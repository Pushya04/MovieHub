"Good Character Study, Lacking in Facts","The movie is enjoyable to watch and gives a good impression of what must go on inside the mind of a pilot after such a spectacular accident. The depiction of the actual ditching (landing in the water) and the conversation between the pilots and controllers is quite accurate, and with CGI, quite believable.However, the depiction of the investigative process, including the behavior of the investigators, is not realistic at all. I have worked as a professional pilot and air accident investigator for most of my life, and the investigation as depicted in this film is pure fiction.In several interviews with the director, Clint Eastwood, he admitted that the movie needed a villain or antagonist, so he chose to depict the investigators and the investigative process as much more hostile than it really is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
He's the Captain now,"Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. On January 15, 2009, Sully made the decision to land the crippled aircraft of US Airways flight 1549 right into a river  an event immediately labeled ""Miracle on the Hudson"".Surprisingly, this is the first film collaboration for Tom Hanks and director Clint Eastwood. Both have cinematic experience with true life stories and real people: Hanks most recently in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies; and Clint with American Sniper and J. Edgar. This one is the perfect fit as Hanks takes on a good man who takes pride in doing his job, and Clint brings to life a story that showcases the best of human nature.Tom Komanicki adapted the screenplay from the book ""Highest Duty"", co-written by Sully and Jeffrey Zaslow. Much of the attention is given to the doubts and uncertainty Sully experienced during the NTSB review. The scrutiny of his work by the committee (played here by the ultra-serious Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan) left his career and reputation dangling, inspiring nightmares that are much worse than yours and mine.Certainly we are in awe of what Sully pulled off that morning, but as movie goers, we are anxious to see the plane crash/splash/landing. Clint comes through in breath-taking fashion. While it lacks the hysterics and drama of the upside-down plane in Flight, this re-creation is so realistic that we nearly obey the flight attendants repeated instructions of ""Heads down. Stay down"". Even the cockpit chatter, passenger evacuation, and first responder's (many of whom are real life folks, not actors) activities are played in matter-of-fact manner  more people just doing their job. We shiver knowing the icy Hudson River water is 36 degrees, and we feel Sully's anxiety as he desperately tries to get a final count  a count that he prays will hit 155.Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles and has a couple of memorable scenes, and Laura Linney embraces the thankless role of telephone wife of Sully during the aftermath and hearings. We get a glimpse of Sully's background with flashbacks to his flight lessons at a Denison Texas private airfield, as well as a portion of his military service. Hanks is the perfect choice for a role that would have suited James Stewart just fine if it were the 1940's.The conflict here comes from the NTSB inquiry. Backed by computer simulators that show the plane could have coasted back to LaGuardia, we get the distinct feeling that the committee's goal is finding human error – naming a scapegoat (other than Canadian geese) for their ""lost"" plane. It's Sully who reminds us that the committee is simply doing their job  just as he was, Skiles was, the Flight Attendants were, and the first responders were.This is technically expert filmmaking. We know the ending, but are glued to the screen. Frequent Eastwood collaborator Tom Stern handles the cinematography, and like the acting and story-telling, the camera work avoids any excess or over-dramatization. The film provides one of the best examples ever of the duality of hero worship and intense scrutiny, and how a person can be a hero by simply doing their job. The closing credits show clips of the flight's reunion and every survivor would agree that the best among us allowed a continuation of life  something that could have gone to the other extreme.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid Movie about a Remarkable Moment,"One of the most remarkable incidents of the 2000s was when U.S. Airways Flight 1549 landed in the Hudson River on January 15, 2009. All of the 155 passengers on the plane survived. This dramatization of the incident, starring Tom Hanks, tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, who pulled off the Miracle on the Hudson, as it's called. Hanks gives a solid performance as Sully, who is conflicted as to whether or not he endangered the lives of all of the people on board. Aside from the incident itself, most of the movie is dedicated to the debate over whether or not the plane could potentially have returned to LaGuardia. The FAA is made out to be a villain of sorts. Some may argue that this is not as interesting as the incident itself, or that it isn't good movie material. It still works as a film, as it is more about Sully himself than anything else. Director Clint Eastwood does a great job at telling the story, by cutting the incident into several scenes and having the rest be about how it affected Sully's life, and that of his family. After the incident, Sully himself had to deal with PTSD, as well as the stress of instantly becoming a celebrity. His wife and daughters also had to deal with a constant bombardment of attention from the press. This is the focal point of the movie. It's about the people, not the incident. In that regard, it is a very good movie, but if you're expecting it to be about the incident itself, go watch any of the documentaries made about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Power of the Human Spirit,"If there's one thing you can count on Clint Eastwood doing well, it's directing an emotionally heartfelt story. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.""The miracle on the Hudson"" is the subject of this Eastwood drama, starring Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, and Laura Linney. There will be plenty of obstacles with any film based on a true story, but with a film based on an event that lasted a mere 208 seconds, it's extra difficult. But Eastwood manages to pull a great story out of these unbelievable events that comes in just under 2 hours. Of course, the flight itself isn't the only hurdle that captain Sully went through, as he dealt with reporters, investigators, and the National Transportation Safety Board determined to diminish his heroic efforts.Who could possibly be better to play Captain Sully than the great Tom Hanks. Having wonderfully played another ""controversial"" captain back in 2013 as Captain Phillips, there was no doubt he could pull off a somewhat similar role. Boy does Hanks deliver. He always effortlessly pulls out the big speeches and powerful dialogue well, but I often find his more subtle acting to be more impressive. It's the moments when Sully is reacting to the big moments with only his facial expressions and body languages that give me goosebumps. Not many actors are able to bring me to the verge of tears just by a facial expression, but Hanks is one of them.Eastwood and his editors also deserve tons of credit for their work here. Much like Hanks' subtle acting, I love when Eastwood holds back the bombastic music (that can sometimes take you out of a story like this) and lets the audience choose how to feel by watching gorgeous cinematography and poignant acting and directing. This may be Eastwood's best directorial work since Million Dollar Baby. He understood exactly the moments to use and not music in order to pull the emotion out of his audience.Most of all, this film is a great display of the power of the human spirit. Everything about this film is grounded with humanity. No one seems fake. So often Hollywood is flooded with over-the-top filmmaking that can easily dilute the power of the film's message. Sully knows exactly what it's going for, and it does it to near perfection.+Eastwood back at the top+Hanks subtle acting+Power of human spirit91/100",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of Eastwood's and the year's best.,"""Everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time."" Sully (Tom Hanks)On January 15, 2009, a decidedly un-cinematic hero, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger of US Airways, landed 155 souls into the Hudson River, safely, as he struggled with a plane crippled by birds in both engines. As we all know, the passengers and crew survived, so what does director Clint Eastwood bring to the big screen that could engage an audience knowing the blessed outcome?First, he brings Tom Hanks, not unknown to portray low-key heroes (see Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips most recently), whose understated courage seems accurately to reflect the Sully we have come to know and see displayed with the credits. Second, Eastwood crafts one of the most believable crash and rescue scenes I have ever encountered.As in the authentic Hanks interpretation of the quiet Sully, the disaster is compelling and understated. No swelling or morbid music takes away from the terror. Because the simulations at the National Transportation Safety Board hearings were necessary to prove fault, the contrast between the NTSB creations and Eastwood's rendition of the real incident is starkly evocative of the film's attempt to get it all right.Even the NTSB's grilling Sully at the hearings, while it unsettlingly tracks his alleged errors in the ""Miracle on the Hudson,"" has a low-profile approach. It confirms Eastwood's and writer Todd Komarnicki's affirmation that everyone in the film is doing his and her job, from pilots, investigators, and rescuers to director and writer.Even Sully's wife, Lorraine (Laura Linney), in the ever-annoying wife-in-waiting-role, is stronger and more balanced than the stock character. Although the passengers are not always first-rate actors, they do seem sincere. However, it is Hanks's film with his stolid, no frills acting, followed by a supportive Aaron Eckhart as his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles.But then, that powerful under-acting is emblematic of the director himself, a lean craftsman who wastes no time in production and has no time for puffery. Although not Unforgiven, Sully is one of Eastwood's best and one of the best films of the year.After seeing this film, you may have a heightened respect even for flight attendants, who evidence a more sincere bravery than summer blockbuster heroes could ever do as that crew directs the passengers: ""Brace. Brace. Brace. Head down, stay down!"" If you see Sully in IMAX, your head will be up in the clouds and your heart too.",,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks is Sully,"It's a cold morning on Jan 15, 2009. Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) survive bird strikes and the lost of both engines to safely land the US Airways Flight 1549 in the middle of the Hudson River. All 155 aboard are rescued. Despite being almost universally herald as a hero, the NTSB investigation starts raising questions and Sully is haunted by the incident.Hanks is Sully. He embodies the easy natural goodness the role entails. The recreation of the incident is compelling. Eastwood should be more careful about doing the incident twice. The second time needs to be sufficiently different from the first. Then there is the clunky NTSB villainy. The flawed computer simulations need to be expanded. Otherwise, it's hard to buy the dangers to Sully. I wonder if a straight docu-style recreation would be more compelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Hero of the Hudson River,"On January 15th 2009, after a bird strike with the loss of two turbines, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) land an Airbus A320 with 155 passengers on the Hudson River saving their lives. Sully is claimed a hero by the press and public; however the official investigation reports that one of the left engines was running at idle and not damaged. And the flight simulator indicates that it would be possible to land at LaGuardia or Teterboro. Sully has to defend himself to the commission; otherwise Sully has to defend his reputation and career showing new evidences of the incident. Will he succeed?""Sully"" is another great film directed by Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks in the lead role. These two names would be enough to show the quality of this movie. But the story is excellent, based on the biography of Sully and the screenplay keeps the attention of the viewer until the credits. In addition, there are Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney in a support role. In the end, ""Sully"" is a great tribute to the hero of the Hudson River.

Eastwood and Hanks are a great combo,"Based on the true story of the 2009 emergency airplane landing in New York's Hudson River: the events following the rescue include a hearing at the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) which claims that the plane might have landed safely at a nearby airport and avoided endangering those on board.""Sully"" was based on the book ""Highest Duty: My Search for What Really Matters"" by Chesley Sullenberger (aka Sully, the flight's captain) and Jeffrey Zaslow.The choice of narrative structure was wisely chosen. Instead of beginning with the main event itself, the film starts with the beginning of the NTSB hearings and later shows the emergency landing in flashback. This sets up an unexpected focus: instead of highlighting heroism, the film concentrates on the problems the event triggered and the inner turmoil of Sully himself.This movie works mainly because it is in the hands of two very able and trusted stalwarts: director Clint Eastwood and lead actor Tom Hanks. The simulation of the emergency landing is as thrilling as expected but there is just as much tension in the NTSB hearings. Here, the viewer is able to see the character behind someone (Sully) who can be extraordinary as he fights back but in a calm way; someone who thinks well and quickly; and also shows humility to acknowledge everyone's participation in the successful rescue rather than letting himself be singled out. Only someone with the depth and experience of Hanks could pull this off so well.The closing credits add a special bonus to this fine film. As it has already been mentioned: during that infamous decade, New Yorkers needed good news like this - especially news involving an airplane. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Terrifically detailed work directed by a living legend, and starring one too!","This is based on a true incident from a few years ago, where a veteran pilot actually was able to land his plane in the Hudson river in NYC and with all on board surviving. It is a terrifically detailed but slow moving work by 86 year old living legend Clint Eastwood starring the Jimmy Stewart/everyman of our era, in two time - should have been three time -Oscar winner Tom Hanks as the quietly unheroic hero pilot. (You were robbed of the statuette in 2000 for ""Cast Away"", Tom. Who else could play opposite a volleyball for two hours and make it work?).I'm reminded of Eastwood's 2003 Academy Award winning ""Mystic River"" in that he deliberately takes his time in adapting the book, as he does here as well. The script is a little odd, shifting back and forth between the events of the day itself and the hearing to decide whether the pilot and co-pilot were at fault for not heading to one of the nearby airports. This leads to a little awkwardness during the first third of the film, but then works out just fine. We see the big event twice - The epic landing of the jet is more than worth seeing in and of itself.Aaron Eckhart, for once, gets to play a good guy, the co-pilot. How nice to see Delphi Harrington, a much underused actress, as the passenger in the wheelchair. She was marvelous as an intelligent, sophisticated woman in the long-gone soap opera Where the Heart Is and was also believable as a trashy Southern murderess on Guiding Light and as a trashy Southern prostitute on All My Children. Here she plays a somewhat stereotypical New York Jewish mother. As a daughter she gets Valerie Mehaffey of Desperate Housewives.Sully shows something rarely seen in movies these days, the simple heroism of ordinary people, like the ferry boat crew members who rescue the passengers from the plane.Be sure to stay for the credits, where you will see a reunion of many of the actual passengers and crew from the flight. And as Columbo would say, just one more thing - The last line of the movie is a hoot and got a big laugh! Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks come with a revered film on real life incident....,"""Sully"" depicts the real life incident involving the ditching of US Airways Airbus A320 on Hudson River saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew which is considered one of the miraculous survivals responding to an efficient crew resource management. Anyone like me with a strong urge for aviation will heartily take this movie important which salutes the professionalism brought to the screen by the flight crew.Clint Eastwood, one of the revered actors and directors of all time, does it again drifting from his usual genre of fictitious stories, to capture the prompt decision the cockpit crew take. The film is based on real statistics and investigation which avoids sentimentality or drama unlike Denzil Washington's ""Flight"" (a good thriller) which fictionalized the real life accident into a heroic survival game receiving Oscar accolades. In that case, the film remains subdued with yet an another revered performance as a controlled captain of Airbus A320 showing the patience, diligence, and dedication of a senior captain equally supported by Aaron Eckhart as the first officer. Don't worry if the film didn't sweep major Oscar nominations, it's a sincere film on a heroic deed worth watching.Rating: 3 stars out of 4",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Clint Eastwood masters doing a lot with the bare minimum.,"What makes Sully exceptional is that Clint Eastwood lets the story tell itself.Specifically real with the water landing itself. Nothing is really taken out of content in the way Hollywood thinks and usually takes it.The event was dramatic enough without anything needed to be added to enhance that.Tom Hanks is a fine actor. Not the greatest performance, but it was cool that Hanks and Eastwood did a movie together.Sully gives us an in depth look at the miracle of the Hudson. Though the title does state that the we focus on Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger who did an amazing water landing on the Hudson in January of 2009, and got his 15 mins because of it, Eastwood shows us that even one man can see things in many different ways, as Eastwood goes through all those angles.I love Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, the co pilot who supported greatly the pilots decision. He was a great supporting actor for Tom Hanks.In the end this movie is about heroes, not just Sully but everyone involved in the US Airways Flight 1549 water landing. From the well trained flight attendances to the rescue police on the water fairy. Its about the 155 passengers and the their accounts of what happen. It's about how sometimes we forget how to treat a hero, but true heroes will always shine though, and Eastwood tells the story as real as possible knowing that he has an incredible story here.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Solid Movie,"It's not very hard to get behind Tom Hanks in just about anything he does. Even still, I was wondering just how they would do this movie. Would it be a life story, an extended telling of the fateful event or something different entirely.""Sully"" was a dramatic retelling of the miraculous water landing accomplished by Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks). It was done very well with just the right touch of drama. It's an American hero movie where the hero this time is not a soldier or a cop but an airline pilot.I enjoyed the movie from a professional standpoint. I'm not a pilot but in my line of work I'm very familiar with investigations of accidents and events and the Monday-Morning-Quarterbacking that goes along with it. It was very interesting to see how procedures and guidelines come into play and how skilled human beings have to implement them in crunch time.""Sully"" was a solid movie throughout.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Hanks is good, but Sully falls flat","I think Clint Eastwood is very talented director and Tom Hanks is easily my favorite actor. He's just good in everything. That being said, I was going to wait to rent this movie because the subject didn't appeal to me very much. Ended up at the theater with a group of friends who wanted to see it, so that's what we saw.Put simply, it was just OK.Tom Hanks is always good (in my opinion) and that was still the case. He did really well and might get awards consideration. I don't think he reached the heights of his performances in Philadelphia, Cast Away, Forrest Gump, or Saving Private Ryan or even another bio-pic, Captain Phillips. He was very good and made the movie watchable. Aaron Eckhart was also pretty good. My problem with the acting is that I don't feel those characters would be very difficult to portray, so although they did a good job, it isn't impressive per se.I am all for creative license, but I think the choice for the antagonists in this film is borderline slander given how actual events panned out. That's all I will say about that.The plot honestly doesn't have much going for it. We already know how the flight ends and thus lose a great deal of dramatic suspense. Eastwood tries to work around this with how he structured the story, but it just felt forced. Three separate times, I believe, we end up in a flashback of the flight in question and it does not add anything to the story. It quickly grows old.I mean, technically, this film is impeccable. The editing, the cinematography, etc. Clint Eastwood knows how to shoot a movie. So I don't want to knock it too hard. I just feel like it is pretty forgettable.6 stars is my standard rating for a movie that is well made, but I just didn't really care about.I do have to say that Aaron Eckhart's mustache is the star of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Somewhat Inaccurate but Captivating,"It's not easy to present recent history in film. The rescue of 155 souls in an airplane who were diverted to the Hudson River is still in our memories (I remember them standing on the wings). Tom Hanks does a cool, underplayed version of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, who will live in the annals of heroism for as long as we talk about heroes. I was wondering how one takes a two minute event and turns it into a bracing film. But they do. By including the events in the investigation of the landing, they are able to keep our attention. Sullenberger's actions came under tight scrutiny because the airline ""lost a plane."" As it turns out, the lead investigator for the NTSB wasn't played quite accurately. Of course, we are in need of a villain, and the geese that flew into the engines wouldn't make good witnesses. I'm used to filmmakers playing a bit fast and loose with events, but let's face it, everyday things don't draw much attention. Hanks is good. The pacing is good. The recreation of the landing is quite apt. A good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

The structure of the film is very clever, the most moving flight process is scattered in the middle of the film, constantly re-enacted fragments to enhance the heat.

"Likable film about an admirable man, but the material was better suited for a documentary...","""On January 15, 2009. More than 1.200 first responders and 7 ferry boats carrying 130 commuters rescued the passengers and crew of flight 1349.The best of New York came together. It took them 24 minutes""Surely an inspiring conclusion, but I admit my immediate reaction was ""who are you kidding?"". I'm not cynically negating the fact that the 155 passengers of the fateful flight were rescued by competent and dedicated New Yorkers, but it's Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger aka Sully who definitely saved them. And that's why he's got the lion-share of praises, that's why he got the film.I worked in an airline company for more than three years, this film is about January 15, 2009 but I mostly remember June 1 of the same year. It was the day I started working and when -in a tragic irony- the Airbus flight from Rio to Paris crashed. My immersion into the flight world coincided with that event and for some metaphysical reason, I read every single article about that crash, which -according to the investigation- was tragic because avoidable. Basically, if it wasn't for the pilot letting the co-pilot in command, for the co-pilot taking the wrong indications, for several ""if"" factors, two hundreds of people wouldn't have perished in one of Airbus' deadliest accidents.But ""Sully"" made me relativize all these computer-generated inquiries that end up pointing a posthumous accusation against the pilots. Indeed, it doesn't take a NTSB expert to know that accidents are the result of equations featuring many parameters among them human factor, there's never one sole cause of accident. This is why planes are still statistically the safest travelling ways, and this is why it doesn't say much about how stressful a flight plane is. This is why, on a personal note, I think my last hour is coming whenever turbulences start. This is why I take my chances with buses, boats and cars. Hell, this is why people still applaud the pilot when he lands.Why should they? Isn't it part of their job? In the short documentary-feature about Sully, he reminds us that pilots have to fly well every time, it's a job that doesn't allow one hazardous move or uncertainty. I worked in the freight business where everything was processed and pre-planned from A to Z, freight isn't living people, but lives are always at stakes during a flight. That's why pilot is an ace job, when you have hundreds of lives depending on you every day, you can't afford a mistake... but as Sully also says this time in the film ""everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time"".Clint Eastwood shows us a man confronted to such situation with only 208 seconds to react. In what should have been a routine flight, birds are sucked into the two engines making both unusable, and the only solution is an emergency landing on the closest runway. The altitude is low, he can't reach an airport without flying over New York City and he's got less than a minute to make up his mind. Of course, there's not much suspense since we know he made the right choice by landing on the Hudson river. But suspense isn't Eastwood's concern, he doesn't care about the 208 seconds but the 24 minutes.Indeed, after his ""Invictus"" and ""American Sniper"" and before the ""15:17 to Paris"" Eastwood seemed to have grown a cinematic fondness on real-life heroes. I guess it's a generational appreciation of men who were capable of taking the right decision at the right time and inspire the best out of the people. Mandela in ""Invictus"" took unpopular decisions that eventually united South-Africans. Chris Kyle might have been blinded by his patriotism but became an inspiration to his companions. Sully is made in the same Eastwoodian vein, he wouldn't call himself a hero, but don't ever tell him he made the wrong decision.The problem with ""Sully"" though is that the film takes a situation of a few minutes and needlessly stretches it for the sake of cinematic viability. In a non-linear narrative, it switches back and forth between moments where he's hailed as a hero and where he's criticized by the NTSBC investigation. Moments where he seems to go through a PTSD phase and moments where he reminisces about his past. The investigation is perhaps the best part of the film and it makes everything else feel as ""fillers"", Laura Linney is not being given the most grateful role of her career as the long-suffering wife and the film could have done without Katie Couric calling Sully a fraud in an imagination sequence. Why would he be a fraud if he never pretended to be a hero?The not-so subtle point of Eastwood is betrayed by that ""best of New York"" disclaimer. The film opens with a nightmarish vision of ""what could have been"" had Sully followed the instructions by the book instead of his precious instinct and it ends with a needlessly graphic recreation of September 11. Maybe the opening and ending elevate Sully as a heroic figure because he could inspire the best of New York like the terrorist attacks did, but by saving lives instead. An Egyptian taxi driver praises him for having restored his faith in humanity in a year that started with the crisis, Madoff and Middle-East wars. It wasn't just the perfect timing but the perfect time.Now, I enjoy a good inspirational film like anyone but I can't say the film captivated me as ""Invictus"" did or elicited a reaction as strong as ""American Sniper"" (even though it was a negative one). The film struck me as a poor man's ""Apollo 13"" or a film Steven Spielberg could have made between two blockbusters. I liked it for its informative value but I enjoyed the real smiling Sully more than Hanks' grim all-serious performance... so maybe the story was better suited for a documentary?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger,"Running at a lean and spry 96min, Clint Eastwood's Sully isn't so much a clinical bio-pic in the traditional sense, but an absorbing showcase of a man's extraordinary professionalism in the face of danger.On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, the world witnessed the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" when Captain Chesley Sullenburger (Tom Hanks) glided his disabled plane onto the frigid waters of the Hudson River, saving the lives of all 155 aboard. However, even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career.Tom Hanks underplays Sullenburger but in so doing he brings out the multi-layered human qualities in the man. This is about a man who has 42 years of flying experience and he knows the aircraft like it is the back of his hand. Here is a man who does his job to the best of his abilities and he does it well. He will tell you he is not a hero but simply a man who is just doing his job. From a man with no time he becomes the man of all time. However, he is shaken to his very core when the doubts start to set in as the NTSB rips apart his heroic maneuver. Is Sullenburger a hero or a fraud?The story rests on Tom Hank's abled shoulders who has built a reputation playing understated and reluctant heroes in Bridge of Spies and Captain Phillips. On first look Hank didn't seem to put on his acting hat, but after a night of rumination his character continues to stay with me. His sullenly insular and taciturn manner displays a fully functioning problem-solver's mind, calculating the probability of survival in that instance when the birds hit the plane engines. Thank goodness he trusts his instincts rather than the computer.Hank isn't the only star in the story. At 86, Eastwood has meticulously crafted an honest story we thought we already knew into a tense drama with little bell and whistle. His unfazed skill in storytelling is assured and Sully definitely belongs to the top tier of his pantheon of good movies that include Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby. In Eastwood's hands, the film flies above the usual biopic tropes and it feels like a homage to a modest man who rose to an extraordinary occasion and a salute to professionalism. It is a wonder the story doesn't carry an ounce of jingoism and it is a superb amalgam of the loud and the silence and the human elements of a near air disaster.The final star is definitely the plane crash. For a home-theatre enthusiast, the visuals and sonics are a feast for the senses. We get to see the crash and its aftermath from every physical and emotional angle. I can't remember the last time I see a reenactment of a plane crash so visceral and real. This is the closest you will get to experience one without actually being in one.I didn't care much for Eastwood's last directorial effort American Sniper because it carried too many skull-numbing and blatant embellishments, but with Sully he has redeemed himself. This may feel like a straight-forward story but the use of Rashomon-resque plot manipulation transcends the film above the usual biopics that you would forget after a night's sleep. I didn't forget this one today.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Miraculous true story, not so miraculous, albeit still very impressive, film","The story of Chelsey ""Sully"" Sullenberger landing a passenger plane in the Hudson River on 15th January 2009 is one that fascinates and inspires, it's a remarkable story and makes one show a lot of respect for a man rightly regarded as a hero.'Sully' may not be a high point of either director Clint Eastwood or star Tom Hanks's careers (both having very highly regarded careers with great films and performances), it didn't blow me away and may have been better as a documentary. It is nonetheless very impressively done and on the most part is still a good film, with a lot of great elements as well as a few not so convincing ones, and its honesty and understatement are to be admired. It takes a remarkable story and mostly does do it justice, though it is not hard to see why not everybody will like it.As well done the understated mood is, occasionally 'Sully' feels a little too muted even for what it's trying to portray. Other than the air, landing and rescue scenes, which are riveting and nail-biting, it does lack tension and some scenes are more compelling than others (the aforementioned air, landing and rescue scenes, Hanks in the bar and Hanks and Eckhart together for instances are more involving than any scene with the NTSB and Sully's wife).Laura Linney does very well as Lorraine and handles the character with dignity and empathy, but the role is thankless and underwritten, on top of that her screen time is pretty limited, Linney deserves better than this. More of a problem was the stock villain portrayal of the NTSB, far too extreme and very heavy-handed. The ending does satisfy for all that roots for Sully at the start, though the outcome was very much foreseeable for anybody familiar with the story and compared to the more sombre understated feel of the rest of the film it felt somewhat pat.Production values however are high. It is beautifully photographed with good use of locations and above average effects. The recreation scenes don't look too cheap either. Eastwood's direction is intelligent and admirably restrained. The music score is not the most unforgettable of ones, but it is still very well suited to the film's tone and wisely doesn't go over the top or feel anaemic.It's a very thoughtfully written film too and treats its audience and subject matter with sensitivity and respect. The subtle dry humour from Eckhart's character is well judged and not misplaced as it could easily have been. The story is not a tense or exciting one, but it's dealt with honesty and deep humanity with some inspiring and powerful moments.Hanks gives a master-class in grace, dignity and subtlety, holding everything together with great composure and telling a lot even with just his eyes. One really believes how much of an emotional toll being hailed as a hero but also being investigated has on Sully. Eckhart is sympathetic and provides some never overdone or too frequent dry humour that leavens things up. Linney does much with little and the rest of the cast do very well.Overall, very impressive if not miraculous. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fabulous screenplay and intense acting and emotional,"I am one of the lucky few who had the opportunity to get an advance premier screening for Sully at AMC IMAX Somerville, Boston ten days prior to the release.This is easily the best movie of 2016. I have been following the Jan 15 controlled ditching incident of US Airways Flight 1549 case for a while. Everything about this case was covered on TV and the hearings are uploaded on YouTube. I have watched nearly 5 hours of the footage on YouTube and I was skeptical before the film whether if it offers us anything new.I was mind-blown; the movie is truly an untold story. The drama, action and intensity is all along. It left me and many audience in tears. It feels realistic in the IMAX edition with great sound effects surrounding you. The screenplay of this film is unique, Client Eastwood is an outstanding director has outdone himself with this gripping tale.Tom hanks has been the heart of the film. The acting was top notch. I am sure his meetings with Chesley SUllenberger must have contributed something in the acting department. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles also did a great job with his subtle humor and great screen presence. He makes you wanting more of the character.Coming back to the facts, Client Eastwood has left what we all know because of the footages shown in YouTube and the hearings.Overall, great performances, superb screenplay, neat editing and fabulous visual and audio effects make this film easily the best in 2016.Above all, this one has a heart!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Because Grandparents Wanna Go To The Movies Too""","Eastwood's directorial efforts are undeniably skillful dramas full of human resilience. Sully is no different, and may be his best in years. For some, that may be great news; for me, that's not saying much. Completely lacking in dramatic subtlety, Sully still somehow feels oddly distant and cold. On the other hand, its non-scifi-action-superhero-franchise thrills and intrigue are definitely a welcome reprieve after a long summer. Like an airline bag of peanuts, Sully's far from a delicious meal, yet it certainly helps pass the time. It's the harrowing true-story of a commercial-pilot-turned-national-hero successfully landing a plane on the Hudson River, saving everyone on board and potentially hundreds of NYC citizens. It's a stoic movie about a stoic man who is thrust into excitement. Playing the titular ""Stoic""uh, I mean ""Sully""is Hanks, who has taken a step-down in intensity, complexity and effectiveness from his other real-life-hero-on-the-water role in Captain Phillips. Instead of studying the psychology of an every-man experiencing sudden stardom through immense trauma, it hits fairly predictable biopic beats with on-the-nose and corny dialogue and performances. Luckily, the centerpiece plane crash and subsequent rescue is pretty fantastic. The great mixture of high thrills and drama told with grounded realism gives it a surprisingly honest and non-glorified portrayal. It's no accident this was released on 9/11, as that horrendous day played such an integral part in what made Sully such a beloved figure. People in NY buildings watching a plane fly low through their city, followed by the familiar humanity in the rescue boats, it's hard not to be moved. Those beautiful moments propel an otherwise bland movie that your grandparents will surely love.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
OK Movie about an Extraordinary event.,"For 208 seconds, Sully is saving the lives of all 155 souls aboard Us Airway Flight 1549 when he undertakes an emergency water landing in the Hudson River in January of 2009. He emerges a hero at a time when the U.S economy was in the crapper due largely to the actions of many greedy short-sighted men making horrible decisions with your money, and heroes were at a premium.The question is: how does this translate to a feature length movie? This can't stretch out two hours. You need drama, you need conflict, so how is this done?The conflict at the heart of the movie is one that pits humanity versus the computer. Or human error versus those that second guess. Or those that do are criticized by those who don't. For according to computer simulations, done in non-life or death situations, Sully could have managed to land the plane on a runway, at an airport, and not have it become a total loss in the Hudson River. And it is because of this that the authorities investigating the crash (just doing their jobs) try to sully the heroic act of Sully (sorry, bad pun.).We know how it ends, we know where it's going, and for what it's worth, Captain Chesley Sullenberger is without a doubt a hero of the highest degree. The inspiration that his cool-headedness under enormous pressure provided Americans is incalculable. I just wish the film had been able to communicate that a little better. I wanted there to be a resounding victory, a moment where you could cheer for the good guys. Unfortunately, the closest we came to this was the moment where Sully (played well by Tom Hanks, not my favorite actor but what can you do?) after proving his point about human speed and reaction time, says ""DO you need any more tests?""I miss the days when Tom Hanks was not such a serious actor. But the fact that he plays the part without the audience overly thinking about the fact that this is TOM HANKS is a tribute to his talent. Eckhart does a great job as his co-pilot and Laura Linney is always great, though it would be better if she had more to do than talk to Sully on the phone.Overall, in terms of airplane related movies, I'd put ""Sully"" somewhere near ""Flight"" but not as good as ""Flight 93."" Or even ""Airplane!"" But it's still good.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
NTSB bashing not useful,"The 5 is for Tom Hanks' acting. He plays the cool airline captain very well, as we all expected.But the NTSB would never hire such an asshole as the guy who plays the chief investigator, and they would never get the report on the left engine while sitting in a final public meeting. Also, never would the NTSB accept simulator tests where the operators were allowed several attempts. They are well aware of the stress factor and don't have to be lectured by some film producer. The film makes them look like they had done their first accident investigation.Once again, Hollywood has created prejudice among lay people for the sake of ""good entertainment"".

Sully -- a slightly ESOTERIC review,"First, the film itself:* technically perfect. What Clint Eastwood shares with Ron Howard is that they are both actors-turned-directors who consistently make technically perfect films. (Howard, on the other hand, was never voted ""sexiest man alive"" in his acting career. Just a trivia point...)* what they also share is a penchant for taking larger-than-life people and literally making them much-larger-than-life on the big screen. After this, you will feel like you have known Sully as long as his family.* in the presence of such directorial talent, it is easy to overlook the casting choices. In this case, I suggest that Hanks may not get the credit he is due. This may be the best performance of his career. He sets a deer-in-the-headlights tone early; and by mid-movie, the viewer starts to feel as paranoid as his character. Amazing performance.* recommended for multiple reasons, not the least of which is that it is one of the best films of the year.And now the esoteric part of the review:* have a friend, a university professor, who once explained to me, at some length, that the #1 most ""unnatural"" event in life is an MRI scan. You are placed immobile in a life-size cassette and then inserted into an appliance that bombards you with EM waves while deafening you with noise unlike you have ever heard before. Like a baby, you are completely dependent on outside help, and, if the machine failed, it is far from certain you could escape on your own. Yet this is a part of our culture, and the common wisdom is we should be grateful the tech exists in the first place.* the second most un-natural event in our culture? Air travel, he said. (You can do the comparisons on your own.)* the kicker is that my friend ended his dissertation by mentioning there are ""standing"" MRIs which do the same job and are more comfortable but expensive, so many hospitals and clinics avoid them. We are, after all, a society that is all about money.* watching the people leave the plane in the film I remembered my friend's strong views. A century ago, air travel was a very different experience. If you think about it, as is the case with the MRI, it is really all about the money.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Structural issues abound.,"Clint Eastwood is back with yet another true story film. Unlike his last based on a true story flick, 'American Sniper', 'Sully' actually works pretty well. And it makes for a surprisingly gripping story at that. If you're unaware, the story is about an airline pilot. The same one that landed an airbus in the Hudson river in 2009. Naturally, this is his story. But it's told slightly differently than you'd expect. 60% of the film actually takes place after the incident and the other 40 is told through flashbacks that are triggered in some way. This was the aspect of the film that really suffered the most. There are so many flashbacks in this movie.There are so many that this otherwise engaging story starts to feel disjointed. There are one or two that feel genuine and work fairly well, but the majority are just crammed in where ever they could fit them. It felt a lot like 'Suicide Squad' in that, these flashbacks didn't really serve much purpose. They almost felt like they had too much footage and decided to just stick it in somewhere.The worst offender happens about twenty minutes in. The film opens after the water landing, of which we don't see. We see that Sully is being put on trial for endangering the lives of his passengers and crew. This plays out for about twenty minutes and is shockingly gripping I might add, and then it suddenly flashes to directly before the flight occurs. But it doesn't just end there. No, we sit for about twenty more minutes as we watch the entire accident occur.This scene, and many other flashbacks like it, come out of nowhere and overstay their welcome. This one, in particular, does nothing for the film other than blatantly show you exactly what happened. And that isn't really a bad thing, but when the first twenty minutes of your movie is board meetings, it feels out place to jump to this plane scene. We all know the story, and the film does a great job of showing it subtly.Yet, for some reason it stills shows the full event to you. It doesn't help push the story forward, nor does it build character. And, to make things worse, this very scene is shown again later in the film. With this second time actually feeling like it belonged there. When you tell a story like this through flashbacks, they have to drive things forward. A good example of this is 'Incendies'.But 'Sully' just pushes in random footage that rarely helps the film in any way. This effects the pacing drastically. Watching these engaging trail sequences to only flip to a flashback makes this movie more of a lame roller coaster ride. Where you'll be exhilarated sometimes and just bored the rest of the time. It doesn't help that the shooting style is rather bland. The visual style of the film is very mute and stationary. Which can work, but here it just looks boring.By now you are probably thinking that I hated this movie, but I didn't. In fact, I thought it was decent. This mainly has to do with the non-flashbacks aspects of this movie. When the film plays out uninterrupted it works very well. It's very restrained and subtle actually. The scenes that take place after the crash all felt like they served a purpose. Each one helped flesh out our main character or forward the plot with interesting new information that caused conflict.Conflict that actually felt like it had weight to it. Each new piece of info that Sully receives is almost always something bad. And each time you can see him sink a little more into himself. And watching this kind of hurts. You know that he's a genuine guy and saved hundreds of lives, but there's always consequences. So when you throw consequences in a film like this they actually carry weight.You don't want to see him put on trial because he just saved hundreds of people. But that's what happens, and it works very well. Of course, this couldn't have been accomplished without Tom Hanks. Who is typically great. The entire cast is actually pretty great. They all take on their character in interesting ways even if their character translates to nothing more than a line on a paper.However, 'Sully' is ultimately a frustrating watch. That mainly has to do with the fact that this could have been great and just wasn't. There's an excellent movie in there and it's ruined by jumbled storytelling. Excessive flashbacks grind the film to a halt nearly every time they surface and never really help the film move along. This along with a boring look and bizarrely abrupt scene changes really hurt an overall good movie. The cast, crew and investigation aspects of the film are definitely its saving graces. Without them, we'd be left with another True Story flick to throw by the wayside.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Why? A run of the mill, predictable, done before bore-fest, but not bad.","Who cares? That's the question I asked about halfway through Sully.First off, it's as predictable a story there is. It only occurred a few years ago and in the first ten minutes, it's confirmed the story is going exactly where you thought: there's no surprises. For entertainment's sake, Eastwood effectively has to throw in a dream sequence where the plane crashes into a building before Hanks wakes up.Plane crash movies have also been overdone. Wasn't Flight just a few years ago? It was much more compelling and more unpredictable. But then there's just been so many flight films. The one with Liam Neeson, the Grey where the plane crashes, and too many more to name. The thing about them though is at least they were about more than a predictable plane landing.Hanks is, well, Hanks. He's not Sully, and is far removed from his Oscar caliber wins for Forrest Gump and Philadelphia. Wow, look at him jog in those scenes! He's decent, but no way should he beat out Andrew Garfield for Hacksaw Ridge.Speaking of Hacksaw Ridge, another biopic true story this year, it actually has something to say and a reason behind it. There's no way Sully should win a nomination over it in any competing category (voters take note).It's not a bad film, but is incredibly ""run on the mill"", and like I thought before watching it, I still don't know why this was made into a big movie. It would've worked fine on Lifetime.The final half hour exits the clichés and saves it.5.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
What Do You Expect From Clint Eastwood?,"I've always been a fan of Clint Eastwood and he didn't disappoint at all. When this first happened, I figured there'd be a movie about him and never thought about Tom Hanks, and now see that he was an excellent choice. Even though we know the outcome, this movie was awesome! There were some teary moments and the special effects were so realistic. It kinda shed a bad light on the attitude of the NTSB and I'm hoping that wasn't the case, maybe the movie just needed some controversy. I remember seeing someone from the NTSB being interviewed who claimed they were depicted in a bad light but who knows. There was a humorous side, and I don't want to spoil it, but keep you eye on the black guy who is sitting on the board of the NTSB.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Light on story, plot and characters","Fairly light on story, plot and characters, not surprisingly it's a fairly short film, unusual for Eastwood.Long sequences of Hanks running through New York streets help pad out the minutes, throw in a few flash backs here and there and you can stretch out a 4 minute event into a whole film.However that said, it's an enjoyable and easy watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
The real event more interesting than the movie,"The problem with the movie ""Sully"" is that it's about 208 seconds of action, and we all know in advance that he successfully landed the plane with no loss of life. The movie starts off by telling the audience that. So the only 'tension' in the movie is whether Capt. Sully is going to go from hero to villain if it's decided by the accident investigators that his decision to go for the Hudson rather than one of the nearby airports was the safer decision or not.Unfortunately, because the movie is based on Sully's own version of events, it looks at the everything from his point of view alone. If there was some background provided for some of the passengers, the audience might be a little more invested in the survival of everyone onboard.The movie's just over 90 minutes long, basically because there wasn't enough to pad it out any further. It's well acted, but that's the only thing going for it. The real event was much more thrilling.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great movie making still exists.,"Eastwood and Hanks team up to tell a story true to life and without over dramatization in a convincing fashion while building on the foundation of real world heroism. The theme even projects throughout the movie as characters consistently remark on the rarity of ""good news"" stories that have real heroic action involved in this day. Hanks brilliant ability at portraying self reflection as he has so often pulled off in titles like Apollo 13 and Saving Private Ryan is well presented here.The fact the movie may contain a number of continuity errors, for example Captain Sullenbergers dry pants moments after being waste deep in water are superfluous to the gorgeous story unfolding of a self doubting hero who after all is said and done wants to simply be known for ""doing my job"".Regardless of the motivations of the FAA and Corporate Airline entities involved and how they are portrayed we can all relate to a thematic relevance of an individual under mental siege, being questioned and ultimately pushed with intentions toward making the individual the patsy for the systemic failure of a large organization. The understanding that even the best of pilots cannot see birds from a great distance and in time to react or maneuver a large cumbersome airliner on a dime is well displayed and enacted by Eastwood and Hanks.The final analysis being that veteran experience in decision making saved the lives of 252 individuals and prevented what would have most certainly been one of the worst catastrophes in aviation history.Everyone should watch this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Class act all round,"Most folks will have forgotten about this real life event by the time they see this movie.

That's what we discover.Superb writing and script and excellent direction from Clint Eastwood as you'd expect. Tom Hanks is sublime as always. Aaron Eckhart plays a bit of a second fiddle role but is superbly supportive. One of the underlying aspects of the movie is the matter-of-factness with which the characters portray their roles and go about their business - much as you'd expect an airline pilot to do.The slightly unsettling investigation shows big business looking for a scapegoat - no surprise there, then...!There are a few interesting quotes such as ""It's a long time since New York had news this good - especially with an airplane in it.""

"No, not ""Monsters Inc 3""","Chesley Sullenberger was just a very experienced US Airways pilot starting an everyday job flying from LaGuardia airport in New York to Charlotte when fate stepped in. Following an extensive bird strike and the loss of both engines, 'Sully' achieved worldwide fame by landing his aircraft and all 151 passengers and crew safely on the Hudson river. Sully is immediately acclaimed by the public as a hero; US Airways, and their insurers, however, are not necessarily as impressed given that their plane has got rather soggy when the flight data suggests it might have actually been able to make it to a landing at a number of nearby airports. So a National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) inquiry is called, where a decision against Sully could see him facing the fastest fall from grace since Icarus.This film is obviously based on this real-life 'Miracle on the Hudson' and to a large extent the recreation of the crash. sorry ""forced water landing"" is both vivid and gripping. The film is certainly unlikely to make the regular list of in-flight movies for nervous passengers, but it does serve as a good training film for all of those regular airline passengers who don't ""put down their reading materials"" to listen to the aircraft safety announcement.Director Clint Eastwood has delivered a highly watchable action sequence showcasing the undisputed acting talents of Tom Hanks (playing Sully) and his Aaron Eckhard (""Olympus Has Fallen"", playing the co-pilot Jeff Skiles). This makes for a great 45 minute film. The problem is the other 51 minutes.Where the film works well – aside from the actual recreation itself – is in representing the post-traumatic stress experienced by Sully, with his insomnia and regular flashbacks of 'what might have happened' (anyone still strongly affected by 9/11 will struggle with these scenes). The final NTSB hearing scenes are also well-done and suitably gripping: particularly for viewers outside of the UK where we wouldn't have heard the outcome of the affair once the news cycle had moved on from the 'gee- whizz' headline event.Where the film aquaplanes somewhat is in the padding achieved through multiple (MULTIPLE!) scenes of New Yorkers back-slapping Sully. Some of this is needed to establish the pedestal that Sully is set upon: the bar scene, for example, is well done. But all the rest of the references become just plain tiresome.There is also a back-story focused on Sully's financial problems and rather scratchy marriage (as portrayed) to Lorraine (Laura Linney). Linney is normally a highly-watchable actress, but here her character is just so irritating that the mood of the film plummets every time she reappears on screen.The key problem that screenwriter Todd Komarnicki (""Elf""!!) had here is the obvious one: that as a real-event (based on Sullenberger's own book ""Highest Duty"") he would have had more scope to build tension if the flight had lasted more than 208 seconds! We end up with little visibility into the back-stories of the passengers. We get to see a father and two grown-up sons who – as fate would have it – just manage to catch the doomed plane: and we end up caring what happens to them. But this approach could have perhaps been usefully extended to feature more of the passenger back-stories (without getting the full ""Airport"" soap treatment).Clint Eastwood is also clearly an All-American patriot, and in common with some of his other films he can't help himself from putting up rather soupy statements about the self-sacrifice of New Yorkers (""the best of New York came together""): when actually the rescue teams did what they were paid to do and Ferry captains did what you or I would do if we stumbled on the scene! These sentiments might go down well in the States: in the cynical UK they tend to generate snorts of irritation.What IS nice are a couple of scenes during the closing credits where the real Sully, Skiles, cabin-crew and passengers appear together in a celebration of continued life against all the odds. And just so you are aware, this is done as two separate segments during the titles, so if you don't want to be one of those people standing in the aisles with your coat half on, then wait for the second one!A curate's egg of a film: great in places, but overall not as well executed as it could have been.(Please visit bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review and to comment.

A Masterclass in how to make a movie,"Sully is not a typical bio pic, and sets a new gold standard for how to make a movie that is thoughtful, touching, and overall about the nature of what it means to be a hero. I actually think this is one of Eastwood's best directed movies, along side Million Dollar Baby and Mystic River in the 21st century phase of his career.There are interesting influences that have been seeping in from a couple of Asian directors: Zhang's Hero which approaches this same topic albeit in a different century and with more extravagant visuals, Ozu for the long, patient camera takes as well as Kurosawa for the Rashomon type story that takes place. ""paintent"" is the key word here, as many of the films detractors have said the movie is ""slow"". Notice how each flashback tells more, and more of the story, much like how Rashomon tells the story from different perspectives. Flashback are used as suspense devices, and Eastwood really crafts the picture in way that even though you think your are watching the same scene (birds!) new information is revealed every time which makes it entertaining. And entertaining is not a bad word.For a movie touted as a big studio movie about a real life character, and unlike J. Edgar which I would say is about a ""B"" quality movie though well done biopic, I feel like Sully deserves an the highest rating possible because of the multiple nuances used, and like you said Hanks performance as he disappears into a role unlike any other he has ever had (compared to Captain Phillips, which to me was just Hanks doing Hanks). Hanks deserves an Oscar nomination at least, and a win at best. Eastwood makes movies about JUSTICE as a key theme, where 'what is right is right' and boy does he get his opinions on that across in this film (which also ties it to previous masterpieces he has done like Unforgiven, Grand Torino, and High Plains Drifter).When you know how a movie will turn out it is a challenge to make it entertaining and new to the audience, and Eastwood found a way to do that with several devices and ideas (the court hearings, Sully's jogs and visits to bars around town, his nightmares which echo the 9/11 attacks). Seeing this film on 9/11 (which was an accident really) had a profound effect one as a well. It left me with just enough tears after it is over. Sully is a movie I would recommend for everyone to see at some point in their lives, as it is one of the best movies ever made on the topic of a true life hero, who always includes others in his thoughts and refuses to take credit for his heroic acts (another Jimmy Stewart-Mr. Smith goes to Washington parallel for Hanks).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"This isn't a documentary, the NTSB weren't attack dogs as portrayed.","Clint Eastwood, his political views aside, might be wise to stick with comedy, like Space Cowboys (since he's too old to play Dirty Harry anymore), and leave the directing to better people. Are there any left in Hollywood?I realize that this movie was not meant to be a documentary, which is a genre that I often enjoy, and I also realize that Hollywood has to do what is best for their revenue, which often means sensationalizing ""true stories"", (Like the movie Race the Sun, about a good friend of mine, but almost totally fictitious) but we're talking about the Miracle on the Hudson here, it's sensational as it is. Granted, the intensity only lasted for 208 seconds (plus another minute or two to get out of the plane), but there is sooo much of the story that this movie could have told, but didn't, like the rescue, background of those involved, etc.All the confusing bouncing back and forth in the timeline, all of the distortion of the events, were beneath Tom Hanks acting abilities. And the portrayal of the NTSB was pure fiction. So much so, that they spoke out as soon as they heard about the movie. Search: bloomberg crash investigators pan their portrayalI still give the movie 4 stars, because Tom Hanks played his roll well (and the other actors tried, especially Aaron Eckhart), although Tom's heart didn't seem to be in this one. And if you don't care about accuracy, it was an OK movie. It's worth seeing once, I guess, with a grain of salt (or a mine), but unlike many movies in the same ""True Story"" genre, I doubt I'll watch this one more than once.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Sully"" does its best","In ""Sully"" the white haired and mustached Tom Hanks as Sully wearily tells his wife played by Laura Linney on the phone, ""... I did the best I could."" His wife knows he did. We do as well. On January 15, 2009 Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed the crippled US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew. Director Clint Eastwood tells the hero's story in ""Sully"", one of his best movies. Eastwood's direction and Tom Hanks as Sully are stark and powerful in understatement. They honor all the heroes of the US Airways Flight. ""Sully"" is lean, clean, and inspiring—much like Eastwood. The conflict in ""Sully"" centers upon the investigation of whether Sully made the right choice. Hanks's authenticity and humility evoke Sully's strength and compassion. He reminds us that Sully did his best, and he got it right. ""Sully"" is one of the best movies of the year.""Sully"" follows the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation into the airplane landing on the Hudson River. Todd Komarnicki's screenplay based on the book by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow seamlessly intertwines flashbacks from the water landing, and the NTSB proceedings. Eastwood effortlessly orchestrates the narrative of the startling images of the landing and the irony of the investigation. The visual effects of the plane landing on the Hudson are spectacular. Cinematographer Tom Stern captures the impact on a very personal scale. Water flooding the cabin. Sully and crew racing into action getting the passengers to safety. We see the fear in everyone's face, and the courage to get through.We are in awe. Eastwood and Komarnicki graciously acknowledge the community of heroes: from the ferry boat crew at the scene, the Coast Guard divers, to all the first responders and the police. And it starts with Sully. He has his anchors of support. Aaron Eckhart is loyal and solid as First Officer Jeff Skiles. He was his invaluable right hand during the unthinkable, and during the investigation.Just minutes into the flight, birds collide with the plane's engines. Sully notices that they lost thrust in both engines, forcing them to choose an emergency landing. Eckhart is smart and subtle in his unwavering support of Hank's Sully through it all. Laura Linney amazes as Sully's wife Lorraine, his emotional rock. Sully has his doubts, and she is always there for him. Linney is relegated by the story to phone conversations with Sully. She beautifully accentuates that what Sully does sources from their profound relationship. That also goes for Eckhart. They all see the best in each other.At the story arc Hanks as Sully graciously acknowledges all the heroes involved. We are also present to that he is catalyst for heroes emerging. Everyone involved was grateful to Sully. Eastwood is succinct in the irony of it all. Sully did his best, and saved 155 people. The NTSB scrutinized whether there were other viable alternatives. What Sully did worked in an unprecedented crisis. Period.The music in ""Sully"" both eloquently highlights and undercuts the range of emotions. Christian Jacob and the Tierney Sutton Band composed the score from Clint Eastwood's musical theme. The music's clarity and simplicity embody the movie's quiet heroism.""Sully"" is beautiful simplicity and power. Eastwood and Hanks celebrate people selflessly doing their best to make a difference. One of the measures of a hero is that he or she acknowledges and inspires other heroes. ""Sully"" does all that and more. It is one of the best movies of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Fascinating aviation history ""story behind the story""","This is an extraordinary aviation history movie where the outcome is a mystery even while the viewers understand the emotional impact of the Flight 1549 ""Miracle on the Hudson"". Again, Tom Hanks gives as exceptional a performance as the expert aviator Captain Chesley Sullenberger as he did when he portrayed the hero in ""Captain Phillips"". A wonderful supporting role performance, perhaps co-star is a better description, was given by Aaron Eckhart as Sully's co-pilot Jeff Skiles. Excellent heroics in ""Sully"" were directed by Clint Eastwood and it is probably his best movie; Oscar nominations all around will be well deserved. This is a timeless movie to be enjoyed for generations because the characters are real people who are bonded by a heroic man, husband, father, positive role model and dedicated aviator. Highly recommended as a movie worth an encore viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Watch it once, to know the story at least","'I have been flying for over four decades and I am being judged for the last 208 seconds' - It's a line (well not exactly, but something to that effect, IMDb doesn't have the quotes section up yet) from the movie and it pretty much sums up Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's 'miracle' landing of US Airways flight 1549 on the Hudson on 15 January 2009.Plot and ScriptSully, played by Tom Hanks makes a human decision relying on his vast experience and lands a plane of 155 people on the Hudson, making it the first flights to survive a water landing with all lives intact. The movie is about viewpoints - of the pilots (Aaron Eckhart plays the co- pilot), of the passengers, and of the investigating officers of the safety board. It shows what happened during the flight, after it landed and the investigation where the pilots were scrutinized for their decision as the simulations said that they could have gone back to LaGuardia and landed.Considering it is a true incident and everybody survived, this film is dead serious and comes straight to the point. Simulations can predict scenarios to a certain extent but they don't and cant predict how humans will react in a certain situation. How can one judge a person in a few seconds when they have a lifetime of experience with no incidents? That's the question the film tries to ask.Characterization and Acting (C&A)I have a soft corner for Tom Hanks - he just picks the right movies maybe, or he is just plain lucky, but he is great in every movie. This was no exception. I hadn't read much about the actual incident, and I am reading about it now and watching a few videos of the real Sully - Tom Hanks is so much like him. Calm, composed - he did what he does best, play a role and bring it to life. It was mainly his movie.As for Aaron Eckhart, this is the second time I have liked him in a movie (first was Batman of course with him as Dent) - he plays the part well. There are other talented actors as well like Laura Linney but like I said, it was completely a Tom Hanks movie.Sounds and Effects (S&E)The movie has a serious tone to it and rightly so. Not much music but the sounds are great. There is a scene where the flight is just about to hit water and you can hear the air hostesses saying in unison 'Heads down, stay down' and its just so real that you almost do it.Cinematography and Visuals (C&V)I really liked the look of the movie. It is difficult to do a flight movie I think because most of the time it does look unreal, but I think Sully looked quite real. Even the water landing looked like it was how it would have happened.Direction and Overall (D &O)You gotta give it to Clint Eastwood - he is all of 86 and still giving us great movies, hats off to him. His movies are about people and this was too. But at 96 minutes (one of his shortest movies), it still felt extremely stretched. And it was pretty uni-dimensional - it was Sully's story, the audience is not given any other vantage point.Having said that, the 204 seconds that Sully took to land the plane with no deaths is probably the best 96 minutes we have on screen.I wonder why they took so long to make the movie?So here are my scores according to my new system:Plot and Script (P&S)- 1.5Characterization and Acting (C&A) – 1.5Sounds and Effects (S&E) – 1.5Cinematography and Visuals (C&V) – 1.5Direction and Overall (D &O) – 1.5Overall Score – 7.5 out of 10Watch it once to know about the 'Miracle on the Hudson' and one of the greatest stories in aviation history.

Magnificent,"I have always maintained that Clint Eastwood may be the last of the great 'classical' directors still working in Hollywood, despite the fact that he has only been making films since the 1970's. Like Hawks and Wyler and, to a large extent his mentor Don Siegel before him, there is nothing ostentatious or showy about his films, preferring instead to rely on narrative and casting. His films are usually about strong, almost silent, men who prove themselves capable of almost superhuman displays of strength, if not in any literal sense, certainly of character. In the past he often took on that role himself but he's 86 now and is unlikely to appear in front of the camera again anytime soon.In ""Sully"" the central character is played by that most unassuming of actors Tom Hanks in what may be a career-best performance. He is, of course, Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River on 15th January, 2009 with no loss of life. Hailed instantly as a hero by the world at large, Sully had still to clear his name with the aviation authority who initially claimed he could have safely returned the plane to La Guardia; Sully argued otherwise.For a film where the outcome is already known it remains both incredibly exciting as well as deeply moving, testament to both Eastwood's direction and Hank's acting. He is the lynch-pin of a first-rate ensemble that includes Aaron Eckhart at his very best as his co-pilot and Laura Linney as Sully's wife. She literally phones in her performance, appearing on the phone in everyone of her scenes. She's still superb, proving yet again just how good an actress she is. When, I kept asking myself, is someone going to write a great role for Linney the way they do with a certain Miss Streep. As for the real Sully, I can't think of a more fitting tribute to the man than this. Eastwood's magnificent direction and Hank's magnificent performance do him proud.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Clint Eastwood delivers a mediocre film,"Clint Eastwood's ""Sully "", a film about Chesley Sullenberger's legal and personal battles after the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", is a film that satisfies the audience by utilising strong performances and converting an intriguing story onto the silver screen. But the film ultimately falls short of great, and it finishes leaving a mediocre taste in the viewer's mouth.One of the strengths in ""Sully"" is its humanistic values and traits that are portrayed within the character of Chesley Sullenberger. ""Sully"" successfully attempts to paint the picture of Chesley as a hero, who acted in the best interests of humanity, rather than the interests of money(being the plane). A combination of his heroic morale and human flaws combine an interesting and deep character, and furthermore allows the audience to connect to the story. But that's as far as Eastwood allows the audience to connect.While the performances are strong and the message is dominant, the film fails largely to take any risks, with either the depiction of the story, or the story itself. The cinematography, lighting and composition is largely dull to look at, besides the few scenes where Sully is having nightmares. The visual aspect of the film lacks heavily, and the whole visual side of the film feels like it's just there to support the dialogue, which, at moments, feels lazy and cliché. The story at times feels insufficient to be made into a film, which doesn't give true justice to the story itself.The depiction of Chesley Sullenberger, however, give justice to the man, and provides the backbone to the films quality.""Sully"" is definitely worth a watch, but having high expectations of the film will leave you flat. If you liked any of Eastwood's recent work, such as ""Invictus"" or ""American Sniper"", then this film should appeal to you.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wafer thin material but well handled,"Finally had a chance to catch this and it wasn't quite as bad as i expected but found it quite interesting watching how they had padded out the story to fill the time.Sully goes for a jog, Sully calls his wife, Sully drinks some watered down vodka, Sully lands his F-4, Sully goes for another jog then calls his wife again.While the flight reenactments were well done the NTSB hearings particularly the ""showdown"" toward the end was rather comical. As anyone who's read a NTSB report would tell you one of their big things is analyzing the human performance of the crew as a team during the event which made the Airbus reenactments especially laughable as would the need for the crew to have to point out the human factor to investigators in the first place.One thing i would give them though was the examination of the likely results if he had gone for one of the airports rather than ditching. OK given the skinny material on offer but the invented conflict was just silly.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"It ""sticks the landing""","Here is a movie that got very good reviews, did very well at the box office & after a half hour into it isn't really flying. It is a ""Clint Eastwood movie"" starring Tom Hanks so you give it the benefit of doubt.Then this movie finds its thrust. It gets better & better as it goes along before it really sticks its landing (to borrow a term from gymnastics).The ever reliable Tom Hanks --my generation's ""Jimmy Stewart""-- turns in another fine performance as the unflappable Capt. Chesley Sullenberger who, of course, landed a United Airways flight on the Hudson River with all 155 souls surviving while 9/11 was still fresh on our collective minds. Yeah, it winds up being a ""feel good movie"" that unexpectedly begins as a ""feel bad movie"".This movie brings back some some very good memories while exploring some under-reported angles. The script becomes very crisp & witty while spreading credit to to ""Sully's"" co-pilot Jeff Skiles (nicely played by Aaron Eckhardt), crew & first responders. There is also a cool role played by the air traffic controller who thought he lost the flight.There is a surprising lot of stuff going on in this under 2 hour movie. The ever efficient Eastwood directs it with his usual assured economy & rarely overplays his hand emotionally & cinematically. Laura Linney must also be applauded for her touching ""phone scenes"" (those could not have been easy for an actor).This is one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

During the recent Olympics, every day was a wonderful spectacle watching all the events on TV. Then when they were over, back to the reality of the planet, with tragedy forced down are throats on the news. But watching Sully restored my faith in the average guy doing his job and doing it well. Excellent acting and visually you really feel you are in the cockpit. I had no idea that there had been an inquiry with an attempt to discredit the pilot. Pretty shameful, but the crew stuck together and you can feel and visualize the powerful effects of excellent team work. Sully always credited his team.

The fact that this movie kept me interested for so long, just about a story of a guy who landed a plane on a river, is magnificent. It's one of my favorite movies, and I rewatch it.

"You know the story, but the experience is something else.","From what I'd seen of the trailer I was expecting something similar to Robert Zemeckis's Flight. I can gladly report that Sully was a totally different cinematic experience.An inspiring piece of work which is all the more impressive being a true story. This film did not disappoint. I think it's sometimes easy to watch the news, extract the critical facts of an event and assume that we know it all. Having sat through this film however I have a greater insight into how things really went down that day.I now have so much more respect for Cpt Sully and the crew of that flight. It really was nothing short of a miracle that things turned out the way they did. I would highly recommend this film especially for aviation employees and enthusiasts!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
There's a lot of talking and hardly any piloting.,"Technically this movie is fine, nothing to complain about. But I really didn't like how the story was told. I think I would have enjoyed this movie more if it was cut chronologically. The first opening scene already made me dislike this movie straight away. Then it took 25 minutes before the movie actually started.It's more about the air crash investigation than the actual crash. There's never a moment of suspense, never a moment when you feel that people's lives are at stake.It's not what I expected at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Based on real events, the film does full justice to what happened, despite not being a particularly memorable film for any of those involved.","On January 15, 2009, the American people (and the entire world) saw with amazement and great joy the way in which a commercial airliner, after hitting a flock of birds and losing its two engines, managed to cheat death and land safely in the waters of the Hudson River in New York. The pilot, Chelsey Sullenberger, was widely credited for the aerial feat, having managed to save everyone on the plane and limit the incident to material damage. In fact, the veteran pilot largely ignored the instructions from the Tower, trusted his instincts and experience, and made the right decision.No wonder, then, that it all ended up on film. Clint Eastwood has done better and more notable works in his directing career, but he's in good shape here, and the film fully honors what happened that day. However, the film lacks tension and drama, and most of the action takes place after the accident, throughout the long investigation in which the authorities tried to verify what happened, and to what extent could they blame the pilots of that plane.Tom Hanks is one of those actors that we can call a ""safe bet"". Whatever film he decides to make, it's almost guaranteed that the actor will put in his best effort and do his job to the best of his ability. And this film was no exception, with a good performance, in which Hanks managed to capture very well the voice, gestures and mannerisms of the real person he imitated, and who he knew to be able to do so. Aaron Eckhart also rose to the challenge, giving his character a touch of unpretentious humor that suits him well, as well as giving Hanks a very welcome backing. Unfortunately, on the part of the cast, there is nothing else good to point out. Laura Linney did everything she could with her character, but she doesn't have any material or relevance to help her. The evaluators who analyze what happened, however, are the film's most ungrateful and poorly written characters because, for increased dramatic effects, they are virtually demonized.Technically, the film is pretty decent. There are glaring flaws of anachronism in between, that the most attentive eye can easily find, such as the deciduous trees that are green despite the fact that the film takes place in the middle of winter, and also there is not a single person on that crashed plane that we can see the breath of (something common on colder days, when we see our breath as a vapor). The plane scenes were very well done and the CGI used was really good. The cinematography is good, the film makes good use of the scenic beauty of New York and its Hudson River, and the filming locations were chosen and used in the best way possible. The soundtrack is essentially banal and unremarkable.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Professionally made account of a mind-blowing story,"Sully (2016)What a story! That's all Clint Eastwood needed in this case to make a compelling movie.Of course, we all know the ending to the crash part of things. And we think we know what happens to the other plot, the investigation of the crash. So this is a movie without surprises, and is mostly about recreating the events in a moving way.Done.Kudos also go to Tom Hanks, who pulls of a nuanced version of the pilot that seems convincing and sympathetic. A star playing a hero.The re-creation of the crash itself, and of the simulations afterward, are also first rate stuff—gripping, scary stuff.All of this said, it's also true that this is a formula movie. It does little to get to actual depths or surprises. It includes a couple of short dream sequences that are manipulative (for those of us who remember 9/11, at least). It concludes with a two-minute wrap up where everyone says golly and a huge room full of people jot a few things onto pads of paper. And with a very funny joke, which ends the movie with a laugh.Could more have been done? Of course. But then it wouldn't have been a simple re- presentation of the facts. It would have been a creative, original work of art, which this is not.But it's one heck of a story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Plays it like we are there and it's happening for the first time. Tom Hanks really gives a great Oscar worthy performance as Sully.

7/10,"""Sully"" is the real life story centering around the event that came to be called ""The Miracle on the Hudson"". Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were two airline pilots who on the 15th of January 2009 found themselves at loss of both engines at a record low altitude. Thankfully to their committed professionalism they managed to land the plane on the Hudson just 208 seconds after the incident without the loss of any lives both inside and outside the plane. Unfortunately, both the airline officials had to face tough times in the aftermath of the incident, during an investigation that mistakenly led to believe the two pilots hadn't done their job properly.The ever so prolific Clint Eastwood is back with another real life picture and yet another time he delivers a story that is well told and filled with great performances, even if there might be not that interesting of a story to tell, the efficiency of Eastwood in the use of the cinematic medium makes for nevertheless a worthy 90 minute watch.By saying that the story to tell here might not be interesting I am in no way, shape or form belittling the amazing feat that Sully and Skiles pulled off, nor denying their heroism in doing so, what I am saying is that the overall dramatic content that the situation and the story entail isn't exactly structured in a way that that brings an audience to feel naturally moved or emotional. The archs are pretty straight forward and predictable, the resolution really anticlimactic and overall there isn't any thematic content that gives the story a cinematic effect. The run-time of the film is reflective of how, even in real life, no matter how extraordinary the events, this was a pretty self contained and short spanning occurrence.Yet, if on one side we have to recognize the cinematic limitations this film has and how this reflects on the overall experience, on the other the effect to which Eastwood manages to bring it to the screen and make it as cinematic as possible. To me he actually showed in the film a self-consciousness about everything mentioned above and managed to play towards that at different moments, giving the picture a sense of realism and everyday life that is remarkable. The calm of the pilots during the incident, the offbeat disorientation of the passengers during the situation, the strange tranquillity with which the rescuers approach the plane and ultimately the way in which the characters cope with the situation in the immediate aftermath, everything contributed into giving the film a real sense of the situation that was incredibly surprising and fresh to see and better not, it gave the film its moments of greatest dramatic effect.Of course, one couldn't go about reviewing the film without mentioning Tom Hanks, that seems to be the standard with all of his movies. I think that even in the very short span of time I have been doing it I have already run out of words to describe him: ""Saving Mr. Banks"", ""Captain Philips"", ""Cloud Atlas"", ""Bridge of Spies"" and now this. It is baffling to see how he still cannot manage to turn ion a performance that is less than amazing, he is a real authentic actor, when you see him on screen there is no filter to his performance, you see how he is really living the moment and it is always a pleasure to experience. Aaron Eckhart is great too and definitely the standout in the rest of the cast, he is someone that infidelity deserves to be seen more in these kind of supporting roles as he always excels in them.Overall ""Sully"" won't give the audience any kind of gut wrenching, white-knuckle experience because of its limited content, but the picture that Eastwood presents us with is as good of what we could have asked from it.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A masterful recreation of a recent aviation event,"A US Airways jet with 155 passengers plus crew leaves LaGuardia Airport Jan. 15, 2009 in the early morning hours, experiencing trouble after just three minutes in the air: dual-engine failure due to bird strike. The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger and co-pilot, Jeffrey Skiles remarkably manage to land the plane on the Hudson River with no causalities, although the National Transportation Safety Board isn't quick to call ""Sully"" a hero. Director-co-producer Clint Eastwood does superb technical work, and no expense has been spared to make us feel we are in that plane as it splashes down in the freezing water. However, the investigation by the NTSB (portrayed as a bunch of sniveling villains) into Sullenberger's quick actions are heavy-handed, while the segues to Sullenberger's worried wife back home are equally dim (she isn't turned on by the media excitement, she can't sleep and she's worried about money). Eastwood certainly does well by his leading actors: Tom Hanks (with white hair as Sully) and Aaron Eckhart are both terrific, as is the intense, realistic action taking place on Flight 1549.

"Well-made, well-acted true story","'Sully' is the biopic of Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Hanks) and his First Officer, Jeff Skiles (Eckhart) who had to land their plane in New York's Hudson River in 2009, after both engines failed directly after take-off. Even though it was all over within five minutes, the film does a great job of exploring a bit of what happened before, a lot of what happened directly after and plenty of the investigation. It's edited well, so it's not all chronological.Surprisingly, this is Eastwood & Hanks' first collaboration, and they're both in good touch here - Hanks is the no-nonsense, but relatable soon-to-be-retired pilot, Eckhart is the slightly-younger and more enthusiastic co-pilot and Eastwood keeps the narrative flowing and never allows it to get too boring, technical or bogged down in the passenger's experiences. Linney is sparingly used as Sully's wife Lorraine, and Porter (O'Malley) is head of the NTSB investigation - essentially the 'bad guy'.The film works as an investigation/mystery, casting some doubt, but also has plenty of tension and action showing the actual crash and aftermath. While it's not sad per se, it did almost bring a tear to my eye in some parts, as it is a feel-good film at its heart, with ""this is some good news that New York really needed - especially when involving a plane"" really hitting home.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well crafted 5700 Seconds (from 208 sec),"Sully is best example of how a great director(Eastwood) can make a great movie (definitely not his best) with just one line or 208 sec story.Sully is a movie which glorifies the real time effort of a real life hero who saved every one on the flight and still keeps his humanity intact.The best part of the direction was that director teases you with the accident which could have happened without showing the real landing on Hudson river till last.(he shows 3 different scenario of landing through Sully's eyes.)Tom hanks was perfect in every frame( After 15 year, Oscar nomination is on the way) and i couldn't have imagined anyone else for this role. he was pitch perfect and showed how confident captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger was, but at the same time uncertain of his own doing that if he was the real danger to life of people on the plane.I was immensely impressed by the other hero of the movie, Editing and Cinematography. it was great to see how flashbacks and imagination was used to move story forward. The only disappointment of the movie was one dimensional role of a talented actress Laura Linney and how she was given only one object to show her emotions and how she was just reduced as a weeping wife.Aaron Eckhart was good and provided some much needed comic relief.On the whole it was a satisfying journey, journey which might be the most important journey of those 155 passengers and crew of their life.

a bit scattered,"Although it has a very good scena that recreates the crash, apart from that the movie is a bit lacking. They wanted to stay true to the real life story, but how do you make a good film out of that? You kind of only have one itneresting aspect to go on. So there are these little sub plots throughout the film that kinda go nowhere. And the main storyline of the trial doesn't feel all that fleshed out. And lastly, the timeline felt very stiched together. It felt like they originally wanted to start with the crash scene.

Uninteresting,"Boring. Very, very dull. Before anyone starts questioning anything, there were advance screenings at the local cinema, that's why I saw it early. Moving on.Who thought making this story into a film was a good idea? An event happened, everyone did their jobs, nothing went wrong. Why all the drama? Even the film just feels like a news story of the week type thing. I didn't know that much about this story so I went in hoping for more insight, but I learnt nothing. I knew going in that the plane crashed into the Hudson and the pilot did a good job. The film offers nothing beyond that.It is competently directed, as expected by Eastwood. I'm a little sick of the colourless visuals, although this wasn't nearly as bland looking as Jersey Boys nor as murky as the awful J Edgar. Hanks just does his usual thing pretty much playing himself in the lead role. There isn't much character development in this film, nor any truly memorable or resonant moments. The film lacks insight into the characters, I feel as if I could have had the same experience just reading a newspaper article based on this event. It's incredibly dry.I thought Flight with Denzel Washington was a very underwhelming film. And this was a bad version of that. Let that sink in for a little. At least there we had the story of him overcoming alcoholism. Eastwood really needs to pick films based on more interesting material, as he did until around 2008. It's pretty surprising to see such lacklustre output after films like Gran Torino, Letters From Iwo Jima, and Changeling.You know they're running low on material when they show the crash twice from the same perspective. I have no clue what Eastwood was going for there. Very strange.I'm sorry this review was so short - I just don't have much to say about this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography

Chesley Sullenberger (Hanks) is an ordinary pilot about to fly from New York to Charlotte. Almost instantly his plane is hit by birds and the engines fail. What he does next changes his life, and his passengers forever. This is a movie that starts with a problem.

The movie is a mix between flashbacks of the event and the subsequent investigation that just makes you angry. I was not aware of the extent the FAA went to try and prove what Sully did was dangerous and wrong. I don't want to spoil this, if that's possible but I do have to say that the emotion in this movie is front and center and I did tear up a few times. To me that is based on the magic of Tom Hanks. Everyone knows that everyone survived, but his reaction is priceless and makes you feel extreme joy, as if hearing it for the first time.

An dramatized baloney like an inflated balloon,"I have to borrow some words from Wikipedia about ""Balloon"" in order to describe this boring and extremely pretentious film: ""Modern day balloons are made from materials such as......, and can come in many colors.

A balloon's properties, including its low density and low cost, have led to a wide range of applications.""

There actually not too much to tell, so the whole multi-color patched up work, an assembled pieces by American grandma, still successfully lured lot of people buying tickets to relive a dramatized near-death experience. But there's absolutely nothing to tell, all the production team did was heavily relied on the deep wrinkles between Tom Hanks' eyebrows.I'd rather watch Denael Washington's ""Flight (2012)"" than watching this what's-the-big-deal, trying so hard to crate one more self-glorified American Hero Worship Thirst, yet totally unnecessary add-up.",,Anonymous,Biography
Best of 2016 so Far,"I'm gonna go straight to the review without telling its plot. In this film.Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart performance were great. Clint Eastwood did a great job stretching the story from the Plane scene, court scene and Sully's little background story. I love the editing of the film and the screenplay. It's not a linear storytelling but it works well showing some flashbacks and visions. I like also how they add some humor in this film. Cinematography was good. I didn't experience it on IMAX because there's no IMAX theater nearby do i watch it on 2D they said that the plane scene was good in IMAX in 2D looks good.Overall it is a worth watching movie. If you love drama films you're gonna love this but if you love films with explosions and a non-stop action this film is not for you. It's about human, human who makes decisions. This films is not just about Sully but also the other people involved in the rescue in the Hudson River.Can't wait to watch it again in DVD or Blu-rayIf you haven't seen it go watch it and you're gonna love it too.9/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Probably going to be the most realistic aviation movie you are going to watch,"The movie was very accurate especially with the Quick Reference Handbook. A lot of aviation movie like Left Behind are inaccurate especially when a person who knows airplanes very well to watch. The alarms and accurate, the cockpit was accurate, the Enchanced Ground Proxity Warning System was accurate. There are humors here and there, but it is very very easy to understand the movie if you know a lot about aviation. But overall, everyone should be able to understand the plot or movie unless you have completely no idea what happened to USair 1549. Beware that they might be some misunderstanding parts in the movie but in the end you will still understand the movie well. I advise to anyone who flies or loves aviation to watch this film cause it is probably going to be the most accurate movie you ever gonna watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I've flown for 42 years. I'm being judged on 208 seconds.""","""Sully"" from 2016 is based on the true story of pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger's dramatic landing of a plane carrying 155 people in the Hudson River when birds attacked his engines in 2009. I can still see the photos of the passengers standing on the wings waiting to be picked up. Naturally Hollywood grabbed the story immediately.Sully (Tom Hanks) is hailed as a hero. He doesn't seem to be one born for the spotlight -- he's a quiet person who really felt like he was just doing his job. But behind the scenes and the pictures of him as a hero, Sully's actions become the subject of a tense NTSB investigation.When the plane had to make an emergency landing, he was told to head for LaGuardia, but Sully said that the plane would not make it. The NTSB disputes this by performing simulations, and also states that one of the engines was still working. Sully felt he had no choice but to make his landing strip the Hudson River.Sully demands to see the simulations and also insists the second engine, so far lost at sea, was not working. His copilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) backs him up, and more importantly, no one was seriously injured.Very good film, if on the slow side, and it's not very exciting. It is, however, interesting and absorbing as we watch Sully attempt to prove that he was right, and insisting that the simulations are done in the same time frame as he had piloting the plane.Tom Hanks gives a good, reserved performance of someone whom greatness was thrust upon, a man who loved his work and was proud of it. Laura Linney has a small part as his wife.If Hanks' performance is subtle, so is Eastwood's direction, emphasizing the humanity of the story rather than going for over the top moments or big music. Truly an excellent job.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Not just a biopic, Eastwood done his best","I watched Sully (2016) last weekend. Author Monahan wrote in In Looking at Movies, ""every movie, regardless of how it is categorized, employs at least a loose interpretation of narrative"" (54). The investigation scenes, where Sully faces skepticism, intensified conflicts and confrontation with his actions are all hallmarks of dramatic storytelling. The genre convention of a real-world narrative structure is the main focus of this film, narrowing to the personal and professional challenges Sully faces during the investigation of the forced landing.The core of the movie can be simplified to a man trying to prove himself not wrong. But one notable theme, ""heroes as humans,"" includes Sully in the biopic genre by focusing less on celebrating the event and more on his vulnerability as a person. Making this movie about a human being and not an image of a hero. This is shown in Sully's internal conflict about his choices. In a scene, Sully is haunted by nightmares of failed landings, reflecting the film's emphasis on keeping the narrative grounded in reality, not idolizing. Thus the movie adds a layer of complexity to his character.This movie also subverts some elements in the biopic genre. As the book describes, ""narrative films are directed toward fiction...Events are added or removed or rearranged, and characters are composited"" (60). Conventionally a biopic tells a faithful story of a person's experience. Even the movie that claims it tells a true story, it invariably has to direct toward fiction in order to fit better into the narrative film category to achieve commercial success. The author says, ""Sully inaccurately portrayed their investigation as skeptical and confrontational to add drama to the fictionalized story"" (60). The film draws on familiar genre conventions such as the rise-fall-rise story arc, drama in the story, and character relationships that are otherwise unknown in the real world. Also, it utilizes non-linear storytelling by mixing up the investigative scenes, Sully's nightmares, and the actions of Sully landing the plane to add to the entertainment of viewers. Since the story is fairly straightforward, a conventional linear story-telling of a biopic would fall short in this high-budget production. Director Eastwood done his best to make it entertaining, but what do you expect? It's a biopic.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A movie based on a non-story,"I went to see Sully with a good deal of curiosity, curiosity to see how two heavy-weights such as Eastwood and Hanks would put up what could only be as a minimum a strong movie in absence of an underlying story. In fact, the events involving flight US Airways 1549 present a very thin story indeed: take-off, engine failure, emergency landing on the Hudson - all taking 208 seconds, plus rescue operation. A miracle indeed, but paradoxically a pretty simple and linear one, without much else attached to these sheer facts. So what was left for the movie was another superlative performance by Tom Hanks and the very professional direction of Clint Eastwood, but it remains a very thin story, with an attempt to inject some tension through the NTSB investigation, which is a usual routine after every incident, which is the movie is artificially dramatized. So, I walked into the cinema with great curiosity and I left with the question why did Eastwood picked up such a light story for his movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"I almost forgot movies were supposed to make you feel something, until I saw Sully.","This movie was absolutely amazing. Tom Hanks was great as Captain Sully. He captured Captain Sully's conflict about his decisions really well, and it made me sympathise with his character a lot. Of course, all the other characters, including the extras, were great as well. At first I felt sorry for him, but as the story progressed, I admired him more and more. Sully's ark is great to see, and will make you feel good in the end.Certain scenes had my heart racing. These scenes aren't filled with explosions and bullets, rather they consist of a conflict, which leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat. Scenes where people are sitting are more exciting than the final battle in Suicide Squad. I had goose bumps most of the movie. I can't say that about Suicide Squad.The story was, in one word, amazing. The structure of the story helped a great deal in sympathizing with Sully, and made me feel really sad, yet proud of him at the same time. The movie makes the viewer feel what Sully is feeling, and that is its best quality in my opinion. The only downside to the movie was the somewhat mediocre CGI plane. This, however, changes nothing about the quality of the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Incredible look at a hero's moment of valor.,"By now everyone reading this review would be somewhat aware of the Miracle on the Hudson. This film is based on the hero of that incident- the Captain Sullenberg. Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks and Eastwood a great team,"While this may not be Hank's most demanding role, I think it will certainly be one of his most memorable, along with ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". And Eastwood met the challenge of telling the truth of the story in an engaging way without loosing the audience in tedium or BS. And I was glad to see that serious attention was paid to aeronautical reality in a movie--for a change. For those interested in how well the movie does stick to the facts, re: the go to source for that, http://www.historyvshollywood.com/reelfaces/sully/ . For me, one of the two highlights of the film was what happened after the aircraft was ditched, in how the passengers didn't panic, and how well the rescue effort went. The other was the climax with Sullenberger's & Skiles testimony before the NTSB investigation (read ""trial"") which was in a much larger venue than I would have thought.The one thing the movie (and the actual investigation, apparently) didn't cover was how things are changed when making a dead-stick (no thrust) landing in an airliner, which without thrust, have been likened to flying a brick. With a runway, you have only one shot aiming for a specific point--in this case surrounded by many tall buildings, and they didn't exactly have much time to see how far they could glide anyway. Better to have something flat, very wide and very very long, even if it is wet. The space shuttle is the only large aircraft that routinely does (or did) dead stick landings; and that's with much study, training, practice, and (at least at first) landing on a dry lake bed--offering plenty of wiggle-room.What Sullenberger told 60 Minutes had to have been going through his head that day, ""The only viable alternative, the only level, smooth place sufficiently large to land an airliner, was the river"". The only semi-error they made was not to hit the ditch button which would have sealed the vents in the airplane (though the tail section was breached on landing) because it was at the end of the checklist which they didn't have time to complete. They made a big deal out of his starting the aux power unit (APU) out of checklist order. Just sayin'. That should have been the co-pilots's cue when Sully looks at him 10 seconds before ditching and asks, ""Any ideas?"". (A ""DITCH"" button, who'd've thunk.)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unnecessary and unforgettable,"Don't get me wrong. I think Tom Hanks is a tremendous actor who has done exceptionally well throughout his career however, I often feel like he is the go to actor when casting directors are lazy. He just did not fit this role well and over the last few years. I definitely feel like that is often been the case with Tom Hanks. I also felt like this film was completely unnecessary and not worth making. The small dramatic court stuff toward the end of the film feels very forced and unnecessary and likely was not as dramatic as they make it out to be. It's a great story amazing story but it's just not a very memorable film. As often as the case with a lot of Clint Eastwood films.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Sully"" shines thanks to the accident sequence and the performances of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, even if in the end it turns out to be just another correct uplifting biopic","In the opening minutes of ""Sully"", we follow the pilots and passengers of a plane preparing for a forced landing, in a sequence full of tension and a sense of imminence that ends with the worst: the plane crash in the middle of the city and its impact on the buildings, this one followed from the point of view of pedestrians. When Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played by Tom Hanks, wakes up, disoriented and distressed, we realize that the efficient prologue was just a dream. Despite this effective initial sequence, director Clint Eastwood demonstrates it right from the start, with the surprise of the dream (which is not at all dreamlike in its approach, by the way) and the reaction it provokes in the captain played by Hanks, who is less interested in the ""tragedy"" and more interested in the effects it has on the title character.These dreams also become ""hallucinations"", daydreaming's, and are a constant in the film. They are derived from a real accident, which the pilot prevented from becoming a major catastrophe. This is the ""Miracle of the Hudson"", when Sully decides to land his damaged plane in the icy waters of the river that cuts through the state of New York, the Hudson River, - a feat considered impossible, saving the lives of the 155 passengers on board. Sully is assisted by his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). However, even though Sully is hailed by the public and media for his unprecedented achievement in aviation history, an investigation begins that threatens his reputation and career.The bold decision by Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skies prompted an investigation by the US air traffic controller. The accusations were that, by landing on the Hudson, they risked even greater damage. The expert also pointed out that there would have been conditions for them to have returned to the airport and landed more safely - forgetting, however, the human variable in the face of the stress of making decisions at critical moments like that. Interspersing the public investigation of the two heroes with a more introspective level, which explores Sully's questions about his decision, Clint's film values the reconstitution of facts, but exaggerates in didacticism and monotonous sequences.""Sully"" operates like a made-for-television movie: be it in the short duration, in the way it treats the characters' relationships and even in the audience scenes (the weakest of the film, which try to inject unnecessary tension into a feature that is already full of it). ). In this way, Sully may be a film that operates on automatic as the ""uplifting biopic of Oscar season,"" but at least it does so efficiently. Efficiency already seen in the recreation of the accident in question, where Eastwood succeeds in always portraying it from a different point of view, in the aforementioned memory flashes or in Sully's own dreams, instigating our curiosity (not the morbid one, I must emphasize, rather in understanding how events unfolded). When we watch the complete sequence - excellent with the sound and impact of an IMAX cinema - we feel the despair of those present on the flight thanks to its realism (and if the special computer graphics effects were not so efficient, the whole sequence would be compromised, looking like a mere simulator).Chesley Sullenberger's life needs no empathetic stimulation. Here is a stoically decent person, by all accounts, who in 2009 landed a damaged commercial jet in New York's Hudson River, saving everyone on board. If that's not enough, the character is played by Tom Hanks, one of the loveliest and most likeable actors to ever grace Cinema. However, as impressive as Sully's heroics were that day, the incident itself only lasted 208 seconds. So, how do you build a feature film based on such a short event? Based on Sullenberger's book Highest Duty, the film expands on the pilot's emotional turmoil shortly after landing, the stern investigations into whether he made the right choices and, above all, modern society's seeming inability to simply appreciate a heroic act. Daily.Despite these intrinsic problems of the protagonist being interesting within the framework of cynicism that Clint wants to build, the film conveys an atmosphere of forced extension of a magnificent tale, however with ephemeral longevity. The work just doesn't fall into the boring abyss thanks to Clint's economic and safe direction, which replaces the lack of tension from the well-known accidental outcome with the dramatic increase resulting from security investigators manipulating facts to discredit him and the media making his life unbearable at the same time. Try to celebrate it, and, of course, the ever-reliable Tom Hanks. The script, written by Todd Komarnicki based on Captain Sully's own book, has its greatest narrative quality when it constantly returns to the minutes of the plane crash, each time offering a new detail of the event. This structure reinforces the feeling that unexpected events can mark the rest of our lives, just as the figure of Sully will be forever linked to the ""miracle of the Hudson River"". The rest of the work is like walking around in an old shoe: comfortable but boring. The story is beautiful, but emptied of major human tensions, except for the passing of the accident. Even the super-dimension the script seems to give to the crisis between Sully and his wife is just uninteresting.The narrative simplicity - an honest man doing the right thing - contrasts with the grandeur of a feat considered impossible. Todd Komarnicki's script, however, chooses to translate the story into Hollywood terms. To create the necessary conflict, the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) is made into a villain. The investigation, which exists to learn from the air accidents, avoiding future tragedies, becomes a pursuit of honor and Sully's more than forty years of experience. It would be an unavoidable mistake if it weren't for Tom Hanks. In the portrayal of Sully's concerns, the actor connects the viewer with the questions of someone who did the right thing, but is still haunted by the possibility of error. Eastwood is at his best when he focuses on his subject, measuring what a true hero is made of. This curiosity about the ""human factor"" also prevents Sully from falling into fabricated speech. American patriotism is there, but dissolved by a healthy dose of reality. There is no idealization, only competence.Were it not for Hanks in the lead role, the film would lose much of its strength, as the actor, with his friendly and ordinary type, gives the appearance of an ordinary citizen. Still, Hanks composes a character who is disciplined and methodical about his work. Thus, seeing him take pride in remembering his extensive career and not wanting it to be defined by a single event is convincing. Aaron Eckhart is competent as the co-pilot, and his relationship with Sully is believable due to the frankness and camaraderie with which it is portrayed. It's comical and light, for example, the moment when both seem anxious when they learn that they will participate in the famous David Letterman talk show. It's a shame that, even if it sets out to explore these relationships, Eastwood partially fails to insert a manipulative and dispensable family dynamic, as well as the audience scenes in which the protagonist's actions are put to the test.Just 96 minutes long, Clint Eastwood is wisely economical in telling the American pilot's story. In addition to this extraordinary period right after the accident, we have some flashes of the character's past and, of course, the complete reconstruction of the crash landing during the third act of the feature film. All very well sewn and worked, a beautiful example of less is more. Any other director would perhaps feel like telling the meeting between Sully and Lorraine, their life as a couple, or even giving more space to Jeff, his faithful co-pilot. None of this is necessary to understand the story that Eastwood wants to tell, and so these facts are rightly left out. Tom Hanks and Laura Linney don't share any scene together, even keeping in touch via phone. The message is very clear: computers can make mistakes and the human factor should never be left out of the equation - especially when we are talking about facts in which a right decision at the right time can completely change the final result. At the age of 86, Eastwood sends computers to hell and says it loud and clear: an experienced man can do better, even under great pressure.Clint Eastwood points his camera at the human being, but he doesn't forget to impress his audience with a very competent recreation of the accident that, fortunately, had no victims. The real heart of the movie ends up coming right after the event, when the rescue shows up. Brave people who promptly stepped up to avert a tragedy end up making the story more moving. Some might turn their noses up at the patriotic bias that Eastwood undeniably includes in the plot. And others, rightly, will find the last scene ridiculous, with the right to laughs and a freeze frame that would be more coherent in a bad eighties' series. These sins do not weigh so much for the result. ""Sully"" shines thanks to the accident sequence and the restrained - but efficient - performances of Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, even if in the end it turns out to be just another correct uplifting biopic.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

What could have been a long drawn-out movie with only 10 minutes of serious action becomes a masterpiece under the watchful eye of Director Clint Eastwood. Some of the biographical details may seem like filler, but it's nice to know a little bit about the man after all the hype about the hero. An attempt is made to discredit the magnificent deed of saving all 155 on board the aircraft, by the National Safety Board. Apparently, the movie ruffled a few feathers high up, as it was claimed that the inquest ""did not exactly happen that way"". Indeed! That's because it all had to be compressed into a mere 96 minutes. That's in far less time that even one board hearing, I am sure. Spellbinding. Great storytelling.

Despite that, it couldn't stretch to 90 minutes. So a few events, like those in cockpit, were shown multiple times.It didn't feel like a boring movie any point in time, but it did feel stretched than necessary.

Relive The Miracle on the Hudson,"There aren't many feel-good stories in the world in which we live. It's a sad fact of modern life that most of the news we hear is bad, and even events that can be considered triumphs by some have a downside for another group. In January 2009, America got an honest- to-God miracle, and an authentic hero. No qualifications, no asterisk, nothing but one of the most amazing stories in aviation history put the right man in the right cockpit to save 155 lives in a spectacularly-executed water landing of a passenger jet on the Hudson River. Over seven years later, the event dubbed ""The Miracle on the Hudson"" is a feature film helmed by director Clint Eastwood with Tom Hanks portraying the man in the pilot's seat for the incredible hair-raising flight: Captain Sully Sullenberger.US Airways Flight 1549 was supposed to be just another routine run from NYC's LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, NC and then on to Seattle. Just another flight in Sully's 42-year career behind the stick of various aircraft. Less than three minutes into the flight, the plane was hit by a flock of Canadian Geese that completely destroyed both engines and essentially turning the Airbus into a glider. If you're unfamiliar with the geography of the NYC area, the Hudson River separates NYC from the Newark, NJ area. It's one of the most densely populated areas on earth. Sully was given clearance from both LaGuardia and New Jersey's Teterboro airport to make an emergency landing, but he determined that the only course open to him was to attempt a water landing on the Hudson. The wind chill that day was -5 degrees Fahrenheit. The water temperature in the thirties. Any water landing that put passengers in the water for an extended period of time would have resulted in extensive casualties. Skillfully landing the plane and joining the crew in evacuating the passengers onto the wings and inflatable emergency ramps (Sully himself was the last person off the plane, only after making two additional sweeps looking for stragglers), Sully was met by lightning fast response from NYC's ferries, NYPD, Coast Guard, and a host of emergency responders. There were a few injuries, only two of which required overnight hospital stays, but not a soul was lost.The temptation in Sully would be to try to over-glamorize something that was already astonishing as is or make Capt. Sullenberger into something more than the quiet, reserved, professional, dignified man he is. The triumph of the film, to me, is that the star of this film is the crash. Hanks' portrayal of Sully is true to what I've seen of the man in interviews. He's not glamorous or flashy. He's a professional pilot who took the lives of his passengers very safely. He's humble and soft-spoken; not the sort of things that make up a Hollywood star. But, I think, that's why everyone identified with Sullenberger and hailed him: he was one of us. Yes, his job was more high-profile than those of us sitting in cubicles, but to him, this was him doing his job. Eastwood and Hanks give you pieces of the flight from the very beginning of the film, but it's not until the finale that you see the entirety of it from the viewpoint of passengers, crew, ground control, and bystanders. Sully is a brief film at 90 minutes; it tells its story tightly, with enough human angles to lend perspective. The narrative device used to drive the crash is something I was unaware of, the tremendous pressure exerted on Sully and First Officer Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) by US Airways and the NTSB, claiming Sully could have easily made it back to New York or New Jersey and the water landing had been unnecessary.I viewed the film on the 15th anniversary of 9/11, and that context needs to be kept in mind in watching the movie. This occurred just over seven years after the attacks on the World Trade Center, and what could have been more devastating than another passenger plane, for whatever reason, hitting a populated area in that same city. Eastwood has received some criticism for shots of planes crashing into buildings as Sully replays the events over the Hudson, questioning himself and his actions, but how could he not be thinking of that worst case scenario? Those were the stakes, you had densely populated metropolitan areas to each side and the Hudson River. He makes the water landing wrong, at best, he suffers significant passenger casualties. He gambles on either side of the Hudson going for an airport, and he may end up plowing another passenger jet into the New York skyline. It's difficult to even imagine stakes that could have been higher.Clint Eastwood, at age 86, has made one of his best films, lending just the right touch to a story that needed little embellishment. Tom Hanks brings the same subtle strength and realism to his portrayal of Captain Sullenberger, and Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn, among others, round out a strong ensemble. This is really the first big picture of the fall and it delivers in every way, and I strongly recommend people get out and see just what a miracle this truly was.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Captain Sully,"January 15, 2009. Many remember the date for the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" Crew and passengers totaled 155 as birds flew into the engine of the plane, forcing the captain to land in the Hudson River. Heralded as a hero, people who haven't read the book (including myself) that Chesley Sullenberger proceeded to write about the incident may not be familiar with everything that happened after the memorable day.There's different ways of approaching the material, so let's see how they decided to do it before analyzing the contributions of the individual. The beginning sets up how Sully never embraces the role of a hero and how his mind is tormented about how he saved the lives of everyone, yet the flight committee pushes to know if it was the best and safest decision; Sully reported that he lost both engines and thus wouldn't have thrust to return to a runway, but simulations and data engineers put together state otherwise. The beginning also sets up how Sully has always had a passion to fly and is an experienced pilot with over 40 years under his belt.It isn't until about the 30 minute mark that we get our first glimpses of the day in question. From then on there's a good deal of Sully contemplatively running through New York and reliving the day and the possible outcomes, and then different views of the 208 seconds of fateful flight.This is not the most thrilling movie. It just simply can't be. And it doesn't infuse the amount of enjoyment that Moneyball did with subject matter that could've bored audiences. Nevertheless, that is not to say the movie is boring. Clint Eastwood directs, and he more than anybody ever can direct with such a cool hand. And his directing when it comes to the rescue scenes on the river may be overlooked, but it's truly strong directing. And in typical Eastwood form, expect a lot of subtle piano playing in the film (Eastwood is credited with the theme for the film). It's also worth mentioning that even though many glimpses of the crash (or as Sully puts it, ""forced water landing"") are presented throughout the brisk hour and a half, it doesn't get old. There's purpose every time it's shown, and the right amount is shown every time.Tom Hanks stars as the captain who misses his family and truly believes he was just doing his job-- nothing overly heroic. There's some internal demons to battle over the course of the movie, and it may not be Hanks' finest performance, but the everyday-charm and subtleness is still quite a performance. Aaron Eckhart is the clear supporting role, second fiddle character. He's really meant to be the comic relief, and, not all the jokes are the most well-written, but again there's charm for the guy that has his captain's back every step of the way. Laura Linney is never on the screen with Hanks at the same time, but as the distressed wife, they share plenty of phone calls together.Again, this really isn't the most thrilling movie, and there shouldn't be hopes of it being one either. But it is a film shot almost entirely in IMAX cameras and the shots of New York are great; the acting is basically between good and great, and the final act shows the most humanity. Perhaps the film could be likened to Lincoln-- well acted without the most compelling of stories, but instead of Lincoln's ensemble cast, Sully places its bets on the focus of a few individual and that helps it retain the identity of an enjoyable film. It probably doesn't raise to the level needed for any Oscar nod, but it is an enjoyable film. And when you can enjoy a film or the film succeeds in the purpose it set out on, that's a win in my books.

"If you fly, do not miss this film","Do go and see the film ""Sully"", when next you fly, you will think of this film. Tom Hanks did a great job in the role of Sully. We take for granted those who crew and fly our passenger planes. Seeing this film, you feel you are one of the passengers. When your flight lands and it takes so long to get off the aircraft, think of this film and if it ever happens to you, remember were the emergency exits are and do read the safety brochures on the back of the seat in front of you. As well the life vest is usually under your seat, but do not inflate it till you are out of the cabin, else it may catch and lose its air or it may hang you up from exiting the plane. Some people who see this film may never want to fly again. Trust your crew to look out for you.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The true story of a great modern hero; everybody should see this terrific film!,"He was smarter than the air traffic controllers, the NTSB investigators, the flight simulator pilots, the flight simulation computers; he even outsmarted fate itself. On January 15, 2009 in New York City, 155 airline passengers and crew, plus an unknown number of people on the ground were all spared from a horrible and fiery death that fate had planned for them on that day. All their lives were saved because of one fact: the brain of Captain Chesley Sullenberger was in the cockpit of US Airways flight 1549 on that day.Forget about presidents, royalty, movie stars, or great scientists; if I could choose one famous person that I could meet before I die, it would be Chesley Sullenberger.Excellent directing, acting, screenplay, editing, and special effects; but mostly, the true story of a great modern hero. Everybody should see this terrific film!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Felt that the movie diluted the Heroic Deed !,"Felt that unnecessary drama was entwined around a real life heroic deed thereby by diluting it. How long will we tolerate pot-bellied short & bald men asking mean questions so that the viewers will get sympathy on the hero ? Hanks reaction seemed to be too cold in the aftermath of the bird strike which seemed too artificial. Thank goodness that the story line did not unnecessarily get into the personal lives of the passengers. Just felt that there wasn't enough meat in this real story that could have made it to the movie. We could have settled for a national geographic episode on ""Aircraft Investigation"" to get more scientific analysis and viewpoints.Hats off to the real hero Captain Sullenberger and let the real story stay with him.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful movie,"I used to love blow 'em up kinds of movies with lots of action. But I've settled down some. Now I more enjoy a movie with lots of heart.This movie was wonderfully heart-warming. I thought the flashback scenes were well-done and did not take away from the movie. I enjoyed getting little glimpses into the characters.I got tears in my eyes in a few scenes and was thoroughly engrossed the entire time. I highly recommend this movie.For an hour and a half long movie, the pacing was perfect. A bit of action, a bit of talk, some more action, some flashbacks to get a feel for the character. The movie didn't drag; there was always something new to keep the story going.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sully my name,"I remember when I listened to the news of this hero pilot, who made a really tough landing on water. That might be putting it lightly of course. Then again, there were people who said he took too big a risk and could've gone to an airport instead. Did he do something wrong? Computer simulations seemed to indicate there was another solution, a much safer one for everyone involved.And that is what this movie is about. It's a human story, about someone who though he did the right thing. But suddenly has doubts. You can't really compare this to the movie Denzel Washington did (which was also very powerful, one could argue even more powerful overall). These are different characters and different situations overall. If you like Drama and suspense combined you could do much worse ...",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie based on an incredible real story,"Sully had everything to be one of the best films of the year (at least for me), there's a good director who is Clint Eastwood who did a good job, an extraordinary actor (who is even my favorite), who is Tom Hanks , And a good supporting cast, not to mention the story that is based on real history, but Sully is just a good movie, and will hardly be nominated for the Oscar for best film and best director, maybe it's for better actor, which will be very well deserved , Because Tom Hanks is the best of the film, he is great, not to mention the makeup very well done, he Reincarnated the paper, I would not surprise if he was indicated, the direction of Eastwood has ups and downs, the acting of the secondary actors It varies from good to medium, the only one above the average is Hanks himself, the film has a medium tempo, even being a short film, the dialogues are good, the way the story is told is very interesting, the script does well , Even though it did not rip off all the potential that the film had, Sully is a good movie, but I would not indicate the best movie of the year.

Quality Mountain out of a Molehill,"The second entry in Clint Eastwood's informal ""real heroes"" trilogy, Sully tells the story of the Miracle on the Hudson, and it does it in an interesting way. Essentially swapping out its first and second acts, the tale of Captain Chelsey Sullenberger making impossible decisions to safely land an airliner on water is less about the event itself and more about the fallout, about the need of people to tear down someone who did something great. It ends up feeling a bit wan, like its trying to make a mountain out of a molehill, and it comes to a rather abrupt end, but the portrait of courage both during and after the fact are compelling nonetheless.Sully (Tom Hanks) wakes up to a nightmare of him crashing his UA 1549 flight into the middle of Manhattan on that snowy January morning instead of landing safely on the Hudson as he actually did. What follows is the early morning of the next day when he and his copilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), are staying in a hotel in New York, waiting for the next moves of the NTSB, the governing board that investigates every plane crash in America. Sully, a forty-year veteran of the skies starting as a boy learning on a crop duster leading to a career in the Air Force and as an airline pilot, is worried that the initial conversations he's had with the board are trying to place the blame on him rather than on the accidental bird strike that took out both of the engines of the plane. There's a line of dialogue about how the airline's insurance company would rather it be Sully than the failure of the plane in the face of disaster that may be the source of things, an implication of regulatory capture by larger, more powerful forces, but it gets no real attention and is dropped as quickly as it's brought up.The big thing about this opening is that it fully is the second act of the film, and that becomes obvious as it comes to a close and the next act begins with Sully buying a sandwich from a vendor in the airport and getting onto the plane to work through the preflight checklist with Skiles. It goes through most of the crash, and I think that ends up a mistake. The whole point of the journey we are on, the point of moving the structure around, is to make the portrait of the crash unclear to the viewer, to deny us key details so that we can't be quite sure of Sully's decision making, only for it to come together in the final act with the playing of the flight recorder. We see most of the crash from inside the cockpit here, and considering that the finale hinges on the playing of the flight recorder from inside the aircraft, it gives us too much information right off. There are key details missing from the second act telling (mostly the key moment where Sully pulls the plane to the right to line it up with the Hudson), but the bulk of it is there. I think to make the whole structural changes more effective, they needed to remove all of the cockpit stuff from this telling and let us see the individual pieces outside of it, namely the air traffic controller's perspective, the tower's, and those of the rescue personnel who helped get the people off the plane sitting in the middle of the river in winter. And then, in the final act, show us what happened on the inside. The current setup also has the weird effect of us seeing the whole thing, with only the smallest of variations, three separate times. It's weirdly repetitive.Still, the focus of the film really is Sully, and he's dealing with all of his second-guessing after the fact. Could he have made it to Newark or the small airport in Jersey, Teterboro? That no one died is a heavy salve for him, but his decision could have lead to deaths from the crash itself to sitting in the nearly freezing water on top of a sinking aircraft until something outside of his control (rescue) came. He commiserates with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) over the phone about the potential of his entire career being defined by 208 seconds, and how he could be left with nothing if the board goes against him.One of the most effective little things in the film ties into something Sully says at his hearing: that it wasn't just him, that it was the work of everyone on board that led to a positive outcome in the face of disaster. That gets shown in the crash with the flight attendants working hard at keeping the people in their care safe, but there's a tiny moment that helps highlight it even better. A man sits next to a woman with a baby. They don't know each other. When the call comes to keep their heads down and that the plane is going to crash, the man takes the baby from the woman so he can cradle it more safely. It's a small moment that very well may have led to saving the baby's life that goes unheralded. It's a key to understanding the film's focus on the understated and small heroism that helps provide light in a dark world, and that's what Eastwood is highlighting with this film as a whole. Sully is not a flashy hero, but he was cool-headed and worked hard to help.The NTSB stuff feels off, though. I'm not opposed to depictions of bureaucrats going too far and hurting the little people because they just feel like its in their power, but these people are presented too professionally by actors like Anna Gunn to sell that. The implication of regulatory capture is too briefly mentioned as well. In terms of holding it up against the reality, the events feel overblown, like they were trying to create movie drama where more low-key drama in the form of a general sense of unease in the face of a run of the mill investigation actually happened. Essentially, the NTSB is trying to set up Sully as the patsy in the film, but for what? They're too thinly drawn to have any real motivation, and that may be to prevent any kind of lawsuit. The writer, Todd Komarnicki, takes it as far as he can go without quite hitting on defamation. It provides some dramatic moments in the public hearing, like when Sully gets them to add 35 seconds to the live feed of the simulation happening in France which leads to his exoneration. It's a thinly entertaining moment that provides vindication for our hero, but the fight feels so manufactured that I resist it.Also, it just kind of stops. Sully gets cleared, Skiles gets to have a joke, and the movie fades to black. Sully doesn't get reunited with Lorraine or his daughters. There's no denouement of any kind. He gets his vindication, and it ends. It's an odd way to go out.Still, as a portrait of the lowkey heroism that can come out of nowhere and inspire, Sully is a success. Tom Hanks brings a quiet dignity to the pilot, and Eckhart is energetic as his copilot out to tell anyone that Sully did everything right. Eastwood handles the production with his normal professionalism, including with the special effects. This ends up halfway between a strictly realistic take on the incident and the more fully Hollywoodized version of events as presented in Robert Zemeckis' Flight. Flight is easily the better film, but that's because it chooses one side of that equation and sticks to it. Sully's dancing on the edge between realism and Hollywood convention undermines it a bit, but it remains an entertaining and quality look at the event.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Inspiring film,"Tom Hanks stars in this portrait of heroic airline pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, re-enacting his incredible successful emergency landing of an Airbus A320 full of passengers on the Hudson River. I love Clint Eastwood's direction and this movie is not an exception. He created a film that is vital, intense, thoughtful and emotional. Hanks does an admirable job of showing Sully's humiliating stress while his reputation was being challenged, with the first-rate support of a cast that includes Laura Linney as his wife, and Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn. ""Sully"" it is an admiring recreation of the quietly powerful true story that happened in Hudson and an inspiring film that touches your heart.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Bottom Up Stoic Professionalism,"As far as Eastwood films are concerned, this is your standard biopic. The only difference is, Sully is a real hardcore hero.Sully is the living representation of Copland's Fanfare for the Common Man. Insofar as this was the purpose of the film, it delivered. Hank's versatility playing all sorts of common men in unsurmountable situations makes him the perfect choice to play Sully. Everything else just writes itself.Simply put: it is the accurate portrayal of stoic professionalism that makes this film a solid watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
You know the story but........you watch it for TOM HANKS !,I am really starting to appreciate Clint Eastwood for his direction.This is a perfectly executed movie with all the fine actors bringing their experience to do their roles justice. The story though well known is revealed in just the right way to make you amazed at the heroic yet miraculous event that it was.It is clear that this piece of film is going to age like wine wine and will be a must watch under the 'Based on real events' category.Thank you Lord for giving us Tom Hanks for the gift to Cinema he is!,7.0,Anonymous,Biography
yawn,"i think an 8th grader wrote this script. the bottom line is the entire ""conflict"" in this story is that the government agencies investigated the water landing. ummmmm...yeah. that is their job. the dialogue...wow....poor. the action scenes were OK, but the sound track was too loud and offensive. Look, make movies that people want to see. it is not really that difficult. there were probably a lot of stories around the people on the plane that went untold. we have all matured a little beyond the evil conspiracy by the big bad government plots. they are boring. tired. old. Somewhat like the director. don't waste your money. i only went because my in laws wanted to see it.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
never forget the human factor (uh oh: Steve Mnuchin participated),"On 15 January 2009, something never before achieved in aviation occurred. A pilot landed his plane on the Hudson River after a flock of geese struck the plane, causing it to lose engine power. The pilot, Capt. Chesley Sullenberger - called Sully for short - earned ample praise for his landing of US Airways Flight 1549 and saving all the crew and passengers. But the story had only just begun.Clint Eastwood's ""Sully"" looks not only at the landing, but at the investigation. The NTSB thought that Sully hadn't done what he should have and held several hearings about it. But Sully knew something that they didn't.Admittedly, the audience knows what the outcome is, so it's not that suspenseful. But even so, the movie reminds us that the human factor is one of the most important things in any decision. Tom Hanks does his usual outstanding job as the pilot whose sudden celebrity risks getting overshadowed by the investigation. Good support comes from Aaron Eckhart as the co-pilot, and Mike O'Malley (Burt on ""Glee"") as one of the investigators. I thought that Laura Linney as Sully's wife didn't get enough screen time. It would've been interesting to see how the event affected their relationship.Anyway, it's not a masterpiece - not Eastwood's best by any stretch - but I still recommend it. I guess that a slight downside is that Steve Mnuchin was involved in the production (I guess that he invested in it).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Factually and technically brilliant,"Sully is probably one of the most detailed, factually and technically brilliant movies ever made of a real life event. Apart from some obvious CGI rendering of the plane which could have been done much better, I was amazed by how Eastwood has given the viewer a clear and accurate reconstruction of what exactly happened that day and almost from every angle.However, having read the book of Sully, ""Highest Duty"", I feel that a lot if not most of the message of the movie would have completely gone over my head if I did not read the book. Sully's mentor at a young age and the story of how he successfully landed a damaged plane in his earlier military career was perfect from a cinematographic point of view, but I think it did not convey Sully's message of ""a life dedicated to doing your normal job remarkably"" clearly.I appreciate that the movie tells the untold story of how Sully was almost blamed for his heroic actions through the investigation (not told elsewhere or in ""Highest duty""), but the cheesy ""wife crying on the phone""-type of storytelling misses an opportunity to inspire the audience to go home from the cinema and start preparing for their own ""land on the Hudson"" moment in their life, something which the book ""Highest duty"" most certainly does perfectly.Nonetheless, Sully remains an amazing film which serves as an example of what a fine actor Tom Hanks is. I also enjoyed Aaron Eckhart in this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
masterful storytelling and a thoroughly riveting film,"True story bio-pics based on real disasters have little room for creativity because a major aviation incident like landing in the Hudson River is so forensically documented. However, the real disaster in Sully (2016) is not landing a plane in a freezing river, but the hysteria of the media, airlines, insurance companies and safety investigators, who all voraciously pursued their own vested interests by undermining the professionalism of a modest pilot who saved the lives of everyone on board.The central incident unfolds only minutes after take-off on 19 January 2009 when Captain Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) realises that his Airbus A320-214 has lost both engines on hitting a massive flock of Canada geese. His options were to glide back for an airport landing while losing altitude over a densely populated city, or go for an unprecedented water landing onto the Hudson. His decision made history and he was immediately lauded as a hero until the media's appetite for the dark side of humanity turned the incident into a witch-hunt. Asking was he a ""hero or fraud"", the really big doubters were those with most to gain if human error could be established. While aviation interests quickly pitted computer simulations against real world decision making, Sully remained focused on cockpit logic. The film spends most of its 93 minutes exploring the incident from different perspectives and director Clint Eastwood's masterful storytelling is a perfect mix of facts and human insight.It is hard to imagine any actor who could fill this role as well as Tom Hanks. He captures the understated gravitas of a modest hero whose job exists at the fleeting intersection between saving and losing lives. The filming style draws you into its vortex while being mercifully light on CGI effects. We watch over Sully's shoulder at the controls then study his face during the critical minutes, before switching to panoptic views from the clouds. The most outstanding feature of this film is the way it frames the narrative and its aftermath, with flashbacks and parallel sub-plots that piece the story together like an elaborate jigsaw puzzle. Disaster films are usually just action dramas, but this one is much more than that. It has the intensity of a psychological thriller as we watch Sully's own confidence being undermined in the battle between sterile computer algorithms and the kind of intuitive judgement that comes from four decades of flying. This is a thoroughly riveting film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good acting not bad writing but much left out,"I really liked this movie but being a pilot myself I was surprised at what was left out of the movie and not mentioned. For instance the air traffic controller was removed from duty immediately and a blood and urine sample was taken or mentioned to be taken but not from the pilot and the copilot.Also when an aircraft goes down because of two engines failing and shutting down I would think the fuel would be examined and red tagged until it was tested safe with no contamination to prevent other aircraft being fueled with the same fuel from shutting down. That also was not addressed. Why Sully nor the co pilot failed to complete and follow the ditching procedure no one ever will know but that also was not mentioned. The procedure specifies that in a water landing that a ditching button be activated.The Airbus A320 has a ""ditching"" button that closes valves and openings underneath the aircraft, including the outflow valve, the air inlet for the emergency RAT, the avionics inlet, the extract valve, and the flow control valve.It is meant to slow flooding in a water landing. The flight crew did not activate the ""ditch switch"" during the incident. To be fair holes were ripped in the fuselage during the ditching of the aircraft that opened huge holes that let water seep in but still proper procedure was not followed by activating the switch. No one mentioned this during the movie.There is no doubt that both pilots acted professionally and should be commended for safely executing the water landing but it makes one wonder why after all the training and hours they received in training and in the cockpit they failed to follow proper procedure.But then again it is said that any landing you can walk away from is considered a good one.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Sully was pretty good, here's what I thought","Sully was pretty good here's what I thought. I liked how it pretty much developed every character who was on the plane, it showed why they were going on the plane, witch was cool. And I enjoyed how much they managed to show Sully's PTSD of the event, e.g all of his detailed nightmares, and the Men at the bar bullying him, when they bullied him he pictured the people in the nearby buildings with their shocked expressions, and all of the passengers screaming. 😚Cinema. You could hear the fear in all of the characters voices in their dialogue. The problem I did have with the film though, was that the film mentioned he had daughters, but it never showed them or you never even heard their voice on the phone. The only shot of them we got, was when the Mum said, hey girls turn on the tv, and it showed the back of their heads🙄. Honestly it would've been good if it showed their reaction when they turned on the tv, and having Sully have some interactions with them was what was missing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Solid Biopic Drama,"A decently solid biopic about the 2009 plane crash over the Hudson River and the admirable flying skills that saved all 155 passengers. Tom Hanks gives a good performance as always and the film feels fairly grounded and wrapped up in the whole procedure. That being said, the movie can feel a bit sluggish at times trying artificially stretch out the relatively smaller-scale conflicts of the aftermath that can feel a bit low-stakes and impersonal at times. But I'd still say it's worth a watch if you're interested in the topic and want to see a good recreation of the incident and its courtroom aftermath.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exceptional,"Superbly directed and brilliantly acted. Tom Hanks again defies gravity and lands himself on the legendary plain of cinematic artistry to add to his multi-faceted character ability. If anyone at all can tell a story it's Clint Eastwood and if anyone at all can live it....it's Tom Hanks. I also have to give Aaron Eckhart a solid A for his supportive role. I remember the day this historic event happened, but in no way did I or anyone I know, have any comprehension or understanding as to the length of rigorous interrogation that Captain Sully really truly had. There was definitely more at stake than what met the eye, and it was Captain Sully's heroic decision that was the fine line between the survival of 155 souls and losing 155 souls.

Make It Bigger And Better And Another 30 Mins Longer,"Way to suck the life out of a movie. Clint Eastwood is one of the best directors and Tom Hanks is an elite actor but they both miss the mark of greatness in this movie.Sure its good. They could both do 'good' in their sleep. I was expecting brilliant. Something with on screen tension and drama to match the real life story.The story is, as we know, incredible, so why isn't the movie?It looks great, sounds great and IS interesting, it just doesn't have any moments or great theatrical heights.

Another Masterpiece from Clint and Hanks.,"A story that must be told, this movie made me love the job I loved and cherished most in my youthful days. Great performance from Hanks👌🏾",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great direction and performances - just a little too dramatised on occasion,"Dramas based on real events can always be a bit tricky and making a feature-length film out of an event that took place over a few minutes must have been even trickier. Some of the events in this film are dramatised, some to an annoying level (the guys in the investigation team were like Disney villains...) but I do understand that the show needed to have sort of dramatic flair to keep it interesting for 90- odd minutes. Hopefully it didn't tarnish anybody's recollection of the events too much.It's oddly structured too but as time goes by in the film and events unfold, you understand why it was structured in such a way and I think it's fairly well done. It does mean that a few scenes are a bit heavy-handed in describing what's happening and how people are feeling and some transitions in and out of scenes are a bit hard to follow.Overall though if you take yourself away from these issues and immerse yourself into this film and Hanks' stellar performance then it's a pretty thrilling ride (I can end my review on a corny joke too...)",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies of 2016,"So I saw Sully and found it very well done. It had really cool reenactments of the airplane crash both as sorrow for the passengers and as special effects recreating the crash. It also was very well paced.

Sully is Sullenberger,"There's obviously a lot of research and accuracy of facts that need to be considered when making a film out of a real life incident. Clint Eastwood once again shows he knows what he's doing when it comes to sitting in the directors chair.January 15th, 2009, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed an Airbus A320 in the Hudson River after it suffered dual engine failures from a bird strike. What he endures following the incident is a scathing investigation team hell bent on showing him he made a mistake and he could have in fact turned the plane around and landed it safely on one of the many runways available to him in New York.Tom Hanks, as always, plays a solid role and character and a very believable Aircraft pilot, although i felt at times he could have shown just a little more emotion in certain spots. Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn made good additions to the cast fitting into their roles nicely.The film itself, jumps all over the place, it starts straight away with a nightmare from our hero. we see the time line of events is post- incident, then eventually goes back to the beginning of the flight before Sully even steps foot on the plane. I wasn't expecting the film to be structured this way and found it kind of annoying at first, but it doesn't at all affect the pacing.Clocking in at just an hour and a half, Sully is a good hero flick depicting the events of January 15th, 2009, because we learn everything we need to know in just that short space of time. Nothing feels overdone or over dramatized and I walked out of the cinema feeling thoroughly satisfied with what Eastwood managed to do with this story. Really good stuff!Fox.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tampering with truth,"Clint Eastwood really has a way with creating more drama when it should not be needed. The story itself is dramatic enough, and all this NTSB stuff he is adding in this movie is flat out false. Plus all these other cozy moments he is adding.

Very good movie based on a well-known true story,"I saw most of this movie on HBO last night.It was a little repetitious with part of the crash scenes, but solid all the way through otherwise. It gave me more respect for flight attendants.It seems to have ruffled feathers at the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). It is my understanding the Mr. Sullenberger requested that the names of the NTSB be changed to fictional ones after he reviewed the script. The movie didn't paint a rosy picture of NTSB, but I wouldn't call it harsh either. I've have an experience with another state government agency which was quite similar to that portrayed of the NTSB in this movie. In my opinion, the NTSB people were being way too sensitive. The movie makes them look good at the end.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

gets right to the heart of the matter,"An earnest, white-haired Hanks is ideally cast as Chesley Sullenberger, an adept pilot of forty plus years who on January 15, 2009 successfully landed a U.S. Airways flight on the Hudson River saving all 155 souls on board. Though initially hailed as a hero, the reticent aviator has little time to process everything he's been through when he finds himself under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). With a surprisingly short running time you almost want the film to go on longer than it does, especially when thinking about the miraculous real-life incident that inspired it, yet it's efficient and well-made. Never a dull moment in this affecting drama, which also serves as an unofficial love letter to New York City. ***",,Anonymous,Biography
"Did not reach to the level of expectation, documentary about this incident is more emotional","Was waiting for this Clint Eastwood movie for a year. Specially after watching the documentary on this incident. The documentary is mind blowing and some how it makes the questions on audience mind on own deeds, whether we are doing right in life... the passengers who face death in front shows their emotional dialogues so sweet and heart touching.. which surely makes the audience cry.. especially when one of the passenger said - ""after this incident i started to question everything in my life,..felt like whatever done yesterday was not the right "" life of each on the board touched with this incident and they surely changed. Now let come to the movie. Unfortunately nothing of the emotional part of the passengers shown in the movie. Even when the film maker got a good chance to win some tears from the audience they did not gone much for emotional part but concentrated on investigation part. Film should have at least give concentration to the scenes of the incident but again unfortunately whole incident short cut to some few shots and that too in discontinued flashbacks with no continuity or whatsoever.

Am I missing something here?,"It was an OK movie, with lots of natural acting. Hanks does the job well as usual, so does Eckhart too, but I just don't get it..isn't something missing here?

Definitely 155 people were so lucky to have Sully as their captain I was full of admiration of what Captain Sully did in those 36 seconds.... But the movie simply fail to give us that feeling the wow factor! I just thought being a feature movie it could have added some dramatized events to enrich the characteristics of a live drama... a feature movie.

I am astounded by the actions of recovery teams, rescue workers and all the people involved in the event, including passengers and crew. While this event was about 8 years after 9/11, the good will and belief in themselves was still fresh on the minds of passengers, crew, and first responders. If this were to happen today (2025) I cannot imagine the comments and reactions from people wanting to tear down, not build up, this country. Today some folks would have taken the pulpit to lay blame prior to fact checking.The major issue I have with this movie is the depiction of the NTSB. Not surprising from Clint Eastwood, who is a marvelous director but lets his personal beliefs to overly affect his work. It is the job of the NTSB to dig into any accident and examine facts, not media reports. In the movie the depiction seems to be more antagonistic at first. We have got to develop more positive stances these days or destruction is looming.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Deeply moving drama,"It's been a while since I saw Tom Hanks, maybe it was the Terminal, a movie about a man stuck in a airport, maybe he's got something for planes ! Anyway.I've been deeply moved by this drama, Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckart are just excellent and make a really believable pilot duo, the humanity and steadiness of Sully is just amazing as he faces the cruel investigators. We care about Sully from the very start, because we can see he's a good man tormented by bad dreams about plane crashes, and I have a special mention for dialogues which are really enjoyable, Sully just always finds the right answer to the investigators of the crash, it's a real pleasure to see his confidence in what he did.I would have expected more presence for Eckart though. The co-pilot finds himself in an incredible situation, yet he doesn't even asks : ""are you sure about this ? Isn't there another way ?"", it really felt too passive during the crash.The psychology of Sully is really well-written, you can see he doesn't really like to be called a hero or being hugged, but still he fights back to not be called a criminal.A nice surprise to see Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad, playing here one of the investigators. She quite has the same administrative role in Breaking Bad so it fits her well.Cinematography is mastered even if not excellent, by director of photography Tom Stern who also collaborated with Eastwood on Gran Torino and Million Dollar Baby.You can see the real pilot and crash victims meeting in the credits, so stay to the end. One of the most interesting movies of Clint Eastwood. I recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty good,"So I watched it with pretty high expectations, I like Tom Hanks, think he's a brilliant actor and I love Clint Eastwood, I think he knows what he's doing both in front of the camera, acting and behind it, directing.It started off really good, they built up the story, but then I thought the pace went up and everything just went by too quickly. I like a more slow pace with lots of details, but for people in a rush, than yeah this will work fine! This is an example of why a lot of big actors has started to show up in TV Series. And I totally get why, they get a lot more time to play and grow into their characters, and there is much more detail to everything.I'm not saying it's bad (obviously) It just didn't live up to my expectations. I think the film could have added at least another 30 minutes.I do recommend it, the acting and story is very interesting!I give it 7 out of 10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good depiction of Sully. Cartoon villains,"The flight scenes and PTSD Sully suffered were very good. But the portrayal of the NTSB. They may as well have come with black suits, whiplash moustache, and an evil snicker.At no point in the entire transcript of the proceedings (very boring read) were NTSB hostile to Sully or Jeff. The whole point is to identify the point of failure and correct it. If pilots think they have something to lose, then some will hide details, and people will die.I know a movie where all the details are obvious and known beforehand is very boring, but presenting the National Transportation Safety Board as the bad guys is insulting and very misleading. Their job is not to determine who or what is at fault. Their job is to determine how to prevent the accident from reoccurring.I cannot recommend this film due to the made up conflict.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sturdy film-making from the ever-reliable Hanks and Eastwood,"Despite being just 96 minutes long, it was difficult to think that an entire feature-length film could made from a 208-second incident that, while miraculous, was rather short-lived. Sully utilises the star-power and talent of director Clint Eastwood and lead actor Tom Hanks to sustain the rest of the runtime, with a compelling and engrossing play-out that is as interesting as it is intense.(...)Sully is a sturdy piece of film-making from the likes of Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, proving exactly why they are top of their respective games. With a slim runtime and excellent pacing, it is a compelling piece of film perfectly suited to the big screen, with stunning visuals and cinematography. Sully demonstrates the Miracle on the Hudson with a great deal of detail, ensuring it is an engrossing watch, as well as one that educates. It deserves to be viewed on the biggest screen to truly appreciate the stunning visuals, so be sure to see it while you still can!FULL REVIEW - http://perksofbeingnath.blogspot.co.uk/2016/12/sully-2016-review.html",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""Chesley Sullenberger""- The unsung hero of US Airways Flight 1549","The movie Sully is based on a true story which was in The New York Time as Miracle of the Hudson. It is a 2016 American biographical drama directed by Clint Eastwood and written by Todd Komarnicki, based on the autobiography"" Highest Duty by Chesley Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow"". The film stars Tom Hanks as Sullen berger, with Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan, and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles. The film follows Sullenberger's January 2009 emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River, in which all 155 passengers and crew members survived the plane crash. A feat largely credited to captain Sullen Berger. On 15th January, US airways flight no.1549 departed from LaGuardia airport. Barely 3 minutes into the flight, disaster struck. A flock of birds flew in to the engines; which cripples both of the engines and raised an emergency situation for the pilot. Although there were no airport in range Sully still maintained the aircraft and saw if they could make it on airport otherwise they would crash. Sully decided that the plane won't make it to the airport so he choose to land on the Hudson river which was nearby. Finally he successfully landed the aircraft with minimal damage; sparing the lives of the crew and passengers. It was the first-time in history that a plane landed on water without any casualties. However, the official investigation reports that one of the engines was running ideal and not damage yet. The flight simulations indicated that it would have been possible to land at either of LaGuardia or Teterboro airports. This charge caused Sully being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill. Sullys life was being invaded by reporters and investigators forced sully to put his job and reputation on the line. Sully was almost charged guilty of endangering the lives of his passengers and crew as the human flight simulations showed that it was possible to land the aircraft safely on any of the two airports. But then Sully asked jury how many times did the simulation pilots practice the turn and landing to make the landing precise and also added that they were not in the real life and death situation that he had to face. Then the jury took his opinion in concern and found out that the simulation pilots had to practice 17 times to make the turn, and so they gave the pilots and 30 second handicap then both of the landing attempts failed in disasters. And afterwards they received a report on the recently recovered left engine and it said that the left engine was severely damaged. After seeing this the jury was convinced that what sully did was inevitable and a miracle. So, all the allegations on sully were taken down and Sully was finally recognized as the hero that he was.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great story, decent movie","I was living in Australia when I watched this story, soon after it had happened. It was all over the news. I remember, still today, Sully's apparent calmness when talking about the event. This is one of those stories that one believes to be fiction and part of a feel-good Christmas film, but it was real, it was great, it warmed my heart, and it renewed my respect for pilots, who certainly are not just cool dudes in pretty uniforms.Knowing the end of the story is a tricky thing for a film that is not documentary and intends to build tension and interest in the viewer. Eastwood achieved that in different ways: 1-by just playing a non-linear story that does go back and forward in time; 2-by making us see Sully behind doors (his personal background with aviation, his emotional self with PSD after the events on the Hudson unfolded, his worries about his family future); 3-by creating a set of villains (in this case the NTSB investigators), and 4-by creating a situation that builds tension (the investigation on whether Sully's act of heroism was on the contrary a lack of judgment.To me, the main problem with the film is not what is in the film, but with what's not there. Sully is based on Captain Sullenberg's own memoir and, therefore, we see just one color. I would have loved knowing more about the co-pilot and his PDS, of which he also suffered, get to know some of the passengers flying on the film, seeing more about Sully's daughters' reaction to the events, seeing more details about the NTSB behind-doors investigation going on, and building a bit of more tension around that.The acting is good overall, especially on Hanks' part, who is able to convey Sully's real mix of his usual external calmness and the inner turmoil that he experienced after the event. I also liked Eckhart as his co-pilot,and Linney as his wife.I loved the special effects that reproduce the events on the Hudson as the landing on the river looks totally real not just special effects.Overall, this is a very enjoyable feel-good movie and story. Yet, the events being so well-documented and internationally well known, and so close in time, it is difficult to get overly wowed by a story that was, indeed, wow.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
I love it!,"Clint Eastwood's movie is about how a group of people worked together to save lives when the government couldn't help. Tom Hanks is amazing in his role as the calm and collected hero who saves the day. The movie shows how everyone involved dealt with the situation differently, but they all came together to make sure everything turned out okay. Even though it might not be as interesting as some of Eastwood's other movies, the way he handles the aftermath of the event and Hanks' performance make it worth watching. The movie ends on a happy note that shows forgiveness and the importance of having friends by your side.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
best and emotional movie 2016,"Greetings again from the darkness. Society has a tendency to go to extremes – hero worship for those who probably don't deserve it and character assassination for those who have the gall to be less than perfect. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger has experienced both. Sully continues Eastwood's success by giving us probably the most human drama of 2016.On January 15, 2009, US Airways pilots Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeff Skiles board US Airways Flight 1549 from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte Douglas International Airport. Three minutes into the flight, at an approximate altitude of 2,800 feet (approx. 850 m), the Airbus A320 strikes a flock of birds, disabling both engines. Without engine power and judging themselves unable to reach nearby airports. Sully landed the aircraft on the Hudson River. The crew and passengers evacuate without casualty. The press and public hail Sullenburger a hero, but the incident leaves him with nightmare, and he repeatedly imagines the plane crashing into a building.Sully learns that preliminary data from ACARS suggest that the port engine was still running at idle power. Theoretically, this would have left him with enough power to return to LaGuardia or land at Teterboro. The National Transportation Safety Board claims that several confidential computerized simulations show the plane could have landed safely at either airport. Sully, however, insists that he lost both engines, which left him without sufficient time, speed, or altitude to land safely at any airport.Sully realizes that the Board believes the accident may have been pilot error, which would end his career. He arranges to have the simulations rerun with live pilots, and the results are relayed to the public hearing. Both simulations result in successful landings, one at each airport. Sully argues that they are unrealistic because the pilots knew in advance of the situation they would face and of the suggested emergency action, and were able to practice the scenario several times. The board accepts that in real life the pilots would have taken some time to react and run emergency checks before deciding to land the plane.The two simulations are rerun and relayed to the hearing, this time allowing a 35-second pause before the plane is landed. The simulated diversion to LaGuardia ends with the plane landing short of the runway, and to Teterboro with a crash into buildings before the airport. The board announces that analysis of the port engine, now recovered from the river, confirms Sully's account that it was disabled by the bird strikes. The board concludes that Sullenberger acted correctly in selecting the best of the options available to him, which in the event saved the lives of everyone aboard.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Repetitive and Lacks Urgency,"I'm not a massive fan of Tom Hanks, and I don't think I've ever enjoyed a Clint Eastwood-directed movie, but I figured what the hell and went to see it anyway, it's a story I'm interested in learning a little more about. But if there's one thing the movie taught me, it's that I already knew pretty much the whole story already. Sully and his co-pilot lose both engines from a sing bird strike, start losing altitude fast, and quickly decide an unprecedented water landing on the nearby river is a safer option than attempting to make a ditch for a nearby airport. Through an unmatched amount of skill and luck, the landing goes as smoothly as can be, all the passengers survived with minor injuries, and Captain Sully is hailed a hero. The main narrative follows the investigation afterwards from the NTSB, as Sully attempts to convince the board that there was no other option, in the face of both computer and human simulations that tell them otherwise.I have two really big issues with this movie. The first is how repetitive it is. We see the incident at least three times, almost from beginning to end each time, just with slightly different perspectives; air traffic control, passengers, and cabin. It takes a while for these flashbacks to begin, instead offered nightmares of how it could've happened and gone catastrophically wrong, but once they start, we keep revisiting it over and over, and I'll be honest, it gets boring. These flashbacks become harder and harder to separate from the main narrative as we go on as well. There's a scene late in the movie where Sully is hugged by a hotel manager, but it's not immediately obvious when this scene actually takes place. It's only when his co-pilot asks why he's still in his uniform that it clicks that it's actually still part of the flashback, post-incident.My second issue, and this is a biggie, is that every time we see the incident, it lacks urgency, it lacks drama, it lacks suspense. At no point are we shown the gravity of the situation, only told how it was a miracle, how it was unprecedented, how it could've gone so much worse. As I understand it, the whole rescue operation took about twenty-four minutes, and I guess in the name of authenticity, Eastwood decided to show it in near enough to realtime, which slows everything down, loses all momentum of the accident and takes away the much needed urgency that lives could be at stake. We're told by news reporters that the passengers ""have minutes to live"" but we're never given any indication that this is actually the case from watching the rescue itself. I don't know, maybe that was the point; to show how the media over-inflates everything to make it sound more dramatic and interesting? But then, wouldn't that just completely undermine the heroism Eastwood is simultaneously attempting to portray?It's not a complete failure of a movie though. Even though I haven't enjoyed a single Eastwood- directed movie I've seen, he's still reasonably talented on the more technical aspects. The film does look great, and what effects work there was is flawless (genuinely thought the David Letterman scene was re-enacted rather than just had Hanks et al's faces super-imposed). As off- putting as it was to see a reporters face large and centre in front of a blurred background, it did at least have the resemblance of artistry behind it.Tom Hanks' work is admirable, of course. He isn't such a celebrated and high-demanded actor for no reason, and his Sully is likable and empathetic, but rightly conflicted and affected by the incident. Aaron Eckhart's Skiles is more down-to-earth and jokey, but not entirely without effect. Laura Linney doesn't get a whole lot to do, spending a hundred percent of her screen time on the phone, but she manages to serve as the emotional backbone to the movie, as annoyingly insignificant as her role may be. Anna Gunn probably impressed me the most, as NTSB investigator Elizabeth Davis. In a way she's the sympathetic investigator on the board, without undermining the authority of her position. The break in her voice during the hearing as the NTSB's agenda is brought down is powerful. She also gets bonus points for almost making me forget how annoying Skyler was in Breaking Bad.Sully clocks in at a relatively short ninety minutes, but that's still too long, and the film still feels like it was padded out with filler, overly slow-moments, and repetitive flashbacks. It somehow manages to drag along, and then concludes abruptly on weird joke. It lacks urgency, which in the retelling of a real-life emergency is a big oversight, and I'll be honest, I was actually kind of bored by the movie's end. I give it a meandering and over-sentimental 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Real Hero....vs. little paper pushing people......,"This movie is engrossing and deserves a high vote.It is based on true events, when a passenger plane needed to make an emergency landing in a city lake. Without doubt the hero of the event was the planes captain.Believe it or not there are a lot of people especially world wide who never heard of the events portrayed in the movie as at the time it was a sensation all over the planet.At first I was puzzled as to why the movie makers instead of putting the attempted plane landing at the center of the picture, concentrated on the awful bureaucrats from the airline safety board who were it seems trying perhaps unfairly to find the captain at fault.However my research suggests that from the perspective of both the captain and co-pilot they felt they were being investigated in such a way that if they could be blamed for what happened, they would be; hence the movie takes the point of view of the captain and co-pilot.Both the attempted landing and the investigation are certainly compelling viewing.The lead actor gives a fine yet restrained performance.Even if the decision to land on the lake was not the only alternative the captain is a Real Hero.All in all, I give this picture 7 and a half, rounded up so:8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hurray for the Hero of Flight 1549!,"Remember when a plane flew into the Hudson Bay? Remember all 155 passengers on board who miraculously survived the impact? Remember the pilot responsible for making the quick move that prevented this delay from becoming a disaster? ​ Now, seven and a half years after these events shook the world, the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger is brought to the screen by director Clint Eastwood and actor Tom Hanks. Based on the autobiography, ""Highest Duty,"" Sully expresses how the passengers' fear was vanquished by their pilot's risky and controversial thinking in a fashion that will inspire dads and business professionals across the nation.It begins with a nightmare by the infamous pilot of his airplane flying uncontrollably into the city, the sounds of the plane booming real enough to rattle you the right way. He wakes up to yet another news report of his catastrophic Flight 1549 landing from January 15, 2009. This reality is simply too overwhelming for him to handle, so much so, that he can't even go jogging without facing a near-hit by a taxi cab. Neither he nor his family can escape from the reporters, talk shows, and high city court who won't shut up about the controversy. It's almost as if 911 is happening all over again, except consequentially by one of America's own heroes.He explains in flashback precisely why he allowed the landing in spite of claims that the left engine could still have been idling. It all follows a nonlinear storytelling structure similar to what Stanley Kubrick or Quentin Tarantino have popularized. Maybe this flashback structure wasn't necessary in the telling of the story, or maybe it just wasn't edited properly. But either way, it got frustratingly confusing as to where or when I was in time, especially when it returns me to a scene that if left off of a half hour earlier.If you were to go ask anyone who was there on that day of the Hudson Bay landing, they would go on to say from backed up evidence that these events are true to what happened; but this retelling doesn't feel quite true enough. Even right from the release of the first trailer, I knew that Tom Hanks wasn't going to fit the part, particularly because he does not look the part at all. Basically all the makeup artists do to make him look authentic is spray-paint his hair white and glue a mustache onto his face, which looks completely unconvincing that he is representing the real flight hero. Then if you look everywhere else around him, there is an excessive amount of branding for New York's culture. The words ""New York"" are everywhere within the overused wide-shots of the city, something that not even the fake-looking CGI planes can distract us from.Yet I still wouldn't say that it makes this a horrible viewing experience. Far from it, in fact. Sully is backed up with plenty of satisfactory performances by the whole cast, particularly Aaron Eckhart (The Dark Knight, Thank You for Smoking), who plays Captain Sullenberger's first officer and best friend. There's also Laura Linney (Mystic River, The Truman Show) who plays the captain's stay- at- home wife. She's not the most well-developed or memorable of characters, but her love for her husband still comes out satisfactorily well.Yeah, that's a good word to sum up this movie. It's satisfactory. It's certainly better than average, but not the best thing ever like I hoped it would. It's just plain satisfactory as good, wholesome, inspirational entertainment. It's not that bad for tributing a man who was so big he had an alcoholic beverage named after him (it's made with a shot of Grey Goose Vodka and a splash of water, so feel free to make it at home!)It's also worth noting that the end credits feature some special guest appearances who will make this entire movie truly worth the trip.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Contrived, fictitious, unreal, and ingloriously political","This film is simply filled with claptrap, and right-wing nut job claptrap at that. The juvenile rendering of the NTSB agents as cartoon character villains is a disservice of all those who try to protect the skies from airplanes deprived of their correct servicing and from terrorists as well. The film clubs the viewer over the head - or at least tries to - with the notion that the government and the media are evil, out to get heroes like Sullenberger. Abandon government regulation, the film cries out, led by the film's ""hero,"" the near senile Clint Eastwood, with his Fox News-rendered illusions. What is most disappointing on an emotional level is the unreal rendering of the man Sullenberger himself. As Hanks plays him, he has not a shred of a personality, is nothing but a stoic, jaded, unhappy misanthrope, which the real Sully isn't, as is seen at the end of the film, when he is actually shown smiling with his former passengers, something - smiling, that is- that he doesn't do throughout the entire film. Tom Hanks and Laura Linney should be ashamed: the nadir of their careers.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
An interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero,"Sully is a biographical drama film starring Tom Hanks and directed by Clint Eastwood. Based on the true story of veteran airline pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the film is a nice tribute to its title character and the people he saved.Late in the afternoon on January 15, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 departs from LaGuardia Airport in New York to Charlotte Douglas International Airport in North Carolina. Three minutes into the flight, the plane is struck by a large flock of birds, which seriously damages both its engines. The quick thinking of pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) results in the plane landing in the middle of the freezing cold Hudson River. All 155 passengers and crew survive the crash landing and Sully is hailed as a hero by the media. However, Sully feels overwhelmed by the sudden fame he has received and to make matters worse, an official investigation is opened over whether or not Sully should have acted as he did or if he recklessly endangered the lives of his passengers.Featuring another solid performance by the ever-versatile Tom Hanks and careful direction by Clint Eastwood, Sully is an interesting look into the psyche of an everyday man who inadvertently becomes a hero. The audience always feels connected to Sully's plight as a reluctant target of the media and the post-traumatic stress he goes through in the aftermath of the crash. The only major issue I had with the film is that the supporting characters did not have much to work with. It just seemed like most of their dialogue was there merely to enhance the character development of Sully himself rather than to bring a different perspective to the story.I rate it 7.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hanks, and all supporting actors are sublime throughout. Understated at times I guess, but for good reason.It's just great stoytelling with the right balance of fact and artistic licence to be visceral and enthralling all at once, I guess (could be very factual for all I know but it's very entertaining!)For me, it is what filmmaking should be more often. I guess for some too slow. Sometimes, an enthralling historic event unfolding at a pace that makes you salivate is almost as good as it gets.Great cinematography, scirpt, acting and storyline.

Quiet Courage in 'Sully',"""Sully"" is one of those movies that gets your heart racing and makes you feel good inside. It's the real-life story of Captain Sully, the pilot who landed a plane on the Hudson River, and Tom Hanks just nails it. He shows us how Sully was calm and brave during those scary moments in the air. But the movie also gives us a peek at what happened after, when Sully had to prove that he made the right decision. Clint Eastwood does a great job showing us the exciting stuff and the challenges Sully faced afterward. What's really cool about ""Sully"" is it's not just about that famous landing. It's about standing strong when people question your actions. It's about the kind of bravery that doesn't make a lot of noise but shows up when it really matters. This movie makes you want to cheer for the quiet heroes who do the right thing, even when it's tough. ""Sully"" is a thumbs-up for anyone who loves a good story about real heroes who stick to their guns.",,Anonymous,Biography

Great story but the film left me cold,"True stories are always the best stories and Chesley Sullenberger's is certainly an extraordinary one. The film tells the story of the pilot of a doomed flight, whose skills and quick thinking saved all lives onboard. It's a remarkable story, though I do feel the film didn't do it full justice. It felt more like a quick fix rather than a proper account of the events that occurred. Too much of the film is set in the aftermath and as a result, it isn't the heart in mouth drama that it should have been.Tom Hanks is excellent, as he always is, though I much preferred him in the similar 'Captain Phillips'. His character was a lot more vulnerable in that film and it also did a much better job at building tension. While there is certainly tension in 'Sully', it is restricted to only a few scenes and the cutting back and forth doesn't help at all. Overall, not a bad film, but I was expecting something a lot better.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks at his best,"One of, if not the best, performance ever by Tom Hanks . He is Chesley Sullenberger, not just Tom Hanks skillfully playing a role. The recreation of the events and other ""what if"" scenarios is spectacular, almost as if they had been filmed when the event was actually happening. (It's a shame the DVD has no additional special features explaining how this was done.) The movie could have taken a more traditional approach, such as following more personal stories of passengers and rescuers from the moment they left their homes to the moment they got off or to the plane. Instead - and equally entertaining and enthralling -- the focus in on the behind-the-scenes examination of whether a public hero actually deserves the accolades he has so instantly received. Such a government agency review is standard procedure, of course, but it seems especially cruel for Sullenberger to have to go through what appeared to be a hunt to find a way to blame the emergency landing on him. In the end, everyone was just ""doing their jobs"" and no hard feelings remained, one would hope.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Could have been something,"SULLY, directed by Clint Eastwood is a true story made into a film surrounding Captain Chelsey Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his first officer (Aaron Eckhart) who save 155 passengers by landing their plane on the Hudson River, and also focuses on the aftermath they debate whether the plane could fly a little further and land safely on land without putting anyone in danger.I don't remember a thing from 15th of January 2009. And with all the great reviews of this retelling I was hoping to learn and be entertained while doing so. Which I was, kinda?When they were doing the hearings at the end of the film to see if it was possible to land safely on land as I briefly mentioned before, was where I had the most fun. And has a lot of suspense. Including the music playing, and all of these aspects made me really excited and worried at the same time for these people, the message at the end was really nice as well.Eastwood's movies are very colourless as shown in J.Edgar. It made that movie very un interesting and boring and kind of hurt my eyes after watching it for a while, and I have never finished watching the movie. Sully isn't half as bad in colour choices as J. Edgar and actually helps the movie to give it more realism with the darker shades and tones.The film is spoken all in a quiet tone, sometimes hard to understand, and doesn't give the movie much personality. But makes the film calming at times, which I liked. There are no scenes of people changing emphasis in speech, like yelling, having different speech types, (I guess), I find these breaking moments really important and makes the characters more fascinating.Eckhart was an interesting character, and looked like he had more fun making this movie.The wife was there to give us another reason to love Sully and shows us he has a family, but she just tags along. She makes some really stupid decisions.Tom Hanks plays a suppressed everyday hero, and it was comforting being around him and Hanks gives the character a little bit more of a personal element to Sully, but not really an emotional side, or really a heroic side. He doesn't believe in himself and never takes a second to realise he did such a great thing. Because the media is everywhere he goes assessing him, recording his every move. He never wanted this life, so he thinks he made a bad decision in a way, there are bigger reasons he thought it was a bad decision but I won't spoil anything. And by this character he plays, Hanks feels very contained in this movie, I just wanted him to change his tone, spit out his words faster. Something. But never does.There are scenes in the movie where Sully dreams up scenarios because he is, in a way, going crazy.The same dream is shown at least twice in the movie that I can remember, the exact same crashing dream and landing scene. The scene in the second act of the movie where the plane is landed on the water is shown randomly after Sully falls into a dream at a pub. Not 100% sure, but it was something like that. All I remember is that it felt really out of place, when in the third act of the movie when he listens to the audio file of the event in a court hearing, the audio recorded in the plane shows us the exact same visual scene and in a better context, it made sense for it to be there!There is really too many cuts from the past to the present to even more in the past. Once you get invested in one time period it jumps to a different one, and then when you like that time period, it jumps again. It would be a lot more convincing if it told it in a chronological order, except for the land itself. It was smart having it at the end. So the mixture of flashbacks and flash forwards in this movie didn't really work and was kind of jumbled throughout the movie. The movie lacks from the placing choices and ultimately made the rest of the flashbacks a little useless and annoying as it took us away from the personal story of Sully we were following.Although at times was entertained, mostly in the third act, the entertainment value wasn't all there. And even though I enjoyed the movie, I'm not too sure if it should have been made into a movie in the first place. It was a little hard to make a story around the material Eastwood picked, because as it said in the real life and the synopsis of the film that all passengers survived, so it's not really a heart pounding when a person starts drifting away from the plane, when Sully said at the start of the movie that everyone is living. So unless you have amnesia these scenes won't be as frightening and thrilling as it could've been.I enjoyed Sully and it had my whole family awed by the ending still days later after coming back from the cinema, in a positive way. This is a quiet movie, with good performances, with some great scenes that goes well with the soundtrack. The movie brings up questions that were intended to be unanswered. So is this movie good? Definitely. Is this movie great? Kinda. Is it a masterpiece? Not in my eyes. Too many faults and missed opportunities for me to really call it a great movie, but I enjoyed it, and I think you will too.Overall : B-",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Content is better than the movie,"Not sure I understand the positive reviews this movie gets. Or maybe I do: it rides on Eastwood's talent as a director and Hanks' talent as an actor. Yes ""Sully"" does offer some nice visuals, good directing - there is no denying Clint Eastwood is a great director. Similarly, Hanks' portrayal as Sully is good - no denying this.But this movie is far from being the best from both of them. The story ends abruptly and easily - making the whole plot seem a little shaky to begin with. And Hanks is a cool composed pilot. And that's basically it.The landing scenes are impressive and there's no denying the story of the miracle on the Hudson is worth telling...but it feels like this could have been a 30 minute documentary. Not sure the movie actually builds anything worth rewatching several times.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Dry,This film is ok I guess. Nothing to write home about honestly. The subject matter is incredible of course and massive kudos to the real life Sully.

Everything is unprecedented until it happens for the first time,"Sully also known as Sully: Miracle on the Hudson is a biographical drama film directed by Clint Eastwood. The film stars Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, and Jamey Sheridan.The film is based on the real life of Captain Chesley, a commercial pilot, who makes an emergency landing on the Hudson River after his plane gets hit by birds. However, an investigation was set up to look into the matter might prove to be fatal to his career.This is one of the wonderful film and a slightly underrated work of Tom Hanks. The film which describes the life of Captain Chesley who saved everyone despite being landing the plane into the water in chilling winter and Tom Hanks portrayed his character with utmost perfection.Tom Hanks was marvelous and was superbly supported by Aaron Eckhart and Laura Linney and both of them were outstandingly good.The screenplay of the film is very impressive and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The BGM works perfectly for the film and enhances the intensity of the film. The view of the cockpit and the landing on the water works as an icing on the cake.The climax of the film is intense but gives a perfect closure to the film. If you're into biographies or if you're a fan of Tom Hanks then this is the film for you. A must watch.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Better than expected,"I 'thought' I new the story of what happened so I wasn't eager to go and see the movie. I figured I would wait until later in the year and just watch it 'On Demand' or some other way at home. But I kept thinking it must be pretty decent with Tom Hanks starring and when I realized Clint Eastwood directed the movie, that's when I decided I had to see it in the theater. SO glad I did and if I can make a recommendation, make sure to see this in a theater that offers Widescreen if possible.Most people know about the heroic landing of the plane on the Hudson river in New York where all passengers and crew survived. But few of us, myself included, know all of the details that led up to that event happening. Nor was I aware of the questioning by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).What is also striking, is despite the heroic move by Captain Sullenberger, he is an incredibly humble man who clearly did not care for the spotlight nor the fame that came with this. It's interesting if you have ever seen the movie ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington where there is a horrific crash but the pilot minimizes the crash and everyone agrees he was the only one who could have done this. Good movie except that was fiction and in ""Sully"", this is real life and again, he is probably the only Captain who could or would have pulled off this miracle.The only fictitious thing I would say about the movie was the part when people were boarding the plane. Everyone was extraordinarily courteous to each other. People helping others with their belongings in the overhead bins. Nobody bringing on excess luggage that won't even fit in the overhead. People being patient as they go down the isle looking for their seat and everyone saying thanks, excuse me and please. There was a woman sitting in a middle seat with an extremely young toddler in her lap. Yeah, don't think that's even allowed, but the man next to her was smiling and seemed so happy to be sitting next to a woman with a young child. The boarding of the plane was a bit fantasy and I heard quite a few people in the audience chuckling at that part. But otherwise, this is a great movie and here is my 2017 Oscar nomination predictions for this movie:Best Picture Nominee - Tom Hanks, Nominated for Best Actor - Clint Eastwood, Nominated for Best Director - ""Sully"", nominated for best cinematography",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Invigoratingly Compelling Pre and Post Jet Landing Experience,9 September 2016. Director Clint Eastwood has created a compelling and refreshing look at both the mental and the physical experience of a national event of an aborted passenger jetliner takeoff and its aftermath occurring in one of the most populated place on earth. Both the director's incorporation of humanly personal touches and some wonderfully new camera shot perspectives reveal an exciting movie-going experience this heroic incident that is inspiration in its entirety.The editing and use of flashbacks to maintain the pacing and captivating questions move the storyline along at a wonderful pace. This is one of those movies where the director's keen talent is required to finesse and flesh out a written recollection by the heroic pilot himself onto the big screen. The small shots of the secondary but just as important humans involved in the rescue and personally touched by this major bird hit informs the public of a community coming together and the teamwork involved in saving the lives of both passengers and crew.Clint Eastwood offers up this singular event as in important redemptive experience of Americans in light of the tragedy and turmoil that took place in this country in the early part of the last decade of the 21st Century. This movie is a great follow up to Ralph Nelson's 1964 fictional airliner investigation thriller Fate is the Hunter or the more haunting supernatural thriller of Rodrigo Garcia's Passengers (2008) and complements the television series Air Disasters (2011) with a fuller personalized background story.,9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty accurate,"Unlike Eastwood's last movie, American Sniper, which glamorises a man who in his own biography said ""killing was fun"", Sully comes very close to how the story unfolded. Don't pay attention to anyone telling this is a ""Hollywood reimagening"". In fact, Eastwood did so much research after the criticism of his former movie, you can look at shots of the airplane in the water, and it's about identical to real life photoes. Some liberties was taken, Sully never doubted he did the right thing. But nevermind that. It's a pretty good movie, but I have one big issue. Eastwood isnt a typical technical director, and for me, Christopher Nolan would be a better choice. And the movie start to lag when the investigation goes on. Do we REALLY have to see the same scene with the plane going down twice? Anyway, Tom Hanks deliveres as always, with an excellent Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot. Good, good movie, but it could have had better pacing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tom hanks to the rescue,"A completely simple but very enjoyable story from the beginning to the end I was never bored at any time. There are many movies that are simple but most of those are of the suspense genre and this one not infrequently you can get lost with the flashbacks that it has twice I did not know if they were in the present or in the future, but of course this does not It is an inconvenience to enjoy this movie",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A well executed film but it felt limited by the source material,"The story of Captain Sully's impressive water landing on the Hudson is nothing short of remarkable, and it was all very well executed in this film adaptation.Hanks was very solid in his role as Sully. It wasn't particularly a standout performance, but I don't think the script ever really allowed him to be at his best. It was a very well measured and spot on performance, drawing us into the film and character like only Hanks can.The direction from Eastwood was very good. There were some fantastic shots, an inspired decision to opt for non-linear story telling, and a great tone that overlay the whole film. He also made the great decision to make the film no longer than it needed to be. There was very little unnecessary fat on the bones of the story. Every scene was relevant and had a distinct purpose, bringing the picture in at a crisp 90 minute runtime.The only real reason I haven't scored Sully higher is that I felt the story was always quite limited. As mentioned, it was a truly remarkable feat and the film does a great job of explaining just why, but the story didn't always have legs. There were attempts to inject tension with the proceedings that followed the 'forced water landing' (not crash), but these never felt that real or serious. In terms of the landing, the scenes were genuinely quite emotional and moving, but as its based on a real story there wasn't much jeopardy as we knew the outcome.Therefore while there is nothing particularly wrong with Sully, in fact it does a great job of capturing the moment, I just felt like it didn't have enough. Not enough to intrigue, excite, impact or move me.A good film and definitely worth watching, but always somewhat limited with the story it was telling.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Solid, if a bit clumsy, portrayal of an everyday hero. Better than Flight!","It's kind of depressing for me to witness a growing contempt in Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood. To be clear, all of it is for good reason. I personally don't care for his political views, nor do I stomach his recent, unpleasant comments on my generation. His 2012 support for Mitt Romney hasn't been more than an embarrassment. His films also haven't reached critical success for a decade and, topped with his baggage with the media, still probably won't be for a while. It's a shame that a man who once started out as an out-of-nowhere classic icon and also a well-acclaimed director will now be remembered by the new generation as ""that crazy old guy"".Even then, it's still a bummer considering that he's still capable of making great work. He has a great eye for filmmaking and an unrestrained approach to storytelling. His biggest perk is designing simple yet effective tales out of troubled historical figures. There's no ""what if"" or ""how come"" in his stories. Just the basic ""it is what it is"" style of his biopics. Some might complain that there isn't much meat to chew on as a result, but what makes Eastwood great as a storyteller lies in the trust he bestows on subjects he feels has just enough resonance on its own. Sometimes that works great (Letters from Iwo Jima) and sometimes it doesn't (J. Edgar). With Sully, which tells the story of a recent plane landing on the Hudson River by Chesley Sullenberger, he once again reaches that same template with great earnest to the now-retired hero. The result is a solid, well-intentioned, slightly clumsy, tribute to a historical figure that no man other than Eastwood can make.Now the life of Sullenberger is a fairly straightforward one. Once during a flight in Flight 1549, a major turbulence caused by out-of-nowhere birds forced Sullenberger to attempt a miraculous landing in the Hudson River. After saving everybody on the plane, he is held as an ""All American Hero"" even though he just did his job. However, the NTSB, after an investigation on the wreckage, finds evidence to suggest that he committed an irrational act and found evidence of an alternative and safer method to land the plane. But Sully, along with his co-pilot, suggest that his human instincts point to the contrary, even going as far as to deny the dozens of flight simulations against his claim. Is he right? Did he act rationally? Or does the big, bad, mean NTSB just trying to tarnish his reputation? Do you seriously need answers to all of these?Now I know a bunch of smarty pants is bound to compare this to another plane movie Flight since both films are about pilots who attempted miraculous landings and somehow gets ridiculed for it. But while Flight was an overrated, unlikeable slog where such a landing can only be achieved by an under-appreciated drunk who shoots up blow and abuses his friends, Sully takes a simple, likable explanation. He is just a man with past experience with a plane who believes in doing what he can to save as many people as possible, even if it means not landing on a runway. He has a lovable relationship with his wife and kids who gets separated thanks to a swarm of media news people. He feels that the NTSB forgets the fundamentals of human instinct so much that they wouldn't see the danger of not complying with it. The only piece of extra information we get is when Sully suffers from reasonable nightmares of the plane crashing which resulted from him not committing to the Hudson in the first place (in beautifully crafted CGI plane crashes). Though otherwise, Clint Eastwood adds little more to this story and instead focuses on a man who just simply did his job and gets the well-deserved hero status, which leads to probably his most heartwarming piece in his career so far.Sadly, that does lead to a lot of issues. The film's structure is a little all over the place for starters; Todd Komarnicki's scattershot screenplay rearranges the events rather than in order, which honestly would've been the better route. It starts with Sully after the crash, then before, then even back to his younger days, then the events at the hearing. It's a weird structure and it's made worse by the film deliberately finding ways to film the crash from multiple angles. Another issue lies in the film being too one-note in its short and sweet storytelling, in which Eastwood frames the NTSB as the bad guys who misunderstood Sully's act of heroism. It gets reasonable at first, but then once the film shifts into the ""man vs machine"" court case, it gets distracting. I expected that to be the case all along, especially from a film made by an anti-government conservative, but it's still unfortunate to see a huge sacrifice in complexity, both in narrative and in character.Huge issues aside, this is a fine surprise for me and a huge improvement for Clint after the two-punch disappointments back in 2014. Tom Hanks is still great in his otherwise straightforward role. The way the film represents an everyday hero is admirable and sentimental. The runtime is deliberately shorter so it doesn't overstay its welcome. And yes, lo and behold, Eastwood amps up the production value in this for the first time in forever, with simple camera work and impressive CGI plane sequences. In a weekend of sad recognition of 9/11, Sully deliberately arrives in the right time to remind us about that little heroic event that's bound to bring us hope in the near future. Should this be Eastwoods last film, it'd be a great closure to an impressive career.http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/2016/09/review-sully.html",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Flawless execution,"Being an aviation enthusiast I might be slightly biased, but this movie is just incredible. Plenty of spine tickling moments that make you feel like a passenger on a tremendous flight as the crew shout ""heads down, stay down"". The work done by the director, actors and everything else around them is incredible.Cockpit scenes and realism is on a level not seen before. Masterful story telling backed by gripping camera work, acting and music.Slightly dull in-between fillers using back stories which tend to be a notch boring. They still add value to the screenplay, but takes one star away from being truly flawless.Have watched it multiple times now and will likely watch a few more times.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Pretty close to exemplary,"Tom Hanks delivers a beautiful performance (again). Clint Eastwood aids and abets with his usual light touch style and the story speaks strongly for itself. It's pretty much a text book example of how to make a film without needing too much in the way of flash and bang to get the point across. My only nit-pick is that Laura Linney as Sully's wife has a ridiculously under-developed role and I don't remember her even sharing a scene with her husband - they speak on the phone for the majority of the film, it seems.",,Anonymous,Biography
Strangely unconvincing,"Tom Hanks aces his portrayal of the eponymous Captain 'Sully'. His number two isn't bad either. As for everyone else? This is where you'll lose any sense of 'reality'. There are plenty of extras in this movie, its just a shame some of them, the majority of them in fact, have no sense of what 'acting' requires. These people neither inhabit the roles they have nor seem to appreciate what it is to be in a crisis scenario. Lots of hamming and flapping all to no good effect and productive of nothing more than pantomime on film. Script is partly at fault but Eastwood's direction must also be called into question. A worthy attempt at depicting a dramatic event. Just a shame it misses the mark.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

The formal investigation by the National Transportation Board performed simulations showing Sully could have diverted and landed safety at either airport.

"A good tribute, but not Eastwood's or Hanks best work.","Clint Eastwood gives us the untold story of Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who successfully crash landed an Airbus A320 onto the Hudson River when it suffered dual engine failure from being hit by a gaggle of geese.Now some of us might expect a long, drawn out picture of what happened on that day, especially with it being from Eastwood who's known for doing films that would last much longer than the flight itself. But no, it's Eastwood's shortest film to date with a flight time of only 96mins.It's not about the passengers or the families relating to, nor is it about the flight crew or the other people involved in the rescue, however all these people are played out in the film; it's just very focused on Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and details the events after the incident. Rightly so.We know, or should know the details of the incredible emergency water landing that happened back in January 2009. Sully flying a routine US Airways flight 1549 from New York to Charlotte but lost power to both engines shortly after taking off and being at a considered low altitude. What does one do in that situation?What makes up the bulk of the story is how Sully is treated in the wake of the event by the press, the general public and most importantly coming under scrutiny from the National Transport Safety Board who, I suppose are just doing their job, but to question a seasoned pilot with 20,000hrs over a 40yr flying career who saved the lives of everyone on board hardly makes sense.There's quite a bit of turbulence in the structure of the film, jumping about with flashbacks and interviews, though this doesn't make it hard to follow, not at all. It's actually better that it's a not direct, linear film working towards the conclusion.I couldn't decide if this wanted to be a courtroom drama, because I don't think it's intended to be one. It's interesting to see the questions and emotional impact of those questions on Sully, was he a hero or did he actually endanger the lives of everyone on board.it's just a film about how ordinary people who do extraordinary things to then get questioned. He's a real life avenger made to question and doubt his actions.As expected, strong performance for Hanks and Eckhart is good as co-pilot Skiles, but everything else is a little disjointed. The re-enactment of the crash landing is impressive and is probably the stand out image piece of the film, the rest made up of script.A different and interesting score/soundtrack provided by Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band in collaboration with Eastwood, as he tends to do his own scores as well. (Mystic River being a personal fave.) It's soft, easy-listening and embellished by spiritual jazz songs. On a side note, not that it appears on the soundtrack, not suiting the film, but the song ""A Real Hero"" by College and Electric Youth was actually inspired by this event, well know for featuring on the Drive soundtrack.It's a good story and tribute to Sully, otherwise known as the miracle on the Hudson but it's missing something, maybe not aiming to be such a spectacle, but it's feels rushed, almost like a part-time film, complete but if not for flying scenes, it could be mistaken as a TV movie, certainly not either Eastwood's or Hank's best work.Running Time: 7 The Cast: 8 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 8 Creativity: 6 Soundtrack: 7 Job Description: 4 The Extra Bonus Points: 0 Would I buy the Bluray?: Possibly, not a priority buy.64% 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good film,"The film works in representing the post-traumatic stress experienced by Sully, with his insomnia and regular flashbacks of 'what might have happened) The final NTSB hearing scenes are also well-done and suitably gripping: particularly for viewers outside of the UK where we wouldn't have heard the outcome of the affair once the news cycle had moved on from the 'gee- whizz' headline event.Where the film aquaplanes somewhat is in the padding achieved through multiple scenes of New Yorkers back-slapping Sully. Some of this is needed to establish the pedestal that Sully is set upon: the bar scene, for example, is well done. But all the rest of the references become just plain tiresome.There is also a back-story focused on Sully's financial problems and rather scratchy marriage (as portrayed) to Lorraine (Laura Linney). Linney is normally a highly-watchable actress, but here her character is just so irritating that the mood of the film plummets every time she reappears on screen.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sully is a true story about the plane that crashed on the Hudson River.,"Movie Review Sully is a true story that is no words can tell how great it is. Even though the movie is hour and thirty six minutes it's still amazing. It won't be a waste of your time. It has some drama and explains what really happened during this event. Sully is about a captain named Chesley Sullenberger that landed a plane on the Hudson River. People call him Sully. Also explains what he and many people went through during this event.The movie also shows what the passengers went through. Mostly the movie is about what happened after the event. This movie stars Tom Hanks as Sully and he is probably the best actor in it. Tom Hanks brings the drama into the movie. Movies that are true stories explain the event that happened really well. This movie explains what Sully went through during this hard event. He had a ton of people talking to him that he could've made it to the airport but with all his knowledge he knew he couldn't of. The miracle of landing the plane on the Hudson happens at the very beginning. During the movie there are flashbacks and nightmares that Sully has after this event has happened. Sully and his co-pilot had to go to a hearing with the National Transportation Safety Board because they wanted to make sure there wasn't any different safer options of landing. The NTSB said from evidence from the computer simulations that they could of made it back to LaGuardia Airport. Sully disagrees.People might not like this movie because they are familiar with the event but the movie explains what Sully actually went through. Many people will love this movie because it's amazing to know that this actually happened and no one died. This is probably one of the best true story movies I have seen. Some of the best parts is probably the flashbacks and all the miracles that happen in the movie.The drama and the way they explain the event is fantastic. I didn't know a lot about this movie and at the end of the movie I was fully educated on what had happened. I recommend this movie from my perspective of the movie. Go watch the movie , it won't be a let down.",,Anonymous,Biography
Pretty okay film,"This is a fairly solid film that has, as it's centerpiece, a fairly incredible feat of aviation and an impressive rescue operation. The problem is that a feature film needs to be built around that, and you feel the film straining to pad itself out. Hanks is really good in a role that pretty much tailor made for him. Aaron Eckhart provides solid support. As always, Eastwood crafts a well-made, no-nonsense film. But the film strains to create drama out of an National Transportation Safety Board investigation that never manages to feel like anything more than people doing the job they are supposed to do. Yes, there's some evidence that maybe Sully made the wrong decision, but that's fairly easily dismissed and nobody really fights it when a reasonable argument is made. It ends up feeling like a great 15 minute short wrapped up in a mediocre film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Good depiction of heroism,"Sully features a strong performance by Tom Hanks as the Captain of a fateful US Airways flight that skirted death by a miraculous successful water landing in the Hudson River after taking off from Laguardia airport in NYC.This reminded me a bit of the fictitious movie Flight, where the pilot did something heroic, then was questioned every which way about why it happened. In this case, why could you not get back safely to an airport.We know the ending of the event, but Sully gives you a behind the scenes feeler into what happened afterwards.The weakness of the film is that there was that one point (the takeoff incident) that was the focus, nothing else. Eastwood as director tried to bring in other events in Sully's life about his love of flying, his youth, his relationship with his wife, but those added really very little to the story.I would have liked to see more info about the co-pilot, excellently played by Aaron Eckhert. That might have helped support the story better. But maybe there was no drama there to build on. Eastwood tried to build some supporting drama, but his only real focus was the crew's reaction after the poop hit the fans, literally. That left very little to excite the viewer.The film takes some swipes at bureaucracy, and the often times idiocy of people who were not there taking judgment. It's unclear if the FAA questioned ANY of the passengers who had survived, or whether they just investigated based on black box data.The flight scenes are terrifically realistic, and the heroism of the entire crew under fire was just incredible. I recommend Sully as a very good depiction of a real life event. It's a film that is worth seeing in spite of the short focus of the plot. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not a very well made life time special but as a true story based movie you can take a chance......,"The movie tells the true story of what happened January 15, 2009. It is about when Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger landed U.S. Airways flight 1549 onto the Hudson River. Many people called this ""Miracle on the Hudson"" but the maximum of them do not know what actually happened. Mr. Sully, this national hero was also being investigated for his actions on that day which put his career in peril. this movie tells the whole story of this investigation and how Mr. Sully struggled and to deal with the new found honor and the stress of post-trauma and the crash had on him and his crew.This is a Clint Eastwood movie and Tom Hanks starring the central role Sully. He portrayed the role Captain ""Sully"" Sullenberger very nicely and think he really deserves an Oscar nomination for his role. No doubt that Tom Hanks is a very talented actor and again he proves this. Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles has also done a good job. But the main hero is Tom Hanks. He acted naturally when the plane landed and his bravery was very good at the screen. He made sure all the 155 passengers were good and this sequence of the movie was very good and really worth watching. Aaron Eckhart plays co-pilot Jeff Skiles who was in the cockpit on that day and he also has done a nice job and his comedic delivery was good.Clint Eastwood's direction was OK but nothing to shout about. He has made a much better movie than this and this is not his best effort. I think the script is a little bit choppy and slow and the character development not so imposing for a true story.I am not telling this is a bad movie but if you want to spend time or money on it, you please think before investing. This is a very very good choice for DVD but in theatres may be you will not enjoy this.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sully: A Portrait of Heroism and Humanity,"Few films can achieve the delicate balance of paying homage to real-life heroes while maintaining cinematic authenticity, but Sully accomplishes this feat with finesse. Like society itself, the story wavers between celebrating triumph and scrutinizing imperfection. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's defining moment-the daring emergency landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River-has been immortalized as the ""Miracle on the Hudson."" Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks take us behind the headlines, exploring the human depth beneath the miracle.Eastwood and Hanks, both veterans of biographical storytelling, join forces for the first time in a project that feels tailor-made for their talents. Hanks, who's brought us real-life heroes in Captain Phillips and Bridge of Spies, portrays Sully with quiet dignity and emotional nuance. Eastwood, whose lens has examined complex lives in American Sniper and J. Edgar, crafts a film that captures the resilience of human nature and the weight of professional responsibility.Adapted from Sullenberger's memoir Highest Duty by Todd Komanicki, the screenplay focuses not only on the remarkable water landing but also on the psychological and professional trials that followed. The National Transportation Safety Board's investigation, depicted with stern intensity by actors like Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, and Jamey Sheridan, becomes the story's central tension. The inquiry's probing of Sully's split-second decisions turns the spotlight on his vulnerability and doubt, lending the film a relatable, human dimension.For those expecting adrenaline-pumping action, the film doesn't disappoint. The re-enactment of the plane's descent into the Hudson River is a masterclass in restrained yet gripping filmmaking. Eschewing Hollywood dramatics for stark realism, Eastwood puts viewers in the cabin, making us feel the tension, fear, and resolve of all aboard. The use of real-life first responders adds authenticity, while the icy waters and cockpit exchanges serve as chilling reminders of the stakes.Aaron Eckhart shines as co-pilot Jeff Skiles, providing support and camaraderie in a performance filled with subtle strength. Laura Linney, though limited to phone conversations as Sully's wife, imbues her role with emotional weight, representing the strain of a family under scrutiny. Flashbacks to Sully's formative years in aviation and military service add context without feeling forced, deepening our understanding of his instincts and professionalism.The film's central conflict arises from the NTSB's reliance on cold data and simulations suggesting Sully could have returned to LaGuardia. This tension underscores a broader theme: the clash between human intuition and machine calculations. Sully's calm reminder that everyone-from the pilots to the rescue teams-was simply ""doing their job"" encapsulates the story's grounded heroism.Technically, Sully is a marvel. Tom Stern's cinematography is sharp and understated, mirroring Eastwood's directorial ethos. Every frame, every line of dialogue, and every performance avoids melodrama, choosing instead to honor the reality of the event. The result is a gripping, emotional journey that celebrates the quiet heroism of professionals who rise to extraordinary challenges.The film closes on a poignant note, with footage from the flight's survivors' reunion. It's a reminder that heroism isn't about grand gestures but about enabling life to go on. Sully's story reminds us that sometimes, being extraordinary means simply doing what's right.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Intense Character Study,"Sully (2016)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Highly entertaining film from Clint Eastwood about the 2009 ""Miracle on the Hudson"" where pilot Chesley Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) had both engine's fail and in an desperate attempt had to land to plane in the Hudson River. He was quickly labeled a hero but this film explains the emotional toll that this had on him.SULLY is certainly a very entertaining movie that manages to keep you entertained throughout and it gets a lot of credit for telling a recent story that most people are going to already know about and manage to hold your attention throughout. It seems the biggest news about the film in recent months was the fact that it was shut out at the Oscars. Usually with an A-list star and director plus a box office hit, you get more attention from the Academy but even with the lack of love the film is certainly still worth seeing.The most impressive thing for me was the fact that most people were already familiar with the events here yet Eastwood managed such tight direction that you couldn't help but feel the pressure of the landing and the aftermath. I mean, everyone knows that everyone made it off the plane yet the landing sequences here are truly intense and manage to keep you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The film shows the landing several times throughout the movie and each time from a different point of view. It doesn't matter which view you're seeing it from, the intense factor is certainly there.Another major plus is that you've got such a great cast of characters doing great work. All of the minor roles are played wonderfully and the better known actors also do a terrific job. Laura Linney deserves a lot of credit for her scenes as Sully's wife. Then you've got the always underrated Aaron Eckhart who plays the co-pilot. Then there is Hanks who is obviously one of the best known actors out there. He fully sinks into this character and to the point where you see the character only and not just Tom Hanks playing a part. I was really impressed with the transformation that Hanks went through and I thought it was really spectacular here with how much emotion was here. The dark side of your fifteen-minutes of fame is something Hanks nailed.Technically speaking the film is quite impressive and there's no doubt that there's plenty of entertainment here for everyone. I wouldn't call the film flawless or great but what few flaws there are isn't going to kill anything.",,Anonymous,Biography

A forgettable retelling of an unforgettable event,"In ""Sully,"" Captain Chesley Sullenberger spends a fair amount of time musing about how his life's legacy is defined by a plane crash that took only 208 seconds. Sully's life was only noteworthy for those 208 seconds. As one might predict, it turns out that this biopic is also exciting for about 208 seconds.Sully's main focus is on Capt. Sullenburger's difficulty handling the media attention following the crash, and the investigation that the airline did into Sullenburger post-crash. If you don't remember hearing much about this investigation in the news, that's because it wasn't newsworthy. The movie makes this investigation to appear bigger than it is, and the threat of a lawsuit lasts for exactly 90 minutes of screen time, only to magically disappear as the movie is about to end. Just before the credits roll, even the villainous plaintiff lawyers seem to concede that they never really had a case against Sully anyway. This threat never seemed credible to the viewer, and it disappears in an incredibly anti-climatic way.While great biopics like Fincher's ""The Social Network"" play up real dramas in the lives of notable historical figures, ""Sully"" is a 90 minute picture about a three minute event. Luckily, Eastwood handles the crash itself pretty well, showing the viewer windows into the lives of multiple passengers on the plane, so we have people to be concerned for in the heat of the action.The movie suffers from jarring edits and needless jumping in the narrative. Sometimes we see Sully before the crash, and sometimes we see him after- the crash itself is shown about halfway through the film. Before we see the crash, there are a handful of ""gotcha!"" moments in which we see the plane almost crash inside of Sully's daydreams. The whole concept of jumping back and forth seems totally random and unnecessary. The ""gotcha!"" daydreams also only hurt the film, as they cause nothing but frustration for the viewer.This is a weak film by Eastwood's standards. Even though its runtime is a slim 1h 36m, Sully feels overlong, and that's because there's simply not much to make of the story. This is a competent enough movie, and is a better choice than some other films currently in theaters, but you shouldn't lose too much sleep if you skip this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Best reenactment of crash and aftermath,"Very well done film. This is probably the best recreation of an accident I have ever seen and with the best outcome. Plane accidents rarely end up well at all and recreating them would be a downer. Alive comes to mind but it was survival story after the crash and does not end up well for most of them. Sully is basically the story of what can happen when the best of them comes together and are in the right place to do so. A great occasion to be bright and heroic. In the dvd extras, they mention the contrast with the market crash and the greed normally prevalent in NY city, causing it. There are people that do not just want to get filthy rich quickly or screw up other people or use the system.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A better recent Eastwood, but still (typically) flawed.","Eastwood's more recent films have often left me wondering if he has been approaching, or even reached, the logical end of what has been a lengthy career. I have often considered him one of my favorite directors. While his films are sometimes and somewhat imperfect, perhaps self-indulgent, they are usually interesting, and possess a particularly unique quality.I can recall this film being criticised for it's re-showing the last few minutes of the flight. In another film this might provide greater insight, or reveal a new dimension to the event, perhaps a twist of some sort. In Sully this appears to both serve as a departure from the rather pedestrian events before and after the landing, keeping the viewer interested, and also to reinforce that this was an event that was experienced by many New Yorkers. Perhaps reinforcing to Americans that this was a significant national event. Eastwood is certainly no stranger to infecting his films with his personal ideologies, and I suspect this film yet another example of the director's politics at work. This was most apparent in the decision to depart in corny and dramatic fashion from the truth of events following the event.Such significant distortions in a film pretending to be factual and biographic should come as no surprise to viewers familiar with the liberties taken in Eastwood's other biopics, particularly American Sniper. I can only attribute these unnecessary deviations from an honest portrayal of events and characters to the favorite tricks of a beguiling, but sometimes clumsy storyteller/myth-maker, if not the direct effect of a director whose political axe requires grinding with each and every film. Be that grievance one with big government, or the crippled that can't access his restaurant, or his love affair with war heroes that are confirmed notorious bullshitters with the moral fiber a gnat.Like most of Eastwood's films this is a quality product, it is dry, but well filmed, and remains engaging. It is unfortunate that while his films appear so convincingly authoritative, and grounded within the real, they are persistently undermined by their creator's decision to be creative or dishonest regarding the characters and narrative.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"very disappointed. great story to be told, the movie told it poorly.","So if i told you i had a car accident yesterday, i would start the story from maybe 30 minutes before the accident took place. Then i would move on to what exactly happened to me during the accident and how things went on. Then i would tell you what happened after the accident took place, maybe the hour after, me in the hospital or the day after the accident and so on.This movie will tell you the story from finish to start, then back to finish. except the car is a plane. oh and some shirt of him dreaming and looking out the window. Look movies are supposed to be entertaining, this movie is not entertaining for me at all.

Beautifully crafted film,"==THIS REVIEW HERE MIGHT CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS. VIEWER DISCRETION IS THEREFOR ADVICED==If you live in the west you probably already heared of this story. Technically speaking 'some' plane make their way through a flock of birds and with both engines hit and unworking, the pilot still managed to make their landing on the river Hudson and all the passenger had been saved. However, hidden to the public eyes there was also a back-story to it. Immidiatelly after the crash there was a federal investigation going on, where investigators run simulation programs to get their point proved. The point was that the pilot could get back to the airport, without putting their passenger on danger by landing on the river. However as we see through the end of the film, the investigators used this programs in the really dirty way, the one that gets their points prooven in the way that only technically speaking is possible, but humanly speaking totally impossible. For instance will the pilot in normal situations really turns around and drive the plane back to the ""base"" the same seconds as the birds hit the engine?, as are things presented in the simulations as they ran Wouldn't he first try to run the engines and turned them on, only to realize in shock that the both engines have stopped working, and he is unable to turn them on, which is a really rare case I believe. Or wouldn't he make a call to the airport, checking that its free, for not hitting the other plane, that it's currently rising., and others..The translation of this film in my country is 'Miracle on the river Hudson', which I think is more to the point. As you watch this film you start to believe that is nothing more then a miracle. Or as Sully(Tom Hanks) puts it, when he left with his co-pilot the court, it goes something like that: ""I believe that we get it through very well. But we actually put it through better.""Clint Eastwoodis without a doubt a very respectable director and very respectable to all the characters involved. However this story also gets true to the truth as is humanly possible. There is no big bangs, no big unnecessary explosions, as long as they don't put anything to the Original story. For instance did you notice that when Sully(Tom Hanks) imagined a building hit by an airplane is the same that the women hit during running the second simulations run. You could imagine what Could happen if he listened to flight controllers and not, acted on his own, as he did.Technically speaking this is a beautiful crafted film. however I still have some negative points. Tom Hanks for instance could be in my eyes more livable. The film is also crafted with a dark and depressing tone to it, the darkness in this film is more moderated, but in my eyes could be made more livable.All in all, beautifully crafted film, which puts to the real story, answering some answers that might be risen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Not perfect, but a good drama from director Eastwood","Basically, I'm skeptical of such films. Filming of actual events, like Sully is about. The film is about Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who managed to land a plane in the Hudson River. But I gave it a shot. This is a low-key film, and the events are not made in chronological order. But this actually makes the film work better than expected. Clint Eastwood uses good actors like Tom Hanks, to tell the story from different angles. Tom Hanks manages to give Hero Sully depth and insight on several levels. Including how it is to suddenly come into focus for the whole world. I thought the film was a little unexciting the first half hour, but Eastwood manages to tell this story thoroughly. And the film picked up and I was engaged by it.

Brilliant portrayal of a potentially catastrophic event,"9 December 2016 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - Sully. It's a strange experience to write about a film based on true events, even more so when you can remember the actual event occurring in real time. The landing of US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River in New York was testament to the skill and experience of Captain Chelsey Sullenberger and his Co-pilot Jeff Skiles as he brought the bird to an almost unheard of safe, yet watery landing which saved all 155 souls on board. Immediately hailed a hero by the media and pretty much the whole of the TV watching, social media connected world, Sully's bravery and heroism was quickly brought into doubt by the NTSB enquiry which seemed to suggest that he needn't have landed on the river at all. The cast was very cleverly assembled, bringing together a group of officials who were smugly sanctimonious and utterly sure they were bringing an airline pilot to task for a sure fire mistake which had almost cost people their lives. History tells us they were wrong but the film had me wanting to put these people in their place as I was itching to shout at the screen and remind them what a hero Sully really was. A first collaboration for director Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, it was superbly shot and CGI has come on a long way enabling us to really believe the plane on our screens was hitting the water. Tom Hanks is a consummate professional, an actor who assumes the character of every role he plays with a flair you don't find in many other actors, and he brought the personality of Sully to the screen with skill and compassion which made us really believe we could read the thoughts and feel the emotions of the man he was portraying. This was one of the rare films where I didn't move in my seat until it had ended. A definite watch!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Nuts-and-Bolts Filmmaking,"Sully is based on what has popularly become known as the ""Miracle on the Hudson"". For those in need of a refresher, on January 15, 2009, flight 1549 from New York City's LaGuardia airport to Charlotte, hit a flock of birds during its ascent, losing both of its engines. Finding little recourse, pilot Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and First Officer Jeffrey Skiles made the fateful decision to make an emergency water landing. They glided their A320 Airbus into the frigid waters of the Hudson River. There were 5 serious injuries but thankfully all 155 passengers survived. Sully for his efforts was treated to a heroes welcome.Much like the protagonist, the film is a lean, workman-like movie that does it job, and does it amicably. The narrative bounces between POV recollections of the crash and the immediate aftermath which includes Sully (Hanks) and the rest of the crew shuttled between investigations and press junkets. To up the psychological stakes, Sully is coerced into second guessing himself by a National Transportation Safety Board investigation (which act as the default bad guys) all while exhibiting light symptoms of PTSD.Tom Hanks as our hero is yet again stellar playing a similar riff off the Captain Phillips (2013) playbook. At this point, the man playing personable everyday heroes has made him a movie genre onto himself. He's not so much a born madcap swashbuckler but rather a working stiff who always seems to be at the wrong place at the right time and relies on training and a breadth of experience to carry him through. As Sully, his inner turmoil as a guy more-or-less being blamed for doing the right thing, feels frightfully real.Director Clint Eastwood seems to take particular relish in conveying stories of this nature. Sully is a pulse-pounding story of a red- blooded modern American hero. One who became lionized for doing his job. Yet instead of gravitating towards the limelight, Sullenberger humbly accepted his newfound hero pilot status while quietly but assuredly backing up his decision-making. Likewise the film doesn't take victory laps or pounds its chest like some other Clint Eastwood directed film I can think of. Instead it lets the smart editing, clear and concise camera-work and nuts-and-bolts directing speak for itself.Unfortunately being a film resembling the clever terseness of Joe Friday can be a double-edged sword. Since it doesn't reach for the dramatic acme of Mystic River (2003) or the mythic majesty of Unforgiven (1992), Sully does have the propensity to feel second- rate. Additionally the NTSB board push-back, which pits the gutsy pilot against simulations, reeks less of John Henry populism and more of a veiled criticism of egg-heads and their darn computers. I suppose most films should have a villain and including Anna Gunn as the silently condescending adult in the room is a stroke of genius. But Sully's visions mixed with the largely unspoken but always present specter of 9/11 should have been enough to convey the stakes were plenty high on January 15, 2009.Sully is a taut, well made B-movie that is occasionally tense and always interesting. While it never reaches as high as it arguably should, it nevertheless makes for a fun time at the movies. The film ends with the real Captain Sully walking up to the plane fuselage which sits at the Aviation Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina. He embraces a bunch of real 1549 passengers while centered on the screen and lighted like a canonized saint. Any other true-life character I'd say Clint's laying it on a bit thick, but this time I think I'll let it slide.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Top class, as expected","Top class, as expected.'Sully' is great. Tom Hanks absolutely nails it as the titular character, he is undoubtedly the perfect cast for the role. An outstanding actor, as we all know. The plot is told in a way that I personally enjoyed, I liked seeing the different snippets of time.Though no-one is on the same level as Hanks in this, there are a few other good performers. Aaron Eckhart (Jeff) does well, while there are less important roles for people like Anna Gunn (Elizabeth) and Michael Rapaport (Pete). I have no issues with the casting, that's for sure.It's a crazy true story, mad that it happened way back in 2009 - feels more recent, strangely. I assume it uses the usual creative license that practically every film does, which I'm fine with. It delivers as a quality film, which is all I truly care about.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the best this year.... Must Watch!!,"I felt it more of a documentary than a movie. But either way, Sully is a MUST WATCH. Arguably, one of the best movies this year. Story - little different than expected; Tom Hanks - top notch and impeccable; Direction - great.Story (9/10): The story is multi-faceted. Contrary to the expectations, Sully is more about the post mortem (post-incident investigation) of the Hudson tragedy and the emotions of the pilot, Captain Chesley Sullenberger - nicknamed Sully, on whose shoulders, lives of 155 people, including him, aboard the US Airways flight hanged in balance for the fateful 280 seconds. As sub-plots, it also covered stories of some of the passengers and the people involved in the rescue. The theme of the movie was very different from what I thought and that's what I loved about it. It narrated the perspective of the pilot on why he did what he did (landing into Hudson river) and his thoughts for those couple of minutes. The story also delves into Sully's life - his teens, youth, his family. Overall, the story carefully avoided the obvious and talked about the things most people wouldn't know about - and that's what makes it very interesting.Screenplay (10/10): This is the first time I am sectioning out Screenplay separately in my review because this movie deserved it. Some of the dialogs left a lasting impression - especially the reporter putting out a big IF around the decision to land the plane on Hudson (which was the essence of the movie), or the wife of Sully realizing he was a part of that 155 endangered lives in that fateful flight. Some of Sully's dialogs to the investigators, which had a hint of sarcasm, were brilliant. Also, Sully's conversation with Skiles outside the investigation room which portrayed his leadership skills was highly inspirational.Acting (8/10): I don't think anybody could have played this role better than Tom Hanks. His expressions and dialog delivery perfectly fit the demands of the character of an immensely experienced and an honest pilot. Besides him, Aaron Eckhart - playing the role of the first officer, assisting the captain - is impressive. Although I felt he was largely overshadowed by Tom Hanks and barely managed to make his presence felt. The rest of the cast had a very small screen time to make any presence felt.Direction (9/10): Clint Eastwood did a great job in keeping this movie very crisp. The idea of narrating the entire incident in pieces was great. More importantly, it was blended very well with the flow of the movie and never felt disruptive. What I also loved was his coverage of multiple sub-plots in a short time of 96 minutes while giving perfect justice to the main plot. However, he probably underutilized Aaron Eckhart or his character - which was equally involved in the entire incident.Overall (9/10): I loved the movie, or documentary if I may say. A great watch - though low on entertainment value - but still a high-quality cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brace For A Slight Impact.,"What can you say about a mild-mannered elderly pilot who in 128 seconds diagnosed the problem with his US Airways passenger jet, reviewed his options, and chose the only one available which, despite the dangers, was overcome by the mild-mannered elderly pilot's skill as a flier? Not a hell of a lot.You need to build a full-length feature film around a few minutes of extreme stress and ultimate catharsis. Captain Sullenberger was a hero who ditched his huge airplane in the middle of the Hudson River with none of his 153 passengers suffering more than a scratch or two. That was January of 2009, which prompts me to observe that time is beginning to fly almost as fast as an L-1011 these days.But how do you fill up the movie? In classical narratives you require a protagonist who's trying to accomplish something and an antagonist who's trying to stop him from getting it done, but there's nothing like that in Sully's story. Everyone did was he was supposed to do -- not just the captain but the co-pilot, the flight attendants, the passengers, and the first and second responders. Given the circumstances -- the loss of power over both engines because of a bird strike -- it could hardly have turned out better.In such circumstances you need to provide the audience with enough information to infer the non-existent antagonist. In this case, the targets were easy: the ""suits."" That would be the National Transportation Safety Board and the insurance companies who stand to lose a great deal of money. So the modest and unassuming Sully must be called before a board of inquiry that looks exactly like the setting of an appellate courtroom. The judges sit up there at the long bench, full of evidence, pomposity, cynicism, and authority, while looking down at Sully and the other prisoners, I mean witnesses, below. The judges aren't chosen for their beauty either. They frown a lot and use tones of voice that are ripe with innuendo.Does Sully come through this and all the stresses associated with celebrity victorious -- in one piece? Are you kidding? If he hadn't, there would be no movie. So the film fakes its heavies. It also lacks sufficient technical detail so that the audience can't follow with any accuracy just what it is that Sully and his first officer are doing during the emergency.The procedures aren't that complicated. The emergencies described in a TV series like ""Mayday"" (""Air Crash"") are laid out so that even a non-techie can follow them flawlessly. But that would require a narrator, and this isn't a story about technology. It's a story about one man -- Captain Chesley Sullenberger and his behavior under stress. The other characters, his first officer and even his wife, Laura Linney, are strictly ancillary. It's a character study and it's well played.On the surface it doesn't give star Tom Hanks much to do because Sully was quiet and always controlled. But there's the challenge. Hanks has to convey emotions with the slightest changes of his facial expressions, a slight squint, a barely perceptible smile, the blankness of a focused attention. As for his voice it never changes except for a few second while the airplane is gliding earthward, or rather waterward, and he has to speak to the Air Traffic Controllers because a shortage of time demands it.There's nothing spectacular about the film. The CGIs are modest. Nobody shrieks with anger or with terror. Everyone is respectful and polite. Hardly anyone sobs. And nobody's head gets wrenched out of its socket. Even the suits, sitting up there in all their grandeur, come around at the end and freely, apologetically, admit that Sully did exactly the right thing under existing conditions.He really DID too. The Airbus A-320 that he was flying was definitely not built with the prospect of a ditching in mind. The airplane has two big jet engines, one hanging low under each wing. The object in landing on water is to keep the airplane as level as possible because if it touches tail down, the nose will pitch forward forcefully and the stop will be abrupt and destructive. And of course if the pilot lands nose down, he's humped. But a smooth, level landing on water us almost impossible with two huge objects hanging from the wings. If the airplane isn't kept almost exactly level, one engine with catch the water sooner than the other, the airplane will spin around in the direction of the lowest engine and possibly disintegrate. Sully was lucky he was over the smooth Hudson River and not the open sea.Clint Eastwood has chosen to show the emergency landing in several disjointed flashbacks but we never lose track of events or of where we are. Sully is a very intelligent man, a highly skilled pilot and deserves his celebrity, however much he may or may not have wanted it. Generally, a nice job, a full-length film built around a few minutes of extreme danger that doesn't lose the viewer's interest.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Oscar Worthy,"I would like to cast my vote for best picture, best director and best actor. Sully. While it includes the details of the actual event in great detail the story mainly focuses on what transpired after the incredible water landing on the Hudson.

Tom Hanks portrayal of Sully is nothing short of amazing. One of his best performances that I've seen in years. I also happen to think that his overlooked performance in ""Bridge of Spy's"" was nothing short of a travesty. The direction of Sully is suburb. Clint Eastwood blends the actual events, flashbacks into Sully's earlier days and the aftermath into a seamless heroic tale. I highly recommend this movie. The world is short on hero's these days. Sully is one heroic story.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A story stuck in a holding pattern,"Sully is an inspiring movie about a real American hero. However, for the majority of the time, this film feels like it's in a holding pattern (pun intended). It circles around the same plot points with no real sense of progress until the end. Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Aaron Eckhart's mustache and the rest of the supporting cast all give strong performances, though, and the scenes with the crash are pretty powerful. It was easy for me to like this movie, but I didn't love it.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Dramatic but informative,"Today I saw Sully and it was such a great movie. The intensity of the plane crash in the Hudson and Captain Sully's story was very interesting. Clint Eastwood did a great job directing and the cast were good at portraying the roles. Yet, I did notice an editing issue. In the scene where Captain Sully is running through Times Square, he passes by a poster that shows the Broadway show, ""Aladdin"", directed by Casey Nicholaw, which came out in 2014. The movie takes place in January of 2009. Tom Hanks did a very good job and was on point with his character. I also find it interesting how in the movie, actual people who were in the crash were in the movie. Overall, I would definitely recommend the movie to people who are into biographies / documentaries.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Solid movie and nice execution, but wrong story","Beautiful job by everyone. It's a great real life story, I just wished they hadn't fixed the story to something that really didn't happen, which was the treatment of Sully by the airlines. That was added for dramatic purposes and not needed. Also it was a bit repetitive. They didn't need to show the crash 4 or more times. Once would have been enough and they should have focused more on the relationships, especially the Sully and his wife which was reduced to phone calls. And Jeff and Sully, they should have added how they met and didn't know each other.Also, the ending meeting was too much Hollywood drama and some bad acting/direction. They spent too little time on the passengers/flight attendants. A few moments here and there isn't enough to care for them.Having said that it's worth the watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Well done!,"Going into this I was a skeptic. How do you make a movie about something that was in the news for days and days? Something that everyone feels they could repeat from start to finish due to all the exposure? And how would you hold people's interest when we all know how it ends and possibly all the details? This movie accomplished all in a mesmerizing, edge-of-the-seat delivery. I didn't go with enthusiasm but because my husband wanted to see it. ""Sully"" uses flashbacks as a person does when mulling over something from the past. The pilot examines what happened, what he and his co-pilot did, and raises the question as to whether anything was missed. I can't criticize the way ""Sully"" was staged but find it close to flawless. It was as close to the actual experience as one can get. Even the scene involving the NTSB, something that might come off as dull, was not. You know this movie is moving toward a frightening, inevitable, event. This kind of thing anyone who flies, openly, or secretly, fears. There was something a little cathartic in taking the dive from the sky. I can't say whether everyone would feel that way but it satisfied my curiosity. I wasn't there but...close enough! Tom Hanks and his co-pilot, Aaron Eckhart, bring this story to life again in the best way. It also made me aware of how much experience plus instinct the real Sully had, and used, to bring about a happy ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
everything's good about it except for its reason for being (as a movie),"So here's the deal: in the English classes I teach, I like to bring up the Rhetorical Triangle, which was originally by Aristotle or one of those Greek fellas, and what this consists of are three things in any decent piece, fiction or otherwise that is meant to convince us of its worth (obviously): Logos, Pathos and Ethos. Logos is the use of logic, facts, or truth; Pathos is the appeal to a reader or just an audience's emotions; Ethos is the speaker or writer's character, credibility, and authority.I thought of this when I was walking out at the end of Sully, the new film by the 86 years old(ass) block of American grit known as Clint Eastwood and starring Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as the pilots who landed the plane without any loss of life in the Hudson river in January 2009. Surely the film has the logos and ethos down - it doesn't fudge any facts (far as I or most can tell), and it's made by a filmmaker who has gone around the block already when it comes to depicting figures who may be called heroes but they simply (in that Howard Hawks tradition) see themselves as professionals (think of the soldiers from Flags of Our Fathers or American Sniper, the former made for dull viewing, the latter more engaging but troubling at times). But the pathos? I'm not so sure.Sully was a man who was and remains beyond reproach: he *did* do his job and did it well, and despite the doubt that may be planted to the flight committee/board who are investigating the landing in the river (basically the closest this movie has to antagonists), where's the conflict? There may be some interior struggle I may have missed, but in such a short run time I'm not so sure Eastwood and the screenwriters leave much room for any troubling character signs or things that can put this story in flux (especially as it's one that is relatively recent and more in the public eye than Chris Kyle even was by comparison). This isn't to say that from that ethos/logos perspective the filmmakers and cast don't do their job - this may be one of Eastwood's better directed films in a while, and Hanks and Eckhart (mostly Hanks as it's his guy at the top of the bill) so as good as they can in portraying these men.But, and it's not too small a but, what else is there to this story? If one thinks back to two of the intense films that involve plane crashes from the past ten years, United 93 and Flight, they each had a) something that was intensely significant that made it a story worth telling and utilized pathos to the Nth degree, or b) gave us a character (Denzel in Flight) who was troubled and flawed and made it a little more difficult to see the story as black and white. Sully doesn't dance too far into the gray areas, and it's not really because Eastwood or his filmmaking team avoided them. They're just not there to begin with: a plane had a major problem, the pilots were both professional *and* human in their duties (the one interesting factor to me is that), and then there was an investigation. Oh, and Sully's wife or girlfriend (Laura Linney) had trouble selling their other property or something. Shrug.In other words, aside from the centerpiece of the film, where we see the crash happen from the perspectives of the pilots, the passengers (including three who were separated due to arriving at the last moment to the gate), the attendants, the airline traffic controllers, the coast guard, and which is an incredible piece of filmmaking and performance unto itself, there is not too much 'there' there emotionally speaking. That may be part of the point, that this was a case that showed the best in people and the fact that no one died was something of a miraculous event. Is that enough to make it worth rushing out immediately to plunk down the how many dollars it costs to see it in a theater? I'm not totally convinced.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Brace for impact,"Chesley Sully Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) get into difficulties with their aircraft shortly after take-off when a flock of birds fly head on at the aircraft resulting in damage to both engines. Sully makes the difficult decision to land the plane on the Hudson river as he does not believe that he will make it back to the airport (despite air traffic control advising him to head back to LaGuardia). Sully is branded a hero for his actions by the public, but his superiors don't see things this way and begin trying to build a case against Sully...I remember hearing about this case on the news but was shocked that it happened as long ago as 2009 - I thought it happened more recently than that. My how time flies (no pun intended). On that basis and due to what little knowledge I had of the incident, I did find Sully to be interesting and fairly informative and it was also nicely balanced with enough exposition to get a reasonable understanding of the events and the aftermath (without ever getting boring) and it also had a few sequences showing the plane getting into difficulties which made it quite nervy and tense at times. These things serve the film well and make it worth watching, but for me despite these big positives I just felt as though something was missing..Whilst it is informative and tense, the film is also quite cold and the film never seems to do much to draw me into Sully and Skiles' world; considering how often the word 'human' is used I couldn't help but feel that rather ironically the film lacked something in the way of a 'human' touch. Sully and Skiles aren't given much development and at no point do we seem to get any insight or understanding of how they are feeling or what thoughts are going through their heads?? This meant that the film lacked a bit of depth and felt a bit superficial at times. The film also clumsily throws in a scene where Sully and Skiles are both appearing on David Letterman which not only served no real purpose but it also felt oddly out of sink with the rest of the film. The same could be said for the scenes showing Sully in his early days as a pilot which added very little to the story and seemed to only exist as filler.Despite some weaknesses, Sully is still worth watching as it has an interesting story and at just a shade over 90 minutes long it gets the job done fairly painlessly. For me though its cold delivery and the rather poor character development offered up here prevents it from being as great as it could have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

"A very well executed movie, high quality product","Clint Eastwood comes back to our screens two years after American Sniper to tell us another American story. This time is the true story of the US Airways flight 1549, which, on February 15, 2009, was forced to land in the Hudson River after hitting several birds in the act of taking off from New York's LaGuardia Airport.The movie is centered on the figure of the captain, Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, the hero that saved everyone on that plane by taking the decision and then executing a bold water landing. In the movie, we go through the investigation of the accident and the struggles that captain Sully faced during that period. The hero is then haunted by doubts about himself and by the perspective of losing his pension after 40 years of service.Telling a true story on screen is always tricky, but Sully delivers with power every emotion, overcoming the fact that the viewer already knows the outcome of the story. I've enjoyed the movie, I felt a wide spectrum of emotions and it feels authentic. The actors are amazing and very well directed, the dialogues are powerful, and Aaron Eckhart should be forced to keep that glorious mustache till the end of time. Moreover, the narration of the events is very well designed, not giving us the scenes of big visual impact right away, but rather delivered, one bit at a time, in different moments of the movie.The only flaw of the movie itself is a piece of dialogue that gave my nerves. It appears to me that the old Clint wants to remind the viewers that something else about planes crashing on New York happened in the recent past. Therefore, starting from the very first scene, we find images of how worse that accident could have been. At first, I tolerated the choice, since it is fitting with a PSTD of the pilot. Moreover, it could be the way of the director to say ""everyone will think about 9/11 anyway, just ride the elephant in the room"" (although I'm not sure about the first part and we will never know now). I ran out of tolerance when the issue was explicitly addressed with a phrase like ""It has been a while since New York had good news, especially involving planes"" (not a literal transposition). I found it inappropriate and it doesn't fit well in the movie.Besides that, it is a very well executed movie, I fully recommend it because it is a good way to spend a couple of hours.At last, I would like to address a message that the movie made me feel and to which I disagree with. The method used to represent the investigation, as well as the people whose duty is to establish what went wrong and who is responsible, made me take a stand against the investigation itself. This is simply a wrong message to deliver. In such accidents, the investigation is mandatory because you have also to decide if giving or not to the pilot (or the plane) the responsibilities for other human lives. It is true that the struggle and the self-analysis of the main character are saying that he trust the necessity of such investigation. However, from the choice of the actors (that always interpret annoying characters) to the dialogues, the feeling is that the investigators are the bad guys. I think this is simply the wrong message and I don't think that an expert director like Clint Eastwood did that by accident.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Believe in yourself,"... even if no one else does.Retells the events of 2009, where Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger landed an airplane with 155 people on the Hudson river. The story focuses on the happenings after the incident, and the investigations whether the pilot did the right or the wrong decision, to potentially endanger the lives of 155 people.This is a very well made movie. Storywise this quite masterpiece by Clint Eastwood seems very similar to Robert Zemecki's 'Flight'. But in truth, they are as far apart as possible. The story built-up with the flashbacks mixing with the investigations are superb. Tom Hanks is Oscar-worthy (as always), the flight scenes are unspectactular and realistic, what moves the viewer are the emotions underneath.But all this is unimportant, this is not another well-crafted action drama but a masterpiece with underlying message as powerful as it is subtle. And I think it was this subtlety that made Eastwood direct this film, not the superficial heroism.If you ever find yourself in a situation, where everyone criticizes you for what felt like is the best thing you can do, and all of a sudden what was right seems to be wrong, and you start doubting yourself. The movie's message is: Don't.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
There are better documentaries than this movie,"That was a remarkable event with happy ending thankfully to professionalism of captain Sullenberger. It was a joy for the whole world, no doubt. He is a true hero.But the movie was too concentrated on investigation of this incident and it was a bit boring.In fact, there was no need in this movie because you can easily find great documentaries on youtube about this event and they are made as interesting dramatization with interviews of all participants (the crew, the passengers and their families waiting for them on ground). Or how the captain and some passengers later met at museum near the aircraft when it was repaired and put on excibition.However, this movie gave a good visualization from cockpit's view how they flew over the bridge and how dangerous it was. Also, for those who are interested in investigation it can give some interesting details i.e. why Captain's decision was right, but again - you can find another documentary or read about this elsewhere. Because this movie is a mix of documentary-like and drama-like style and I think it should be made in drama style only.",,Anonymous,Biography

This is probably one of the best films of the year with a screen play that is magnificent and the cast couldn't have been better.

He had watched this before but was willing to watch with me as I hadn't. It was quite a touching true story of Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, played here by Tom Hanks. The drama took its time in telling how the plane ended up where it ended up and why he was being investigated despite being called a hero because none of the passengers suffered badly during the crisis. Clint Eastwood did a good directing job, as usual. Going back and forth during some sequences, I managed to not be confused at all while watching which is a good sign of a fine drama based on something that actually happened.

Risk vs.Reward,"While many viewers are familiar with the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", few know about the inquiry conducted by the Federal Aviation Administration which challenged the decision Capt. ""Sully"" Sullenberger made when he chose to land US Airways 1549 in the Hudson river. These administrators insisted that Capt. Sullenberger could have landed his disabled aircraft safely back at LaGuardia simply because their computer simulations using the same flight data parameters showed it could be done. But at what risk? When a plane crashes in a simulator, the screen freezes but as Capt. Sullenberger realized, a real life plane crash in densely populated New York city would end in a huge ball of fire and the loss of every passenger on board. Tom Hanks' portrayal as ""Sully"" Sullenberger was unquestionably one of his best performances and Aaron Eckhart was equally up to the task as co-pilot Jeff Skiles. Clint Eastwood did outstanding work as the film's director but also deserves recognition for adding another historical moment into the American film industry archives. I rate this film as a solid 9.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sully,"Since around the year 2000, I've adopted a rule to see any film Clint Eastwood has been involved with, and largely that is a rule that has proved fruitful. Sully, the 2016 film directed by Eastwood, was another shining example of the mastery of Eastwood behind the lens. Starring Tom Hanks in the titular role, along with Aaron Eckhart as the co- pilot no one knows, Sully tells the story of the miraculous landing of a US Airways flight on the Hudson River in 2009. Audiences everywhere remember that fateful day, and can recall being captivated by the newsreel footage that overtook American TV screens; what we didn't know, however, was the tumult Captain Sullenberger endured with the National Transportation Safety Board. Exposing this untold aspect of the story, and delving deeper into the psyche of the veteran pilot after his difficult landing, makes Sully a film not to be missed.Thursday, January 15th, 2009, is a day that started off like any other workday for Captain Chesley Sullenberger (Sully) (Tom Hanks) the 42-year veteran pilot. After settling into the cockpit for another flight, Sully performs all of his pre-flight checklist with first officer, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). When all systems are go, Sully and the crew take off with 155 total people on board the plane. Moments after takeoff, a flight of Canadian geese fly straight towards the plane disabling both engines. As everything begins to fail, Sully makes the decision to reroute back to LaGuardia where the plane departed from. When the plane loses thrust and altitude at an alarming rate, Sully decides they will not be able to make it back to the airport, and is now faced with how to execute an emergency landing and save as many people on board as he possibly can. The only option that seems available to Sully is to attempt a landing on the Hudson River. An unprecedented water landing is, by no means, an easy undertaking, especially on a frigid 20-degree day. Sully did the unthinkable, not only successfully landing the aircraft, but doing so with no loss of life. Remaining on board until the last possible moment, making sure all passengers were off the plane, then taking the flight manifest with him to be able to account for all the passengers, Sully acted as a true captain to every soul who happened to board U.S. Airways flight 1549. That's the part of the story the audience knows, what we didn't know was the tumult Sullenberger went through with the National Transportation Safety Board, who was dealing with the insurance fallout following such an emergency landing. The ensuing investigation threatened to ruin Sullenberger's career and his burgeoning aviation safety consulting business. The investigation threatened Sully's lifework, and pension, all while being touted as a national hero. Sullenberger fought for his livelihood while dealing with the debilitating fallout of the traumatic experience he endured. It is easy to think about the passengers onboard the flight and the harrowing experience they went through, but it is easy to forget that Captain Sullenberger went through the same traumatic experience, with the added stress of being responsible for every life on board, as well. An amazing insight to the man who captivated a nation, Sully is sure to gain some Oscar buzz, and one not to be missed.Clint Eastwood attempts the incredibly difficult task of taking a story that everyone knows and telling it in a captivating way. Eastwood definitely achieves this feat, as the audience is on the edge of their seat, even though they already know the outcome of the story. Eastwood, choosing to inject the following NTSB investigation into Captain Sullenberger's actions was a stroke of brilliance, allowing the audience to become engrossed and possibly enraged with another aspect of his heroic story, that we may not otherwise have known. I am no fan of Tom Hanks, I actually prefer to only watch him in a movie if I can forget that he is the actor I am watching on screen; that being said, Tom Hanks was perfect for the role of Captain Sullenberger. He embodies the extremely focused, almost militant Sullenberger in a fantastic way. Aaron Eckhart was also a brilliant selection for the strong supporting role of the first officer who was a necessity to Sullenberger's unprecedented landing. Sound acting choices and the brilliance of Clint Eastwood behind the camera create a wonderful story of one man's heroic feat that gave New York some much needed plane-related good news.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Twizard Rating: 98,"I was initially wondering how they would make a 30 minute event into a full-length feature. But then I remember, this is Hollywood--they can do whatever they want.Sully is based on the true story of 2009's ""Miracle on the Hudson"" where Captain Chesley Sullenberger had to safely land a plane after a flock of geese flew into both engines, causing them to fail.The event was traumatic enough, but this film mostly details the airline investigation following the incident. Director Clint Eastwood wisely circles the narrative around, sprinkling the action amidst the drama, keeping the pacing up and saving us from having to experience a long, uninterrupted National Transportation Safety Board hearing.Throughout the film, Sullenberger is seen interacting with his wife, played by Laura Linney, on the phone. It's an interesting choice not to have them face to face in person. I've struggled to find a good reason why. Perhaps keeping them apart is to emphasize the film's ""delay is better than disaster"" theme. Or maybe it's to distance Sully from his family and show how he just longs to be home, creating irony around how he was nearly never to be home again. Or it might just be an interesting quirk that Eastwood decided to include. Whatever it is, it's unique and adds to the film's appeal.Perhaps the only thing that's distracting, though, is Linney's acting. It might seem like it's good on the surface. She shows a lot of emotion, yet is strong when she needs to be, but her delivery is just so off much of the time. It's not believable. It feels like she knows she's acting and is trying her best to sell it. Maybe it's because she was acting into a phone the whole time.But that's a minor setback. The film is uplifting, just like the 2009 event itself. It gives us a glimpse inside the mind of an American hero. A normal, everyman who lifted our country's spirits during a time when we really needed it. The film doesn't ruffle any feathers. Nor does it ever really make you ever second-guess our protagonist--which is for the best, I think, in this situation. But it takes what it has and does its very best turning the material into one heck of an ode to a memorable person and event of the early 21st century.Twizard Rating: 98",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Real Crash and Burn of a Film,"I paid $6.50 to watch ""Sully"" in a theater on this drizzly day, and think I would have been better off spending nothing and standing out in the drizzle instead.Sully came highly recommended, and most of the people in the theater seemed to enjoy it, but I found the simplified storyline unnecessarily manipulative and boring. Sully is a typical Clint Eastwood directed blockbuster that pits a purely heroic pilot (Tom Hanks) against the completely villainous investigators of the NTSB. Eastwood has again shown himself incapable of nuance, and unable to tell a story without lazily resorting to a binary narrative of absolute good and evil. Maybe American audiences crave simplistic black and white stories (as indicated by the box-office success of Sully), but I'd rather spend my time with complex stories and characters, even if the grand narrative is one of hero vs. villain.I'm certain there is a good tale to be told about the ditching of the USAir flight. In this case it looks like Tom Hanks did the best he could with a weak script, but Mr. Eastwood's directing made sure that Sully wouldn't rise above the level of a made for TV Movie of the Week.

An Extraordinary Film!,"Based on the autobiography Highest Duty by Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow, 'Sully' is a moving, inspiring & feel-good biopic, about a man who saved lives & remained courageous in a near-impossible task. Hollywood Legends Clint Eastwood & Tom Hanks team up for a story so heroic, that's also so heroically told you, its hard not to be mesmerized by it.'Sully' Synopsis: The story of Chesley Sullenberger, who became a hero after gliding his plane along the water in the Hudson River, saving all of the airplane flights 155 crew and passengers.Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger took a drastic decision, that eventually led to one of the most courageous & successful missions in the world of aviation. But, 'Sully', moves back and forth from the incident, and delves deeper into Sully's psychological & physical journey, once after the moment was over. It explores the side when his life is invaded by reporters and investigators, who force Sully to put his job, family, and reputation on the line. 'Sully' is a human-drama, treated with a tense touch. Also, the nerve-wracking airplane mission on the Hudson River, is repeated many times, but from different perspectives. Its first shown as a nightmare following Sully, and later, seen from the moment the birds hit the engines, and then from the some of the passengers & finally on how Sully & First Officer Jeffery Skiles, achieved the near-impossible. And not for once, does it feel repetitive, in fact, the narrative digs deeper into that day & offers a wholesome view. Even the sequences where Sully & Skiies are questioned by the investigators, are engrossing. In short, 'Sully' works from start to finish.Todd Komarnicki's Adapted Screenplay is Top-Notch. The Writing is super-strong & delivers Sully's heroic story, with genuine drama & affecting human-conflict. There is not a single dull moment in the film & although there isn't much to think of the story behind a few instances, the Writer keeps the narrative straight to the point & razor-crisp. And Director Clint Eastwood is at top of his game! The Legend handles 'Sully' with detail & passion. He's bought out the best from its terrific cast & also allows his crew to soar, in every department. 'Sully' is amongst his most accomplished works to date!Tom Stern's Cinematography is excellent. The entire airplane incident (Shot in IMAX), is brilliantly shot & executed. Even otherwise, Stern's Camera-Work extracts the core emotions of its characters, at all times. Blu Murray's Editing is superb, as 'Sully' runs for a crisp 96-minutes. Art & Production Design are flawless. Christian Jacob & The Tierney Sutton Ban's Score is good.Performance-Wise: Tom Hanks Soars as 'Sully'. Hanks delivers a masterclass in subtlety, offering a personal & compelling performance of a man, who is haunted by something, he didn't let go horribly wrong. He plays 'Sully' with a beating heart! Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, is fantastic. Its such a joy to see this talented, underrated actor in such great form. Hanks & Eckhart share an infectious on-screen camaraderie & are the backbone of this solid film. Laura Linney as Lorraine, Sully's wife, is restrained. Anna Gunn as Dr. Elizabeth Davis, is brilliant. Others lend fair support.On the whole, 'Sully' is a Triumph! Don't Miss It.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Clint Eastwood does it again,"This film tells the story of how Captain Sully and his first officer landed a plane on the Hudson River in a cold winter day a few years ago, and the subsequent the aftermath of that attempts to fault his heroic effort.""Sully"" wastes no time at all, and cuts right to the chase from the first second of the film. The slightly non-chronological order does not affect the story, as most people would have already heard what happened on the news. I find the story very engaging, and I really feel for Captain Sully. He acts honourably and makes critical decisions decisively, saving all people on board the aircraft. Yet, the subsequent investigation is so unfair, without any consideration of his past accomplishments and without respect. The undue pressure from the unnecessary fault finding exercise simply puts professionals off their work. I can relate to his predicament, that he has to fight for justice and his honour just because something goes wrong beyond his control.

An entertaining watch from Eastwood and Hanks,"Much like with his last film, American Sniper, Eastwood is trying to portray the everyman. However, Sully is no Chris Kyle. He's someone who doesn't hunt for danger but rather an ordinary man who found himself in the worst of situations, that made him have 155 people's lives in his hand. Half the film is dedicated to the actual ""Miracle on the Hudson"" and the other half documents the media representation and the inquiry from the National Safety Transportation Board.As always, Eastwood gets the best out of his performers. Tom Hanks is brilliant as always, both calm but also engaging in his delivery (his final speech. There's very few actors who can portray people like this but Hanks is one of them. Its a welcome return for the actor after the godawful Inferno. The other standout is Aaron Eckhart as Sully's first officer who delivers most of the comedic relief Some of the supporting characters I did feel were not developed enough fully such as Sully' wife (Laura Linney) who seem slightly shoved in, without a lot of depth to be had to them. But as a film called Sully, is there much more that needs to be added to any of the other characters when the film needs to dedicate time to its title character.The movie is a very short sit at just 90 minutes long, which some may feel is too brief but I think it works in the film's benefit. Primarily, a story like this could've dragged on too long but Eastwood keeps it concise and interesting The film's biggest flaw is perhaps through its editing. I almost think the film would've worked better as a traditional, chronological narrative rather than focusing on flashbacks. Some scenes also feel slightly out of place, especially the ones that focus on Sully's younger, flying days. The movie is not something I would sit through again, perhaps as there's not much to be rediscovered but it does deliver an interesting and engaging enough story to make it worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A remarkable movie about a real-life hero.,"Sully is a biopic about, pilot Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger(Tom Hanks). Sully & his First Officer Jeff Skiles(Aaron Eckhart) have no choice but, to land US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson river. This is due to a dual engine failure. Despite all of this, Captain Sully & First Officer Skiles saved the lives of all 155 passengers on-board the aircraft. This is due to Sully's last-minute unorthodox decision, to land the aircraft on the Hudson river. However, the aviation authorities question his decision.Sully is a sensational film. Clint Eastwood has directed yet another masterpiece, after American Sniper(2014). The most fascinating aspect of this movie is that, it is based on a true story. The visual effects department has flawlessly depicted, how Captain Sully & First Officer Skiles made a successful emergency landing on the Hudson river. The fact that they shot several scenes at the actual locations, definitely solidifies the authenticity of the film. The background score by Christian Jacob & Tierney Sutton Band is subtle yet memorable. The performances are the highlight of the film. Tom Hanks steals the show as Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. Hanks portrays Sully's subtle change in emotions throughout the movie, effortlessly. Aaron Eckhart is fantastic as Jeff Skiles. Eckhart adds a little bit of much needed wit to the film. Laura Linney is spectacular as Lorraine Sullenberger. Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan & Anna Gunn are great as Charles Porter, Ben Edwards & Elizabeth Davis, respectively. The actors that played the passengers & crew of Flight 1539, are brilliant as well. Sully is a feel-good film. Go for it, immediately!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The story of the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" is interestingly recreated with grace in Sully","People often forget that when their riding an airplane (specifically, a commercial airliner), their sitting on top of a major carrier of fuel that it were to crash, would likely explode. This shouldn't discourage people from flying as such a profession requires finding everything that could go wrong and making sure nothing can happen. Aside from terrorists that have tragically used them as weapons, most plane crashes tend to be mechanical. Engineers before the takeoff can find most of these glitches. In the case of something going wrong in the air, most planes can simply head back to their original airport and try to land at a nearby one.If all of the above is available, then the people on the plane better hope that the pilot can find a place to land. Though these things rarely happen, most of these forced landings or crashes tend to end badly. Though there is the occasional miracle.In 2009, a US Airways plane was forced to make a water landing when their engine was struck by birds. Not only did the plane land alright, but Captain Chesley Sullenberger managed to save everyone on board. The story of that crash and the aftermath are the subject of Sully.As history is recreated, we see Captain Chesley Sullenberger (played by Tom Hanks) and his first Officer Jeffrey Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) getting ready to depart from LaGuardia Airport to Charlotte, North Carolina. For Sully, this is just another routine flight in his thirty years of flying experience. He's discussed retirement soon so that he can spend more time with his wife Lorraine (played by Laura Linney) and his two daughters. Just as his flight is ascending, both engines are struck by a flock of birds, rendering them broken with the plane unable to restart them.He makes the decision to water land after deciding that trying to get back to LaGuardia or another airport was not doable. Though the crew and passengers are frightened, Sully manages to get them all out safely. Sully is seen as a hero by the press and get's several bookings to talk about it from Katie Couric to David Lettermen. Though suffering post traumatic stress and experiencing nightmares, he seems to be pulling through. The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating whether Sully had made the right call and even holds a large meeting to determine whether his decision was correct or he should give up his wings (doing so would prevent retirement pension).Sully sounds straightforward and it pretty much is the kind of reenactment one would expect. Given the Hollywood budget, they manage give us a pretty good sequence of the plane landing in the water and the rescue of the people. Though a good part of the movie is about that crash, the real focus of the story is surrounding Sully's aftermath and the investigation he was under. With the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" story surrounding the press, I had no idea that Sully was questioned about his actions.Director Clint Eastwood brings the same dark style that he brought to Gran Torino and Jersey Boys and I think he finally understands that too much of it makes the experience unpleasant. The story is short at only an hour and a half, but it's the right length. Though it's story is good, the editing is very odd. There are several moments where it chooses to sporadically cut to Sully's youth or of the crash. Some are short, but some are very long, which makes you question just what the intention of the flow was. I think this would have been better had it been shown straightforward without the time jumps.I'll give this seven airline captains hats out of ten. In the end, I was glad that I saw this miracle on the Hudson story to life. While not necessarily a strong commentary about the airline industry nor a dive into captain psyche, Sully is an engaging story about one man's decision. Plus with Tom Hanks, you know you're gonna get a good performance. I'd say check it out if you heard about the story and wanted to know more. Board on and hope for the best.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"National treasures Tom Hanks and Clint Eastwood tell the story of another national treasure, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger.","Many people remember, or have at least heard of, the ""Miracle on the Hudson"", the 2009 landing of a disabled passenger jet on the Hudson River by Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, resulting in the survival of all of the plane's passengers and crew. But how much do we really know about the incident? In most cases, probably not much more than what was in that first sentence. That's what makes the story such a great idea for a movie. With Todd Komarnicki's adaptation of Sullenburger's 2009 memoir ""Highest Duty"" as their guide, director Clint Eastwood and star Tom Hanks bring us the behind-the-scenes story of this incredible water landing and its aftermath in the drama ""Sully"" (PG-13, 1:35).The film opens with a plane crash scene. It's a literal nightmare of Captain Sullenberger (Hanks), who is haunted by his experience of landing his airliner on the Hudson River – and what might have happened if things had gone differently. Different scenarios play out in Sully's head as he sleeps – and also while he's awake, forced to relive the incident by NTSB investigators. Their questions and the facts about the ""crash"" (as they call it, ""forced water landing"", as Sully calls it) lead Sully to second-guess himself and his actions, even as he is being hailed in the media and in person as a hero and he is being wholeheartedly supported by his wife, Lorraine Sullenberger (Laura Linney), via telephone from their California home.As the investigators (played by Mike O'Malley, Jamey Sheridan and Anna Gunn) repeatedly interview Sully and his co-pilot, Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), we hear information and arguments which will make most Movie Fans question whether Sully made the right call and whether he really is a hero. As Sully alternately struggles with those same issues and reaffirms his version of events for the skeptical investigators, we also see that short flight reenacted, from different perspectives and with more and more of the story coming to light. We also get a taste of the media frenzy which surrounded Sully and his family, and see flashback scenes of Sully's earlier experiences flying as a teenager and in the military.The combination of the vast movie-making experience of Eastwood (directing his 35th feature) and Hanks (with over 30 years' worth of films on his resume) has resulted in an interesting and well-conceived telling of Sully's experiences. Much like the NTSB investigation at the center of the story, the film uses what most of us didn't know about the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" to dramatic effect, telling the untold story as if peeling back the layers of an onion. Besides a more complete picture of this incredible incident (and another reminder of how talented Eastwood and Hanks are), the film also gives us a subtle but profound reminder that there is, and never will be, a substitute for human experience, intuition and guts. ""Sully"" may not be a thrill-a-minute movie, but it uses every one of its 95 minutes very well. ""A-""",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A competent enough, but still flawed biopic","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOn January 15th 2009, airline pilot Chelsey 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) was forced to take drastic action when the passenger airline he was commandeering ran into turbine trouble and began to nosedive down towards New York. Sully took evasive action, and glided the plane down toward the Hudson river, saving the lives of all the passengers on board. However, in the aftermath, his airline tried to hang him out to dry in order to avert blame for the disaster from themselves, and he and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were forced to do a round of publicity to defend themselves.Nothing produces better human drama than a real life drama, and plenty of them occur every day for Hollywood to bang out for the big screen (what with this and, for example, the up-coming Patriot's Day with Mark Wahlberg.) Clint Eastwood's latest dramatization has a really glossy, ready made feel to it, another Malpaso company production with none other than Tom Hanks in the lead role. Running at a far more condensed length of just over an hour and a half (rather than the two hours or so it would have ten/twenty years ago), it zips by and is a generally fine and polished piece, but sadly it's undeniably pretty flawed.I didn't know much about this event, but in early 2009 it must have been something that took America by storm, and with 9/11 still fresh in everyone's minds, it undoubtedly must have caused some fear and panic. It was a tale that was indeed begging to be told, but sadly Eastwood's execution is a little disjointed, and the dramatization and the flashbacks to what happened are too blurred together to enjoy the story properly, whilst other strands, such as a scene where Sully's fascination with flying began as a child, is never explored any further. It's never sensationalist or sentimental, but it's still a bit flawed as a film.Performances wise, in the lead, this is a role Hanks was pretty much born to play, and a role he can pretty much do in his sleep, portraying a reserved, dignified man whilst also quietly conveying his softer side in some private, emotional scenes. His presence adds to the overall smooth, glossed over feel to the film, though, while Eckahrt provides similar sturdy support along with Laura Linney as Sully's wife. It's an aesthetically pleasing film that is just a little too flawed to be perfect. ***",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

3 minutes worth of movie stretched out to 90 minutes,"An interesting very short tale within an otherwise very bland movie that probably shouldn't have been made, because there's 45 minutes worth of documentary here at best, not a 90+ minute movie.Let's face it: the landing is what this is about. That was a miracle. There was a happy ending. But this lasted only around 3 minutes, leaving us with about 87 more minutes to fill.There simply isn't much more to the story, so the creators decided to inject some villains in the shape of the NTSB, in order to create some tension and an actual story to go on with. This however just turns out really disappointing and rather unbelievable.And guess why it's unbelievable? Because it is. It's not true; it never happened like that.

8/10,"8/10Sully tells the story of the emergency plane landing on the Hudson River, performed by Captain Sullenberger. The movie is relatively simple, and it follows the questioning of Sully and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles if they made the right decision. The film jumps back in forth from the case of the plane crash to the actual incident itself. The movie provides an excellent level of detail in the two main storylines. In this case, the film shows no real enemy but the questioning of a man's decision and that man taking personal offense. The movie excellently shows that Sully knows his actions are correct, and the audience agrees. But we also share the perspective of those skeptical, whose reasons are entirely valid. The portrayal of the incident itself is fantastic cause it doesn't leave anything out from what happened from the perspective of the pilot, the passengers, the men from the watch tower, and even the rescuers. The VFX is excellent enough to immerse you to the point of believability. This film makes us witness what truly happened on January 15, 2009.There isn't much to talk about in this movie. The characters are relatively simple, but they successfully made Sully the highlight by making the central perspective through him. And Sully in this movie is an absolute chad. He cares for passengers and stands his ground, but also shows his humane side by letting him have nightmares of what happened. It may not be profound, but it shows the movie's central theme, the power of human instinct. From Sully's heroism, the instinctual actions of random people moving to act, and of course, the imperfections of humanity are highlighted in the central climax of the film in the end. Overall, great movie, such an enjoyable watch for everyone. And a testament to where miracles can happen, especially for the passengers of US Airways flight 1549. Good work from Clint Eastwood in directing a simple movie with great inspiration for the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good storytelling, but nothing really special","I like that Sully took a somewhat different approach to retelling the story of ""The Miracle on the Hudson."" Rather than walking us through the events one-by-one, they instead start you with the inkling that mistakes might have been made. Allowing us as the audience to discover the truth of that short flight through the process of the investigation into the pilot, and the decisions he made, is quite interesting. The movie does fall a little too deep into idolizing Sully, but I still felt they were fair in presenting why some people might have doubts about what he did at the time. The entire film is shot well, and I quite liked how they handled the actual reenactment of the water landing. At this point in time we are so overwhelmed by the quality of CGI effects that the great ones don't stand out all that much, but I have to say that these were seamless for me. It was cool to see the retelling of this well-publicized event, and I appreciated that they showed the actual people at the end, so you knew about all the lives that were impacted by Sully. It's a heartwarming film, and while it may not have anything to make it truly outstanding, it was well worth watching. I could easily see myself watching Sully again for some good comfort-viewing.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Not entertaining,"This film was disappointing. It was obvious that the NTSB was set up as the villains, simply because Eastwood needed some conflict and knew he didn't have much of a film otherwise. The dialog was trite. Sully's interaction with his wife, played poorly by the actress, was as mundane as you could get. The basic problem is that the whole incident happened so quickly, so Eastwood had to figure out how to get an hour and a half out of that. Hank's Sully is a rather uninteresting character, and it's hard to be much concerned to what happens to him or how he feels.

It's a story about what happens when the right people are in the wrong place at the wrong time and what it looks like when the best of humanity emerges, comes together and works for the greater good. And Eastwood manages to land this plane in just 95 minutes, demonstrating a film doesn't have to be two and a half hours long to be powerful.Sully is poignant, intelligent, rewarding and inspirational.

Gets lost in back-room power-struggles and bureaucratic discourse,"A somewhat world-weary Tom Hanks is playing real-life pilot hero Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, a man whose feat of saving the lives of 155 passengers and crew by landing a motorless Airbus A320 in the Hudson River is turned by NTSB into a question of why he didn't also save the plane by returning it to the airport. The problem with this film, which has a heroic and fascinating story at its core, is that it gets lost in back-room power-struggles and bureaucratic discourse, which not only is all too familiar in American films (powerful organization vs. Powerful organization with protagonist stuck in the middle), but also smothers any nerve and vivacity that Sully has (the film, not the man, although it may be true for both).",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Even with the overwrought made up parts a Good movie about a better pilot,Great movie about an very good pilot and good man.

Most of whats in the movie about the investigation is completely made up. If you read the transcripts of the interviews and panel its technical boring and frankly deferential to the pilots because by then they were international heroes. And it took nearly a year to complete. If you take that and the made up dream sequences out its probably a fairly boring movie because no one died. People came together to work a problem and no one was the bad guy except some geese. Its a feel good movie well acted by Hanks.

Hanks navigates the emotional turbulence with a stoic grace, bringing depth to the man behind the headlines.

When too much glorification is not a good thing,"I'm sure that every one of you knows the story behind this film. A passenger plane dies in the air above NYC, and the captain pulls off a tricky save by landing the machine on the Hudson. A great job indeed. And one way too appealing to make a movie about.But it's just too boring to tell a story about a person who did his job right and saved a lot of lives. Or that's what the cinema bosses might be thinking. So let's bring in some less genuine or relevant conflict about the corporate pigs who always aim to blame the little man, or about the confused wife and financial struggle back at home. Yeah, that's so much better, now we can actually root for our guy even more and see that even if you're a hero for the whole nation you still have severe issues to fix. And what would be better than seeing the little man prevail and beat the evil system fair and square for all the world to see?Well, I don't know how exactly it was in reality, but the one created by Clint Eastwood was a bit too cloying to be appealing. Of course, it's impossible to criticize the work of one of the most esteemed actors-turned-director of late, featuring one of the most esteemed actors of the last decades, especially when it is about a true heroic story America could wholeheartedly call its own. So it's just easier to ignore the general lack of a true drama in this film and let yourself be tricked into spending a few bucks to watch something that would at last make you feel proud to be an American. After all, it's not just New York that was in a desperate need of good news, especially those about an airplane.I'm not an American. Still, it's no problem for me to admit that what the real Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger did was extraordinary. What the movie industry did with this story, however, is much farther from 'extraordinary' and much closer to 'sentiment exploiting and money grabbing'.

This is the ""what-if"" scenario that haunts the titular hero after successfully landing the engine-blown Flight 1549 on the chilly Hudson River, and miraculously saving all 155 souls onboard. As he snaps back into reality, we will soon learn that the ""untold story"" lies on the aftermath of the averted tragedy. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) starts to investigate and finds results that does not jibe with Sully's estimation: the left engine is still operational and he could have landed the plane on the nearest airport instead of risking passengers' lives with a forced water-landing. ""Over 40 years in the air, but in the end I'm going to be judged on 208 seconds,"" Sully laments and sadly, he's right. Has there been a lapse of judgment on his part? Or could this be NTSB's attempt to use him as a scapegoat against the future lawsuits that will be filed? Director Clint Eastwood may put you into the mind of Sully, yet you won't be able to conclude beyond a shadow of a doubt.Eastwood turns this feature film into an introspective character study narrated in a contemporary fashion. He feeds his viewers with seamlessly-integrated, piecemeal flashbacks that takes us to the events on that fateful afternoon. He does not take the route of presenting a straightforward inspirational tale but he's more interested on a bigger issue here – man's internal turmoil to redeem himself. As we witnessed in his previous works like American Sniper, this is where he shines best. Still, he remains simple as a filmmaker. The restrained execution of plane crash may not please fans of extravagant tent-pole films but the wave impact brought by the musical scoring and sound editing is impressively realistic and accurate.Hanks shines as well in this yet again perfectly-tailored role – a brave, diligent and sturdy ordinary American hero facing against insurmountable odds. It's already a cliché thing to say that Tom Hanks is a brilliant actor but what I like about his performance is that it does not scream of: ""Look at me! I'm a great actor! Give me an Oscar!"" He can be minimal in his acting – during an intense bird-engine collision scene, he stoically yells ""Birds."" and still, he sells a nuanced depth into the character. The same can be said to the underrated Aaron Eckhart as co-pilot Jeff Skiles, the funny guy who mocks the things that Sully is often too nice to say. He earns the film's final laugh.Whereas Hanks has weathered rougher storms in his previous travel-disaster films like Apollo 13, Cast Away and Captain Phillips, Sully, however, offers less dramatic weight. We already know by now that everything will turn out fine in the flashbacks so the suspense gets to be partially ruled out. It can also be a bit underwhelming that the closest thing you'll have here for antagonists are the suspicious bureaucrats (Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn, and Jamey Sheridan) armed with computer simulations that should put Sully's career and pension at risk. The depiction of investigation somehow appears to be exaggerated for the sake of adding tension. The straw villains here will probably have more social relevance when they are viewed as Eastwood's take on modern cynicism: that even the noblest of men can still be subjected to harsh scrutiny.Just when Sully is on the verge of becoming a saccharine adulation to its hero, Sully gives credit where credit is due, ""I don't feel like a hero. I'm just a man doing his job."" He's right. This is not only the story of a man saving 155 souls but this is the story of a whole community coming together in the midst of tragedy – his co-pilot, the passengers, the flight attendants, the radio operator, the ferry boat captain, the coast guards and even the bit- players, no matter how thinly-sketched as they may be. Eastwood may not succeed in offering much meat for those who are expecting of a shocking conspiracy, but the fact that he's been able to effectively deliver the human element from a 208-second incident in such a short run- time is praise-worthy enough.Full review: http://www.filmpolicereviews.com/reviews/sully",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Flight,"Aiming to tell the ""untold story behind the Miracle on the Hudson"", this true story drama from Clint Eastwood documents Chesley Sullenberger's safe landing of a damaged plane on a river and how the National Transportation Safety Board sought to scrutinise his actions rather than celebrate him saving the lives of everyone on board. ""In the end, I'm going be judged on 208 seconds"" laments Sully, played by Tom Hanks here, and this is the most fascinating aspect of the film: the verdict will determine how everyone will always perceive him, all other merits aside. The film only engages in this dilemma occasionally though, and it is only in the final half hour in which the National Transportation Safety Board put Sully on trial that the film takes off. The first hour of is not worthless, but it is certainly uneven. Clint's decision to leave the real crash until midway through works well as it places doubt in our own minds as to what transpired, but since Hanks does not have a deeply flawed character like Denzel Washington in the similarly themed 'Flight', it is only so interesting to watch him wallow in self-doubt. The inclusion of extraneous flashbacks, like a father and two sons almost missing the flight, also feels like a poor attempt to beef the running time up to feature length. Indeed, the story here is slim for a standard length motion picture with (again) none of the plot complexities of 'Flight'. As always, Clint directs the film in a classy manner and if one avoids thinking about the Washington film in the same breath, it is a solidly assembled piece, if one that could have been much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks is so watchable,"There aren't that many actors around at the moment who are guaranteed to swell the box office, but Tom Hanks is certainly one of them. Regardless of the role Hanks is just so watchable.Sully tells the story of Captain Chesley Sullenberger who captained the US Airways flight that landed on the Hudson. There is always an issue with a movie based on a real event (especially when it's so recent) as everyone knows what is going to happen. I wasn't certain exactly about the length of the flight, but was pretty sure beforehand that it was less than 10 minutes. The obvious question is how can this be stretched out into a feature movie. This is achieved by basing the movie on the 'crash' investigation. Whilst this is a little clunky at time it mostly works. As ever Hanks is excellent in the lead role and it's nice that the real life people had a little cameo at the end of the movie. If you like Hanks you'll enjoy the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very boring.,"Uninventive, unfocused, uninspiring and undiversified. This movie sticks to the basics yet feels so monotonous, and largely over the practicality. A documentary could have been better. Nice acting by Mr. Hanks though. That colour palette was astonishing and I like such colour tones in the movies. - - 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Amazing Hanks performance,"Go see this movie!!I don't normally write reviews. But in this case, I feel like I should. I am not a Tom Hanks fan. I mean, he is a good actor, but I find a bunch of his movies a bit dull. On the other hand, I absolutely love Clint Eastwood. As an actor, and as well, as a director. This team is...the dream team. I absolutely loved Hanks performance, I think that makes the difference between this movie and similar ones. I saw a lot of movies with plane crashes or plane-situations. I recall very well the sensations each one of them left upon me: ""Flight"", ""Red Eye"", "" Non-Stop"" and even ""Final Destination"". All of these movies made me forget the plot right after leaving the cinema. In this case, you will feel empathy. You will live with Hanks's character all the uncertainty. And I absolutely loved the quotes in this movie. And the last line...was the climax.Go see it!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Would Have Been a Great 45-Minute Film,"Disappointing. By exaggerating the evil of federal agencies & including too many of Sully's ""nightmares"" that could have happened to his flight, Eastwood scratched out a feature-length film of 1 hr. 36 min. The scenes of the actual disaster are wonderful, but you can palpably tell where he's padding-out scenes & scenarios to stretch it out. A little very good movie within a so-so feature-length film. I was worried about this movie when it came out--it had generally good reviews, but I could tell from what I read that Eastwood resorted to what seemed to be flabby scenes, and so I waited till it came out on DVD.... And lo and behold! What I feared turned out to be true. Great in parts, flab in too many others.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tribute to professionalism,"An emotionally engaging tribute to professionalism and, at times, a working satire on the sensationalism of media, it's rather a fine movie.It's fascinating to see how Clint Eastwood, at 86 years of age, is still able to direct good movies on interesting and relevant topics. Looking back at his work as a director for the last 15 years, it's hard not to be impressed. ""Sully"" benefits greatly from the amazing and inspiring story of the Miracle on the Hudson, but it's Tom Hanks that really makes the film work.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Are disaster movie scripts becoming less of a calamity?,"I still hanker after those halcyon days of the 1970's tragi-pic after being mesmerised at the capsizing dining salon sequence in The Poseidon Adventure as an inquisitive 12 year old.How that effect was achieved became a consuming desire and kick-started my interest in cinema.I didn't care a jot about the hackneyed dialogue, characterisation or preposterous scenario.But that type of blockbuster disaster drama is on the wane. In an age of openness and transparency, fact-based calamity cinema is all the rage, with Sully following Deepwater Horizon by sticking closely to the events that happened during and after tragedy.Tom Hanks, cinematic short-hand of the everyman character, was the right choice to play Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who breached accepted aviation protocol by ditching his stricken airline in the Hudson River. He is ably, amusingly supported by Aaron Eckhart.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hero Worship,"(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5 )  THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: A bio-pic that tells its story concisely but lacks a real  emotional lift-off.  GRADE: B  SYNOPSIS: The true story of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's emergency  water landing and its aftermath.   JIM'S REVIEW: Everyone needs a hero and Sully is the latest bio-pic  about an American idol. The story is well known, as is the outcome, but  as directed by Clint Eastwood, the film immerses the moviegoer in a  behind-the-scenes glimpse of Sully's saga. In January 2009, this  ordinary man successfully crash-landed his plane into the Hudson River,  saving all 155 lives on board. We witness this ""Miracle on the Hudson"",  and view the event both before and after the crash, or as Sully called  it, ""an emergency water landing"". Although the filmmakers smartly stage  the crash in multiple scenes via flashbacks and dream sequences, it  lands squarely on the dramatic after-effects that haunt this aviator.  As Sully and his crew are subjected to a thorough investigation by the  Federal Transportation Safety Board, who become the film heavies in  this movie, the film takes flight, even if it treads too lightly on its  subject.   Played by Tom Hanks, in common man mode, the film aligns us to our hero  from the start. From a competent screenplay by Todd Komarnick, which is  based on Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's own autobiography, there is an  imbalance of the facts by Mr. Eastwood that biases our judgment and  places the moviegoer in direct support of Sully and his actions,  without naturally questioning his decision-making process. (One wonders  if many passengers were injured or died during this crash if the same  public reaction would have happened. So to paint the FTSB as the fall  guys isn't very fair or logical. It is, after all, the procedure that  occurs with any aviation incident. However the doubt factor, flight  simulations, and conjecture of the inquiry does make for good conflict  and compelling personal drama.)  Solidly directed by Mr. Eastwood, the film is very well-crafted. The  CGI is effectively done. The acting by Mr. Hanks and Aaron Eckhart as  Sully's co-pilot, is strong. Anna Gunn, Jamey Sheridan, Mike O'Malley,  and an underused Laura Linney as Sully's wife are all fine in their  supporting roles.  Yet, emotionally, the film seemed to be stuck in auto-pilot for this  reviewer, a disconnect with the characters' traumatic circumstances.  The narrative structure doesn't follow a linear structure and has  issues with a choppiness as it jumps from the aftermath to the accident  itself and then back to Sully's past life. The episodic script never  quite lands, causing an aloofness in its clinical retelling. The many  plane crash sequences, shown from varying points of view, are overdone,  serving as pure filler.   While the film successfully establishes the personal tension of the  investigation quite effectively, it underplays the dramatic gravitas.  Were more of the screen time spent on this conflict, the film could  have been more directly involving. Less time spent on the actual impact  (of the plane) and more time spent on the personal stakes from the  results of plane crash would have been more powerful for this  moviegoer.  Still, Sully shows a vivid portrait of a nice guy, humble to a fault,  who was thrust into a dire life-and-death situation and survived to  tell his tale. Mr. Eastwood honors him and the first emergency  responders admirably. But depicting the man as less of a saint and more  of a human being could have made this film more believable and  thoroughly engaging. Yes it's a riveting and uplifting story but the  film plays it too safe, looking for that soft place to land.  NOTE: There is a lovely song written by Mr. Eastwood, called Flying  Home, during the end credits. Stay and have a listen.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Tom Hanks Continues to Deliver, But Steer Clear of Travelling With This Man","Despite its screenplay inconveniences, Sully is ultimately carried by another strong outing by Tom Hanks, successfully spotlighting the few seconds of Chesley Sullenberger's defining act of heroism, and the controversy-riddled aftermath.While Sully's central premise is intriguing & the execution suspenseful, its setup was not letdown free unfortunately. For instance, the amount of needless scenes that seemed efforts to surpass the 90-minute mark was a nuisance. From the poorly executed flashbacks that either tackle time periods irrelevant to its central arc, or those that purposely repeat with little benefit, to the dialogues that are overly theatrical, head scratching moments blindsides us left and right. This is then a prime example, that close to straightforward storytelling, does have its wonders. Thankfully, Tom Hanks' brilliance stands front and center.Hank's portrayal is one for the books. He conveys such an appealing hero that is subdued & humble, fear-stricken yet finds inner confidence when push comes to shove. His performance is never theatrical here, oozing with unmatched likability, typical of Tom Hanks' finest roles. Apart from Forrest Gump, another positive is Sully's well executed third act that is Clint Eastwood's triumph. Here, the question marks are addressed in the most grounded & nail-biting scenes that absolutely engages its audience, and rewards them.Overall, through misses & shades, Sully perseveres through stellar acting & outstanding telling of its most impactful moments. Tom Hanks (& a dose of Eastwood) showcase their Midas touch here, opening our eyes to an everyday hero's persona.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Strong Tom Hanks performance in a structurally irritating film,"There will be no discounting of the true story and skills of the heroes involved in this investigation. What these pilots did was truly remarkable and should be remembered in the most honorable of terms. That being said, Clint Eastwood's film is a bit of a mess.Firstly, there is very little story to tell to span the running length. There are moments so stretched out it is unbearable to watch. A couple of subplots with passengers from the Hudson River flight are popped in to ground some form of reality to the people involved. While on paper this sounds fine, in execution there is a really phoniness to the whole proceedings. The crash incident itself is very tense yes, but for some reason we are subjected to it a couple of times over the film when this could have been skipped over and feels like it was purely done to stretch the film.The depiction of the National Transportation Safety Board is hilariously bad and sort of disrespectful to the real people involved. A painful attempt at creating a villain presence for a film that could have easily done without to purely focus on the heroic efforts of Sully and his co-pilot.That being said, the crash scene is very well done ignoring some bad CGI moments. Tom Hanks is also very very good and gives a real warmth to the cold direction of Eastwood (at least in this film). His speech defending himself is by far the best scene in the film and makes me want to see a film that was engaging and well written as that scene.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Flawed, but inspiring nonetheless","Whether or not Captin Sullenberger was genuinely an American hero has been a much discussed topic ever since January 15, 2009. Some say what we did was incredible and certainly heroic, others will argue that he was simply doing his job (by the sounds of it he may even argue for the latter himself). Regardless of where you stand, no one could argue that he did his job fantastically well that day.'Sully' is actually a film I can relate to on a personal level. I was a flight attendant for a couple of years and during my time we had a flight that was showing signals of a possible internal fire. We had to return to the nearest airport and I (as the sole flight attendant on board) had to evacuate 50 passengers mid-runway. I can confirm that that is a harrowing experience that sticks with you for a long time afterwards. What these people did, both the pilots and flight attendants, will never be easy for them to forget.The film itself isn't perfect. The biggest flaw it has it that structurally it's a bit of a mess. A 3 minute event doesn't exactly lend itself to a film. The scenes of the actual crash are brilliant. They're captivating to watch and are filmed brilliantly. It's the filler that doesn't really sit that well. The board room scenes feel overacted and unnecessarily harsh. They are purely that way to add some conflict to the story. It was needed, but it feels far from natural.'Sully' is a film that could have been a complete mess without a competent director. Luckily, Clint Eastwood was up the task. I imagine his job was more a case of paving over the cracks in the script than anything else. He did his job effectively though and the end result is a good, if somewhat forgettable, tribute to some people who did their job fantastically on that particular day.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Heroic Story, Uneven Ride","Sully is a film that showcases a remarkable true story with Tom Hanks at the helm, delivering a steady and grounded performance. The film captures the tension and drama of the with impressive realism, especially during the reenactments of the emergency landing.However, as much as I appreciate the film's focus on the human element, Sully sometimes feels stretched thin. The story, which is inherently intense but brief, is padded out with flashbacks and a drawn-out investigation subplot that doesn't always hit the mark. These additions, while necessary to flesh out the runtime, can feel repetitive and slow down the pacing, leaving me wishing the narrative had a bit more momentum.Another downside is the depiction of the NTSB investigators, who come across as overly antagonistic, which feels somewhat exaggerated for the sake of drama. This portrayal undercuts the film's otherwise respectful and realistic tone, making the conflict feel forced at times.Despite these issues, Sully is still a solid film that honors a modern-day hero. It's well-acted, competently directed, and does justice to an extraordinary event. It's just that the film's structure and pacing prevent it from soaring as high as its subject matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fantasy wins over fact.,Eastwood takes an amazing incident but one from which he cannot make a film without wildly diverging from the facts. Sully is made a persecuted hero as if it was a Spaghetti Western (who was the director again?). The post-crash incident investigation was a complete distortion but necessary to make a story. I really dislike filmmakers playing fast and loose with real life events without any acknowledgement. An aircraft incident investigation is just not carried on as described. But I guess most people don't care as long as they leave the cinema warm and fuzzy. The crash re-creation sequences were incredibly well done though and reclaimed the film.,4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie but Unrealisitc Portrayal of NTSB,"As a pilot for 40 years I really enjoyed Sully as I'm sure most pilots did also. Since the actual flight was so short it would have been nice to have seen an uninterrupted view of the flight from take-off to the water landing from the cockpit perspective. Instead we got a lot of short edits jumping back and forth from the cockpit, to the cabin and then outside.That's a small complaint though. A larger one is how poorly the NTSB was treated as arrogant and oblivious to the human factors involved in an unprecedented emergency involving dual engine failure at 2,800 feet. I understand every drama needs an antagonist and maybe only the NTSB could have played that role in Sully. Just understand that's show business. Pilots might have the occasional complaint with the FAA, say, during a ramp inspection, but the NTSB is pretty much universally respected as one of the most capable and thorough agencies within the federal government. The incredible safety record of American air travel is largely attributable to the NTSB and the FAA.Google ""ntsb final report USAir 1549"" to read the final NTSB report on the flight. Judge for yourself. This wasn't written by a bunch of arrogant bureaucrats.One other thought. If you liked the pilot heroics in Sully, watch ""The High and the Mighty"" filmed in 1954. Great music, visuals and John Wayne showing how iron-jawed pilots handle emergencies.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A well made crowd-pleaser, that's for sure!","'SULLY': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A biopic based on the story of Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger; the pilots Captain who heroically landed US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River (in January of 2009), and saved all 155 people on board. The movie stars Tom Hanks, as Captain Sully, and it costars Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Anna Gunn, Mike O'Malley and Jamey Sheridan. It was directed by Clint Eastwood, marking his 35th theatrical film as a director, and it was written by Todd Komarnicki. The script is based on the 2009 memoir 'Highest Duty' (written by Sullenberger and Jeffrey Zaslow). The movie's received mostly positive reviews from critics, and it's also a hit at the Box Office. I found it to be very intense, and involving!On Thursday, January 15th, 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 hit a flock of Canada geese (shortly after departing LaGuardia airport), which disabled both it's engines. With no airports in safe landing distance, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Hanks), and First Officer Jeffery Skiles (Eckhart), were forced to land the plane on the Hudson River. All 155 passengers on board (miraculously) survived the emergency water landing. The media and public praised the pilots as heroes; but the National Transportation Safety Board was beginning an investigation which could discredit the men, and possibly destroy Sully's career.I knew nothing about the investigation into pilot negligence, by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board), so this movie was very interesting to me. I also enjoyed seeing the epic events of the 'Miracle on the Hudson', recreated for the big screen (they're intense). The film is very inspiring, and involving. I love seeing a story where the little guy takes on the establishment too; in this instance it was definitely self defense, but it's still incredibly moving! Eastwood is great at directing this type of movie, and I actually think it's one of his better films. Hanks is also spectacular in the lead. It's a well made crowd-pleaser, that's for sure.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIFMQ3xbt9g",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fairytales do come true,"This true story is well known: plane crashes in river, everybody survives. Despite this miraculous succes the pilot Sully gets accused of reckless behaviour.No riveting actionscenes to be found in ""Sully"". No big drama's either. Director Clint Eastwood's movie is a slow burner, with good but not excellent acting. There are some touching emotional moments when everybody gets rescued and ofcourse it has got a feel good ending. All in all a warm nice movie depicting a fairytale of a true story.I must confess however, that I was constantly longing for the drama that ""Flight"" with Denzel Washington DID have, and ""Sully"" did NOT have. There could have been made a more intense and gripping movie about this wonderful story. Clint Eastwood played it too safe unfortunately. It certainly wont offend anyone, but it wont thrill either. It is just average feelgood stuff.Last detail worth mentioning is that in real life, pilot Sully revealed that a lot of pilots nowadays are in constant debt, while some of them even have to resort to foodstamps! When you fly what do YOU want? A rookie pilot with money problems or an experienced flightcaptain like Sully with a good salary? Flight companies are now testing planes WITHOUT any pilots at all. Bigger profits for sure. Better safety too?",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
No Cartoon Super Hero,"So refreshing to see a movie depicting a hero who isn't a cartoon-like Super Hero. The industry is sadly saturated with action-action-action Hollywood films. Sully suffers mildly from post-traumatic stress after he successfully lands his damaged plane in the Hudson River, amazingly saving all 155 of its passengers. After the landing, he is made a hero in the public's eyes, but begins to doubt himself when the aviation panel believes he could have successfully landed the plane in the LaGuardia runway. This story that unfolds is realistic, intelligent, and moving. Do we really need car chase scenes or explosions to hold our interest? My favorite line of the movie was when the hotel maid hugged Sully, and he asked, ""What just happened?"" The crash was not overplayed, thus, more tragic. The rescue scene was brutally realistic. The aviation panel's witch hunt was ugly and unfounded, and the fact that this story was based on true event made it even more harrowing. What was needed was for people to stand up and salute at the end of the final hearing. Amazing movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Miracle on the Hudson,"Given where I live I have a vague memory about the Miracle on the Hudson. That is to say I remember it happening and being on all of the news channels, but I never really cared to follow up on the events past those first few days after it happened. What the movie Sully brings is at best an exhilarating account of bravery displayed by Capitan Sully and at worst a little bit of feel good drama where the drama feels inflated.Lets start off with Tom Hanks as the titular Captain Sully. Hanks is not only the perfect choice for this role, he is the only choice for this role. No actor working today brings as much trust and inherent compassion better than Hanks can. From the first moment that the NTSB starts questioning him about the events during the emergency water landing I immediately believe Sully. I trust that he did the right thing and that is because of Tom Hanks. He has made a career of being the good guy and this role demands that he be the best good guy he has ever been, and he nails it. Aaron Eckhart is solid in his supporting role because he is able to play off of Sully's personality. He allows the viewer to step into his shoes and play co pilot in our heads. In those 208 seconds he has to trust Sully like we trust Hanks and you feel that in his performance.Even though I was not really sold on the CGI in Sully, the ""water landing"" scenes were the highlight of the movie. Even though they showed the same sequence of events more than a couple of times, each time it felt different. Eastwood lets you view it through the different lenses of the people involved, the passengers, the crew and even the people on the ground viewing it from office buildings and homes. While the CGI sometimes broke my immersion when they put you in the plane is when it really shines. I could almost feel the bottom of my seat drop out as if the theater had lost both engines.Most of the issues I have with Sully are nit picking. The direction by Clint Eastwood is unimaginative, the writing is average but the biggest problem is one that Eastwood suffered from in his last movie American Sniper and that is an unrealistic villain. This time around Eastwood decided that the real opposition to our hero is over zealous government officials and white people problems. For me the real problem for Sully should have been the constant terror of what if. What if he had done something differently that day or what if he had put those people in danger? They allude to this a bit but I think this really should have been the emotional focus. At least thats what gave me the willies the most. Although i did say the writing was average, Sully actually as what most movies miss and that is an earned third act. The writers saved all their really good stuff for that second to third act transition. They even have a few twists for you at the end there which I did not expect at all.Sully can sometimes be dragged down by the low points and dialogue heavy scenes but when it has to the movie really turns it on. at an hour and 37 minutes the length is just about right, there were a few scenes that kind of felt added in to pad the run time but it was a decently paced movie with as I said before a great third act. I did not expect much from Sully but I am here to say I have been proved wrong. This is a story about a true American hero, but more than that Sully is just a flat out amazing person who deserves for people to really know how great he is.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Hanks and Eastwood make a very good film where there arguably isn't one,"In 2009, America got a rare hero in the form of Captain Chesley Sullenberger, the pilot who safely landed a commercial plane with two blown engines on the Hudson River without losing a single passenger. Clint Eastwood, as he did with ""American Sniper,"" takes a closer look at that heroism in ""Sully,"" which follows the immediate and little- known aftermath of the event, chronicling Sully's (Tom Hanks) fame amid an investigation by the National Transportation Security Board into his decision-making.Hanks is the film's linchpin. Nobody does ""everyday hero"" like Hanks. His moments of uncertainty and brooding that project reluctant heroism are not only expertly delivered on screen, but critical to the drama and lifeblood of the film.That's because ""Sully"" is really a 90-minute exercise in how to make a feature film out of a story that doesn't really have enough material for a feature film. Somehow, Eastwood and screenwriter Todd Komarnicki turn the plot of an NTSB investigation into the most riveting product one could possibly create from an NTSB investigation.The compliment here is not meant to be so back-handed. No, ""Sully"" doesn't manage to completely disguise how little it has to work with and some of the techniques that it uses to mold that story into a serviceable drama, but Eastwood and Hanks get more mileage out of all that than they seemingly should. The truth is that it works.In a nutshell, while Americans were enchanted by ""The Miracle on the Hudson,"" Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) were worried about losing their wings if an investigation revealed that they could have safely returned and landed the plane at LaGuardia. So, amid his press appearances on Letterman and with Katie Couric, Sully is doubting himself and wondering if he needlessly put all 155 passengers' lives at risk.Sully's inner quarrel and the unfolding investigation are the only sources of conflict in the film, and that's why Hanks covering that first half as well as he does makes the film. He lends such credence to the notion that Sully would have any self-doubt that it weighs on the audience too. As for the other half, Komarnicki paints the NTSB officials, which includes actors Mike O'Malley and Anna Gunn among others, as out to get Sully, when the likelihood was that they were just doing their jobs, albeit coldly, perhaps.When the climax of your movie is a room full of suits watching flight simulation videos recreating the conditions of the incident multiple times, you've put its fate in the hands of how well the rest of the film was executed. That's where the sure eye of Eastwood makes a difference. It becomes more about the details, and he captures the right ones. ""Sully"" doesn't get that emotionally evocative, but it hits enough of those notes with Eastwood's guidance.What it comes down to is that ""Sully"" landed in the right hands with Hanks, Eastwood and even Komarnicki for weaving a strong story where arguably there isn't one. ""Sully"" isn't a surefire awards contender, but it's the kind of film that can be if there aren't other great options. Either way, it's a really solid watch.~Steven CThanks for reading!

Good (76/100),"This movie tells the true story of the airplane pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (played by Tom Hanks), who, in 2009, had to land in the Hudson river after a bird strike that disabled both engines. And though he was able to save everyone on board, people started doubting if he did the right thing and whether or not he could have made it back to the airport.The film starts after the event had already happened and we see the consequences of it both in the media and in Sully's personal life and the actual event is told through flashbacks throughout the movie. One of the complains I heard about this film is that there are too many flashbacks and most of them are not needed. I partially agree with that: they show several clips of the accident always with something more (or less) each time they show it and most of them don't add much to the one showed before, so I think some of these should have been cut. There's another unneeded clip that shows Sully learning how to fly a plane and one showing him in the air-force landing a jet (though it's not needed, this one is pretty cool).I found acting in this movie to be mostly okay. Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart are both great as the two main leads but the rest of the actors were not that good.Here in Brazil this movie is called ""Sully: The Hero of the Hudson River"" and that basically tells you everything about how the movie want us to see Captain Sully: as a hero, and the ones that are ""agaist"" him: as the villains. And that's my biggest issue with this movie: there is a clear ""right"" side and ""wrong"" side. The people investigating if he did or not the right thing are portrayed as villains and thus we don't ask ourselves if what he did was right or not. I think the film would be much better if we kept asking ourselves who's side is the ""right"" one! That happens briefly in the fist act but it just stops! And the villains are not even good villains they're just blend!Clint Eastwood's direction is really good for the most part; There's one scene that I found it sort of weird: Anna Gunn's character is the only one talking and there's two other people in the frame with her and she's almost out of the frame and every time it cuts back to her it's this exact same angle!Most of the characters, with exception of Tom Hank's and Aaron Eckhart's, I found to be kinda generic though the movie focus is mostly in the main leads. But surprisingly one character that gets too much screen time is the guy from the air traffic control, he has two pointless scenes and he is by far the worst actor in the movie!It has good suspense (mainly in the ending scene) and a good atmosphere, result of the really good cinematography.This film has good acting (for the most part), good atmosphere, cinematography, suspense and it's overall a good movie. Check it out for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Got to Me,"Wow, this movie really hit me on a physical anxiety level, as it is all about anxiety. Anxiety before, during, after the incident. So, for that alone, I have to add on a star. I had this reaction not once but twice during the film. I, too, wondered how much of a movie could be made out of this, esp as I don't remember much controversy over this crash. As other reviews have so well put, the momentum was kept by the editing and non-linear story line. Also the realistic silences and great acting by Hanks. He does anxiety very well! Sure, you have to believe in this movie to let it play out and be patient, but the payoff was wonderful. I don't require movies to be full of action or whatever, every second, so this was an easy decision for me. Esp as Tom Hanks pulled me in, coupled with my visceral physical reaction. I loved the special effects used to create this movie, and esp the great camera work that caused me to admire, once again, the guys who jump into dangerous waters from helicopters, to rescue others, even if it was done by CGI. As a frequent flyer many times in my life, and with only a storm and one severe loss of altitude to show for it, I have to say that commercial pilots and everyone else involved, are an amazing bunch, safely ferrying us, in the crowded skies, thousands of times a day. I am happy to put my life in their hands.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful Performances, albeit Short on Compelling,","Sully is a good movie with a well developed plot and a terrific cast. It's an instantly engaging film as we follow two pilots who sparked controversy after landing their plane on the Hudson River. The emotion and trauma these must have underwent is beautifully captured by Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, their chemistry on screen is fantastic, it is the highlight of the movie for me.However, the story seemed to be too straight forward to make in to a full blown film, they experimented with this by not showing scenes in chronological order and showing the plane crash from different perspectives, but it ends up feeling like they were merely filling time.I found the last scene to be very disappointing. It is anti-climatic and drags on significantly, consisting of us watching various flight simulations of what Sully should have done, it becomes very tedious by this stage.It is certainly flawed, but Sully boasts terrific performances and an engaging story, I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama, just do not go out of your way to see it.Follows the life of Chesley Sullenberger as he struggles with the precautions of having landed his damaged plane on the Hudson river, despite saving every passengers life.Best Performance: Tom Hanks",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
NTSB not the Bad Guys,"Great story. Great guy, a true hero, in fact. Mediocre movie. Why? I give the movie only 5 stars because I question the portrayal of the NTSB as the ""bad guys"". Ah, but in Hollywood's version of reality there always has to be bad guys. Right?That is my only criticism of the movie. My wife and I actually enjoyed it, and I cannot think of anyone else who could have played Sully so convincingly. Hanks portrayed accurately the reality of what Sully experienced.I waited until I read Sully's book before writing my comment. I wanted to know if the NTSB hassled him as much as the movie depicted. There was nothing there. If there was, at least Sully did not write about it.Does Eastwood not fly anymore? Does anyone involved in this movie not fly? Even if the NTSB did ask hard questions, that is their job. No need to imply that they had bad motives.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

It takes Clint Eastwood to make a great Tom Hanks movie,"Many have tried and failed spectacularly (case in point, Spielberg/The Terninal). It's not as easy as it looks or sounds. It takes a Clint Eastwood to pull it off. Even though Hanks is in it, the film is excellent. Eastwood was smart and gave Hanks as little to do as possible. Just imitate the real Sullly and a couple of monologues. Joel Cox did an amazing job editing some intelligence into Hanks's performance as well. You almost believe Tom Hanks really is an actor. It sometimes seems Eastwood could grab a meth addicted derelict and turn him into a great performer (with the magic of filmmaking). All in all this is one to see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Clint's Heroes A-changin',"It's interesting to watch the evolution of the heroes that Clint Eastwood brought to screen in his acting and directing career. His first serious impact was with the spaghetti western style heroes of the 60s, followed by the sometimes rotten, sometimes idealistic cops in the action movies of the 70s. Later as he turned to directing and built a solid career as an accomplished director his heroes were polarized in super-achievers or rhetoric failures. Some of them continued to use their fists or guns. Other were inspiring leaders or great inspiring movers. They never were conventional. Which is the main problem with Sully. The hero of this film is so predictable. Even his dilemmas and the way they are solved are predictable.You will tell me that this is a true story, we know the ending, it happens to be a happy one, this also happens in life. Maybe so. Reality however does not always provide the best promises for great art, and realism is just one of the possible styles in cinema (and not necessarily the one I prefer). Good movies were made based on true stories and biographies of real heroes. They succeeded however because they could find new dimensions to the stories and the characters, not because they followed the beaten tracks. Even in Sully the best parts are the ones that describe, almost as against the story the conflict between self confidence and doubts. Should we trust the heroes that become overnight media sensations. The instinctual answer is 'no - be cautions' but this is not the obvious answer here. The problem is that the envelope is so conventional, full of platitudes and melodrama, of small and insignificant side threads (the calls with the wife) that add nothing to the substance of a story that is quite thin already.It is interesting as well to watch the evolution of the heroes that Tom Hanks acted on screen. If there is one thing that made his career exceptional it's the fact that he never made the expected, his next role was an exception, a different character that built himself as a live and true character on screen, no matter if he was playing a Central Asia refugee or an American astronaut. This is not the case here. If there is one performance that director Eastwood succeeded in this film, it was making actor Hanks look bored and boring for the first time in his career.'Landing on the Hudson - The Movie' (my personal title) is not the best film of either Clint Eastwood (as director) or Tom Hanks. It brings however some interesting questions about the careers of the two exceptional film personalities in the film industry and America of 2016.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Don't Sulk at Sully,"It's a new weekend and that means a new wave of movies to flood the local theaters. Robbie K here starting the round with the latest drama based on real life events that centers on an American Hero named Captain Sullenberger. Yes, I'm talking about Sully, the film that once again delves into whether or not the pilot who landed on the husband is indeed a hero or a delusional zero. So fasten your seatbelts, make sure your trays are in the upright position, and cell phones off as we take flight into my review.LIKES:  The Realism  The insight into Sully's mind  Tom Hanks actingWhen you look into a movie based on true events you hope there is more truth than Hollywood fiction. Fortunately, this is one movie that puts reality before fantasy. Sully's 96 minute run time is a recreation of the treacherous nightmare that plagued the skies in 2009. Audience members will be wowed as they are dropped into the cockpit of the US airline flight as it soars into the Hudson. The combination of camera-work and modern computer technology will immerse you into the full experience, perhaps fooling you into thinking you are a passenger on the plane. In addition, the team manages to give you multiple perspectives of the flight, not only advancing the realism, but also adding more pieces to the proverbial puzzle. Yet, the other component that brings the realism is the airplane jargon that fills a majority of the dialogue. According to the retired pilot sitting next to me, Sully's writers were very accurate in the technology and maneuvers used to land the plane. Will most care about this component? Probably not, but this reviewer appreciated the extra effort to make this movie real.What helps provide more answers to the mystery though is getting a visualization of Sully's internal thoughts. Much like a book, our team was able to illustrate the dark fears that plagued our captain as he waits for the investigation to finish. These memories are well placed into the story, helping to develop Sully while also helping advance the plot in a timely manner. Those who have read the tale and hoping the movie will mirror it are certain to enjoy this presentation, and those who choose a less literature based approach will find this method entertaining and engaging.But of course the headliner of the movie is by far the legendary Tom Hanks playing Captain Sully. No surprise that Hanks is capable of bringing this role to life. Hanks certainly commits to his role and manages to mirror the reported personality of the Sully. His lines are delivered with grade A accuracy, and yours truly gives the actor props for handling the lead role with such a powerful performance that will most likely net him an Oscar. While most of the other cast certainly plays a hand in recreating this story, Hanks is by far bearing the brunt of the load and handles that responsibility quite well.DISLIKES:  The Drama Flare Added  Some perspectives not neededAs I sated, seldom is a movie safe from getting the dramatic touch added to the tale. Sully is no exception as some components take on that Hollywood magic to spice things up and make them more ""entertaining."" Some of this editing is in the nature of the crash itself, the dragged out drop to the river, support personnel going into near break downs to add a touch of sympathy, and even the rather stretched portrayal of Sully's wife. Yet all those moments are nothing compared to the direction they took the lead investigator Charles Porter. Instead of playing an agent just looking into the entire scenario, Porter's character was like the lead marauder in a witch hunt with a single-minded goal to bring Sully down. This could have been fine if this was the true character, or even if they mystery was deeper. Unfortunately, neither of these cases seem true, and Porter's stubborn as a mule attitude inspired nothing more than anger and eye rolling for me.The second dislike comes in the form of editing and the director's decisions to split the incident into so many perspectives. While I appreciate the integrated approach to fully envelop you into the moment, there were some components that really weren't necessary. One major moment was from the civilian perspective watching the plane come to land, or the random passenger trying to swim the cold waters due to their panic. I appreciate the realism in all manners of this flight, but these moments added little to me other than trying to expand the movie out to a longer run time. A minor error sure, but the editing could have been tapered down a bit to remove some of these pointless moments.The VERDICTWhen it comes to Sully, this reviewer has to give props to this movie. A realistic portrayal of the hero with fantastic acting and attention to detail are sure to attract the nonfiction lovers to the theaters for this one. Sure it could have found a home on Netflix or PBS as a 1 hour special, but I have to admit that this movie was one of the better productions I've seen in a while. So is it worth a trip to the theater? I would say yes, especially to pay tribute to Hanks' wonderful performance. The recommended audience is anyone in love with nonfiction/true stories, Tom Hanks fans, or those looking for another tale of a trip gone wrong (with Hanks again being the captain. Guess I won't be traveling with him anytime soon.)My scores are: Biography/Drama: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.0",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency,"It is difficult to forget the positivity and heartwarming end to some powerful events that we come across in our daily life or through the media and 'Sully' covers one such event which consoled the world that not every bad incident would end in a tragedy. While the incident is still powerfully etched in our minds due to its coverage, this movie tries to cover the human aspect and behind-the-scenes events from the perspective of the man who made this possible - Captain Chesley Sullenberger.On 15th January, 2009 US Airways Flight 1549 (Airbus 320-214) took off from New York's LaGuardia Airport with the experienced and sure-handed Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) at the helm along with his First Officer Jeffrey B. Skiles (Aaron Eckhart). Three minutes into take-off, the flight was hit by a flock of Canada geese leading to the shutdown of its engines and flight losing its thrust. Using all his experience as a flight safety expert, glider pilot as well as his instincts, Sully landed the plane on the River Hudson without any casualties despite instructions to return to the source airport or the other nearby options. An inquiry was ordered by NTSB whose initial evaluation through flight simulators suggested that it would have been possible for the flight to have made it back to LaGuardia airport. With evidence mounting against him, can Sully come out of this serious accusation of endangering lives of all the passengers and crew aboard the flight.It is impossible to not draw comparisons with a similarly themed Robert Zemeckis's movie 'Flight' which also deals with a freak and impossible crash landing followed by an investigation. The major difference apart from one being fiction is the melodrama quotient. 'Sully' deals the entire episode with operational efficiency without bringing in emotion where it was not necessary. The surprising and overwhelming nature of the situation that doesn't have a precedence is well countered by the experience, maturity and confidence of the Captain who is a veteran of thousands of flight hours and air-crash investigations - aptly portrayed by Tom Hanks. The way Sully is shown to conduct himself in this extraordinary situation makes you respect the real man even more. While the focus is mostly on Sully, Aaron Eckhart shows his quality by making his presence felt without actually having to force it in. One more interesting segment is how Sully deals with the situation on the personal front with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney) while speculating possible outcomes from the impending investigation.Apart from the leads, Anna Gunn (Breaking Bad fame) also gives a nuanced performance as Elizabeth Davis, an NTSB panel member who was heading the investigation. Rest of the cast gives an apt performance despite just being in the background. Coming to the technical departments - the visual effects of the crash looks natural, the screenplay makes the events more interesting by non-linear flip-flopping between the incident and the investigation. However the final hearing of the investigation is hurried to bring the revelations hastily in a day which in reality would have taken weeks to conclude. Despite its short runtime, it sometimes felt repetitive and dragging occasionally. Age seems to be just a number for director Clint Eastwood who has maintained relevance and quality in his second innings (last 10-15 years) which is a stark contrast of the genre for which he was a superstar for decades previously.A crackling performance by Tom Hanks dealing a powerful incident with operational efficiency.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tom Hanks is the revelation of this Clint Eastwood-driven biopic,"Tom Hanks has soared as one of the most versatile actors in last few decades while Clint Eastwood on the other hand, has contributed as a major icon not only to Hollywood but American entertainment. So it is pretty easy to understand why many would have speculated a product of an actor like Tom Hanks and an ingenious filmmaker like Clint Eastwood. That is where this riveting drama centered on the major 2009 event known as ""The Miracle on The Hudson"" comes into place. Clint Eastwood conducts the astonishing story of commercial pilot Chelsey Sullenberger who made a daunting decision to land an airplane on Lake Hudson following a failure of plane engine, a decision that many would expect lead to tragedy but instead ended with unexpected triumph. A gray-haired Tom Hank stars as pilot Chelsey Sullenberger (nicknamed ""Sully"") in Clint Eastwood's retelling of January 15, 2009 when Sullenberger and his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (played by Aaron Eckhart) were forced to make an emergency landing on the Lake Hudson after their plane engine was maliciously destroyed by a flock of geese in the air. When this fearsome stunt miraculously saves the lives of all 155 passengers on board, he is almost instantly held as a hero by the national public. However, Sullenberger also becomes a target of an investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board that unexpectedly jeopardizes his career as well as his newly earned reputation.Clint Eastwood has a sense of livelihood in storytelling which he has best exhibited in his previous few entities. This one is almost equally as riveting as you could come to expect from a Clint Eastwood entry, though it follows a slightly odd story structure. This biopic opens with the titular man immediately in the plane in a jarring flashback of the aforementioned disaster, then the story strolls through the aftermath of the harrowing debacle as the man is almost senselessly falls under scrutiny by the National Transportation Safety Board. It is not until around the halfway point when we witness the mid-air catastrophe which is done realistically. With writer Todd Komarnicki providing a hefty hand for the script, the film paints a mesmerizing portrait of the heroism that defined Chelsey Sullenberger on that fateful day while shining clear light on how heroic actions don't always come without a cost. And without the need to villainize the National Board (at least not in an over-the-top way), Eastwood provides us with a sensible look at both legal and psychological repercussions that threaten to tear Sullenberger apart as the person the public deeply admired him as. As the story moves on, Clint Eastwood accomplishes the essential task of pushing depth of the lead character including the psychological aftermath that disturbs his inner being. On top of it all, the real revelation in the mix is Tom Hanks. Now pushing his sixties, Hanks strives with a powerful performance as the spirited lead character, a role that allows him to shine like gold. Though this does not mark the first time Hanks has ignited the role of a real-life tragic figure as he portrayed the titular role in Paul Greengrass's 'Captain Phillips' in 2013, he provides just enough emotional gravitas to make for a memorable role. Even if he doesn't quite pack the same visceral energy he did the 2013 biopic, his performance still demands for admiration.Sully is a riveting biographical drama blooming with the likeliness of Clint Eastwood's solid direction and Tom Hanks' blissful talent in the performance department. It is a moving picture that unfortunately doesn't quite fall in the crowd of Eastwood's most masterful features. But in the end, the film paints a smart, triumphant tribute to the heroic Chelsey Sullenberger, a man that many still admire to this day.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

A fine portrayal of a real life story,"It's a pretty tricky affair for any film to recreate the drama of a real life disaster (or near disaster). No matter how skilled the production team is, no film can get close to the real terror that must be felt if experiencing the situation in real life.In the case of 'Sully', it's a bird strike on a passenger aeroplane shortly after take off that takes out both engines and gives the Captain Pilot (played by Tom Hanks) just a matter of seconds to save his passengers lives by attempting an emergency landing on the Hudson river. A well documented real life event.The film does a fine job of dramatising the short flight, astonishing landing and heroic rescue efforts, but fortunately doesn't make that the sole focus of the film. It gives weight to the post flight investigations where the actions of Captain 'Sully' are questioned and scrutinised, adding additional drama and tension to an already remarkable story.This makes for an engrossing, well paced and compelling watch.

Sully Review,"Sully is directed by Clint Eastwood and it's the most generic film I've seen this year. The film is neither amazing nor terrible, it lies slap bang in the middle. The film is a dramatisation of the 2009 emergency plane landing on the Hudson river. The film stars Tom Hanks as Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger. Hanks is the highlight of the film, he turns in a classy performance as usual. It's also clear to see though, that he didn't have much to work with.The film feels uninspired, maybe it's because there's not a-lot of dramatic tension in the real life events, save for the plane landing. However because the events are so fresh in everyone's mind, it's hard to forget what the outcome is. This means the film lacks any dramatic tension whatsoever.So now that we all know what were getting with the film what does it do to pull us in? The answers is nothing. Other then Tom Hanks the film has no punch. There are a couple scenes where Hanks is exhibiting PTSD. Rather then explore this subplot it's quickly swept under the rug, never to be brought up again.The other actors in the film are just there. The cinematography is bland. Nothing in the film really stands out. In the end the film is competently made, but it's played too safe. It almost feels like a quick cash grab before the story is forgotten about and stored away in the history books.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
just being human,"This film directed by Clint Eastwood explores not only the theme of what happened on the Hudson River on January 15, 2009, but also all subsequent events. Against her background, the personality of Chesley Sullenberger is revealed on the screen. Without any pathos, exaggerated patriotism and other nonsense. An impartially told story of the highest professionalism, which made it possible to translate fantasies and ""miracles"" into reality. There is only growing interest in how, simultaneously, on behalf of several people and eyewitnesses, a plane landing on the Hudson River is demonstrated. So you can see this story from completely different angles. Definitely only ""teach"" the viewer one thing. Heroes are not born. You will, which means that any of us can become a hero.

Movie makes you question Sully's decisions,Excellent representation of a true event. The director did a good job of adding drama with lack of action. One wonders if the movie would have had a more lasting impression and viewers would be thinking about movie more if more drama and action was added to the movie. Tom Hanks portrayal of Sully a sincere hard working pilot looks very accurate but may not be his best work. Sully's wife's role is portrayed well with strong presence even though very short. Movie does make one think about Sully's decisions and question if his actions were 100% correct.

A Fantastic Examination of A Forced Hero,"When I first heard about a film being made about the proclaimed ""Miracle on The Hudson"" I wasn't really sure how much of a watch it was going to be compelling or even an event capable of making into a feature film but after watching the final product I was extremely impressed and I would consider watching this film again. From the first few scenes I quickly realised that Tom Hanks was a fantastic choice for the role of Chelsey Sullenberger he perfectly embodies his reluctance to accept the title that has been hoist upon him and his characters experience as a pilot. In my opinion Aaron Eckhart gives his greatest performance since The Dark Knight like Hanks he embodies his characters experience and knowledge but unlike Hanks he seems more hot headed and light hearted making him the perfect person to stand next to Hanks. As I previously said I was worried about this film being compelling otherwise it could slip into a tedious bore but thankfully it isn't mainly due to the fantastic structuring of this film, the film doesn't open with the plane crash but instead is gradually cut back to and seen from different perspectives and it was the best way to do this film as it gave weight to the situation and its aftermath, I think if it was done in chronological order it would have made the film slow down and drag after that pivotal moment. Clint Eastwood did such a good job of directing this film but it really shows in the plane crash he makes it intense and lifelike. However my biggest issue with Sully is its lack of subtlety in certain places, places such as the flashbacks to Sully's career in it felt extremely on the nose and came across as forced exposition that was already being perfectly covered with the investigation into the crash. Another area that fell flat was Sullys family drama it just wasn't done well and in the end just came across as a series of phone conversations that didn't really add anything to this film.Sully is a fantastic film, definitely one of Eastwoods better efforts, both central performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart at brilliant, it manages to turn this event into a compelling and riveting experience and I easily one of the best Aviator films I've ever seen.82%/A-",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not very inspiring,"Sully - They say that corporate Hollywood is primarily about making movies for 10 year old (both mentally and physically), that's where the money apparently is. This movie is the living proof. Now, if you're on the same page with me, I need not elaborate. If not, I couldn't help you anyway.Particularly annoying in this effort though, is the use of cheap Extras for the passengers, for additional profits if I could venture a guess.The only thing they got right is the ""Big Bertha from Auschwitz"", chief-stewardess. Her bossiness is unfortunately quite typical in all forms of public service nowadays.The good news is, it avoids the irritating trend of patronizing minorities in general and Blacks in particular. Also, the perennial plastic coffee container with baby lid, or alternatively bottled water, everybody is carrying around at all times, is conspicuously absent.In defense of Tom Hanks and, as a long time observer of body language, he did not appear too happy with what he was told to do.

"'It's not a crash, it was a forced water landing.'","Topical docudramas don't always work; this one does. This once in a lifetime incident was reported in the book Brace for Impact: The Chesley B. Sullenberger Story (2010) by Chelsey Sully Sullenberger, well adapted for the screen by Todd Komarnicki, and adroitly directed by Clint Eastwood.The manner of telling the story on film is at times a bit disconcerting because of the manner in which the screenplay jolts between after the event, dreams by Sully, and the even and the final 'trial'. But in the end it works – largely in part due to the reliable Tom Hanks as assisted by Aaron Eckhart.Captain Chesley B. Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), with his co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart), made aviation history on January 15th, 2009 when he successfully landed an Airbus A320 flight 1549 on the Hudson River instead of the intended LaGuardia Airport: a flock of birds flew into the engines, disabling and breaking them. 155 people walked off the plane that day. However, even as Sully was being heralded as a hero by the survivors and the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill, an investigation was unfolding that threatened to destroy his reputation and his career. Further tension is provided by Sully's frightened telephone calls with his wife Lorraine (Laura Linney). A fine cast of actors hold the hearings in which Sully defends is actions and proves his heroism.This is a solid film, ell photographed and acted and directed and brings to the public eye the action of a living hero.

"Boring and Pointless, Hank's wasting his talent on useless movies","I watched whole movie expecting some extra-ordinary and entertaining movie, but movie is merely a documentary based on a flight accident which deserve nothing more than a ""TV Release""on Discovery or National Geography Channels, but releasing this boring movie for commercial gain is only because they had Tom Hanks face value, which can easily bring huge box office collections. Film producers have deceived audience because of Hanks face value. As far movie is concern, it was pointless as we already know many miraculous flight accident where many or almost all lives saved by Pilots and Crew (for example Dubai Accident where every passengers life saved on ground landing) but in this movie director was only concentrating and glorifying single man (Only Captain) for live saved in the accident, although in climax they tried to give credits to other crew members but it was like they were doing some kind of favor to them. You can understand the reason for this ONE MAN ARMY glorification as soon as you realize that the name of the Pilot was ""Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger"", yes a BERGER. Entire Hollywood is ruled by them, so you got another cr*p to glorify them.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
The script is overcooked but wonderfully understated film otherwise,"The script's treatment of the aviation safety board is a significant problem in the film. For whatever reason the writer decided to play up the antagonistic angle; this cast the review committee as hostile. This is not supported the historical record. More the point this sort of tension building is unneeded. The script adds a mystery and validation element that the story simply could have done without. I am sure Eastwood's libertarian sensibilities played a role in this poor decisions. Eastwood tends to distrust big structures and sympathize with the every man on the ground.Sully, the character especially as played by Hanks, is the quintessential Eastwood hero. He has an independent mind, an expert, is calm ,collected. He shows emotional only when he is alone and the danger is resolved. The film is at its best when it is dealing with the aftermath of the crash and how it effects the mental state of Sully. It is rare to have a director, an actor and a character so in sync but while everyone involved had finer moments this film just fits all involved.Good late Eastwood",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tom and Clint make a great pair,"Tom Hanks gave another stellar performance. He didn't have to portray a dying AIDS patient or a mentally handicapped person for this one, he just needed to be a pilot. He gave an understated and honest performance that had me completely bought in. This isn't a linear story; Eastwood hops around the time line quite a bit. Flashbacks are so long you forget events aren't happening in real-time. When I first heard this was being turned into a movie I honestly didn't know how they would make it. It turns out there was a lot more to it than just the crash.

All about Hanks's performance really,"Sully is a movie based off the true events where captain sullenberger landed the plane he was flying from New York to Charlotte on the Hudson River. Just after taking off from LaGuardia airport, US Airways Flight 1549's engines had a huge flock of birds fly straight into their engines and had both taken out upon impact. The pilot and co-pilot had to scramble to figure out what the hell they could do to land safely and ensure every passengers survival. Tom Hanks and his acting really is what makes this movie worth a watch. It's a relatively short film and it feels short because of the crash sequences and the scenes showing what actually happened during the whole terrifying ordeal. I really liked those scenes that focused on what actually happened because that makes it all real and it puts actual human faces to this true event. Aaron Eckhart does a good job with his role too, he plays the co-pilot that assisted captain sullenberger in pulling off the ""miracle on the Hudson"". I bought both all of the performances in the film and I thought the scenes showing what happened were done well. Other than that the other scenes don't really carry much weight, that's why it's not like a 9 or a 10. With all factors considered, I think a 7 out of 10 is fair for sully.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""A Sublime Experience.""","Sully: Miracle on the Hudson is directed by Clint Eastwood and stars Tom Hanks, Aaron Eckhart, Laura Linney, Valarie Mahaffey, Anna Gunn and Mike O'Malley.The story of Chesley Sullenberger, an American pilot who became a hero after landing his damaged plane on the Hudson River in order to save the flight's passengers and crew.With the remarkable emergency landing on the Hudson River lasting only 208 seconds, I wondered how director Clint Eastwood could handle such an event in 96 minutes. Shot almost entirely on IMAX 65mm cameras and featuring stellar performances from Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart, Sully does not disappoint.Eastwood's visual style stays intact throughout as he and cinematographer Tom Stern team up once again, capturing the extraordinary brilliance and sheer tension of the now- famous ""Miracle"" on January 15th, 2009. With a story that cuts between the overwhelming news coverage and the landing itself, Sully feels incredibly fresh and grounded.Tom Hanks' performance as Chesley Sullenberger is wonderfully realistic and touching. There are a few moments in the final scenes that really pull the whole picture together in the most satisfying way, and this is greatly supported by Hanks' phenomenal act. Alongside is Aaron Eckhart as Jeff Skiles, who brings a lighter shade to the film, delivering some acceptable and amusing lines of dialogue that feels absolutely necessary when securing the film's human touch.Composer Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band take a personal approach when tackling the project, with ravishing piano pieces and lush string arrangements smoothly weaved into the picture, culminating as the screen turns black.Blu Murray returns to aid Eastwood as editor and this resembles all of their previous work together. The cutting here is masterfully handled, ensuring all scenes are flowing with attentive care whilst providing a fast-paced and sublime experience.With over 50 years of proficiency in acting and helming over 30 directional projects, Clint Eastwood has become one of the greatest icons of the film industry. Yet, even with so much under his belt, he can pull off something different and unique each time. Sully is a fine example of that. Truly wonderful filmmaking.Verdict; Although taking place on the Hudson River, Sully feels undeniably grounded in its masterful direction and skillful undertaking.Sully: Miracle on the Hudson – ★★★★★ (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A bit dry if I'm honest,"This wasn't as good as I was expecting it to be, kind of dry actually. Clint Eastwood directed this bio pic about airline pilot Sully Sullenberger depicting his successful emergency landing of a disabled airbus on the Hudson river in Jan. 2009 .In the aftermath, that takes up most of the movie Sully must endure sudden, unwanted fame and the FCC trying to prove fault with his decision even though he saved everyone on board. Insurance companies right?! The viewer spends a lot of time following the inquest and watching what if scenarios on flight simulators. Tom Hanks is fantastic throughout, there's a good back up cast with Aaron Eckhart as the copilot and Laura Linney but after the actual landing the rest of the movie was dry, a bit jumpy and even repetitive.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sully is one of the Years' best from a legendary director at his no-nonsense best.,"Many people think of Clint Eastwood as a legend. Myself included. At an age when most Hollywood personalities are turning senile, Eastwood is still churning out auteur stuff. At its heart, Sully is a modest celebration of an All American hero, much like Eastwood's previous film American Sniper. Modest and celebration go hand-in-hand, like an oxymoron, because in reality, the message in this film is much larger than it appears on screen.Consider the fact that Captain Sullenberger (again, Hanks at his brilliant yet modest best) had decades of experience as a pilot before the incident. Not a blemish in his career having flown over a million passengers safely in 42 years as a commercial pilot. That's an extraordinary feat for anyone in the aviation industry. But all that was almost instantly tarnished when bigwigs from the NTSB took over the investigation. They wanted to blame someone. Somehow his years of devotion to the job didn't matter. In their books Sullenberger didn't follow procedure. Herein lies the crux of the film based on the real incident that occurred on 15 Jan 2009 - instinct versus experience versus procedure. Could Sullenberger have saved the lives of all 155 souls on board that day had he followed procedure? The answer to that question is almost terrifying, not only in the film, but also to anyone confined to the nitty-gritties of hardcore airport and flight ops. And that's probably why the incident has been dubbed the 'Miracle on the Hudson'.There's a lot of liberty compressing months of investigation into a short 95 minutes of screen time. But that also means there's not a single minute wasted in telling this remarkable story. Apart from a couple of stock scenes showing panic stricken passengers, Sully is as remarkable as the story it depicts. This is not only Eastwood at his no-nonsense best, it's a steadfast salute to professionalism, both on screen and in reality. It's a director's film through and through so I won't be surprised if Sully gets a nod for a Best Picture nomination at the Oscars. And then some.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

This depiction is nonsense on its face. I'm not naïve, and well aware that Federal authorities are not angels. You should be wary of their motives and conclusions.But as a simple matter of fact, the NTSB does not throw around accusations in the days following an accident. They WILL ask questions like ""why didn't you return to La Guardia"" because that's a valid question that needs a direct answer, and that direct answer is ""I didn't believe we could make it."" There's noting accusatory about the question itself, and you're not staring down Skylar White.It's just unfortunate they went there. There is quite ample drama in the actual event.

Sully Soars while Plane Performs a Daring Water Landing,"Tom Hanks is in top form and gives his best performance since Cast Away (2000). After playing a man on the 105th floor of the WTC on Sep 11, 2001 in Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2011), he plays a captain of a doomed double-engine failure plane on January 15th, 2009 in NYC. Writing, editing and emotional directing crafts the portrait of this modern day modest hero with bravo.The storytelling choices, non-chronological order, details, scenes and people portrayed all add the the tension and depth of this fascinating, and familiar to some, story. Laura Linney who is always seen only on the phone gives a credible (incredible!) performance, while Aaron Eckhart and his co-pilot character are well utilized.Clint Eastwood ultimately nails it with the right choice of music he also contributes to, like in low-key but grandiose Gran Torino (2008), along with the flashbacks-flashforwards and figments of Sully's imagination to tell the story and inner feelings the best way, and the sheer thrill of a serious and spectacular life and death situation.Everything unfolds perfectly, ends on a high and comical note and feels like hours because of its intensity instead of the taut 96 minutes in actuality, like the only 24 minutes rescue. Thirteen years after the acclaimed Mystic River (2003), Eastwood and ""Sully"" safely and improbably land on the river.Like Sully who thanks his co-pilot and crew, the passengers and first respondents for this amazing team effort rescue, Eastwood has many people on his team to thank, including long time contributor but first time real lead editor Blu Murray, for all putting in the pieces together to this cinematic masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

This feels much more suited for a documentary, which I'm more than positive already exists.Hank's performance isn't bad either, but its basically consists of a permanent concerned/worried look on his face throughout, didn't exactly require a wide range of emotion for this one.Pretty passable film, overall.

"Intricate Glimpse Into Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger","I've heard this airline captain's story through the news back in 2009 during one of my college classes at the time, but had no idea a film based on those events was created. Upon watching every minute of it, I'm now able to see what made Captain Sullenberger a hero to his passengers and those who know him personally.The plot revolves around his heroic efforts as he and his First Officer Jeffrey Skiles navigated their US Airways plane right into the Hudson River as a last ditch of effort after their plane had collided with Canadian Geese that flew right into the plane's engines. Despite such actions that saved their lives, there was also debate on the circumstance on what could've happened or what would've been better than Sully himself had explained.Tom Hanks' portrayal of the renowned captain was a pretty impressive performance. Instead of just merely trying to emulate the real-life airline captain's experiences on screen, he managed to capture the angst and personal struggles Sully had faced following from that traumatic event. The board hearing scenes had so much to talk about that it left me further curious on what made these events run into motion. For example, when using flight simulators as to project what happened that day and combining it with Sully's recollections via PTSD visions, it's like placing ourselves into his shoes step-by-step. Director Clint Eastwood followed up well from his previous Oscar-nominated film American Sniper by cranking out a story that focuses on how one man who doesn't see himself as a glorified hero, but a man who did anything a professional pilot would do by taking such incredible risks to save the lives of himself and those aboard. For a biographical drama that touches on the mystery and intrigue, this is a must-watch and is sure to hit various accolades.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Lands comfortably as a captivating yet short biopic.,"Another biographical disaster movie, Sully is about Captain Chesley Sullenberger and the landing on the Hudson river in January 2009 and the media frenzy and investigation that followed those events. I remember this news story when I was in school, I did not read too much into it (was probably a bit too young at the time to fully understand it). Originally I thought they would struggle to make the film enthralling enough, but with Clint Eastwood directing it was bound to be good. Firstly Tom Hanks yet again shines, it's safe to say that he is one of the ultimate Hollywood bankable stars. It was quite an understated performance as Sully himself is rather reserved and hides his emotions, I thought Hanks did well. It's good to see Aaron Eckhart as one of the main roles, I find him to be rather underrated and so was pleasantly surprised to find out he was in this. Acting aside, the main star as with all of his films is Clint Eastwood. His directing style is very simple yet effective, nothing fancy just clean realistic camera work. You can tell that the actors in his films appreciate him as a director and work well with him. The scenes of the plane landing in the Hudson river were excellently shot and yet somehow, even though we know what happens, it is still mesmerising and tense to watch. I like how the story played out with the fact that Sully could have landed at an airport and actually the more intense scenes are when the flight simulators are playing...it did raise the question: could Sully have prevented an emergency landing on the Hudson? This brings me to the negatives of the film, and that is the runtime is ridiculously short. 88 minutes for a biographical film!? Nonsense! If you can't make a biopic more than 2 hours long then you do not have enough source material. I appreciate that the film was not longed out for the sake of it, but it was far too short for us to be invested in the characters completely and that is a massive shame. There were scenes regarding Sully's past, but even them did not add anything to the story or any emotional impact. An extra 10 minutes on the investigation or maybe the survivors could have made the film more investing. Overall, Sully was an interesting biographical film about a recent news story with great performances and direction, but the extremely short runtime hinders the character and story investment.Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A tricky case of Unintentional bird gobbling Well done,"Clint Eastwood's latest offering ""SULLY"" has been doing slam-bang box-office business in the USA since it is a well done Near Disaster film, and in a dark year of police shootings, other shootings, train crashes, and an upcoming election featuring candidates both of whom are likely to bring the entire nation to the brink of disaster, provides a ray of hope and something to feel good about --namely, the saving of 155 passenger lives when a quick thinking American pilot ditched his plane in the Hudson River after both his engines failed upon takeoff due to the unintentional ingestion of a flock of birds.This is not one of Mr. Eastwood's masterpieces but it is a very well made film (as usual with Clint) with near documentary effect and, obviously, very user friendly. What Eastwood has set out to do --and very effectively accomplished -- is to remind a public with impaired short term memory of an act of American heroism that took place a mere seven years ago and received massive news coverage at the time, but was soon lost in the shuffle of News overload with which we are bombarded every day -- and basically forgotten. How many people, even if they vaguely remember the event, can recall the name of the pilot who almost miraculously saved the lives of all of the 155 passengers aboard his plane when the plane was disabled upon takeoff from Laguardia in New York, by steering it powerless straight over Manhattan, managing not to crash into one of the towering skyscrapers, and safely ditching the aircraft in the icy waters of the wintry Hudson? The date was January 15, 2009, and the quick thinking pilot was Chesley Sullenberger -- not an easy name to remember -- but his nickname ""Sully"" is one that stays with you. So Clint has wisely chosen to name his picture just that and cast the best man in Hollywood for the job of playing Scully, Tom Hanks. Hanks sporting snow white hair in the picture is the right age -- 59 during the shoot whereas Sully was 56 in 2009 -- and nobody is better at playing men with a troubled conscience and constant pained expression. Following in the heels of last year's ""Bridge of Spies"" Tom has just about cornered the Pained Expression for a Whole Picture market. And he is actually believable doing it even if sometimes gets to be a bit much.Among other things Sully is a detailed process film about the piloting of airliners, but it is also much more. Most of the film actually takes place outside of the cockpit revealing Sully's struggle to justify his courageous act before a relentless board of inquiry trying to prove that he had other choices, such as landing at Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. Even as Sully was being heralded by the public and the media for his unprecedented feat of aviation skill the investigation that was unfolding, and takes up the bulk of the picture's running time, was threatening to destroy his reputation and his career which adds a dimension of courtroom drama to the whole. In the end we find out he made the only decision possible after the plane was disabled shortly after takeoff when a flock of birds were swept into both engines knocking them out of commission. These scenes are white knucklers that put you right into the cockpit with Hanks and the co-pilot, Aaron Eckhart -- in a highly commendable supporting role. Another important role is that of his wife (Laura Linney) who is often on the phone with him with words of anxious support as he walks the streets of Manhattan having nightmares in broad daylight of the plane under his control not making it to the river but crashing into a building in a blaze of inglory. The scene in the river with a real plane floating precariously in the icy waters half submerged and the passengers lined up on the wings waiting for rescue teams to arrive must have cost a fortune to make and is so well mounted it looks like archival footage. Fall into the water and you're dead in a minute! -- even though we think we know the final outcome it's suspense all the way. Clint really knows his business and his new film is definitely a winner with various Oscar possibilities down the line, maybe even a third Oscar for Mr. Hanks. At age 86 Clint Eastwood, director, Is not looking back and shows no signs of slowing down. In that department I would consider him to be my role model.Ps: Tom Hanks is a lineal descendant of Nancy Hanks, mother of Abraham Lincoln -- No wonder he has such an incorrigibly honest look!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Creativity overshadows reality,"While the original story is fascinating and I admire the pilot's skills, I believe there isn't enough material for a Hollywood movie. As a result, the filmmakers had to get creative to keep the audience entertained. Unfortunately, this led to the portrayal of the NTSB as silly villains who lack an understanding of how aircraft operate, speak in phrases more suited for cocky tweets, and act like prosecutors. This misrepresentation is misleading. The purpose of these investigations is to establish facts and enhance safety in the industry, not to assign blame. You can easily find numerous investigations of this accident online that are not only more accurate but also more interesting to watch. I wouldn't recommend ""Sully"".

Solidly and Professionally made and acted film,"Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks throws the first punches in the 2016 Oscar battle with this very good drama about hero pilot Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger who successfully landed his US Airways plane in the Hudson river after both engines were taken out by birds.Professionally and economically directed by Eastwood, this film focuses on the NTSB investigation into the landing and could Sully have flown the plane to a nearby airport?The answer is never really in doubt as we all know what happened and Eastwood casts ""Mr. Trustworthy"" Tom Hanks in the title role, so when the NTSB questions Sully's instincts and decisions, Hanks/Sully responds that he KNEW he did the right thing, we - as the audience - never doubt him as well.This movie shows a director and an actor in lockstep with each other and both showing that they ""still have it"". Let's start with Hanks (and the other actors). The whole cast is excellent. Hanks, of course, takes us along for the ride and he says more with a look of determination and a squint of his eye than most actors can with a thousand words and gestures. His Sullenberg is a real human being, with doubts and troubles, but strong and in command. Hanks is ably assisted by Aaron Eckhardt as co-pilot Jeff Skiles. To be honest, I find Eckhardt's acting to be pedestrian - not bad, not great, pretty middle of the road - but he is as good as I have seen him in this role. I think it is because he has to elevate his game in riding side saddle to Hanks, and step up he does. Laura Linney (as Sully's wife) and Holt McCallany (as Sully and Skiles Union Rep) also give strong, solid performances. Only the trio of NTSB investigators - Mike O'Malley, Anna Gunn and Jamie Sheridan - fair poorly, but I think that is because the script really draws them with heavy, villainous lines - lines that need to be drawn to give the film some dramatic tension - but lines that do turn these three into caricatures, not human beings.But that small quibble can be forgiven because of the solid, workmanlike direction of Eastwood. This movie is short, compact and solid - nary a scene too long or extraneous word of dialogue in the film. Eastwood, wisely, knows that the tension in this film is NOT whether or net Sully is cleared by the NTSB, but by the 208 seconds of the flight from the bird strike to landing and Eastwood films this so well and so precisely that I was glued to my seat, even though I knew what happened and how it ended. For good measure, Eastwood goes through that 208 seconds a 2nd time and I was just as glued to my seat that time as well!A strong effort from Eastwood and Hanks, one that you will enjoy viewing.8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Clearly this was with great skill and determination that this happened and the film shows these scenes with great drama and skill.

Hanks with just another home run,"Who else to pick to play US Airlines hero pilot Sullivan other than Tom Hanks, the theatrical Everyman of our generation? Henry Fonda did this sort of thing when I was a kid, but I was never a big Fonda guy. Hanks is fine as the modest but competent pilot excelling under extreme pressure. This was a short movie, and rightfully so. The real drama is in the reenactment of the forced water landing (don't use the ""c"" word) which takes all of about 3 minutes in real time. But don't be surprised when you don't see all the excitement up front. The screenplay, artfully done, doles out the thrills throughout the movie. So Hanks and Eckhart are great as the pilots, the persons playing the NTSB officials investigating the near-crash do a nice job although their attitude is a little over the top. Even before reading a recent article about NTSB response to the movie, I was wondering if the NTSB's attitude was a bit overplayed. This movie needed a couple of important lines to express NTSB concern, including ""we are mandated to look at everything when a forced landing occurs, and discount the possibility of pilot error""; along with ""landing on the Hudson is a last choice, we have to fully explore whether the plane could have returned safely to the airport"". You don't get quite enough of that here. There is a difference between a complete and thorough investigation and a witch-hunt; and we need to look at possible pilot error not just for evaluating the pilots in question but as a learning experience for all pilots going forward. But the movie as it is plays out nicely, all the bells and whistles are out, and the scenes through the credits of the actual pilot and passengers were much appreciated.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
I still reckon Peter Griffon was right. Nice movie though.,"Benevolent little anecdote of the heroism of a regular person. In fact, the hero-worship of its subject gets more than a little tiresome as everyone seems to want to kiss his ass (except of course, the faceless committee).The story ticks by with the appeal of a lullaby as a non-linear approach gradually lets us in on the experience.It's nice to see him go up against the mean old bureaucracy (apparently this was poetic license)And I imagine Hanks brought something to it as well.Easy going little crowd pleaser.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
a nice movie based on human aspect,"This is a Clint Eastwood movie, that means that it's a movie well done, well framed, well directed and with a tremendous impact on the human aspect. Everythings flow easy during the narration. I found on this movie a lot of analogies with Grand Torino as in that movie on Sully the main character are normal people that turn to be an hero. Nothing to complain on this movie, a great cast very well directed. Tom Hanks is able to put all the doubts on in self and on the spectator. With this movie Clint Eastwood flight back to great movie based on the human aspect of the character. I'm also happy to see a movie that use visual effects at the service of the story and not as main attraction to recruit spectators. So a must watch movie",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
What a movie!!!,"Sully!!!It was Jan 2009 when I was all ready to come to Oman and Sully happened! The news was all over TV. An Airbus 320 had actually 'landed' on a river! And all were alive! In the coming days, the miracle would be written and spoken about across the globe.And now in 2016, when I had first seen the trailer of Sully, I knew this was a movie I cannot afford to miss. Then the added excitement of the opening of the first IMAX in Oman and sully being the first film. So here it was, my first IMAX experience and that to with Sully.Sully, played by Tom Hanks is nothing short of a great movie ever made. Forget the incident and its re-creation. It was all about Chesley Sullenberger, the Captain of the flight, whose presence of mind, grit and above all experience saved everyone on that flight. Not once did I remember Tom Hanks (well, maybe the first scene). His conviction of the roles he plays is really stupendous. The movie enacts what happens and goes to show what transpired thereafter which only a few might be aware of.The movie shows, how the lives of 155 individuals collaborates towards one destiny on that day. The worries, thoughts, tension, remembering their loved ones, prayers, all captured in those few moments when the aircraft is poised as if in time, before the ultimate undecided moment.The big screen experience really made me live the scenes. Being a flying enthusiast and a flight simmer myself, I really freaked out at all the cockpit scenes and shots.What more would you expect from the Daddy of Cinema, Clint Eastwood himself? The direction, editing, acting is truly flawless. Enjoyed every frame of this movie.A Hollywood production you ideally should not miss. And if you have the opportunity to see it in IMAX, don't miss it. As it has been shot on IMAX and the scenes are tailor-made to be enjoyed there. A story you would never want to live but definitely want to know, what had happened!Rajesh Sharma @rajrad",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The quintessential hero.,"This is a great movie. It's about a regular working-class guy who does something heroic. The movie is also about New York City. It showcases New York City at its best. Sully is the kind of movie that is so good that it can't help but put you in a good mood, and make you believe that decent, caring people are still out there. A pilot is flying a plane and when confronted with impending disaster maintains his self-control resulting in a lot of lives being saved. Yet, what makes the movie even more enjoyable are the qualities of the hero himself - modest, caring, loyal, and professional. The movie manages to make you care about him as a person and in the process come to appreciate who he is and what he did. Tom Hanks warrants accolades for his fine performance has Chessley Sullenberger. The rest of the cast is excellent too. But as the title indicates, the story centers around one man who showed the world true heroism in the fullest sense of the world.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Not accurate and painfully slow.,"This is a movie that should not have been made in the first place.I have been avoiding this movie for years, because I knew that this actual incident, although as amazing and miraculous as it was, simply lacked the plot duration to tell a story. It's not possible to tell a 90 minute story using a 3 minute event.I have seen a few documentaries on this event, and they were really good, as they simply used technical data, science, math, engineering, aviation experts, etc., to document what happened. Since there are thousands of pages of technical data from a century of flying, which can be studied in relation to the incident, there is plenty of information to make a fantastic documentary.If anyone wants to know more about 'The Miracle on the Hudson', I suggest watching the documentaries instead.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

Airworthy - worth a rental/viewing,"We live in Charlotte, where this ill-fated Airbus A320 now resides in an aviation museum adjacent to the CLT airport. I took my wife to see the mangled jetliner two years ago. She, not being from America, nor in America at the time of the accident, was not familiar with the January 15, 2009 water landing on the near-frozen Hudson River next to Manhattan.When looking for a decent rental at our local Red Box yesterday, she asked if this movie (Sully) was about 'that' plane. I told her that it was, and we went ahead and swiped our debit card and took the DVD home.I was expecting an average (5-stars-out-of-ten), solid, but probably not exceptional Eastwood-directed movie ... and was pleasantly surprised. We both found the acting to be superb. Hanks didn't 'overplay' his real-life, heroic-yet-modest pilot. I especially liked his reflective and anxious moments alone. Moreover, I thought that this movie was a fair rendering of the man, the gut-wrenching 5-minute flight, the media circus, and the governmental inquisition aftermath.My wife scored it an 8.5 (she thoroughly loved it) and I gave it a 7.5 (maybe I'm too critical in my old age). Thus, 8 stars it gets from us. You could certainly spend $1.61 and two hours much worse.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
poorly done,"I was very disappointed. I had a feeling that actors are amateurs. Dialogues sound unconvincing. There ware scenes that I didn't understand what they wanted to say with them. Something is missing in this movie. It seams like it was made in a hurry,like they didn't invest enough effort and time to make it a great movie. I've watched about this accident in some investigation serial about plane crashes and I was stunned, even I cried. I was expecting that Sully is going to be even better, but it was much worse. I am not recommending it if you don't have a lot of free time. You will be disappointed. Whole movie looks unconvincing to me in spite of renowned actors.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
What we never imagined was happening,"I had no idea all of these examinations of the competence, judgments and decisions of Sully were taking place behind the scenes as we regular folk out here were totally accepting of his heroic accomplishment.

The realism and authenticity of virtually every frame was awe inspiring. I felt like I was there for the original experience.

High Plane Drifter,"Of the reviews written after this movie came out, around 2009 or so, many put sole blame on director Clint Eastwood, never having forgiven him for poking fun at Democratic candidate Barack Obama (meanwhile, weeks before, Hillary Clinton deemed Obama an ""empty suit"" not qualified for the job)...But just imagine if these whiners were on the other side of the political aisle, and had to put up with 99% of the rest of Hollywood bashing everyone on the Right, but...This isn't a political film, although it's very contrived, half baked, melodramatic and one-sided, based on the ""miracle on the Hudson"" where the titular pilot saved 155 people... all passengers and crew on board... by landing in the giant New York river after bird strike (wouldn't environmentalists consider this a tragedy?), turning regular guy Sully into an instant hero (and thereafter, a multi-millionaire)...What Eastwood does here is his usual forte, but making villains out of wicked bandits against cowboys or cops makes more sense than turning the NTSB into the kind of table-seated, stiff-suit jerks who scowled at Jennifer Beals before she turns their heads in Flashdance; added to that, the very unpopular Anna Gunn from Breaking Bad happens to be one of these antagonists, which also includes a bald-headed guy who looks uncomfortable in his own skin, and more ironic, the devil himself from The Stand...Other scenes involve pointless phone conversations with Sully and his annoyingly mundane wife, and then the poor guy suffering nightmares via CGI city-crashes, or simply scowling his way through a city that adores him, making Tom Hanks's lead performance not only unrealistic, but completely benign and lackluster and yet, perhaps he simply wanted to fit into Eastwood's completely unnecessary, lackluster biopic that, at a sparse 90 minutes, felt like an eternity.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography

Hanks and Eastwood provide a professional tribute to a man that was all about professionalism.,"The story of Capt. Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger's ""forced water landing"" of US Airways flight 1549 is delivered wonderfully to the cinema by Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, portraying Sully as a subtle everyday hero.The film follows the story of the crash of the Airbus A320 onto the Hudson on January 15th 2009 and the following investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB). Tom Hanks stars as Capt. Sullenberger, with Aaron Eckhart (First Officer Jeff Skiles), Laura Linney (Lorrie Sullenberger), Anna Gunn, Autumn Reeser, Holt McCallany, Jamey Sheridan and Jerry Ferrara in supporting roles.But the undeniable star of this film is Hanks, who portrays Sully in such a wonderful and inspiring way. Hanks gives a master class on how to portray an everyday man who suddenly becomes a national hero. Hanks portrays Sully as a subtle man, who is just trying to save the people on board his plane during the crash, while trying to save his job in the aftermath. Hanks makes it believable to the viewer that he is traumatized by what has just transpired and it gets you to feel for Sully, wanting to reach out and give him a hug. To put it in simple words Hanks provides a professional tribute to a man that was all about professionalism.Hanks is wonderful as Capt. Sullenberger Hanks performance does also have a negative side. From the get go of the investigations, Sully is portrayed to be right at every opportunity with him attacking the NTSB, which he has every right to but, This comes back to the way in which the film is directed. The director of Sully is acclaimed director Clint Eastwood and he has shaped the story to make it feel like that the NTSB are the bad guys for thinking of dishonoring an American hero such as Capt. Sullenberger, where they were merely just trying to do there jobs and found out as much information as they could about the incident. They are portrayed at the beginning as attackers of Sullenberger, asking questions about drug consumption, how much sleep he had or whether there were any problems at home. I feel like this scene could have been done more subtly and not seem so attacking, therefore changing the viewers perception of the NTSB from attackers to just people inquiring about the incident and doing their jobs.Apart from this Eastwood has shaped an insightful movie, taking us into the deeper parts of the story and into the mind of Sullenberger. Hanks was in close contact with Capt. Sullenberger throughout filming, gaining insight from him and shaping the movie to be as truthful as possible, which is evident through Hanks acting and how Eastwood has structured the film. The plane crash feels realistic and like we are apart of them and it fits right into the narrative and allows for a continuous flow through the story. While the inquiry stages of the film don't feel boring but naturally flow from action to talking seamlessly. The films narrative is based on Sullenberger's autobiography ""Highest Duty"", which was co-written with Jeffrey Zaslow. The influences of the book are seen throughout the film as we are shown cutaway shots of planes crashing into New York and of a military jet landing, which enhance Hank's and Eastwood's portrayal of the traumatized Capt. Sullenberger post crash. While the insights from Sullenberger enable the crash screens to be replicated for our eyes on screen.Sully is wonderfully crafted and wonderfully delivered across the park. Apart from the slight attack on the NTSB it runs smoothly through its action sequences and is intense throughout. Sully is an insightful thriller that will have you leaving feeling better getting into a plane then other plane crash movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Right Decision,"It was a different movie, I didn't know anything about the actual event. Of course, Pilot had made the right decision.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Though its competently constructed, the film places more emphasis on the uninteresting aftermath than the actual 'miracle landing' itself.","Though the source story makes for an interesting anecdote and the real life 'Sully' certainly deserves the praise being thrown his way, this move adaptation feels entirely unnecessary given that the true events it is based upon can be wholly recapped in about three minutes primarily because that's just about how long they actually took. Where 'Sully (2016)' makes its first misstep is in placing more emphasis on the ensuing investigation than the actual 'miracle landing' itself, assuming that its audience will actually doubt for a second whether or not the protagonist pilot made the right call when he chose to (totally successfully, I might add) place the lives of his passengers above the monetary value of the plane he was flying. So, what you end up with is a piece that gets its main event over with within the first few minutes and then revisits it a number of tension-less times, including once more in full during the finale with no new information added seemingly to stretch the runtime to that all important 90-minute mark, before battering you over the head with a corporate investigation which couldn't mean less in terms of emotional investment. This is simply competent film-making but nothing more, thanks mainly due to the fact that its story isn't really as suited to this medium as it is to filling a lull in conversation, but even then it's perhaps a little too late to be bringing it up now. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Sully - Review,"Entertaining? Oh boy, oh yeah it sure is. Tom Hanks is brilliant and the screenplay is super-good. It's not the best movie of the year, it should've had more of the main character and maybe pushed emotions to the audience more frequently, but this result is absolutely acceptable and - again, a lot of fun.

Very, a very good movie, and it's mesmerizing how Eastwood is doing a film at his age - wow.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent - but the documentary is better than the movie,"Best film I've seen this year. More of a dramatised documentary than a movie, but more powerful because it represents a true story. Real-life heroes don't wear capes, they aren't out for revenge or tortured souls .... they're often just quiet, modest, professional people who do their jobs really well, and keep their calm when >95% of us would crap ourselves. In the words of his wife, Capt Chesley Sullenberger ""hates surprises and always plans ahead"". The documentary about Sully is arguably more interesting than the rather contrived court-room drama of the investigation which dominates the film. In the real world, calm heroics come at a price. Sullenberger suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, lost 13 pounds in two days after his miracle landing on water, and loathed the attention. If you get the DVD, watch the feature documentary - it's as good as the film (no disrespect to Clint Eastwood and Tom Hanks, their movie is excellent). The interesting thing is - there's a world full of Sullys, and 99.99% of them will never be recognised - but they just do their best anyway. In Sully's case, he gave New York good news, involving a plane - and that really was a miracle.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Miracles can happen, even on the Hudson.","From actor/director Clint Eastwood, 'Sully' tells the story of the aftermath, through the eyes of Cpt. Chelsey Sullenberger (Tom Hanks), about that fateful day in which he miraculously landed a passenger aircraft on the Hudson river.1. There is no film that I can think of, in which Tom Hanks ever gave a bad performance. Nor have I ever disliked a character Tom Hanks has played. The man is a National Treasure, and one of the greatest living actors of out generation. Even if one has never seen an interview with the actual Cpt. Sullenberger or simply can't remember, Hanks completely loses himself in the role of Sully. There is a blatant reason why Hanks is a two-time Oscar winner, and could very well be heading towards another nomination here cause he absolutely deserves it and all the praise he's getting.2. Apart from the master himself, I was just as equally impressed with the acting of Aaron Eckhart, who plays Sully's co-pilot Jeff Skiles. There is never a moment where you doubt the chemistry between these two because their acting is on another level. Mr. Clint Eastwood himself deserves an incredible amount of praise just by his directing alone. If this man doesn't get a nomination for 'Best Director', I'll literally pull a 'Dirty Harry' on the Academy. The film is short, but it's edited in such a superb way that it never leaves you feeling bored.3. There are just a few hiccups here and there that just doesn't make this film quite as perfect. Laura Linney plays Sully's distraught wife Lorraine, however she never comes across as such since all her scenes take place within the confines of her home. Maybe the reason is due to some scenes being cut, but her range is never fully explored. With events that could have ended in tragedy, there are (unfortunately) nightmares that follow. There are dream and elapsed sequences where Sully envisions the worst, from the plane crashing, to passengers losing their lives.All in all, 'Sully' is still a sharp and well directed cinematic feature, and something those who witnessed the miracle themselves, should be proud of.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The true story genre is moving in the right direction,"The only thing that I knew about the movie is that it is based on a real story. I don't know the exact odds of landing a commercial plane on water intact with no losses, but as the event is actually called ""Miracle on the Hudson"" I can assume they are close to none.I really like the film adaptations of incredible stories that happened and were overlooked by people not affected by them. This makes me feel happy and shows that miracles do exist. However, too many times creators changed too many things or just stomped real facts in favor of action or more tension. This movie hasn't totally escaped the curse of selling the more compelling plot. Some characters were shown quite different than they were when the events actually occurred, and it was indeed looking weird in the movie.Despite of a chase for more attractiveness of the character (which I find very useless, as the crew of the flight 1549 were already heroes in my eyes), the style of the delivery is incredible. The back and forth of the events is used perfectly to show both the emotions of the pilots that performed an act of true professionalism and the above-mentioned doing itself.The modern technology allows you to experience that life threatening moment and can say that Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhart totally impressed me with the performance making me appreciate the skill of the pilots even more.Overall, Clint Eastwood has made a very good example of the movie that tells a real life story. I would say that the genre is moving in the right direction. Now I would like to compare it to the book of Chesley Sullenberger.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

It takes the time to show the humanity, the real fears, the stress and the reall caring of one man for another. The interactions between characters is great. The quality of the movie is very good.I have found that some of the best movies are those that are based on real life, and this one continues to prove that in my book.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I highly recommend that you do so.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Sully review,Once again Clint Eastwood does it again sully starring tom hanks as he is the most respected actor in film for a reason. He killed it as sully.Sthe first act was right in the to the event of the films story but it gets slow a bit into the second act and then near the third act it gets very good and suspenseful. This is an example of a film that has a lot of potential it could have been a 10 out of 10 film it delivers and what you think should but it could have been for suspenseful. This is Clint east woods shortest film and he is still knows how to film great movies because this is a great movie it has great moments and and flaws that make is not as good but in the he end it's great movie watch it it's out now.

the miracle on the Hudson,"Sully is an emotional film with amazing performances. Tom Hanks as always was brilliant, this man could not fail to embody a role. I thought that it was very interesting that instead of reciting the events of the water landing we also got to see the aftermaths and outcomes of the event. This is one of Clint Eastwood's shortest films and I think this sort of length is much better as the long run times sometimes really makes the film drag for quite a bit, so that is one good thing that came out of the film.One of my favourite parts of the movie was that we were not given one side to root for throughout the film, we got both sides of the argument and at times either sides to the argument seemed very plausible and made a lot of sense. This really got audiences thinking, 'was it captain Sully making everyone at risk by performing a water landing? Could he really have made it back to the airport under the conditions?' It was very interesting to get to see and analyze for yourself instead of the film shoving it in your face.This film really captures the best qualities of people, how when facing a common threat people would band together and collaborate and support each other. All 155 passengers and crew were saved and have survived the landing, not only due to captain Sully's landing and experiences but is really this joint effort of policeman, fireman and all the people who came together in the light of need. This could be a very powerful message and imagery that is very empowering and a very important part of the real life event that the film captures impeccably.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Thought provoking film - See it only in IMAX with Laser!,"A gripping movie based on real life events and is definitely worth a watch - go ahead and watch this movie without any hesitation.

Use of flashbacks was brilliant concept for an engaging audience till the climax. Great performance from Eckhart and Linney, too. Simulation thing added some entertainment in the second half.

Slightly suspenseful,"The trailer does a good job at adding suspense to the film, and while it is exciting at times, the film overall has a feel of an educational video. Because it centers around a specific event, the film concentrates on showing us the before, during, and after scenes of that pivotal decision. Sully is a good watch, however, you might come out not thinking you watched a movie.Hanks and Eckhart do great together. Both totally embody their characters, so much so, that I did not even recognize them. More specifically Eckhart, because Hanks is recognizable anywhere. The emotions, especially that of intense thought from Hanks, is well done. Not only does Hanks portray his character's emotions well, but the film- making overall, does an incredible job at magnifying those emotions.Eastwood has done well in directing this film. In most cases, frequently jumping between the past, the event, and the present, can be confusing. However, it worked well for this movie. By not giving us all the details of one timeline at once, it adds more suspense to the movie. Also, the crafting of certain words and scenes makes the audience think in different directions. So, while the story is based on a true story, and seems to be quite accurate, it is rather thrilling the way in which it insinuates different outcomes.Overall, a well made film that was educational as well as a little thrilling. On the down side, I watched this in AVX (my first time), and was quite disappointed. It was not worth the extra money.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tom Hanks nails it one more time .....actually continues nailing every time,My take on Sully : First let me say wow what a movie.A real story which showcases power of quick wit of one man and his act of bravery.

Also proving Human brains out wit computer brains or simulations ( watch the movie to understand that one )Another flawless portrayal by Tom Hanks! you were in the water with your ship as captain Philips now in the air as captain sully either way you are nailing it. Salute to you Captain.Clint East wood on each of your projects you are raising the bars and meeting the expectations. No wonder you are a legendary director. Exceptional and impeccable directorial feat.Verdict : The movie lived well up and above expectations. So what are you waiting?

"Oops, they did it again!","Well, Sally is one of those movies where you can just tell from the cast and director that it's going to be a heck of a movie! You just know.. I was reluctant myself to go to the movies and watch it cause it seemed more of a pay-per-view film to watch at home. It's not.It's masterfully made, keeps the sense of suspense high and although the movie is not revolving around the specific time that the accident took place, but goes beyond that point in time, it's still amazing. I loved all the flashbacks and leaps in time.Tom Hanks seems to be raising the bar over and over again and it won't be a surprise to see him get an Oscar for this. He depicted a determined, professional but deeply human pilot that managed to do what no one thought could be done.This movie is all about surpassing human limits and living up and beyond expectations.

A very touching Eastwood movie,"A very touching Eastwood movie about the little known aftermath of the heroic handling of this double engine failure aircraft (even though I was disappointed by the poor rendering of special effects showing the plane flying through buildings and crashing in New York, it brought tears to my eyes several times) and a special mention to a perfect Eckhart (and his Chevron ""mo""...)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An overall great acted drama about family and the plane crash of 2009,"Clint Eastwood does it again with a new and excellent acted movie about the Hudson River plane crash of 2009. The main premise of this movie is to make you feel and see the intensity and seriousness of the events of 2009. The acting in this film is top notch Tom Hanks plays Sully (The Pilot) and Aaron Eckhart plays Jeff Skiles (The co-pilot) both do a great job in this movie. Tom Hanks plays a serious emotional role while Aaron Eckhart plays more a humorous and relief role. This movie also does a great job incorporating New York City. It shows numerous shots and great cinematography of New York while also focusing on the problem at hand (the plane crash). It also shows Sully running down the streets of New York and down Time Square. Believe me this movie isn't all about the plane crash, its also about family and friendship. It explores aspects of Sully's life no one probably even knew were going on at the time. This film is also very realistic in which it shows people emotionally distraught after the plane crash and how much the passengers cared about there families. There is one scene in the movie which I thought that there might be a classic Hollywood moment but instead it went a different way and I was happy about that. I absolutely love how the movie showed little mini stories about the passengers and there families throughout the film. There is a sense of fear throughout this movie and that's what makes this film intense at some moments.Issues I had with the film There were very few issues I had with this movie but I thought for starters there were a little too many dream sequences which I wont get into detail about.The feeling of 2009 wasn't really there. There were a couple of shots I could see things like an advertisement for the Revenant on a cab.The movie was a little slow at the beginning. The beginning of the movie sort of moved a little slower than i thought it could have but i understand why it was crucial to put those scenes in the film. Eventually the film does pick back up.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An ironical uneventful crash landing,"Clint Eastwood apparently felt the need to adapt the events of the Miracle on The Hudson into a feature film. After watching it, you might just wonder if you find that need too.Barely clocking in at 90 minutes, Eastwood prosaically rushes and stifles whatever material there is to transpose and work with, as Tom Hanks, playing another Tom Hanks' default role (who else could have played it anyway), does whatever he can with a by-the-numbers basic ""script"". When in such a short film a director and a screenwriter are required to repeatedly relapse into dream sequences of the could-had-been, you know you're in for a (figurative) crash landing.In the end Sully is nothing more than harmless, forgettable and ironically uneventful. If that's a capital cinema crime, I can't decide but I do know that I'm not part of the audience Eastwood looked to appeal.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Human Factor,"1338/5000 Clint Eastwood had everything to do a titanic film or Rescue of soldier Ryan, because the story of Captain Sully is fantastic, but no, Clint chose to make a film almost technical, short and almost scarce of feelings, but contrary to everything, The film was really cool so I started to suspect that the film would not have a dramatic content when I saw that it was an hour and a half in duration, and I was sure in the first ten minutes of film. ""Sully"" is a film that has nothing to impress but also has nothing to disappoint, and it is able to leave the viewer completely glazed in the cinema, because it is fast and dynamic, mixing time lines and not caring much about Explain to the public what is happening. With almost no soundtrack and a very clear photograph, be it day or night, with cuts and very good sound editions and remarkable dialogues and very successful performances (nothing special), hardly Tom Hanks will disappoint, and Aaron Eckhart too It's OK. The screenplay is basic, cold and fast, he tries to pinpoint dramatic tones with Sully's dreams and anguish, but he can not, and in the great dramatic moment of the movie, pofff, you do not feel anything, but you leave the movie happy, A great and efficient story with a direction that fulfills the role.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Outstanding Piece by Legends in Hollywood,"Sully-The Story of ""The miracle of Hudson"" depicting the life of Sullenberger is a piece of art that would be remembered in years to come. The film promises you to be immersed for the entire duration and complete credit goes to the director and the Protagonist.Acting (9/10) - Tom Hanks as Sully puts in so much intensity into the character that one keeps wondering that how does he does it so effortlessly. Aaron as the first officer Skies is great too and does full justice to his part. Laura Linney's part as Sully's wife is limited and she plays the role decently. Overall the movie's greatest asset are its actors.Direction (8/10) - Clint Eastwood's American Sniper remains his best work but Sully's direction is one notch below it and its because the story is pretty simple and the director's role in keeping the story engaging does not require much effort. Clint Eastwood has of course done a commendable job and looking forward to more.Overall, Sully is a great work to keep audience entertained with its subtle humor at regular intervals. I give it 9/10 as some great research has been done by the cast and crew which has delivered great performances too.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
About movie,What can I say about this movie? It was all the things excellent the actors especially Tom Hanks!!!,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must see show of a real modern hero!,"Everyone knows the outcome. The challenge for the show is to keep the audience's attention due to a story of an event which occurred in minutes. Well, they met and exceeded the challenge. The show captured my attention through the entire length. The did an excellent job of breaking apart the scenes in a sequence that flowed together well. I recommending seeing this show. Make sure you see it in the new XD sound. It is about time they make a movie about a real living hero, such as CPT Sully!Your review does not contain enough lines - the minimum length for reviews is 10 lines of text. This is stupid. Why do I have to have 10 lines???",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A winner movie and very hopeful,"Tom Hanks has some kind of magic that we see in all his movies. The definition of the word HERO can be extracted after seeing this movie. This is now one of his masterpiece.Tom Hank has played his role almost without emotion but because of his interpersonal skills (the real Sully) this works out almost perfectly.Movies of this kind that are based on real life events have a grip on our mind which makes us watch the movie till the last minute and creates an impression on everyone who sees it.But the censor board giving an A rating which is a little strange thing. Otherwise a great thriller to watch with the whole family and never getting board. Tom Hanks does it again or i should say, Captain Philips does it again! Rocking!I have now started finding better movies through www.flickstree.com . It not only suggests great movies to watch, it also tells where you can watch the movie online.. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It's intelligent!!,"This film tells the story of Sully, a United States pilot, That after making the decision to fall to the Hudson River, should To face the law for the actions I take.The first good thing I see in this movie is the incredible Performances by Tom Hanks and Aaron Eckhar, especially Tom Hanks. It gives a Sense of seriousness to the character, proving that he is a hard man. Aaron Eckhart is very well not like Tom Hanks, but very well. The Actor's ability to level off better actors than he is very Good. The script is very well done, very well structured. Their Flashbacks are very sudden but efficient to tell us very well The story, well done Todd Komarnicki!The bad of this movie are Small things in good parts that are added, are few. He Character that plays the actress Valerie Mahaffey I think very Unnecessary, obviously should appear, but not for so long. The Needed from the North American Aeronautical Bureau to sue They seemed very forced, they would have talked more on that subject.And one Personal opinion that may or may not be part of the opinion, when Birds are flying ahead of the plane YOU WILL NOT HAVE HAPPENED TO ROTATE OR DO SOMETHING! ""O! We have a giant thing in front of us that we make? Let's do nothing. What a good idea!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Best Line in the movie:  Capt Sully tells  co-pilot Skiles,  ""We did our job.""","On 15 January 2009, after his engines flame out from bird damage, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) lands US Airways Flight 1549 on the Hudson River saving all 155 people on board.The beginning of the movie shows a dream sequence by Sully when Flt 1549 crashes into New York buildings, then he wakes up.Later the movie shows the beginning of an investigation by the NTSB of what happened to Sully and flight 1549 on the Hudson River and as we watch we see this committee try to destroy Sully's reputation as it tries to persuade Sully and co-pilot Jeff Skiles (Aaron Eckhart) that there were other options. They claim the computer simulations show they could have made it to Idlewild Airport. They claim the simulations also show the left engine was still idling. Sully says there was no way it could do that.This was hailed the Miracle on the Hudson, but the NTSB didn't see it that way.We see flashbacks of what happens in the cockpit and with the passengers as well just prior to the landing in freezing water. When Flight 1549 hits the water the CGI kicks in and we are most impressed and we let out a ""Wow!"" There is no other expression.We are privy to some of the things the public never sees as the NTSB makes its case. Sully demands to be allowed to see the simulations without waiting for the usual time duration that would be imposed. Sully believes the human factor was not considered in these simulations. He knows he did the right thing.Acting and action sequences all around were perfect. And yes I would give Tom Hanks the Oscar for Best Actor and let's not forget Clint Eastwood as Best Director. Kudos.Notables: Jamey Sheridan as Ben Edwards a NTSB member; Laura Linney as Lorraine, Sully's wife.The next best line in here was when NTSB member Anna Gunn as Elizabeth Davis asks co-pilot Skiles what would he have done different if he had it to do all over again. He says, ""I'd do it in July.""Over 300 New York police and fire rescue men and women helped rescue all 155 "" souls"" that were on Flight 1549.Stay tuned after some credits run to see clips of the real Capt Sully and many of the rescued passengers. (9/10)Violence: Flt 1549 crashing onto the Hudson River. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: One F-bomb heard early on. Brief small stuff the rest of the way.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Terrific. Tom Hanks is on fire!,"""We did our job,"" says Tom Hanks' Captain Chesley Sullenberger in an unguarded moment that turns out to be the emotional fulcrum and raison d'tre of Clint Eastwood's Sully. The eighty-six-year-old director's thirty-fifth theatrical feature is a stripped-down, unfussy salute to professionalism that pretty much serves as a statement of principles for the Eastwood oeuvre – call it The Malpaso Manifesto. In many ways Sully is the Clint Eastwood-iest movie Clint Eastwood has ever made.We begin with Captain Sullenberger crashing U.S. Airways Flight 1549 into midtown Manhattan, killing thousands and engulfing the screen with flames before Hanks' Sully jerks awake in a cold sweat. He's staying in one of the movie's countless, vaguely Kubrickian Marriotts, turning over the ""Miracle on the Hudson"" in his mind and second-guessing every decision as the movie darts back and forth through time. When not being trotted out for media appearances or questioned by the National Transportation Safety Board, Sully's stewing in his own self-doubt and the film follows in the footsteps of Eastwood's American Sniper as the story of a public hero's private PTSD.Of course we all know that Sullenberger's emergency water landing that afternoon in January of 2009 was a super-heroic feat and the stuff of instant legend, so much so that one can easily imagine a thunderously banal movie culminating in the crash and probably winning several Oscars. But Eastwood (working from a script by Todd Komarnicki) is far more interested in the aftermath: a shy man shoved into the spotlight and praying it's for the right reasons. I understand that the actual NTSB investigation was more of a formality and less like the Spanish Inquisition presented here, but much in the way American Sniper invented a nemesis to serve as a shadow-self Chris Kyle needed to kill before he could go home, the hearings in Sully are an externalization of Sullenberger's deepest fears, asking out loud the questions he's asking himself. (Also, it just wouldn't be a Clint Eastwood movie without a bunch of goddamned desk jockey bureaucrats in positions of authority who don't know what the hell they're talking about.) Tom Hanks has been on quite a run as of late – he's the only actor with two Oscars I'd consider calling underrated – and Sully can be seen as the third part of a loose trilogy alongside Captain Phillips and Bridge Of Spies, in which prickly everymen rise to nearly impossible occasions. He plays the best of us but wears it lightly. This is a tremendously subtle performance, with a slight nod near the end providing a release that had the audience roaring with appreciation both times I saw the picture. It takes incredible command of your craft as an actor to understand how doing something that small will pay off so big.People always point out how the male leads of Woody Allen films invariably end up aping their director's mannerisms, and I'd argue the same holds true for Eastwood movies now that he's retired from acting. I'm thinking of Matt Damon's reticence in Hereafter and Invictus, or the steely vulnerability Bradley Cooper shocked me with in Sniper. Sometimes in Sully Hanks seems to be doing a Clint impression – it's the most minimalist performance of his career, and he even looks taller somehow. He's got an easy rapport with Aaron Eckhardt, who as co-pilot Jeff Skiles gets all the wisecracks we're used to hearing from Hanks. And it must be noted that both men's mustaches are spectacular.Laura Linney doesn't fare nearly as well, literally phoning it in as Mrs. Sully and always calling at the wrong time. As in most Eastwood pictures, the day players are all three or four notches bigger and louder than the main cast – although a sinister Katie Couric haunting Sullenberger's nightmares suggests the former Today Show anchor could have a career in horror films if she wants. Hanks and Eckhart get digitally Gumped into the crew's Letterman appearance, and there's a hint of Eastwood's Flags Of Our Fathers in the sly understanding of how America's myths are marketed. A sequence in which Sully jogs through Times Square at night finds the man dwarfed by his own image on televisions and jumbotrons, alongside a skyscraper-sized Old Glory. (Worth noting that he also runs past a poster for Gran Torino, its star looming larger-than-life over the real hero's head.) The film returns to the crash three times from three different perspectives, but it is during the second that Sully becomes something truly remarkable. In what feels like a real-time re-creation of the water landing and rescue, we watch in awe as the fight crew guides the passengers step-by-step through emergency procedures. Ditto for the ferry boat drivers and scuba cops, everybody working together with hushed, meticulous diligence. Eastwood doesn't editorialize, he grants no heroic poses nor the triumphant choirs of horns one might expect from a Hollywood movie soundtrack. (The noodling, jazzy score by Christian Jacob and The Tierney Sutton Band is used quite sparingly throughout the film.) This eerily quiet rescue sequence is so breathtaking because of how matter-of-factly it is presented. Eastwood never strains for affect here. He knows he doesn't have to hype what he's showing us.Sully extols all the classically Eastwoodian virtues of going to work and not making a big goddamn deal out of it. You wouldn't be crazy to notice a whiff of autobiographical identification in this tale of an old pro with forty years of experience frustrated by having to answer to young, corporate-minded whippersnappers who place far too much faith in their computer data. But most importantly, the movie does its job.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great dramatization of an amazing event,"On 15 January 2009, US Airways Flight 1549 lost both engines shortly after takeoff. Thanks to the experience and skill of its captain, Captain Chesley ""Sully"" Sullenberger, all 155 passengers and crew survived when the plane landed on the Hudson River. This is the story of that incident, and its aftermath.Great dramatization of an amazing event. While the the events and skill involved therein are pretty incredible I was skeptical that this could be made into an engaging, entertaining movie.I need not have worried. Director Clint Eastwood turns a story that could easily have ended up as a boring linear docudrama into something very interesting. Through starting the movie AFTER the climactic event, the use of back-and-forth time jumps and focusing as much on the aftermath as the event itself, Eastwood has made something very engaging and intriguing.There is a degree of dramatic license involved, especially with regard to the NTSB hearings, but Eastwood and writer Todd Komarnicki needed a way to introduce an element of uncertainty and drama into a story with a known outcome, and that was it.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
9/10 SUPERB Well crafted storytelling,"Best film I've seen this year so far.Superb storytelling , fortunately I watched this having not known the actual story beyond the headline. It meant all the drama and revelations were real to me .Superb acting , directing and special effects . The Tom Hanks / Clint Eastwood combination was a match made in Hollywood perfection . Great supporting acting by Aaron Eckhart and Anna Gunn.A human story , a triumph over adversity , a battle against the system , huge respect for the rescue services , makes you think of the events of 11/9/01I'm a great fan of the 90 minute movie , if you can tell a story in 90 minutes why run to 120 ? And there's an added bonus in the final credits so stay around till the endBest film of 2017 so far so why have the award ceremonies overlooked it ?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
