The Indiscretions of a Child,"We are such a fragile race, so affected by the shifts of a societal breeze. A child misinterprets what she sees and brings about the destruction of people she actually loves. So caught up in her dramatic wants and angry, she lies, and that lie haunts her for her remaining days. This is a movie version of a wonderful book, the best I read that year. It captures the pain and the need to make true restitution. The truth of the matter is that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. The characters come to realize that. It's a slice of life in wartime and all the chickens come home to roost. Probably the most gut wrenching thing is that the character that causes the most damage has great success in life, but carries around her guilt to her dying day. She is never allowed to truly enjoy things. This is a really fine movie and, except for some breaks in editing, does a nice job of presenting the issues in the novel.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Better Late Than Never - Not Really!,"Comprising recognisable, realistic and outstandingly beautiful performances, set within an uncomfortably believable and heartbreakingly tragic story, it will leave a mark, a scar, a wound on your soul; especially if you have an ounce of humanity, understanding and empathy for the circumstances within which it is told.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Best adaptation of a novel ever!,"I usually don't like watching novels turned into movies (specially when I liked the novel as much as I liked McEwan's ""Atonement"") but this was a really pleasant surprise. The plot is extraordinarily well adapted, leaving out what cannot possibly be included in a two-hour film, changing very few details to translate literary language to cinematographic language but sticking to the essence and the spirit of the novel.I really believe that if you enjoyed McEwan's novel, you will fall for this beautiful film. If you have never read McEwan, you will fall for the intriguing and thrilling story written by this wonderful English novelist.Please, don't miss this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great interpretation of a wonderful novel,"I saw a preview of this film yesterday and felt privileged to be one of the first people to see the film. It was also a pleasure to see a film before reading any other critical review or opinion. I am a great fan of Ian Mcewan and was concerned that it would not be possible to capture the subtleties and nuances of Mcewan's writing but I needn't have had any worries. The director, Joe Wright and screenplay writer Christopher Hampton have done a superb job and the complexities of the novel are superbly captured with real imagination. The story is set in three main areas, an English country house in 1935, war torn France 1940 and London 1940. The atmosphere in of all three are wonderfully captured by the director, cinematographer, costume design and score and I am sure that there are going to be some Oscar nominations for these. James McAvoy as lead man gives a tremendous performance of a restrained but passionate man. I was not as convinced by Keira Knightley's performance and am not sure that her acting has the mature edge to capture the social nuances of the times that McAvoy did so successfully. Do not see this film if you like fast paced films and rapid plot development! This is not a film for the pop video generation. If however you like character development and a plot that unravels at a pace that allows you to be immersed in the atmosphere of the film then I can highly recommend Atonement as one of the best films that I have seen this year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I am not sure why Dunkirk got made when this film exists,"I deeply appreciate Atonement for other reasons and while the films are about 10 years apart I am utterly perplexed by how Nolan's Dunkirk became the critical darling it is, especially since this film exists. This film isn't about the evacuation of Dunkirk or WWII (those elements form the background for a fully realized troubled romance and family drama) and YET this film spends about 20 minutes on Dunkirk and it conveys the horror, defeat and dread of it it far sharper and more resonant than Nolan's film does for its entire run time. There is a one very long shot of soldiers on the beach that even manages to capture the whole what is time when facing your death thing better than Nolan's film.With that being said I most appreciate the soft, luminous cinematography and the very atypical score in this film. Indeed atypical flourishes-the split perspective, the inserted fiction within the narrative, what's being atoned for etc.-greatly elevate a sweeping romance that might have been too conventional if the film played it straight up. It is really the details-sometimes as small as word choice-that really make this film a ravishing epic.Doomed romances rest on their casting and I can say that both Knightley and McAvoy don't disappoint. McAvoy especially is really sexy, beautiful and emotional in this in that perfectly restrained British way. It may be his career best performance. Good film. It is much better than No Country for Old Men.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement - a feast for the eyes.,"My wife and I went to see the movie last night and were totally blown away by the whole experience. So brilliantly directed and acted. The movie time just flew by and we were drawn in and captivated by each dramatic moment. Never having read the book or been an expert on WW2, I had a truly open mind on what to expect and I'm not one of those who count every rivet or go looking for technical inaccuracies however small. This was truly a masterpiece of cinematography. We were treated to wonderful performances, lavish sets, shocking and thought-provoking moments and haunting themes. I had the privilege of being an extra in the Redcar, Dunkirk scene and once seen in its full glory and effect on the big screen I was simply in awe and glad to have been a part of it. Walking along Redcar beach from now on will never quite be the same again. I am quite sure that the movie will win a number of awards within the next 12 months, but that is not what really matters. Movies are there to entertain, tell a story and affect you emotionally and by God this did it in spades! If you have not seen it yet, you must!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Mixed bag,"At a gathering in a country house a jealous little girl meddles in her sister's love life, and things will never be the same ...From an interesting novel that had an engrossing first half but, for me, trailed off in the second. So I had a different experience with the film adaptation, where the country house scenes are not quite satisfying but the following war story is brilliantly told. The narrator is a fascinating little character, but looking back I think her motivation needed to be colder and her atonement more problematic. In the end the story is wrapped up with a talking head, which I guess was unavoidable but not the mark of a great movie.The long tracking shot on the beach at Dunkirk is amazing - not only a technical marvel (the amount of ground covered, the multiple interactions) but it creates a great sense of chaos and despair.Performances are good, and it's no wonder people raved about Ronan. The music is excellent and plays about with the rhythm of a tapping type writer. Photography too, although I didn't get the sense of oppressive heat in the first act.Overall: interesting and impressive, but some big flaws.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
How come everyone stopped looking for the little boys except Robbie?,"Unreasonable! This movie lost me when the entire dinner party went out to look for the two little boys and all but one (Robbie) continued the search after their sister Lola was found and allegedly assaulted. Come on people, sure, Lola was in bad shape and needed help, but a houseful of people standing around asking a 13-year-old what she saw? Shouldn't their priority be to find the missing boys first? They can ask all the questions and point the fingers later. Cannot believe this scene. It's one of the earlier death knells for this otherwise ho-hum movie. The Awards people must have watched a different movie than the one I rented. Thumbs WAY down.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
If this doesn't win Best Picture next year it will have been robbed!,"Its very rare that a movie like Atonement comes along and leaves me completely speechless and in complete and utter awe for hours after I have seen it. You see Atonement isn't just the best movie I have seen all year, its one of the best movies I have seen in a very, very long time. And by that I include Pan's Labyrinth, yes this movie is better than my favourite movie of 2006, and I never imagined Atonement would ever come close to that level of greatness until fifteen minutes into the movie last night. Atonement is an unusual movie, in fact its fair to say that I have never seen anything quite like it. Its a rare movie that actually I adored so much that I am going to hunt down a copy of the book tomorrow just to see the comparisons. Its not an easy movie I'll be honest, if you go in expecting something light hearted and easy to digest then you will leave the cinema feeling very cheated. This is a movie that deals with very dark things at times. No matter how much I desire to write in depth about every aspect of the movie I just can't, the movies greatest triumph is the fact that its plot is so intricately woven that if you ruin one part of the storyline to anyone then the movies impact is slightly lessened. The storyline is just brilliant, but its the climax that leaves you in store for the biggest shocker, and its this shocker that leaves you reeling long after you have left the cinema. The performances here are all spectacular, I think its fair to say that the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly shall be receiving at the very least nominations for Best Actor/Best Actress. The score is beautiful, whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves to be praised heavily. Its rare a score leaves me feeling moved, the score in this movie did that for me. That's yet another Oscar that this movie deserves to win. All in all Atonement is just perfection, I doubt you'll find a better movie this year or even for the next three years. In a time when Blockbusters get all the attention it is nice to see a small, but intelligent movie leave me in awe.As I previously mentioned the performances in this movie is simply amazing. Keira Knightly is an odd actress, while she proved herself in Pride and Prejudice, yes I have unfortunately seen that movie, she comes across as a wooden actress in films like Pirates of the Caribbean. Atonement really sees her at her best yet. Her character is different from what we've seen Knightly play before. Usually she goes for the spunky females, this time she seems more like a proper lady, albeit one that smokes constantly and is a bit stuck up for her own good. Keira Knightly excels in the earlier, more laid back sequences, but its in the later stuff, the more powerful stuff that we see just how talented an actress she truly is. Despite all my praise for Knightly she still plays second fiddle to James McAvoy. The former actor of Shameless and Narnia is on a roll lately. His excellent, although sadly overlooked performance in The Last King of Scotland still sticks firmly in memory. But his performance here is simple breathtaking. One sequence in particular where we see his acting talent come to light has to be the sequence in Dunkirk (more on that later), no words but the performance says everything. Knightly might not be certain to win an Oscar, but McAvoy surely is! Its also refreshing to see a young actress, Saoirse Ronan, not be eye gougingly irritating, but rather a superb actress. Her character, Briony, is a vital character in the movie, and for such a young actress she delivers her performance so chillingly brilliant. Unfortunately next to this brilliant performance, Romola Garai who plays an older Briony pales in comparison. Her performance is still brilliant, but not as effective nor as memorable as the younger actress.The storyline of Atonement is where the film holds most of its impact. Essentialy the film is about a lie that Briony tells, and how it affects the lives of her, Cecilia, and most importantly of all, Robbie. That's pretty much all I can and will say of the storyline. A lot more happens over the course of the movie, and a lot of stuff that you think will happen doesn't, and things you think won't happen will. The ending is a prime example of this and to be honest I didn't see it coming. The way the movie is directed is also something note. The beautiful colours of the summer house are amazing, but the way the camera moves around the house makes it even better. But the direction will be remembered for one scene in this movie, and its in Dunkirk. I mentioned this previously for the performance in that scene, what I failed to mention is that the shot is a continuous shot that lasts five minutes as we see the chaos of Dunkirk. From horses being shot to a man hanging from a ferris wheel, the sequence is shown in all its glory. It really is a powerful moment, and probably the one scene that got me closest to tears, purely because of the singing in the background, it is shocking just how amazing this sequence truly is.Overall Atonement is a perfect movie, in actual fact its a movie with pretty much no flaws whatsoever. Superb performances, beautiful direction, a script and storyline to die for. It is unlikely any film will top this for a very long time, this is something that will go down in cinema history as being a classic, and it highly deserves it inevitable status.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Amazing!!! Favourite Romantic Movie.,"I was completely stunned when I watched Atonement yesterday. From the funny lines to the sad moments, this movie does not fail to amaze me. James McAvoy is by far the shining star in this movie, endowed with unfailing charisma and absolutely adoring accent. The score was impeccable, especially the sound of the typewriter. I loved the scenes from Dunkirk, the hospital, and ,of course, the mansion. It's truly an amazing movie that I consider to be the best of 2007's. The ending was rather sad, but it fits perfectly. Keira Knightley was ineffably wonderful with her charming beauty and brilliant performance. One should really go and watch it because it's a fulfilling experience. I personally give it 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Love And Death In a Cold Climate,"The superb Ian McEwan book translated into cold beautiful images by the startling Joe Wright and scriptwriter Christopher Hampton. The result is a series of powerful rushes and abrupt stops. A pacing that, perhaps, is a bit too self conscious for its own good doesn't help us to connect the emotional dots. I had the feeling I had lost something in the love story of the protagonists - something that didn't happen to me reading the book. By the time the ""injustice"" takes place I was taken by the pain of the injustice but not by Knightley and McAvoy's liaison. Their love story is left to its own devices. The beauty of the images is overwhelming and the assuredness of Joe Wright at his second feature after the, much better, ""Pride and Prejudice"" keeps you going. The score tends to be monotonous and irritating but in spite of all that I intend to see ""Atonement"" again and I would recommend it with just the above mentioned reservations.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Suite Britianna,"A budding young writer named Briony witnesses an innocent act she doesn't fully understand between her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and long-time family servant Robbie (James McAvoy) one restless summer day on her family's lavish country estate in 1935 England that leads to scandal in Joe Wright's dreadfully sumptuous adaptation of Ian McEwan's international best-selling novel, ""Atonement."" Four years later, all three characters try to find their own personal sense of peace or redemption during WWII.This brief synopsis does nothing to explain the intricate complexities of the plot and actions that take place. Although Keira Knightley's performance is slightly off-putting due to the fact she appears like she just escaped from a concentration camp (surely young British socialites did not look like this in the 1930's), the stunning cast shows full range here racing through curious emotions: spite, lust, recklessness, and selfish wanton abandon. The facial expressions, especially from the children in the early scenes on the estate, are priceless. None of the characters are particularly sympathetic as they are often vain, self-absorbed, and quite silly in their drama, but they are fascinating to watch. The first third of the film is played like a ""Masterpiece Theater"" production of ""The Great Gatsby"" as seen through the eyes of Nancy Drew.However, what makes ""Atonement"" soar is the impeccable direction of Joe Wright. He makes the most audacious coming-of-age as an auteur since Anthony Minghella delivered ""The English Patient"" back in 1996. Wright displays a near Kubrickian mastery of sound effects (notice the strikes of the typewriter keys) that transition from scene to scene and often bleed into the amazing score from Dario Marianelli. Wright also crafts a finely textured mise-en-scene that visually translates McEwan's richly composed story onto the screen with near note perfect fashion. Nothing can really prepare you for how well directed this film is until you see it, and the scene of the three soldiers arriving on the beach at the Dunkirk evacuation is one of the greatest stand alone unedited panning long shots ever captured on film. It left me gasping.That scene leads to the heart of the film. The often clichéd romance at the core is trumped by Wright's depiction of Robbie, a single man forlorn and obsessed, his dizzying inner turmoil reflected against the grand canvas of a chaotic world at war. Likewise, Briony's redemption comes not in the too-clever conclusion at the end of the film, but in the intimate and symbolic confessional at the bedside of a dying French soldier. These moments leave lasting impressions, and left me imagining that if Joe Wright were to ever adapt Irene Nemiorovsky's ""Suite Francaise"" onto the silver screen, he would knock it so far out of the park it would leave ""Gone With Wind"" spinning in its gilded Hollywood grave.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An English Tale of Love and Redemption,"In 1930s England, Robbie is the son of a cleaning woman who has fallen in love with his mother's master's daughter (his childhood friend). On the same night where they reveal their love to each other, Robbie is accused by the woman's younger sister of a rape he didn't commit. Robbie is sent to jail and off to fight World War II... and for the remainder of the film, the two lovers try to reunite while the younger sister comes to term with the horrible mistake she made that tore her family apart.Let me be honest up front: I had a very minimal interest in this film. I was mildly interested by its Oscar aspirations (7 nominations) and then I was slightly more interested when my friend Chelsea expressed interest (with whom I ended up seeing it). A chick flick starring Keira Knightley (who, to me, is a younger, classier Winona Ryder)? Not my first choice. Although, I went to go see ""I Know Who Killed Me"", so my instincts aren't always he greatest. Anyway, point being -- I saw this film half-heartedly and really liked it.The beginning is really strong and interesting, and surprisingly funny. The involvement of a certain curse word (one of the more notorious ones) plays a big part and was funny in a somewhat awkward way. After the opening, the tone of the film turned decidedly darker... which you'd expect with a film about war and rape, I guess. Emotionally the film runs strong all the way through, working with loneliness and casualties of war (there's a scene later on with a dying French soldier that doesn't shy from showing the realities of war).Worth singling out is a very long continuous shot (maybe 8 or 9 minutes) of English troops on the shores of France. We see troops singing, troops destroying jeeps, troops shooting horses and much more... to get this all in one shot is a major feat. The last long shot I recall is in ""Children of Men"", which ran about maybe 6 minutes but with much less going on to coordinate. The choreographer (or whoever) deserved the Oscar if anyone did, although in the end it only won a single award -- for best original soundtrack (which I don't recall as being a particularly stand-out score).I think the film closed rather weakly after all the quality emotion (I can't really explain more without revealing things). But it's still a good film, only maybe losing a point from this closing. If you're a fan of period pieces or tough romance stories (this is no romantic comedy) this is for you. I don't know if I could watch it again -- it's good enough but a bit emotional. But I'm glad I saw it at least once and you should see it too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Patchy and probably underdeveloped,"I went to see this film last night. I had high expectations because it has received an extremely high vote average on the IMDb. Coupled to that I have read a couple of Ian McEwan novels, The Cement Garden, and The Comfort of Strangers. Both novels are exquisite, and McEwan is a total master of fiction. The Comfort of Strangers was a bruising read and The Cement Garden was incredibly trenchant and reminded me of my own upbringing.So I had some doubts about whether his intensity could be brought to screen (although the film of Cement Garden is rather good). I did actually groan when I saw in the first credits that the film was a Working Title production, because although I know they have a good reputation, generally speaking I hate their stuff. Far too glossy and bland.The first shot was very promising, a dolls house trompe a l'oeil and exquisitely arranged toys. The Camera pans from the house to the troupe of toy soldiers and plastic bestiary, which taper towards a desk where we see the precocious stripling Briony typing out the last words of her first play. The uncanny organisation of the toys is a powerful indication of the girl's state of mind: both fanciful and controlling. A coup de maitre worthy of McEwan. Then there is a soundtrack where the main instrument is a typewriter. A very bold strategem indeed as in my opinion cinema needs to distance itself from literature, but entirely successful.From there the level of directorial virtuosity declines rather rapidly, we see that a vat of money is used to substitute for creativity, and the audience is meant to be wowed by painstaking and yet quite beside-the-point recreations of scenes from the war. We've had all this with Gangs of New York, Saving Private Ryan, and other tepid 'masterpieces' ad infinitum.Having said that there is actually a continuous shot of Dunkirk in this film which lasts five minutes that I know will have even the most cynical of film watchers drooling. It is as a character says like a scene from the Bible, I have seen a similar looking Breughel print.However the film is meant to be a love story, and by God, it does not convince me as one. The love between Cecilia and Robbie is not properly established, and most of the other characters are cardboard cut-outs. I felt the film could have been a lot longer to enable some character development. The only fully fledged character is Briony. How I long for the days of Billy Wilder who established the journalistic character of Chuck Tatum in Ace in the Hole simply by having him strike a match on a typewriter in a very practised manner.Some of the scenes in France during the fighting I am sure would work better in the novel, in the film they are really a bit devoid of context. Finally the end of the film is a conceit that really failed to impress me, and I won't give it away but the atonement strikes me as very hollow.I think this movie tries very hard to be an epic after the fashion of The English Patient, unfortunately it becomes rather tired and generic. Having said that the source material is of such a quality and the amount of money spent seemingly so vast that the film is very enjoyable. But nowhere near a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
my review,"Well, from the trailers I could tell this would be an epic film before I was even able to see it. I managed to attend a gala screening of the film last night and I thought it was amazing. Despite my constant dislike to Keira Knightly, I was unable to disapprove of her acting in this film. She has improved massively since the first pirates film. The film itself has an intriguing plot line which keeps you hooked throughout. The film includes humour at the start and fascination by the end. I loved watching this film and I enjoyed the smartness of the story. The film is cleverly done with jumps in time and different perspectives of events throughout which will leave you understanding the motives of each character more. The music is composed beautifully, the orchestral tunes accompanied with the clatter that a typewriter makes creates a beautiful piece of music that fits perfectly with the film itself. I have since begun to read the book, the only thing that the film lacks is the character depth that a book can write about but a film simply can't explain. I feel that the film shows what happened but the book is able to explain a little more as to why the events occurred. Overall the film was beautiful, brilliant and emotional.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Review by an Antonement extra at Redcar Yorkshire,"I finished filming as an extra in the blockbuster movie Atonement on August 22nd 2006. I didn't realise I'd have to wait a full 12 months and 1 day to see the end result on screen.Well was it worth the wait? The answer is yes. The movie has the meticulous detail you would expect from a director of Joe Wright's calibre.Richard Brooks (writing in the Sunday Times) said he would be amazed if the jury finds a better film than Atonement to take first place at the Venice film festival on August 29th.He said, ""I cannot think of a better British movie in years. Unlike most of our home-grown efforts, it is big scale, yet intimate when it needs to be."" I would agree. The story unfolds and the audience is drawn into the plot from the start. It begins in pre-war England in a large country house with James McAvoy's character (Robbie Turner) being wrongly accused of rape and being imprisoned and thus separated from Keira Knightley. He is released from prison on condition he joins the army.This is a love story and more, with the back drop of the Second World War. Although it is not a war film as such, the scenes of the Dunkirk evacuation are some of the best of their type ever executed in cinema history.The scene that I was waiting to see was towards the end of the film. Joe Wright shot the Dunkirk scene in Redcar in one complete take, with no edits. It looks amazing, maybe being part of it made me slightly biased, but the human tableau that McAvoy's character walks through engulfs your senses and I can't wait to see it again. My only regret is that it wasn't longer.Apart from this, Atonement doesn't disappoint in any department, the acting is first class and the story is engaging and I certainly didn't guess the ending. I will definitely see it again, this time at the Regent Cinema in Redcar, where the building is one of the cornerstones of the great set.And finally did I see myself? Well possibly, the jury's still out, until I get my hands on the DVD next year. Enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"half the time great drama of a crisis in ego, and the other half...","Atonement is being acclaimed now as one of the best films of the year, a surefire contender for the best picture prize at the Oscars (at least, apparently, as a ""proper"" film as opposed to the crime classic No Country for Old Men). It's not hard to understand it, for a good lot of the running time; Joe Wright, the director, has taken what is an apparently beautiful book (unread by me) and transformed it into the stuff of true existential crises. It's about a young girl, Briony, who witnesses what she thought she saw as a crime. This might seem unclear at first, but it isn't, it's a clear move on the part of immediate revenge for a tryst she witnessed between her sister and a worker (Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy). He's sent to prison, then to war, where unforeseen circumstances may change everyone's lives.Doesn't sound like a bad premise, with a good dosage of romance in the mix. And for the first half hour, forty minutes it IS great film-making of a tense nature, focusing on the young girl who just wants to be the center of attention with her first play and is cut-off by family and other matters that flock away. All of this is filmed by Wright, and acted by the case, quite absorbingly, and by the end you really care what will happen to poor Robbie... But then the story takes a turn that only slightly recovers in the last ten or so minutes. Suddenly the point of view changes- which, I suppose, is also true to the book, albeit from what I've heard lopping off some bits and pieces that would have made it a longer but richer film- to Robbie fighting in the war, though not exactly 'fighting'. He walks around a lot, comes across a beach-front of soldiers (in a startling 5 minute long take no less, indulgent but effective), and yet this coupled later with the emergence of the Briony as a nurse doesn't really click for me.Yes, it should be compelling cinema to see Robbie suffering along with all the other British in the midst of the early, rough days of WW2, but what Wright shows us isn't much more compelling (or, for that matter, as well done) as any given number of war pictures of the period done in the present; even a harsh hospital scene with wounded only works so much until it's overkill. When the point of view changes it suffers, and when it finally returns to Brialy it takes some time to get adjusted back in it all (not helped by a nearly too restrained performance by Romola Garai, particularly in dramatic scenes where, whether or not they actually happened, should be believable). I may be in the minority here from the masses who are praising Atonement to the sky, but only when Vanessa Redgrave appears does the film finally offer a satisfying catharsis.It's a sad thing too, because when Atonement is at its best it's what many dramas, particularly those of this kind of period setting, seem to lack in dealing the old love-and-war story. This time real danger, caused by complete human error in youth and judgment, is in the mix, and it provides a level of interest in what will happen to the characters. That Knightly and McAvoy work so well speaks to the director's gifts. I just wished that Wright either made the film longer to make it even more of an epic feat, or knew how to deal with the change in perspective of narrative for a FILM, as opposed to in a novel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Beautiful canvas, beautiful colors, beautifully directed, beautifully acted","From Joe Wright, the acclaimed director Pride and Prejudice comes his sophomore effort, Atonement based on the best selling novel by Ian McEwan. The film tells the story of Robbie and Cecilia, two young lovers torn apart by a false accusation of young Briony, Cecilia's sister. Robbie is sent to prison and in exchange for his incarceration, he must serve in World War II for his freedom.This is technically and visually the best film of the year. The stunning cinematography by Seamus McGarvey which acts like a photographer capturing the glimpses at the doors of heaven are absolutely breathtaking. The scenery and images are all but believable as we are thrown into a time of passion, betrayal, corruption, and torment.Now, I've never been a fan of British Cinema like the next avid Oscar watcher. Never cared for Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice wasn't terrible but nothing great, Howard's End and The Remains of the Day are mediocre to me. The reason I say this is that I was feeling the way I felt about those films with Atonement for the first half. I thought was melodrama to the extreme and overly emotional and presented that it disengaged the viewer from the picture. As the film continued I felt myself being closely drawn to the performance of James McAvoy very reminiscent of Jude Law's performance in Cold Mountain but with more depth, more life, more response.The melodrama continued and all of a sudden, comes this powerful last third of Atonement. Romola Garai who plays the Briony at 18 who's performance is very responsive and spacious heats up the screen with poise and control. Garai who hasn't had success in with mediocre performances and films like Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights and Vanity Fair finally is given some scenery to chew. Inhabiting the guilt and despondency of Briony was quite a task and sincere effort to bring her to the viewer with aggression yet subtlety was great.Keira Knightley who has teamed up with Joe Wright before in his directorial debut is beautiful in elegance but nothing extroverted that makes you take her with you after the film ends. Her Romeo & Juliet story with McAvoy is the most tender parts of the movie however, disappointment is the only feeling I can describe to you, the reader, with her work here. With expectations so high maybe that was her downfall with myself.Saoirse Ronan who has been reaping all the buzz is a talent to watch in the future but alas, I can't wallow in the glory of Ronan without feeling Garai is missing out on the glory. It is the best child performance of the year by far and her curiosity and crush on Robbie is special to the film; Ronan holds her own against the other talents in the film.In the end, it's the wonderful veteran actress Vanessa Redgrave that steals the show and inhabits Older Briony which singled handedly saves the film in its entirety. All the melodrama and over zealous antics of the film were summed up in the finale and because of Redgrave it all made me swallow it a whole lot better. Redgrave holds all the tragedy of the film in her brief and final moments that encourage all of us to share in the love for all humanity. Thinking about all the things that you regret and wish you could change is the solution to the film Atonement. Atonement in the sense of the word, is needed in all our lives as the one thing that is a necessity but everyone hesitates to take. The film is a work of art.Grade: ***½/****",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Beautiful to watch, and very well done as an adaptation.","I read the book and watched the film recently, and I really liked them both. The book is beautifully written, with flawless narrative detail, though at first it isn't very easy to sink your teeth into. The film on the other hand is beautiful to watch, wonderful cinematography and excellent period detail. The music was quite nostalgic, and I suppose positively hypnotic. The screenplay was wonderful to start with, but the last part's narrative did lose its way a little, and despite the fact that I thought Briony's portrayal was fine on the most part, when she first finds that Lola is being hurt by who she suspects is Robbie, I didn't find her as comforting as she was in the book. The library scene I thought was more believable in the book, it just felt thrown in in the film. I will say, the performances were wonderful, with Kiera Knightly at her loveliest and James McAvoy very handsome and heroic as the two lovers who embark on a complex love relationship. Also worth of note are the performances of two great actresses, Vanessa Redgrave and Harriet Walter, who didn't disappoint here. Atonement is beautifully done, well performed, and fairly faithful as an adaptation. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Oscar movie of 2008,"This is Oscar material. Best Picture material to be exact. That's not necessarily saying that ""Atonement"" is something special. It is a beautiful film based on a very sad novel. Direction and stage design are solid, as are the performances. And that's about the most that can be said about this movie. It's just a classic Oscar contender in the vein of ""The Cider House Rules"", but doesn't really have many new things to offer conceptually or visually. There's one really masterful long tracking shot in the movie, but actually I thought it was kind of unnecessary, as if it had just been there for the director of photography to show off a bit.I don't want to sound too negative, though, as this movie is actually very good and totally worthwhile seeing. Still, if you're looking for more original films that came out this year, you'd be better off seeing ""Across The Universe"" or ""Into The Wild"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
bringing the literary to the screen,"In answer to the question as to whether Atonement could be adapted successfully for the screen; the answer has to be...almost, but not quite. McEwan's brilliant novel with its themes of redemption and morality could never transfer perfectly but writer Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright, give it a damn good try.Starting in 1935 the film follows a doomed romance and how an over-imaginative girl's actions affect the lives of those around her. The film is stylish and intriguing, but, ultimately the novel's emotional gut-punch can't be delivered as successfully on film and its up to an uneasy coda to clarify everything for those who haven't read the novel.Despite its limitations this is a very enjoyable film with some remarkable set-pieces and an intelligence that raises it above the run-of the-mill period romance film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"My Baby, He Wrote Me a Letter","Greetings again from the darkness. Teaming up again after ""Pride and Prejudice"" are director Joe Wright and the finally maturing Keira Knightley. This time they tackle Ian McEwan's monster novel and for the most part deliver a tense, emotional ride.Knightley and James McAvoy (""The Last King of Scotland"") are very good and very believable together, but the ""star"" of the film is Knightley's wicked lil sis played by three actresses - Saoirse Ronan (age 13), the weak link of Ramola Garai (age 18) and a perfectly cast Vanessa Redgrave as the elder Briony wrapping the story up for the viewer in a TV interview for her final novel. By the way, the interviewer in that scene is ""The English Patient"" director Anthony Minghella.Not to give anything away, but normally the story is what makes a film enjoyable for me. Here, I actually admired the film's structure and delivery of the story ... definitely not dumbed down the way so many book-to-movie projects are. Certainly the middle of the film drags a bit as McAvoy wanders through the countryside and 18 yr old Briony pays her penance as a war nurse, but the first 45 minutes of the film are truly outstanding.Just a warning, this is not the feel good, sappy Hollywood garbage that many think it is. Many scenes are extremely uncomfortable to watch and I heard more than a few sniffles coming from the crowd. The score is outstanding and expertly conveys depth to many scenes ... especially the remarkable long cut as McAvoy walks through the beach camp for soldiers.Excellent support work from Brenda Blethyn and Benedict Cumberbatch (""Amazing Grace""), and again the elegant Ms. Redgrave perfectly captures Briony's struggle for the truth and redemption and ""atonement"".",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"An epic tale of lust, love, war, and guilt with remorse.","""Atonement"" is clearly a fine work of art on screen that's greatly influenced by literature. It has all the classic elements of literature and classic prose from lust, love, war, and in the end the central character writer Briony Tallis feeling guilt and remorse for a false accusation. The film will clearly bring out emotions especially if your genre of choice is romance and passionate love, yet you will have wished for more proved truth and justice to have happened earlier in the film even though it's revealed in the end.Set in the mid 1930's in England the film has a classy and elegant setting like all British films you feel the grace of the family. You quickly become swept up by the beginning and desire for dreams as little young darling Briony Tallis(Saoirse Ronan)is caught up in a world of plays, imagination and stories she wants to happen ranging from joy to love. Her older sister is looked upon from her as an inspiration Cecilia Tallis(Keira Knightley)a young lady who's eager for love and romance escape by desire and pleasure. Only young Briony sees an unpleasant and uneasy sight from Cecilia's new love interest as dashing Robbie Turner's ambition for lust will soon send him on an unpleasant and long journey that will make him struggle for love and happiness.As ""Atonement"" spans thru time into war of the gruesome blood and death that Robbie sees while fighting as a solider, Briony's story unfolds as the time changes with her sister growing up and moving on to nurse school and Briony herself with take the same job path. All along the flashbacks of love and joy are presented so well only like a classic work of literature it reveals the painful truth of justice and honesty in the end as we see an old and aging Briony who has it all wrapped up in her last and greatest and most soul truth searching novel piece. You the viewer should finally feel the truth and justice.Overall ""Atonement"" is a good film I will not call it great because the war and romance genre isn't my favorite, yet it still has enough classic literary elements like lust, love, and the search for truthful justice to make it interesting and enjoyable to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Commendable movie.,"I don't believe it. Indeed, I'm amazed. This movie is actually good. A Hollywood romance movie that is actually watchable. Amazing. Shocking. Refreshing. I was expecting the usual Hollywood potboiler garbage - inane love story, major historical events being reduced to mere cinematic footnotes, laughable acting, ludicrous miscasting, etc. In other words, I was expecting a piece of junk, but thankfully my expectations were not met. This is a powerful movie with a compelling story and excellent acting. If I can't bring myself to rag this movie, then this movie has to be good. As a movie buff who has critiqued scores of movies, I've watched some major cinematic clunkers, stuff that doesn't even merit a DVD, cinematic flotsam that are a joke. This movie however is a work of art and warrants whatever commendations it gets from the public.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The best film of the year,"The film is also technically superb. The cinematography is outstanding, with beautiful shot compositions on a hot summer's day to a war torn France. The most forefront achievement though is a scene that displays the English army's evacuation to Dunkirk. The scene (which lasts close to ten minutes) follows Robbie through an entire beach front filled with hundreds of soldiers, all of which is captured in a single shot. It is truly an achievement as the scene is both harrowing and mesmerizing. The musical score also deserves merits for its originality. Composed by Dario Marianelli, the music incorporates key sound effects (notably the type writer of Briony's) into musical themes. It really is rather clever works very well.Even with all of its technical mastery (writing, music, editing, cinematography), the film's strongest assets are from its performers. The character of Briony, played by three actresses at different ages (Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave), is acted to near perfection. All three actresses (especially 13 year old Ronan) bring their A-game in represented a very complicated character. Keira Knightley though really finds a role to sink her teeth into as this is by far her best performance. Cecilia, who on paper may just seem like a supporting character, is taken to the level of leading lady by Miss Knightley. However, the film's strongest performance goes to James McAvoy as Robbie. Most film fans will recognize him as Mr. Tumnus from The Chronicles of Narnia, but here he gets to show how good he really is. His character of Robbie represents the best in human nature and will draw the strongest connection with audiences. McAvoy brings to him a sincerity that makes one of the strongest performances of the year. Mr. McAvoy is quickly on his way to stardom, and right so.This is a film that really works on every level. The first act of the film is arguably the strongest. The scenes at the country house have a great sense of realism and honesty to them; you feel like you are there with the characters (very hard to do in a period piece). Joe Wright's masterful direction gives Atonement the sweep of an epic but the scope of a deep and personal character drama. It is a brilliant and moving story that will pull at your heart-strings and leave you shaken by its ending. Don't be surprised to hear its name a lot come Oscar time, it is the best of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A work of art...,"Crafted in Britain by director Joe Wright, Atonement tells the story of young author Briony Tallis who becomes jealous of her older sister's illicit love affair with a servant. And with this, she finds a love letter meant for Cecilia (her sister) written by the servant Robbie Turner and misconstrues it as a letter written with sadistic-perverted undertones when in reality it was a second draft that Robbie deemed to silly to use. Briony assumes that Robbie is a nymphomaniac and it is with this notion that she accuses Robbie with the rape of her younger sister. Upon hearing this, the Tallis family has him arrested and he ends up in World War II whilst Cecilia winds ups being a nurse. The rest of the movie revolves around Robbie trying to find his way back to Cecilia and also displays the cathartic process that Briony faces upon reaching adolescence and realizing the life-changing mistakes that she made. Atonement is sort of stuck in the middle in regards to whether it renders primarily on emotion or story. It is based on an Ian McEwen novel, so it does use some story elements in the latter segment of the film, such as when the story falls into the 'war-romance'-type category. The first half however feels highly eastern-oriented with well-placed shots around staircases and through windows that draw us into the secret love affair that Cecilia and Robbie have undertaken. The first part of the movie feels almost like a different film altogether. It feels quite artsy in spots and a lot of shots do not help to push the story forward. Having only seen two of Wright's films (Pride and Prejudice being the other) it's hard to lump his style into being specifically east or west. Pride and Prejudice had a lot of eastern elements in its use of detailed steady cam shots that follow its main characters around the sprawling English countryside. Atonement also has this, with an amazing 10-minute long steady cam shot that follows Robbie on a beach through the after effects of war. The shot is so magnificent that you forget about the lack of cutting and you start to feel as if you can taste the acrid flavor of rusted steel on a battleship or the stolid stench of soldiers' breath and spent bombs. The shot is very well choreographed as well as we see literally hundreds of extras that weave in and out of frame, each doing their own duty. Joe Wright uses background action nicely to tell different stories of different people without even giving them lines. Just watch the steady shot as it follows Robbie past a somber-looking band play a waltz or as he shoves into another soldier; a very well executed shot indeed. This shot does have an eastern-feel to it as it does not push the story forward but focuses on allowing the audience to see through the eyes of the main character. Editor Paul Tohill does a great job as well; his editing is never too fast paced but doesn't lag behind either. When he splices, he makes sure that we have enough time to fully incorporate ourselves within the basis of a shot. Again, his lack of editing in the steady camera scene helps to reinforce this. This can also be seen by assessing the scene that takes place near the end when Briony has come back to apologize to Cecilia and Robbie. His edits are now quick and slightly robust and help move the story along as we feel and see the tension-filled apartment room. The medium shot of Robbie when he almost decks Briony is tremendously powerful.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Visual Masterpiece.,"It isn't often that a film comes along and sweeps me away into a trance of beauty that lingers hours later like a delicate but potent perfume--that was the brilliant, epic film, Atonement.We arrived at the theatre quite early as we usually do to claim our favorite seats, near the top and right on the aisle (I have to have an aisle seat because I have the bladder of a newborn baby). Being an independent movie I was somewhat surprised to see how full the place was filling up. I know that it has been critically acclaimed and has been nominated for a piles of awards but I still expected the theatre to be sparse do to the attraction of the National Treasure sequel. So I was surprised (and happy) to see so many people interested in an independent flick. But they kept piling in all the way until and into the previews. I haven't seen a theatre house that full since Titanic when we literally sat in the aisle to see it.So, enough of my blathering--let's talk a bit about this visual masterpiece, shall we? Where to begin? Well, I've been thinking about what to say about a movie that blew my mind. It has taken me about 4 hours to put my brain back together again enough to write about this piece of art.This film is really a like a three part play that grabs your attention in a shocking way and leads you down a tantalizing path of wonder, surprise, fear, anger, sadness and relief all the way to the credits. The dialog is minimal so much of the story is told through body language, cinematography and music. The cinematography is sweeping in capturing the grandeur of the scenes while maintaining focus on the main characters and important elements of the movie. The visuals were stunningly vivid and very memorable, even now as I'm typing I'm still going over these amazing images in my mind. The sets were meticulous in their authenticity and style. Yes, this movie was nothing less then poetry on film, watch for the Dunkirk scene in particular. It is no understatement to say that the visuals in this film swept you away and made you feel as if you were living the story with the characters. Each scene was a masterpiece in and of itself so that at the end of every one of them you feel the anticipation of reading the book and quickly turning the page to see what happens next. There were some very artsy long-shots in this film and they worked because of the detailed and awesome size of the sets.The body language was intense, expressive and utterly human. Ascending star, James Mcavoy, who played Robbie was brilliant in his body language, you could really feel his restrained yet passionate nature. I didn't feel that Keira Kightley matched his energy but she gives a better performance here in this film then her dreadful performances in the Pirates franchise. This leads me to the young starlet, Saoirse Ronan who played a very complex, deeply dysfunctional character who felt more mature and intelligent then she actually was and learns a powerful lesson for it. Her facial expressions and intense eyes left an imprint on the memories of this movie that I'm recalling.This brings us to the score, which stuck to a select few songs but it worked quite well as it kept with the films focused, intense mood. One song in particular acted like another character, a storyteller which arrived now and then to sweep us along to the next grandiose scene. It was subtle in its elegance but then not all that glitters is gold, sometimes the most beautiful thing is the one most over-looked by the majority--the cliché, ""diamond in the rough."" As you can tell I am wacko over this movie and give it a 10 out of 10. Seriously. If this one doesn't win the Oscar for Best Picture then it will be a tragedy. I can't recommend this one enough, unless you aren't into intense, subtle, artsy fartsy, complex love stories.I think the thing that is sticking with me the most is that this movie reflects the strange reality that we as humans are fated to experience, and perhaps that is why I related to it so much. Unlike most movies, life is full of unexpected twists and turns and this movie captures that essence like no other that I've seen in a long, long time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Unforgivable!,"'Atonement' is one of those films, which leaves you in complete awe of what you have witnessed as soon as you have finished it.It is based on Ian McEwan's novel, which tells the story of how tragedy inflicts the lives of three people as a result of a child's vindicative lie. This film is powerful and heart breaking, which is also beautifully written and has a stellar cast. I must admit, I haven't seen that much of Kiera Knightley but she looked stunning in the film, and James Mcavoy was as always on top form. However the film is largely based around 'Briony Tallis', and the young Briony is superbly played by Saoirse Ronan. She was brilliant as the confused and jealous teenager who inadvertently changes the lives of those closest to her. The film feels like a journey from reckless youth to reflective old age where nothing remains except regrets. The film has many iconic scenes, which have been taken from McEwan's highly rated novel that I ordered as soon as I finished the film. The cinematography in the early part of the film is breath-taking before it moves to the bleak setting of World War II. So convincing is the film's depiction of battle that many consider this a war film more than a love story. However, 'Atonement' cannot be labelled within a single genre, it's too complex for that. This film serves as a life lesson that some mistakes are so grave, they are unforgivable even if a lifetime is spent atoning for them. Here lies the tragedy of this story. 'Atonement' is classic cinema at its best! I now look forward to reading the novel.@zulfmanauthor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Well worth Seeing!!,"As a longtime movie buff, but a novice IMDb comment writer, I approach this with a little perspective and a little intimidation. I also went to see this movie not having read the novel and deliberately avoiding any detailed reviews of its plot. The result: I found the movie overall to tell its story absolutely amazingly well, especially its outstanding beginning! The portrayal of the early events that form the basis of this movie accomplish what only happens rarely - immerse one completely into the story and into its characters. Awards to all involved but most especially the director, screenwriter, and editor. High artistic risks were taken by very talented folks acting on both their muse and the full potential of their talents to produce something rarely seen these day - mirabile visu - a film well worth seeing!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Absolutely Stunning,"I have been waiting to see this movie for a very long time and today I finally got to see it. I had been trying not to get too excited in case it didn't live up to my expectations, but I needn't have worried. The movie absolutely blew me away.First off, it was filmed beautifully. Joe Wright really has a talent for using the natural surroundings to his advantage, I also loved that in Pride and Prejudice. The now-famous Dunkirk scene was just stunning. I was really excited to see that after all I had heard and it was just amazing. Wright really captured the anti-glory of the war when WWI is often characterized by the initial euphoria of all parties involved that war had come, then the steep disillusionment that followed. I was so glad that he did the shot as one long continuous take, it was excellent.Now, the performances. Starting with the most attention-getting, Keira Knightley did a fabulous job as Cecilia. I've read the novel and I felt that she really embodied the character. Saoirse Ronan was the most perfect young Briony. She's gotten a lot of attention as well and she fully deserves it, she was fantastic as the self-centered, ignorant, spoiled little rich girl. I felt, however, that the movie truly belonged to James McAvoy. He was so heartrending and incredible as Robbie. True, he and Keira Knightley didn't have a ton of crackling chemistry, but his earnestness and her eagerness make you really believe and feel for them.The writers did a great job adapting Ian McEwan's sprawling novel, and they did an excellent job showing the introspectiveness that the novel conveys. Of course it's hard to get so deeply inside of each character's head the way the novel does, but the movie does an excellent job without feeling rushed or choppy. As with Pride and Prejudice, they clipped the unnecessary but kept the heart of the story.All in all, it was an excellent, amazing movie, my definite favorite of the year and very worth seeing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Give me a break, no Briony accountability?","How did nobody, especially Knightly, slap Briony in the side of the head and call her a liar? These are huge consequences.

But hinging an entire epic on the words of a young girl smacks of burning witches in Salem. Ridiculous.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Talk about overrated,"With so many people raving about how incredible this film was I went to see it with high expectations. I wish I had not bothered. To call it over rated would be an understatement.To start with why are we so obsessed with class war in this country. NOT every single person from the aristocracy was a bigoted upper class twit. We won two World War with a military led by people from those classes so they could not all have been bad. (And NO they were not all poetry writing closet homosexuals either - see most First World War offerings). Yes there were some snotty idiots but to brand everyone as such would be like labelling every working class person as a foul mouthed yob/football hooligan. This whole subject is getting so utterly boring.From a historical perspective 'Atonement' leaves a lot to be desired. About halfway through the film we see a Lancaster fly overhead. The prototype of this aircraft did not fly until 1941, NOT the mid 1930s.Next we move to Dunkirk, where they got the date wrong. Dunkirk was 1940. At one point during the retreat to Dunkirk James McAvoy and some fellow soldiers are seen spending the night in an abandoned building. (This is over a lit candle on a dry wooden floor covered with combustible material......nice one guys). These men are alarmed by the arrival of some French civilians bringing food as they initially thought they were Germans. If James McAvoy and friends were that worried about Germans why did they not post a sentry and blanket out the windows??? As a soldier let alone an infantryman one of the first things you are taught in training is the importance of posting sentries and basic noise and light discipline!!!The scenes of Dunkirk beach were for me the final straw. Whoever designed the set not only tried to cram far too much in, but has clearly never served in the armed forces. Amongst the biggest howlers were the anti aircraft guns that were too close together with no attempt made to protect them or their crews. This is at a time when the Dunkirk beaches were being hammered daily by German aircraft, especially the dreaded Stuka dive bomber. Secondly the soldier siting the Vickers machine gun has not only made no attempt to conceal his position, (why not use one of the buildings) but if he had ever fired the weapon from that position he would have only hit his own men.Finally, where on earth did the black guy come from? People may argue symbolism, (which can go quite well with accuracy) but in reality there were no British African Regiments at Dunkirk. The Kings African Rifles, the Nigeria Regiment and other African units did fight with distinction in WWII but this was later on and in Africa the Middle East and Burma NOT Dunkirk in 1940.If there was an award for most overrated film of the year 'Atonement' would be a clear winner. If you like historically inaccurate drippy yarns about injustice and class war you will love it. If you do know something about history or have served in the military you will be biting a large hole in your lip. How this film won the BAFTA's best film of the year over other films such as 'The Lives of Others' is a mystery.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Essential Movie Viewing,"I saw Attonement sitting at the very front of the cinema, in the row where even when you slouch you cannot see the whole of the screen. This horrible disadvantage when seeing a movie did not lessen or do anything to impede my enjoyment of Attonement, this testifies just how good this film really is.Attonement is set in the early 1900s and begins in an idyllic English house with a handful of characters. We first meet Briany (Saoirse Ronan)a young imaginative girl who then proceeds to lead us too the other characters in a series of quick scenes. She greets Robbie the (James Mcavoy) very briefly before we also get the first meeting with the other main character Cecilia (Keira Knightly).Through a series of misconceptions and assumptions on Brianys behalf, she convinces herself that Robbie is a sex maniac and not too be trusted. As of such when an assault takes place near the house, she tells the police that Robbie is the culprit, she testifies against him, and he is sent too prison (chossing later to go too war instead) It's good to finally see a movie that does not treat the audience as six year old, instead it leaves the audience too notice the small, subtle details that are pivotal too the plot. By making this assumption, it makes the viewing experience more enjoyable as you begin too have to pick up and Analise peoples reactions, eyes and overall their characters to figure who is too be trusted and who is hiding under a phisade.I also enjoyed this movie because of it's ability too make the whole thing seem so realistic. A mid way tracking shot of Dunkirk Beach is particularly effective in making it all seem so very real and haunting. The performances are top quality, James Mcavoy in particular juggles a complex role and breaks out with some truly mesmerizing acting moments. Attonement is ultimately a story of love, and really does not stray from this main plot. It's about a couple deeply in love, whom are separated, then against all odds they must get back too each other, very sentimental I know, but still it never seemed that way. The way it was filmed, written and acted did not let it become sentimental either, almost like a Shakespearian tragedy.The Writing in Attonement is of absolute quality, it is convincing, believable and the end monologue left me stunned. This is a deep movie, that is deserving all off the credit it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Beautiful, Moving, Utterly Captivating Story of the Greatest Generation","I saw this movie today the day after it opened here in general release. And I think this is the best movie I've seen in a long time.The visuals captured me from the first frame. What an amazing series of scenes: a beautiful late 1930s English country estate; wartime France; Dunkirk; wartime London. Every scene appeared perfectly composed, perfectly filmed, with perfect colors and sights and sounds. Authenticity and beauty were captured on every single frame of this movie. The attention to detail was exquisite without becoming at any point distracting. If there's such a thing as perfect cinematography and perfect lighting and perfect editing, this movie must come about as close to achieving these ideals as I for one can imagine. In fact, if this movie had had no dialog at all, I think I would have sat enthralled by the absolutely amazing visuals, from beginning to end.The story, though, was captivating in a special way. Special because of course we all know from the trailer what the basic plot is, and although there are important twists as things proceed, on the whole, we're watching a movie the storyline of which we already know. There's a special pleasure to watching something unfold like this, and I love the way the story was conveyed almost as much as I love the story itself. Deft flashbacks, with changes of point of view, convey so much of the richness of the story.To me, the interaction between the characters and their context is what made the whole story so fascinating. Here we have really very narrow parameters laid down and our characters must make their choices within those parameters with consequences of personal enormity for each of them. The film conveys the Character--Context interaction in an especially fine way by showing & repeating again and again. Sometimes the repetition comes through flashback: for example, in the fountain scene. Sometimes it comes through interleaving points of view: for example, near the beginning, when Cecilia and Robbie are thinking about each other. Most fascinating to me is when the repetition comes through a sort of deft camera's wheeling slowly and deliberately through a scene, following characters moving this way and that: for example, the amazing Dunkirk sequence.A key theme of the movie, as we all know from the trailer, is What's Real and What's Not. And this is played upon in so many wonderfully delightful ways. There are so many scenes through windows, and sights in mirrors, and POV shots up and down hallways and through fields; typewritten pages retyped and retyped and retyped. What we see, what we think we see, and what we do about what we see, or think we see, are all so intimately bound up with who we are: and this is expressed from beginning to end with a sense of authenticity and beauty that was for me just extraordinary.The characterizations and performances were just wonderful throughout this movie. James McAvoy's Robbie Turner was excellent. Keira Knightly's Cecilia Tallis was solid and convincing. Saorise Ronan as the young, 13 year old Briony Tallis was just extraordinary for her age I hope that we see more of this young talent. All of the supporting actors and actresses were first rate. Special props should go to Vanessa Redgrave for her affecting and very convincing cameo as the elderly Briony.Now I do have two criticisms that (to be honest) may or may not be reasonably laid at the doorstep of this movie.One is that to me, the build up to the arrest felt like it *may* have been somewhat long. Maybe a little shorter would be better. Maybe.Also, from time to time, I plain old had problems making out what was being said. I don't know if this is because I was simply so overwhelmed by the visual imagery that I wasn't paying as much attention to the dialog as I usually would. Or maybe the audio in my theater may have been a little off.But these are really minor drawbacks to the movie, if they are drawbacks to the movie at all. Again, I'm just not sure. To me this is simply a splendid, wonderful, and captivating movie no less.Before I close, I have something to say on a personal note.My father & mother were both members of ""The Greatest Generation"" - the WWII generation which is depicted with such extraordinary clarity in this movie. My father was a soldier in WWII. My mother waited on the Home Front as she waited for him to come home. I take away from this movie a very strong sense that this is a true and authentic representation of what that period of time was like for this generation. I come away from this movie with a deep, deep, deep feeling of sheer gratitude for this generation. For the last half of the movie, I simply could hardly stop crying; and left the theater crying as well: tears of joy and gratitude and of sadness at the passing of this amazing generation.All in all, then, if you want to see an amazing period piece about the extraordinary and ordinary people of the Greatest Generation, set in the late 1930s  1940s: please, see this movie. It is absolutely one of the most delightful and authentic human tales of the World War II generation that I've ever had the privilege of experiencing. And the movie conveys its story with the most lovely, most beautiful, most affecting images that I have seen in years, perhaps decades.As I feel deep gratitude for this generation, I feel deep gratitude to Director Joe Wright and everyone who brought this movie to us.

The movie unfolds and envelopes you with a complex plot with a sudden shift at the end. If you've read the book, you know what happens; nonetheless, the movie is worth seeing if only for its absolutely pitch-perfect depiction of the characters, environments, and situations. (Actually, I gained an insight into the book by watching the movie, which for me is extremely rare.) I don't give tens - a movie would have to basically be the Second Coming for that to happen - so this 9 is about as good as it gets.By the way, the version I saw here in the UAE was bowdlerized; if you're looking for that crucial scene that was snipped, search YouTube for ""Atonement"" and ""GQ.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Power of Words,"A brief, misplaced note, an epic novel meant to cleanse scarred souls, the knowledge that what is written and what is said can both kill and heal - and it all begins with the sound of typewriter keys clacking against white paper, preparing the viewer for the cataclysmic events to unfold.Director Joe Wright has created the most breathtaking and tragic film of the last decade, an event that is magnificent and intimate at the same time, one that marries sweeping cinematic visuals with the most personal and nuanced acting performances of the year.Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy are astounding as the doomed lovers, their mature performances defying their youth. Saoirse Ronan is nothing short of spectacular as precocious Briony Tallis, the child with the vivid imagination who sets the film's events in motion. As 18-year old Briony, Romola Garai carries a lifetime of anguish on her face. And although Vanessa Redgrave has less than five minutes of total screen time, her heartbreaking soliloquy is like a punch to the gut that will have even the most hardened souls choking back the tears and leaving no one doubting that Redgrave is among the finest actresses alive today.The brilliant cinematography of Seamus McGarvey, the tense musical score of Dario Marianelli (who ingeniously integrates clacking typewriter keys into his compositions), and the beautifully detailed vintage costuming by Jacqueline Durran form a ""perfect cinematic storm,"" enveloping the viewer both visually and emotionally.When the screen fades to black and the credits begin to roll, but the audience remains seated and silent, you know you've got a winner, and that's exactly what happens with ""Atonement,"" a near perfect achievement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Would you have forgiven her?,"Wright shows us a beautiful, intriguing and dark painting called 'Atonement'. Based on Ian McEwan's novel, is based on three principal characters and how a lie told by one of them changes all three of their lives forever. The character Briony is one of the most interesting characters in recent cinema. While the story is impactful, 'Atonement' is also marvelous to look at. The frames, the amazing cinematography (especially long shots e.g. set in Dunkirk, closeups and underwater shots), the music and the sets and locations are more than impressive and highly add to the poetry of the story.The complex characters in demand strong performances. Sadly, Keira Knightley does not impress. I've never thought of her as a great actress. Here, she just lacks the nuances of a woman of that time (the film is set in the 30s) and she seriously needs to eat. James McAvoy is great. Child actress Saoirse Ronan is brilliant (certainly not the irritating child performances we so often see in films). She underplays her part with a certain dignity. Romola Garai is phenomenal in a briefer role. Supporting cast, that includes Gina McKee, Brenda Blethyn and Vanessa Redgrave, is good (as the aforementioned actresses have hardly ever disappointed).'Atonement' is cleverly told from two different perspectives, that of what really happened and what Briony thinks/imagined. At times, it the film's sudden shift of gear (e.g. switching to the war scenes) feels odd but it comes to an almost full circle towards the end. I found the smoking habit of the characters (which was sort of in your face) annoying. Also, at times, the pacing was very slow. The ending is quite profound and it is left for the viewers to interpret and to seek an answer to a question that will definitely stay in mind long after the film's ended. In one word, I'd describe this film as a brilliant piece of work.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Lavish historical fiction, unmoving drama","Atonement beautifully and lovingly reconstructs the high life of the British aristocracy between the wars and the early, dark days of World War II. Unfortunately, there is much less to it than meets the eye. While the filmmaker clearly wishes us to feel a profound sense of horror and injustice at the false accusation laid against an innocent man which rests at the heart of the film, I couldn't help but feel that somehow the real horror was that this charge was laid against someone who was model handsome and well-educated, and that the punishment he suffered was relatively light by contemporary American standards. Nor could I feel anything at all for the girl whose efforts to atone for these accusation give the film its name, in large part because her initially interesting and lively character is replaced mid film by a zombie-like creature whose sole expression is a vacant stare. The film is redeemed from near triviality by a rather ingenious deus ex machina. Still, for me at least, it worked only as lavishly illustrated historical fiction, and not as drama.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
wonderful,"As a huge fan of Ian McEwan's novel, I was originally anxious as to how any film could accurately portray it, and not a little jealous as I had decided it my destiny to write the screenplay. However, Joe Wright exceeded my already reasonably high expectations (he did well on Pride and Prejudice) and delivered a masterpiece. Briony, a 13-year old girl, has an extremely fertile imagination, and has been writing stories from a very young age. At the beginning of the film, she has just completed her first play, and is learning the difficulties that follow this, i.e., actor trouble and worries about rehearsals. It is clear early on that Briony has slightly egocentric tendencies. For one, all her toy animals face her writing desk, where she is usually to be found. So when her older Cecelia and her friend Robbie finally start their long anticipated relationship, Briony has misinterpreted the signals that led to it, and believes Cecelia to be the victim of a predator. And so she tells a lie that will ruin the couple's chance of happiness. Years later, Robbie has been sent off to war, Cecelia is a nurse, and Briony a trainee nurse, trying to atone for what she did four years ago. We have star acting from all of the main cast, and to be honest, I really loved Robbie's army buddy, whose final line finally brought out my long held back tears. Keira Knightly looked lovely, and has finally moved on from coming-of-age roles to Woman, and may I say she does it beautifully! All three actresses who played Briony did so just right for her age, especially Vanessa Redgrave. James McAvoy, however, delivered a stunning performance- from quite comic humour as he realises a rather embarrassing letter mix-up to seething with anger as he shouts at a humbled Briony. Atonement has already been predicted as a huge Oscar winner, and I can definitely back that.I would definitely recommend this film and give it ten stars.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Mixed Feelings,"At this point, I have seen too many great films to be enchanted by long and beautiful shots accompanied by moving music. And I agree, Atonement was visually beautiful. But many scenes dragged on long after it conveyed both the plot and emotions. The final scene was a painfully abrupt change of tone. The acting of both the Bryony's was excellent. And McAvoy was great as expected (but Last King of Scotland topped). The manipulation of time with young Bryony was well done in that it conveyed the childhood innocence and juvenile misinterpretations. A movie I would recommend with similar setting is ""A Very Long Engagement."" Overall: Entertaining, very emotional, and well acted.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Well made....and most unpleasant.,"If you are feeling depressed, I would not advise you to watch ""Atonement"", as the film is very slow and sad...and might make your depression worse.

Additionally, starting at the Dunkirk portion, the film also is a bit disjoint....as if there is more to the story but there wasn't enough time to say it all.

A Director's Masterpiece,"""Atonement"" is a major achievement of the year, as it transforms the complex words of Ian McEwan's psychological novel into esthetic cinematic greatness, making us feel different feelings and ultimately creating three intriguing atmospheres, the first being an intricate portrait of the lives of a family, the second being an intense yet realistic look at war and the third showing us a flawed, selfish woman full of regret for the actions that she once committed and the causes that they committed in the lives of others. Whether these three atmospheres can differ in experimental styles, they are parallel to each other, allowing a certain rhythm to the story without being incoherent.""Atonement"" begins with Briony Tallis writing ""The Trials of Arabella"" on her typing-machine. When she finishes writing it, she goes up and looks for her mom, while an intriguing score plays in the background (it is a mix of a haunting music with the sounds of her typing-machine marking the rhythm). This is how the tragic story begins. As this story advances, Briony witnesses the mysterious actions of Robbie Turner. She sees him making love with her confused and disorganized sister Cecilia. She then becomes witness of a horrible crime which she doesn't understand but she thinks she does, and falsely accuses Robbie Turner because of what he did earlier. Because of her interpretation of mature things, she separates Robbie and Cecilia. Robbie goes to war and Cecilia leaves the Tallis house and becomes a nurse, as she waits for her lover to be with her.Christopher Hampton portrays a faithful adaptation of the picture's source material with his exquisite screenplay. The book has many segments of descriptions, mainly of the character's thoughts and feelings. It is a challenge to transform these thoughts and feelings into the cinematic language but Hampton managed to stay original by transforming them into images rather than going safe by making an omniscient narration. The book also shows the perspective of the three principal characters, and Hampton stayed true to this. He individually shows these perspectives instead of making an obvious omniscient view (some scenes are repeated so that the audience can observe the perception of every character).Joe Wright, the director of the amusing though simple ""Pride & Prejudice"", outdoes himself with this motion picture. The directing is pretty much the most valuable aspect of this picture, as it conveys extraordinary executions of diverse feelings and of mood. There are many essential scenes were the directing is key, such as the smart sex scene. The shots are very detailed, showing the lips and body parts of the two principal characters and leaving us seduced. Another exhaustive scene is the long shot that follows Robbie Turner. This long shot creates a slow rhythm, as slow and tiresome as what Robbie is feeling. He is full of desperation, hunger and he is tired because of the war. This shot conveys these aspects without having to use dialogue to explain the situation of this character.This picture also possesses some visually stunning images because of the complex cinematography and the detailed art direction. The set decoration of the aristocratic Tallis mansion is impeccable, as it is full of diverse colors and breathtaking British antiques which contrast with the pale colors of the French beach and the burned houses during the war. The cinematography is also impeccable. In the previously mentioned sex scene, the cinematography has to capture some very close shots of the different body parts of the characters and with very little light to maintain true to the mood that the scene must have. The scene is able to show us the impact that it was supposed to perceive.The performances of the film are restrained but powerful. James McAvoy simply shines as Robbie Turner. He has a tough character development, as he has to bring a transformation to the screen, from being a seductive gardener who's finishing his studies to feeling physical pain because of war. He brings his character to life and his rage scenes portray the emotion that they were supposed to. Keira Knightley also plays a complex role. While some of her dialogue can be a little typical, such as the lines of ""I love you. I will wait for you"", she is still able to convey a confused character experiencing for the first time her sexuality and how this event becomes a true passion. Vanessa Redgrave was extraordinary in her final scene, playing the old and flawed Briony Tallis with remorse and full of demons, during her last days of life. She is the weight of the final scene and her revelation watered my eyes in the end.While some persons usually complain because films aren't why they used to be, ""Atonement"" simply shows that true masterpieces with character development and extraordinary directing can still be made. It is a motion picture that touches many different aspects, from emotions to class, from passion to war. It shows literature with images and not with words and it conveys irresistible scenes with amazing execution.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The Best Film of 2007,"As Atonement opens with stunning images of the tranquil English countryside where everything is a picture of perfection and everyone appears content; you cannot help but feel the atmospheric foreboding as nothing perfect lasts forever in this tarnished world. Based on the bestselling novel by Ian McEwan, it is an unforgettable, beautifully haunting love story that slowly slips into a devastating flood of such raw, overwhelming tragedy that you can feel the emotional journey of the characters; and its' thought-provoking themes of forgiveness, atoning, betrayal, and love stay with you for days afterwards.When Briony Tallis (played three different ages by by Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, and Vanessa Redgrave) misinterprets an encounter between Robbie Turner (played by James McAvoy) and her sister Cecillia Tallis (played Keira Knightley), she tells a lie that carries such shocking consequences that it completely ruins their lives. Briony spends the rest of her life seeking forgiveness for her appalling act. The story is told against the backdrop of WWII from the three points of view, along with beautifully rendered and perfectly timed flashbacks and forwards.Director Joe Wright does a splendid job contrasting the two worlds. The beginning is filled with whimsical, pastel colors of the exquisite English Countryside drenched in glowing sunshine where everything has the sense of a timeless perfection; only to be followed by the dark, ominous, gritty images of a war torn France.The acting from the entire cast is top-notch. James McAvoy gives a strong emotion-filled performance of great depth; Keira Knightley effortless glides into her role as the high-class daughter, and as only she can do, speaks each line with such eloquence that it is a treat to just listen. Saoirse Ronan is truly one of the best child actresses of late as she acts with such a profound maturity and intensity; and Vanessa Redgrave is so perfect in her small role as Briony in her older years that she still manages to make an impression and is able to convey such emotion solely through her expressions.Every level of production is so perfect, it is an absolute triumph. Notably the cinematography which was dazzling, containing one of the most epic and complex single-take in movie history (yes it even toped Children of Men); as well as Dario Marianelli's magnificent, sweeping score filled with an original theme of simple yet exquisite beauty. Atonement truly is the best film of 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"One of the best films in the past decade, hands down","Atonement has everything: Drama, romance, stunning visuals, tragedy, compelling storyline...it's all here.Acting: Everyone was on top of their game, but the real scene stealer here is James McAvoy. He deserves every ounce of praise he will inevitably receive for this performance...no kidding. Keira Knightley pulls off a riveting performance, but nothing as eye popping as McAvoy.Story: It simply has to be experienced to be understood. You won't know the whole story or feel the full impact until the credits roll, it's that solid.Visuals: More proof that you can have a deep story AND lush, rich visuals, not to mention some truly stellar cinematography. There's one really long shot in particular that is just overwhelmingly beautiful but incredibly tragic at the same time.The more I think about this movie, the more I love it. I will definitely be seeing this again. Atonement is a serious contender for every Best Picture award out there, and rightfully so. The only NEGATIVE things I have to say about it is that the music is a little too much in a couple of spots, it drags a little in one particular spot, and they make a time jump a little too quickly so it's a bit jarring, but those problems are nit picks and hardly worth mentioning.This could very well be another movie where it's okay for men to cry too.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement shows a bleak but beautiful side of life,"When we say something is full of life, we generally take it in a very lively, happy sense. I want to use the same term for Atonement. But in a different way. Yes, Atonement is full of life. But not just with in a usual positivity. It has life throbbing through every moment with all passion melting in bitterness, confusion, guilt, rage and repentance. A story set in suffocating British aristocracy has a romance brewing with Cecilia, the elder daughter of an aristocrat and extra-ordinarily talented Robbie, son of his servant. But the confusion and misunderstanding of the younger daughter Briony messes up all their lives by accusing Robbie of the crime he never committed. As the world is on the brink of the world war and as a prisoner Robbie chooses to fight in the war. On the other hand, Cecilia still carries her emotions for Robbie intact in her heart. Life is tough for these two, but not as much as Briony who realizes the consequences of her mistakes and tries to repent by giving up normal comforts. But what is undone remains so. Cecilia and Robbie have a hope that if the war ends soon, they will be able to reunite. Briony wishes that too as she has been the reason behind creating the mayhem. However, the wishes never materialize as Robbie and Cecilia lose their lives in the war, leaving Briony to find the only possible way to bring them together, the fictional way. As she grows old, towards the end of her life, she writes a semi-autobiographical novel where in the end, Cecilia and Robbie get to live happily ever after... The first and the most marvelous aspect of the movie is the way it is shot. The way water sinks into sand at the Redcar beach freezes that frame into your cinematic memories...The English country side and the life in contrast to the war tapestry in the second half simply exhibits remarkable film-making skills. The acting complements the technicalities. The screenplay and the flow of story telling in this medium is flawless to an extent that I wonder Ian McEwan's book could have made Robbie's suffering and hallucinations of the night before his death more poignant. Being a movie buff in Europe has advantages, I could at least watch a just released English film even before it released in the US..... Just like most of the world that has seen Atonement, I'm also waiting for how many Oscar nominations it gets.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"The worst film I've seen this year, bar none!","I was so excited to go and see Atonement. Friends told me to bring a box of Kleenex, that it was a tragic love story, that it was just fantastic! So I went, and found here wasn't any love in this story, no reasons for crying, and no real atonement. What on earth makes people think that lust and love are the same thing, and even lust was sparse in this film. The sets and costumes were lush and nice, but the method of presenting the story was so jumbled it was pathetic. I couldn't get to know, or care about anyone, except for the really mentally sick little girl who needed treatment.What a disappointment! I wanted to love it. I hated it. The director went overboard trying to be artsy fartsy so people who didn't know better, thought it was real art. Where have all the wonderful types of movies that were made in the late 30's, 40's and 50's? Movies that make you feel something about the characters, make you laugh, make you cry, and make you understand what the heck they are all about? There are just two movies nominated that are worthy of an Oscar, this certainly isn't one of them.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Impressive artistic endeavor,"'Atonement' tells the story of a series of unfortunate events, misinterpretations and consequences as 13 year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) accuses her childhood friend, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) of a terrible crime he did not commit. Opening in 1935, the story moves forward five years to show the repercussions of Briony's mistake on both Robbie and Briony's sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley), who abandons her family to stick by Robbie and wait for him, first to return from prison and then from war. 'Atonement' is an adaptation of Ian McEwan's hugely successful 2001 novel of the same name. Adapted by Christopher Hampton ('The Quiet American') and directed by Joe Wright ('Pride and Prejudice'), it is a sweeping saga of love and war, class consciousness, guilt and redemption.Having read and thoroughly enjoyed McEwan's novel, I had high-hopes for this film  further fueled by my reading only the most glowing reviews after it premiered at the Cannes Film Festival this year. But after watching the film, I've got to say I don't really see what all the fuss is about.The buzz is that Keira Knightley will receive another Oscar nod for her performance as the loyal lady in waiting, Cecilia Tallis as will James McAvoy for his role as the wrongly-accused Robbie Turner. I am a big fan of both Knightley and McAvoy. Knightley for her kudos-earning role as Elizabeth Bennett and McAvoy because he is just lovely, Scottish and has been on my radar since the British TV show 'Shameless'. However, both actors deliver fairly stoic performances by my reckoning. It's not entirely their fault, they are playing very class- conscious British characters who have to remember their social standing. And it is hard to play character's who have to say a lot without saying anything at all with regards to burgeoning romantic feelings. Neither are bad, but I wouldn't have said 'Oscar-worthy'.The rumor-mill is also predicting a Best Director gong for Joe Wright and Best Picture for the film. Well, I can't really wrong the pre-emptive Best Director for Wright. Perhaps its because 'Atonement' sees him coupled with his muse, Ms. Knightley  but it's more likely that Wright is just a very talented director with an eye for atmosphere and understated beauty. A particularly breath-taking scene shows a panoramic view of desolate Dunkirk, over-run by soldiers waiting to go home, it is grandiose, detailed and absolutely magnificent.The film as a whole however, will be a love/hate affair for many. I personally enjoyed the film, partly because it was a worthy adaptation of a beloved book  but I can admit that it was a little slow. True, outer turmoil is portrayed quite clearly by the war that Wright impressively recreates in London in 1940 and Dunkirk (not through battle scenes however), but so much of the story has to do with internal turmoil that it is sometimes hard to hold interest. However, Wright has to be applauded again for his managing to create suspense in certain scenes I thought would be very tricky to communicate to the audience  in particular, a certain letter writing scene.The fall-backs of the film may lie in the fact that McEwan's novel is not adaptation friendly. That's not to say it isn't a good book  it is, brilliant even. However, the novel is narrated by an omniscient third person who is able to explain the inner-workings of each character, their motivations and interpretations of events. The narration is an important element to the book since the entire plot revolves around young Briony misinterpreting moments between Robbie and Cecilia. In the film however, Wright tries to position the audience in different frames of mind by showing the same scenes twice. One particular scene is first shown from Briony's perspective  through a window, silently seeing the tail-end of a seemingly heated exchange between her sister and childhood friend, Robbie which she perceives as malicious on Robbie's part. We then see the same scene more intimately and in its entirety, between Cecilia and Robbie and realize the sexual undertones and frustration of feelings unspoken between the characters.I think my slight disappointment in the film comes from the fact that I did get my hopes up. It is a good film, Oscar-worthy? Only time will tell. I think it will be appreciated more as an artistic endeavor than a drama or love story, and will no doubt earn Joe Wright more critical acclaim and cachets as a director to watch, and rightly so.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great film!!!!,"It is poetry and beauty made film, it should be enjoyed in a movie theater, not at home. Just sit down, relax and let yourself go with this great experience of intelligent and excellent film making. This is what this business should be all about, great movies with a wonderful script, characters well described, and impossible-to-improve acting. This young director has a clear mind of how to make good movies, every little detail is taken care of, every set it better than the previous one. Is just amazing how a well written story does not have to tell you the day, the year, the exact location... this is all superfluous to what the characters are going through.

"Good idea, dragging plot","Overall, this is a great movie, solid story, good acting, amazing cinematography, but oh, how it drags. For once, Kiera Knightly is in a role she can play, but again, she needs some food. James McAvoy is absolutely brilliant, the girl who plays the young Bryione is top notch, and with the supporting roles, an excellent well-rounded cast. The cinematography is excellent, especially the Dunkirk beach scenes. The music is a refreshing look at contemporary music. But not all movies are perfect. This is no exception. I found some parts, especially in the middle and end, dragged a little too much. When the end came, it was half an hour too long. Also, the plot is slightly confusing with flashbacks and whatnot. But, if you are a melodrama fan, this is your movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.""","Atonement is an original drama that is both tragic and beautiful. This being my 3rd Best Picture nominee to watch, my thoughts were ""Can it beat Juno?"" Amazingly, it did (Although barely). The storyline is superb and strays away from many clichés in the dramas.The movie is another one of those ""star crossed lover"" type stories. The man is accused of a crime that he did not commit and is sent off to fight in the war. The main actors, James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, drive the film in a very effective way. These two actors create a story that is truly believable and proves to be very immersive.You will notice the unique cinematography almost as soon as the film starts. Every source of light is blurry and has a sort of bloom effect. This makes the film look whited out. Also it makes the film looks dreamy as if it is a part of a memory. Character progression is on the slow side but you get to know many of the character very well. The score, which the film won the Oscar for, is interesting and enjoyable. The film incorporates the tapping of the typewriter with the orchestral background music.The one problem is quite obvious: the plot progression is rather confusing. It jumps from one point to another and goes back and forth. This is most annoying especially when it goes ""2 weeks prior"" in a scene where you're already confused as to where in the time of the film the current scene is taking place in. Although it wasn't that big of a problem for me, it might be a little aggravating for some viewers. Also some of the wounded soldier shots are quite gruesome and gritty. They are very graphic although majority of these shots are concentrated into clump of scenes and it is not something that comes back often.The ending concludes all of the main three characters' stories up very well. It is a very emotional ending and is very well done. It is probably something you're not expecting and I thought it was a solid ending. Atonement is ultimately an extremely personal film. Each character has a unique quality to them and story that drives the film become very personal. As long as you can put up with the jumping plot and long-ish run time, you should find this film a treat. It uses emotions effectively, characters are developed well and you will care for them (Well maybe not that little girl. Personally I hated her guts). I thought this film was one of the best I saw this year and it is definitely a one you don't want to miss out on.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Weighty, ambitious and visually arresting, Atonement almost makes amends for its lack of dramatic weight","Atonement is a film exploring the consequences of love, and the guilt one carries when attempting to destroy it. Starting in the hot British summer 1935, we join a courtship between Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis, told through the eyes of Cecilia's 13-year-old sister Briony. Peeking from inside a house window she views her sister stripping off in front of Robbie and then plunging herself into the fountain in the garden of their country house. By the end of the day their lives will have changed forever, as the scheming imagination of Briony will have run its rage over the lives of the two lovers.Cecilia (Keira Knightley) has travelled down from Cambridge; Robbie (James McAvoy), her university contemporary and son of her parents' housekeeper is dabbling with landscape gardening; and her brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) is coming to dinner with a friend, the arrogant industrialist Paul Marshall (Benedict Cumberbatch). The performances are enjoyable and spot-on: Cecilia's brittle beauty; Robbie's educated but tempered confidence; the wily camaraderie between Leon and Marshall.Cecilia clearly harbours an attraction to her university contemporary, but her inherent snobbishness towards his attachment to the more servile classes stilt her feelings somewhat. The class divide is tested even further, when her younger sibling Briony (a fantastic turn from Saoirse Ronan), who herself is dabbling in the arts of playwriting and novels, envelops her own imagination with a warped perception of their relationship. Robbie is branded a ""sex maniac"" and accused of raping Briony's friend and cousin Lola (Juno Temple). The accusations and stigma will haunt Briony, Cecilia and Robbie for the rest of their lives, the next chapter of which follows them through World War II. Briony, staring at her deathbed in the contemporary era, attempts to atone for her guilt by writing what she really saw, and what really happened during the summer of 1935.Joe Wright, at the age of 35, clearly has a interesting future ahead of him There are times during Atonement when the style and flourish of the film's movement is elevated through its direction. He sees his films intricately and along with cinematographer Seamus McGarvey paints them vastly and beautifully. When he made Pride & Prejudice, the popular call was that he had made Jane Austen ""muddy"", despite the fact it was as pastorally arresting as any of Austen's novel's should be. Atonement is the same. It switches from the beauty of the Tallis country home to the grotty urbanism of wartime London with equal aplomb. He is clearly a director with an interesting style of film-making, but it is questionable whether he is utilises his gifts appropriately during the film. One sequence, a breathtaking long-take following Robbie's worn-out soldier walking along one of the French beaches, is both visually arresting and technically marvellous. But all it accumulates to is visual swaggery on Wright's part. What Atonement lacks in buckets is the kind of emotional attachment any loves story desperately relies. Wright attempting to make up for the general lack of involvement in these latter sequences resorts to showing off his technical hands, maybe hoping we haven't noticed how engaging the story is getting. It is a darn shame, far too much of one unfortunately, since the ambition and weight of Atonement make a movie you will want to love. Some people do, and it leads me to question my own interpretation of the film that they something out of it to treasure. But in my opinion there are far too many problems that match the movie's huge ambition. Keira Knightly, for all her hard work, doesn't possess the dramatic weight to make us feel for her character. Far too often is the pain lacking, when it is clear we are meant to be heartbroken at both her's and her lover's fate. I wanted to feel the sorrow of her character, and the closest you come to that is through the guilt and anguish displayed through Romola Garai's performance as the wartime Briony.When the end reveals itself, it is genuinely moving, but a part of me felt as though the film had not earned the right to take me to that place. I still feel there is a great movie to be made on this subject, one that overcomes the literary trappings of the novel, and doesn't give distance to the audience through its more dramatic scenes. I still think people should see it, there is enough worth discussing and much to be admired. It is a beautiful, ambitious and weighty failure. One that will stay with you after you've seen it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

James Macvoy has acted extremely good, all others actors are also fabulous and give justice to the novel. It's now my favourite melanchonic movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Excellent production values to top a very good adaptation,"Atonement has awards written all over it.The story of two lovers betrayed by a younger sister then parted by the second world war is beautifully shot and conceived by a wonderful team. The settings are perfectly realised, and McAvoy et al do a good job. For my money, the ending is the best of any major film this year.Credit must go to Working Title and the legacy of George Harrison, Merchant Ivory, and even, Greenaway for laying the tracks that kept the British Film industry alive. It may not produce anything like the amount of the US or India but the quality is outstanding.The score by Dario Marianelli is certainly a highlight. Not the typewriter, but towards the end the score definitely captures strains of Elgar and Tippett. For my money better even that his score for Pride and Prejudice which was Oscar nominated last year. In addition, Seamus McGarvey and Paul Tothill both deserve mention for the cinematography and editing respectively.Will it win an Oscar? Perhaps not best film - but one thing is clear it will clean up at the BAFTAs for sure.Definitely worth the viewing- for my money better than the English Patient - more human and detailed emotionally - a must for all who like their films to be something to linger.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
They Did It!!,"For anyone interested in seeing Atonement on the screen, you must start with reading the book. It is so beautifully written and the author, Ian McEwan, lays out for the reader what it is like to have the attention of an audience and the responsibility that entails. However, if you don't have time to read it, you will get a very close adaptation. Under the clever direction of Joe Wright and with an intricate score by Dario Marianelli, the book is fully realized on the screen and as a viewer you will be rewarded. Wonderful performances were given by all actors involved. The chemistry between Knightly and McAvoy is a character unto itself. Even the small role of Brenda Blethyn as housekeeper is a powerful performance that deserves much praise. What a struggle to see such wonderfully written novels not given the credit they are due on the big screen. It is very apparent with Atonement that everyone involved with the film understood the sentiment of the book and has done it justice. Hardly a stuffy period piece, Atonement is a house filled with intrigue and harsh realities. Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
That one shot,"That one shot seems to be the theme of the movie here as the young girl, Briony, accused Robbie of a crime he didn't commit. She had one shot to get it right but she was so jealous of her her sister Cecilia and Robbie as they had a secret relationship. Robbie was taken away from Cecilia and was off to the war.The movie is shot from Briony's eyes as well as what really happened and it doesn't rely on twist to keep our attention even though the end did catch me off guard. It deserves its best picture nomination even though I can't believe James McAvoy didn't receive a best actor nomination (oscar) as he, Daniel Day Lewis and Viggo Mortensen were the ones that stand out to me so far this year. Of course Keira Knightly shined once again as so she did for Joe Wright's previous film, Pride and Prejudice. This film was absolutely beautiful with a rich score and very good direction by Wright who I will be following for now on.Now for the most beautiful part of the film, the cinematography. Do you remember the incredible shots that Children of Men brought you? How they would stand out as four minute shots with no edits? This film has a five minute shot that I believe had no edits that just hurt with emotion. It was the most incredible shot I've seen this year and it completely caught me off guard. That one shot will haunt me. This film should win best cinematography and I will say it is easily one of my top three favorites so far of 2007. Don't miss this movie. It won't be forgotten!Oh, and you'll only have one shot to see it in the theaters!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Best movie of the year? Heck, best movie of the last decade!","Two names; Keira Knightley and James McAvoy. They are incredibly brilliant and their acting is flawless in this absolutely stunning movie. From the scenery, to the acting to the musical score, this movie is absolutely spectacular. This is true film-making in the flesh.The first part of the movie is just incredible. From the lush country-side mansion to a gorgeous Knightley and a handsome James McAvoy, it's just visual poetry. These two create such chemistry between their characters, that it seems obvious why they would wait for each other.The story is nuanced, beautifully translated from Ian McEwan's novel and Joe Wright MUST get a best director nod and win.Keira Knightley has come a long way from her ""Bend it like Beckham"" days. She was outstanding in ""Pride and Prejudice"", but THIS is the defining role for her, she is superb and absolutely nails it. She plays Cecilia as a conflicted young woman and her accent is right on the money. This is her best performance to date and deserves a Golden Globe and Oscar nod. She will be robbed if she doesn't get both!Similarly, James McAvoy is wonderful in this movie. What this man can say with one look is incredible. Definite Oscar nod here too!Just a brilliant, astonishing accomplishment by the director and the actors. And it shows you how putting together the right cast and crew and the mega-talent inherent in this movie equals brilliance.This movie teaches filmmakers how to successfully translate a literary masterwork to the big screen.This movie is destined to become a movie classic.

"Overrated, and a disgrace to the name of Golden Globe","There are no words that can describe my anger over this film's win at the Golden Globes for best picture. In a year filled with phenomenal films like Into the Wild, 3:10 Yuma, Sweeny Todd, etc. this movie is sub-par, over-rated, and was personally painful for me to sit through.I give credit to the cinematographer and Kiera Knightly who both did exceptional jobs. I also give credit to the screenwriter and director for the first 15 minutes of the movie. Everything after that, amounts to one of the biggest piles of rubbish I have ever seen celebrated on screen.The problem is the story itself- it's obvious that neither the writer, director, or James MacAvoy, have any CLUE what it's like to go to war or be in love. The film is entirely self-absorbed and completely unaware of the catastrophic historical events that surround it. James McAvoy also cries in every scene of the movie that he's in, including the fountain scene and the scene where they make love--this is just horrific acting and directing. It's also disrespectful to make a movie that unrealistic and soppy on issues that are real and dark.I wanted to vomit after leaving the theater. If it wins the Oscar, I will boycott the awards ceremony for the rest of my life. Do yourself a favor and go see one of the other wonderful 20 films that are out this year and spare yourself the pain of sitting through this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful film,"This film has stayed with me since I saw it last week and I think it will for a long time. It is visually and emotionally beautiful, and demands your attention from the very start. I have read other books by Ian McEwan but not Atonement - and I am now apprehensive of reading it for fear it will not live up to the film (and as someone who 1. is usually unimpressed by Keira Knightley and 2. really rates Ian McEwan's other novels, that is high praise indeed)! Keira does well, all actors involved are well cast, but James McAvoy utterly steals the show. A stunning performance, and one that should warrant an Oscar nomination. You cannot help but fall in love with his character, and although understated he will, in turn, make you smile, swoon, laugh out loud, and weep. The cinematography backs up his performance wonderfully, the Dunkirk scene lives up to the hype, and the music is great. Extremely impressive film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A visually exquisite film that could have been so much better,"Atonement tells the story of Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year-old fledging writer and member to a family of wealthy British socialites in the 1930's. She has a crush on the hired help in the much older Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), but she notices that her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) seems to have similar feelings. But after reading a letter by chance and witnessing some rather disturbing events, Briony changes the course of life for more than just a few people.I was not quite sure what I was expecting going into Atonement, but the movie I saw was not it. I do not necessarily think this is a bad thing, but I do think it helps to know very little about it. Yes, it is very romantic in a handful of scenes, but it so much more darkly mysterious than the ad material lets on. Just the sheer notion of the course of events that leads up to Briony's irrevocable change is quite disturbing all in itself.Atonement has a rather enigmatic method of sequencing. Falling quite distinctly beside the likes of Akira Kurosawa's Rashômon and Zhang Yimou's obvious homage Hero, Atonement tells its story from a few points of view, showcasing a few events through multiple angles. What is great is that we actually get to see these angles from the very point-of-view of the character, almost to the point of being a voyeur (much like Briony herself). It makes for an intriguing of watching the film, and it leads to a greater of understanding of the motivations of each of the main characters. It may not be easy for casual filmmakers to understand the use of seeing these angles used more than few times early on, but it does truly make sense as the film goes on, and is not simply a British upper class nod to those Asian filmmakers.The story itself, while being heavily convoluted (in part thanks to the really well done multiple angles), is a bit off. I liked where it went, and I like how it explored what happened to the characters (since the first half is almost entirely comprised of the day of Briony's big moment), but its focus seemed a bit wonky. I realize and understand what screenwriter Ian McEwan (and in turn, novelist Christopher Hampton) was trying to capture and achieve in the writing, but it works half of the time. I found myself more baffled at the lengths some of these scenes rather ridiculous, and just disliked how it was so careless with its moments of exploration and development. The characters do develop over the course of the film, but just not to the point that the film lends itself to thinking they do.What I also did not like was the length. The first half goes by fairly quickly, but the second half just drags endlessly. A lot of the strongest scenes in the film, and the ones I liked the most, are in the second half, but the filmmakers just seem to have less of a idea as to what they wanted to do with them. They know how to make them look great, but making them play off just as good seems to be a bit of a problem. It is disappointing to think so much effort was put into the early moments, but not enough was given to the later ones. It does not help that the first half does not jump around nearly as much as the second, but the film does not seem balanced. Once the ending hits, the film practically flies, but getting there is almost a test of endurance in itself.The beautiful imagery stays consistent throughout the film, even at its darkest (both literally and figuratively) moments. Director Joe Wright and company have composed a gorgeous looking film, with minute details at every corner and just the right amount of authenticity. Some of the scenes they compose are simply breathtaking as well. One long take late in the film in war torn France is simply fantastic, and speaks volumes of the level of effort put into making the film. It reminded me a lot of the amazingly captured scenes in Children of Men, and I think it qualifies as some of the best sequencing of the year. I was very impressed with the visuals, and I think they helped keep my eyes peeled to the screen and not faltering into the boredom that sets in because of the story. The typewriter infused score is also very well done, and quite riveting at times.The acting from the cast is uniformly good, with some standouts. After being disappointed with his work in The Last King of Scotland, McAvoy really knocked my socks off here. His wounded character is very well conveyed, and truly proves his worth as an up and coming actor. No, it is nowhere near as good as the likes of Daniel Day-Lewis, Viggo Mortensen, Johnny Depp or even Denzel Washington, but it is great all in its own. I can only hope he continues on this streak. Knightley on the other hand, is not all that great. She does fairly well for herself, but she does not seem to be giving it her all. I am not going to say that her acting is bad here, it just does not seem to be up to the calibre the film is trying to project.Ronan is the true marvel here (and miles ahead of Briony's older forms in Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave), and outshines everyone in the cast. Her naivety and amazing style speaks of being a more seasoned veteran, and I hope she can continue on this wave length for The Lovely Bones and beyond.In the end, Atonement is a good film that could have been a whole lot better. If for anything, see it for the astonishing visuals and the even better Ronan.7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Amazing (the only word able to describe it),What an amazing film!!!!! For me to sob my little heart out at the end of the film must of meant it was special as most films have little effect on me. I didn't have very high expectations for the film and was worried about it being perhaps a little bit dull but luckily for me a friend (and the fact the the stunning James Mcavoy was the lead man) persuaded me to watch it. James Mcavoy was brilliant at his roll (as always)and so was Keira Knightly (who i had feared might of been a bit wooden as she has been in other films) Her acting just keeps improving. If Oscars are not awarded for this film them I'm afraid people have no sense. The idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument was genius it fitted perfectly with the film. I've not read the book but will certainly be reading it now......Id definitely recommend it to anybody!!,10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"A Rare Cinematic Showcase, Offering A Vast Array Of Engaging Talent","2007 has been a slow year up until now; at least, I have been unimpressed by practically every release of the year so far. Hence, my uncertainty of whether I should let my expectations rise for the opening of Atonement. Instead, I decided to go in without listening to the hype. I came out of the cinema exhausted, yet it was a good kind of exhaustion, the kind of exhaustion found after an emotionally draining experience which actually succeeded in moving the viewer. Atonement has Best Picture material written all over it, and at this current stage I sincerely doubt that I will find any 2007 film to surpass it.Adapted from the novel of war veteran Ian McEwan, Atonement is directed by young British talent, Joe Wright. Weaving a convoluted, sometimes fascinatingly dreamlike story of unforgiving love in WW2 Britain, Atonement centres on a rich family torn apart by a terrible crime and a love that could never be. Centring itself on three key characters; the young Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), her elder sister, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and their housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), from here on the film depicts the misinterpreted relationship drawn between Cecilia and Robbie. The film conducts a web of disillusionment and regret.For me, the finest element of Atonement is the editing, which is some of the most subtly detailed of recent years. It is the type of fresh editing which enables the viewer to realise how even more alluringly intelligent the picture is. For example, the moment where it cuts from Keira Knightley diving, to James McAvoy bringing himself up from under the bathwater. There are numerous other moments to name, such as the ""cigarettes and opera"" sequence or the lavishly romantic sex scene. Everything fits together with a non-superficial ease, providing a sense of far more thoughtful film-making. Having the pressing typewriter beats playing against a person's hurried walk is another notable case of sound editing; it should be noted because it helps the atmosphere have an additional level of unavoidable allure. You just cannot refuse to ignore the adaptable use of stylistically-enhancing editing. Cinematography also plays a huge part in the picture, too. Rather than simply relying on a clean-cut narrative and some noteworthy performance, the film makes an effort to employ all the features which start to create real cinema. The five-minute long tracking-shot found when the troops enter Dunkirk left me in awe, conveying the destruction through its confrontational set-pieces.Nevertheless, the acting is yet another one of the film's triumphant endeavours. Being that the director's vision and the actor's insights are fused together with an undeniable awareness, meaning the film is at liberty to take a consistently smooth pace. The camera seems to pick up every detail the performers exert, e.g. the recurring use of hand/eye gestures to echo the feelings found within awkward or crucial moments. Evidently, a lot of time was spent rehearsing the magnificent screenplay, since all the actors deliver their lines with a secured knowledge, but without the viewer feeling as though anything was overly rehearsed. Even Keria Knightley left me stupefied, considering I have become exempt to seeing her provide wooden performances which offer nothing what-so-ever for a film. Yet, she is quite sublime in Atonement, exemplifying the features of an upperclass woman. Proving that she can tackle mature roles meant I felt pleased to see a genuinely positive performance from the ever-growing star. James McVoy is by far the film's overall star, though.Not only is Atonement a romance, it is a war film and drama, too. I admit that I expected the film to be the generic sentimental tweaking on a period-piece/costume-drama premise. To my great surprise I was blown away, stunned by the dynamic personalities which were being portrayed on-screen and left in a daze over the luscious visuals. Essentially, Atonement is a romance, and I would be ignorant to deny it. Nonetheless, I found it to be much more than a ""romance"", but in fact a lyrical journey of culpability.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful and imaginative,"I have been looking forward to seeing Atonement for a while, I like a lot of different period pieces and this looked like a great one. Then the awards have been coming to it, unfortunately, it didn't come to my town for a while, until recently and my mom and I finally saw Atonement today and we both loved it. It has such a beautiful love story, lovely costumes, incredible scenery, and wonderful actors. Keira Knightly has just come such a long way these past few years and she's becoming a wonderful actress, she was the perfect choice for Cecille. James McAvoy, this is the first film I have seen him in, I know he's a rising star and from this movie I can see why, he has the perfect charm that lights up a screen. These two actors clicked so well together and were lovely. Romola Garai as the older Briony was the perfect choice as well, she brought almost a sense of sympathy for her character, an understanding. The entire cast brought this wonderful story to life.Briony is a thirteen year old girl in the 1930's, she has quite the imagination, she writes plays and stories. She also has an older sister, Cecille, who is more loved in some ways, especially by Briony's crush, Robbie. Robbie and Cecille fall in love, but when Robbie gives Briony the wrong letter to give to Cecille that has explicit sexual language, Cecille becomes more angry when she catches Robbie and Cecille together making love. Later that night, Briony sees her cousin being raped by a man and accuses Robbie of it, Robbie goes to prison and eventually fights in WWII. Robbie and Cecille to find each other again years later and promise each other to live happily ever after. But Robbie must fight in the war once again. Briony is now a WWII nurse and is living with the guilty conscience of accusing an innocent man of a hideous crime, she riped the love of her sister's life right out of her hands and now she must tell the truth, even if it is too late.Atonement is one of the best films of 2007. It was very interestingly made, it has a strange time sequence. But I think from what I know, is that Atonement is a long book, so they probably had to chop a lot of the story up into two hours. But don't worry, the story is easy to follow throughout the film. My mom and I couldn't get over the sets and the costumes, they were absolutely stunning and we're hoping the awards go to Atonement for best costume. Atonement is a beautiful story of love, sisterhood, friendship, betrayal, and imagination, it's a terrific film. It's a film not to be missed, I'm in a big bind now where I'm not sure what film to root for best picture, because Atonement is going to be a good classic in a few years.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful but sad story,"When I went to the cinema I expected one solid drama with Keira Knightley in a leading role. But instead I walked out of the cinema with that feeling when you know that you just watched one hell of movie. Ian McEwan's novel is brought to life in this great movie about love, actually about love story of Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis. Cecilia's younger sister Briony wrongfully accuses Robbie for raping her cousin Lola. Briony's strong imagination pulls many events in the future as Robbie ends up in prison and Cecilia losses her love of life. Briony's misunderstanding leads to a terrible crime whose consequences follow them through World War II.After ""Pride & Prejudice"", director Joe Wright decided to make another movie that is based on a book and this one is a winner and quite possibly the winner of Oscar for Best Picture in the next year. ""Atonement"" gives us few strong performances but James McAvoy steals the show. That scene in the house when Briony visits Cecilia and Robbie is great. Saoirse Ronan shows great potential, Keira Knightley isn't long in this movie but she's good as usual and Vanessa Redgrave is excellent as older Briony. But what really amazed me is how Wright tells us this story in beautiful simplicity, with returning in the past but never leaves the viewer with questions cause he presents all the answers. One scene is amazing and that is when Robbie comes to the beach with his fellow soldiers. Really breathtaking and spectacular scene, cause ""Atonement"" is one beautiful but sad story and it is really shame to miss it, so go and watch one of top 10 movies in this year.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful piece of cinema!,"Apart from Knightley's stupid pouting that she does in every film she's in, it was an almost perfect piece of cinema. James McAvoy's performance was a masterclass!

Frankly I'm surprised he never won an oscar for this role.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
red carpet reconstruction attempt,"If you are looking for another review to tell you how Atonement is the best acted, best adapted, best costumed (and so on) movie of the year, please stop reading. I don't disagree with that. I simply feel duty-bound to tell you why it is still a bad movie.Atonement is a period piece, set in 1935 and onwards. It follows the life of Briony Tallis (played by three actresses in the course of her life, including Vanessa Redgrave). We see how her error of judgement destroys the lives of at least two other people. She never does actually 'atone' for her wrong, although she ultimately finds a way of telling a second lie, more openly, to do the best she can in her own head. Excessively high production values, superlative acting, and a generally interesting story, blind to us the moral bankruptcy of our tale. A tale that has moral values as its focus. We come out of the cinema saying how interesting it was. But have accepted complicity in the same errors it purports to address.Cecilia Tallis (Kiera Knightley) lives a life of wealth and privilege in her family's Gothic mansion. She is having a tempestuous affair with Robbie (James McAvoy), the housekeeper's son. Cecilia's younger sister, Briony, is still a child. But Briony is at that cusp where hormones start to play havoc. She has been raised in a typical atmosphere of sexual hypocrisy. With an imagination informed more by her precocious skill as an author and playwright, than any understanding of humanity, she is only too ready to believe that most sex is evil. (Sex from a commoner is probably worse.) It is not long before some indiscretions on the part of Cecilia and Robbie allow Briony to form a wicked picture of the young man.When Briony witnesses a genuinely horrific sexual act, she makes a false accusation against Robbie. The power structures of wealth and class soon close ranks with Briony. She spends the rest of her life not only screwed up by Victorian values, but by her own over-arching sense of guilt for what she has done. The real victim of the crime - and real perpetrator - are tidied up as mere plot loose ends.I have not read the book and cannot comment on whether the original novel is as hypnotic, glossy - and essentially vacuous. But I am given to understand that Ian McEwan is happy with the screen version.Like a modern Lady Macbeth (there is a rather overly obvious hand-scrubbing reference), Briony is unable to assuage her guilt. And like the very power-forces that gave her childish lie such strength, the wealth, skill and moral righteousness thrown into this movie con us into believing it is anything but superficial. The acting is faultless. I have been critical of Knightley in her Pride & Prejudice Oscar-nominated role, but here she does clipped, slightly stroppy Cecilia to perfection. Much of the lauded talent from that earlier film has been reassembled. And it is almost as if they are having another shot at the Oscars they narrowly missed before (acting, costume and art direction) and a few more. The middle section (focussing on Dunkirk) has many 'Oscar worthy' moments, such as when lovesick Robbie/McAvoy is silhouetted against a cinema screen kiss. Or the long panning shot of the desolate battlefield that mirrors his inner desolation. But they are done self-consciously: the screen silhouette, for instance, is repeated (in case we didn't get the significance the first time?) By the end of Act Two I was convinced that the filmmakers were not going to let a lack of anything constructive to say get in the way of a good Academy attempt. We are invited to marvel at the film's elegiac quality. Indeed, there is much to admire. But its self-conceit goes on for a rather long time. And at the end, blame has been placed in all the wrong places. It even hints that, as a last resort, stories are better than the truth.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I will never make the same mistake again!,"I would Like to start of by saying that generally period dramas aren't my thing, i get very quickly bored with them and tend to switch of within the first minutes of watching. Much the same with Atonement i had low expectations from the start, luckily for me my brother convinced me to carry on watching. The film i saw then has changed the way i see such films, never again will i write off a film because it looks 'boring'.It is hard to know where to start with a film such as this as nothing really stands out, instead it is all perfect. The logical way to start would be to describe the story line, yet it is also hard to do that as it is hard to know how without ruining the film or making it seem 'boring'. Instead i will say that it is something that needs to be seen.The acting is excellent with Keira Knightley and James McAvoy giving what only can be described as the performances of their respective careers. In addition Saoirse Ronan (who plays the 13 year old Briony) is the most promising child actor since Dakota Fanning.However it was not only Saoirse Ronan who showed true promise in this film. Atonement has also brought to my attention the promising talents of director David Wright who up until now was unknown to me, (having only made pride and prejudice) and undeservedly so. His direction was amazing, especially in the scenes in France which somehow managed to portray the true horror of war without showing the slightest of conflict.Their is one problem with this film however and that is that their is nothing bad about it. This may sound a bit strange but i always like to have a rant about something that annoyed me about a film(such as plot holes or bad characterisation), but for Atonement their is nothing. I could say i feel cheated by the ending which does make you question the film slightly, but that would not be true because it is so well done that they could have all turned out to be aliens in the end and i would still have enjoyed it.Finally i have only one thing to say to people who haven't seen this film yet.Watch it. Now!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
So close to utter and absolute cinematic perfection,"I must admit that I haven't read the novel this film is based on but got a pretty good impression as to its quality judging by the film alone. Simply put, the film tells an absolutely fantastic story that keeps us engaged, enthralled and entranced from the first clicks of Briony's typewriter. Ian McEwan's ambitious tale begins with a whirlwind, joyous and beautiful depiction of young romance, which is so unbelievably dreadfully thrust into a continuous downward spiral of tragedy and disaster. And if this hurricane of tragedy, unrequited emotions and heavy guilt isn't enough, the story is topped off with quite possibly the most tragic, heart wrenching plot point in recent years, as the old version of the Briony character, played by Vanessa Redgrave, comes clean with a shocking revelation. In all, the storytelling structure of the film is fascinating and absolutely thrilling to witness. The same events are shown from multiple reverse angles; mid-way through the story relentlessly jumps forward to a time after what we know were years of pain and agony for our protagonists; and finally, the footnote at the end of the film, the gut-wrenching revelation which throws everything into question and shines a stark, illuminating light on the true nature of the film's emotional tragedy.Wright, this being his second directorial work after Pride and Prejudice, manages to most exceptionally capture the very balance of the work: the balance between broad themes of love, betrayal, tragedy and atonement and between the fine simplicities and nuances such as how his characters talk, act and interact. The film features a stunning balance on Wright's part between sequences of a thrilling, epic nature and scenes of beautiful nuance and subtlety. The entire film has a kind of driving energy behind it propelling the scenes forward in a relentless pace; Wright manages to turn Briony's pressing, triumphant dash through the long hallways of her home in order to show off her newly finished play into a fantastically thrilling scene of excitement and urgency, utilizing all of the cinematic tools available to him. Utilizing all these elements, Wright displays an uncanny technical and cinematic virtuosity, incarnated in all of the cinematic elements the film has to offer.Wright further guarantees his status as a directorial force to be reckoned with in the star-making performances by his young cast. Kiera Knightley had already proved her acting talent in her Oscar-nominated performance in Pride and Prejudice, incidentally also directed by Joe Wright, but it is in Atonement that she delivers her most wonderful, mature and best performance of her career so far. She carries with her an air of maturity, elegance and grace and of course perpetual beauty and snaps out her high class lines with such incredible crass and rapidity, one can simply see the young, adventurous lust just waiting to burst out from underneath. James McAvoy, whose star has been on the constant rise since his starring role in last year's The Last King of Scotland, is sure to get a well-deserved kick into leading man recognition, and his incredibly intense and wonderfully romantic turn in this film is also a career best. Both these actors essentially deliver two roles: the first half depicts their beautiful adolescent, blooming romance and they play the characters so charmingly, we can't help but feel that nobody in the world deserves more to be together than they to. But in the second half of the film, after the tragedy, both portray different versions of their younger selves: Obviously older and more mature, but also skeptic, heartbroken, and desperately, obsessively holding on to the smallest thread of hope they both have of reuniting. The real stunner in the show, though, is young Saoirse Ronan, who plays the 13-year-old version of Briony with such precise, calculated intelligence that the girl is truly frightful. Her prepubescent impatience, immaturity, anger and jealousy seem dangerously harmless at first, but we soon learn that she carries within her an immense destructive power, the reciprocations of which show on both the 18-year-old version and the older version of herself.Impressive as it is, it is nothing new for a director's sophomore cinematic venture to be so skillful. Pulp Fiction, Rushmore, Boogie Nights, and Requiem for a Dream are merely a few examples of director's sophomore frames. But what makes Atonement truly extraordinary as a director's second feature is that it is not the work of a very talented and devoted film geek; but rather, a seminal, beautiful piece of work striking in its resonant thematic prominence, its maturity and also its wondrous display of cinematic aptitude. Joe Wright has directed not one but two period works (Atonement and Pride and Prejudice) one would come to expect from an older generation of filmmakers such as James Ivory, Michael Apted, or Shekhar Kapur  and Wright is only 35 years old. He is without a doubt the youngest director who has managed to capture the precise restraint and calculated technical proficiency to create a good period picture, and with Atonement manages to create much more than that. Suffice it to say that Wright is a director to watch, and if Pride and Prejudice had me interested in his upcoming projects, after Atonement I now eagerly anticipate them. I hope for more of the best from him, and from all of the film's cast and crew, who should all get well-deserved career boosts due to the film's critical success.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
atonement excellent,After being one of the privileged few that got to see the movie at its gala performance last night (23rd Aug) & being an extra. I can recommend going to see this film when its out on general release. Both Keira Knightley & James McEvoy seem to bring the film to life both playing excellent roles. Well directed by Joe Wright as would be expected. Although the local scenes (redcar) are only a few minutes it really brought out the spirit of Dunkirk. It takes some following but if you've read the book by Ian McEwan it makes it much easier to follow. The 3 Briony's all play wonderful parts & the difference between the 2 younger actresses is difficult to spot. Vanessa Redgrave as usual finishes off the film wonderfully with a twist which isn't expected unless you've read the book. Hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.,10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Overrated,"Incoherent plot, jumpy story flow. Characters are all under developed. This is not a first class movie experience.The main element of the story has completed in the first 45 minutes of the pre-war story. The whole thing happened during war time is pretty much irrelevant. Characters stopped develop in those scenes and only simply walk around and day dreaming about the past.Some good things about this movie are cinematography, costume and art direction which worked together nicely and gave you an authentic WWII period feel. This is evident in that this movie is nominated in all these 3 categories for Oscar this year.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Regret of love or regret of war?,"All the magic of cinema is summed up in this movie
Robbie loved Cecilia and Cecilia was loyal to him even in the war
The two lovers suffered a lot in the war, and this was due to the foolishness of Briony, Cecilia's little sister
With the fewest words and expressions, with looks of remorse, love, and anger that overwhelmed the wonderful acting performance, and the most wonderful direction and narration, the artistic work was crowned with a soundtrack that remained in my ears for days after watching.The soundtrack won an Academy Award for Best Music Finally, I recommend watching
Especially if you had a love experience like this and it was not your Cecilia, and it is yours, do not be sad and remember this because the real Cecilia died, and so did poor Robbie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Noteworthy production definitely underachieves,"Certainly overrated as one of the highest reviewed films of the year, Atonement nonetheless provides viewers with the epic scope and cinematic grandeur that some of the best British period pieces have provided in the past. Cinematography, set design and direction seems to elevate this somewhat generic tale of ill-fated lovers into a stratosphere of high art-it is not.Firstly, the film is being advertised inappropriately as an intense love story shared between two well known leads. Rather, Keira Knightley and James McAvoy's overworked chemistry take a back stage to a third party who, in fact revolves around the entire main story instead. Most romance between these two characters merely comes as an afterthought inside this troubled character's mind, leaving the movie with perhaps a bit more metaphysical appeal but taking away substantially from the emotional impact. The plot itself at times feels shamelessly light, often coming across like a classy soap opera instead of the powerful piece of fiction much hype has suggested.Atonement is certainly worth the watch, if nothing more then for the scenery and a few exquisite shots (the beach war tracking shot in particular was stunning and one of the most impressive takes with massive amounts of extras seen recently)....Just try to enjoy the lightness of it all instead of ending up scratching your head wondering where all the bona-fide passion actually is.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A Beautiful Yet Exhausting Film,"This movie, although many will go against this declaration, is not for every type of viewer. Those who enjoy ampulous movies, watching the production details, or gasping against fabulous skies and fields for minutes, and enjoy a lenghty, slowly told story; will like it. Those (most likely men) who enjoy another type of movies; fast movies, with fulfilling characters, twists and sudden changes, will be disappointed by Atonement.My partial disliking of the film, however, comes through another lane. The story, and semi-spoiler ahead, centers mainly and poses the eye on the couple of Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knieghtly) and it's relationship. Yet their relationship is nothing more than a sexual attraction arising from years of close living together. Their is no inner travels to their feelings, but to their thoughts. It's a cold relationship, moved by some impacts and problems that do not really satisfy the romantic crave.Later we realize the focus and most compromising story gathers around Briony (a beautiful and genius Saoirse Ronan) and her story of Atonement through a mistake she did. We will appreciate the closing, her development, and she will be the most endurable character.Then why did the story hesitated in showing random scenes of Robbie at war, showing the despair of War that nothing has to do with the spine of the movie. The story of Lola doesn't bring much to the story, but a device to fuel the conflicts. Neither does the long stays at hospitals.Why did they deviate the focus so much, why did they change the optic on stories, not knowing who finally is the backbone of the movie? ""Atonement"" is beautiful, has delicious camera works and stylized production values. Yet it is exhausting, dipped into much detail and perspective the inner struggle of characters isn't fully developed.If it was a tad less cold, and more explicit in their sentiments, I would have liked it more. Yet, and I don't know why: I recommend you to see it. At least so you can get your own conclusion.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Lovely to Look at,"I have mixed feeling about this movie. I tend to be a sentimental person so I enjoyed the love story very much. My husband (the logical one) did not. We both agreed that character development was a bit vague and there were a variety of story lines that never really seemed wrapped up. Joe Wright is brilliant, but he does not yet know how to tell a story clearly. He uses every trick in the movie directors book to dazzle just for the sake of it. Instead, it would be interesting to see him use his talent to really drive the story forward. I did have moments where I felt the director was saying ""Look at this gorgeous scene, aren't I brilliant!"". Yes, the 5 minute Dunkirk span is unbelievable, but why is it being done. Wright does it because he can. Branagh used this technique to show the actual battlefield sorrow and destruction in Henry V, thus he uses it with purpose. Anyhow, I digress. I give Mr. Wright huge credit for the performances he gets out of his actors. Keira Knightly has real acting chops and James MacAvoy keeps his momentum from Last King of Scotland going. Their scenes together are very strong and carry real tension. Ronan is very good as young Briony, but the real unsung hero of this film is Romola Garai who approaches a difficult portion of the material with real panache and emotion. She is a joy to watch. Even the supporting roles jump out at you. Of course Vanessa Redgrave takes a small part and makes it immensely emotional and powerful. I would see the movie just for the performances. All in all, it is worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Emotionally and historically overwhelming, with a contrived twist at the end","Atonement (2007)Wow, this is a movie begging to be classic. I liked it and wanted to love it for all the deep emotional implications, the great set designs, and the wonderful cast. The story is actually astonishing as it unfolds at first. It's about true love between two young adults, and it's equally about the fertile and misguided imagination of a girl who doesn't understand this true love and manages to sabotage it. It's also about storytelling, and about the ever-fascinating problem of World War II for the participants and the civilians caught in the riptides of its damages.That's a lot. It's enough for any good movie, and this actually has the bones of a great movie. One of the strengths is how good it looks, mostly thanks to veteran cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, who has been on the fringes of a feast of awards but never quite rises to the top of the celebrity pile here. Check his list of movies to know his serious accomplishments, but mostly watch how he deftly makes this movie vivid and moving, scene after scene.Credit of course goes to director Joe Wright who has moved from television to serious movie-making very well. And to the writer, novelist Ian McEwan. But beyond these are the actors, especially Kiera Knightly, who I find at her best here. She's often an affected actress, far to aware of the camera, but here she backs off enough to fit the tightly scripted style. Throw in Saoirse Ronan as the young writer and troublemaker, and her sister, the terrific actress waiting for her major breakout film, Juno Temple. And the one man to note, James McAvoy, is strong if not the equal of the others. (Never mind Benedict Cumberbatch, who is good but slightly out of step for some reason.)So you see the movie is loaded for bear, as we say here in the U.S. (or used to). And it soars and swoops and makes your heart patter and your heart swoon. And then I think it's up to your feeling of how the plot unfolds, and whether you believe it or not, and whether you go along with what I found to be a bit pushy and contrived. Contrived to make you cry, yes, but so obviously you feel slightly jilted. Like the date who turns out to not really like you after all, and was just out for a good time.Certainly give this a try. It might just be the best movie you've seen in a while. It won't be bad by any means. And it really is gorgeous in many ways.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I will tell you exactly why this movie is painfully bad...,"I will not say that this is a really bad movie because a lot of people think it is really good and, unlike some others, I am not arrogant enough to think that my taste should set the standard for everyone else. There is no accounting for taste, even bad taste.However, I thought it was a painfully bad movie and I will tell you very specifically why.First, some specific things that prevented a knowledgeable viewer from sympathizing with the characters.1. In the promo they say that a young girl sees something she doesn't understand and mistakenly tells a story that that has tragic consequences. That entire sentence isn't a quote, but ""something she doesn't understand"" is. In fact, she sees several things and she does understand enough to know what is going on. The specific event that tops off the sequence of events that ruin lives is one she knowingly lies about whether or not she fully understands it, and she clearly has set out to destroy a man's life (apparently motivated by jealousy). Even before the ""main event,"" she says that he should be put away where he can hurt no one.2. It is said in one of the promo trailers (no spoiler here) that Robbie had the choice between prison and going to war. Well, this was a part of WWII that most Americans don't know about because America hadn't entered it at that time, but all able-bodied men in the UK went to war.3. The scene in the library was absurd. To disrespect one's family by doing something like that in a library with a horde of people wandering around would have been the height of disrespect and stupidity.4. In the 1930's in Britain (or America for that matter), if a father caught his daughter engaged in (or learned of) the acts that actually did occur the boy would find going to prison to be one of the nicer things that might happen to him.Now, about the structure of the movie:The story has a beginning and an end. Most of the story should have taken place in a middle that does not exist in the movie. There are events with major consequences for all involved: the girl (Briony), Cecelia, Robbie, the Tallis, Quincy, and Turner families, as well as others. These events take place in the beginning of the story: And the consequences? We learn nothing of what happened except a little of Briony, that Robbie chose war, and that Cecelia stayed around, possibly waiting for Robbie  or possibly not, as we learn near the end of the film. The middle of the story is related in a few sentences.The end of the film is supposed to show the ""atonement"". Presumably, this is Briony's atonement for ruining a few lives  we don't know how many because that would have occurred in the middle of the story. Atonement is ""satisfaction given for wrongdoing."" Unless one includes satisfaction obtained by the wrongdoer, which I don't think counts, there is no atonement.So, what does one have? Some very unlikable characters, some of whom have bad things happen to them because of bad things done by other unlikable characters. The few likable characters disappear during the non-existent middle of the story.If you choose to see this movie you may very well find something to like, but I don't think it will be anything that is a part of the story.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Grandiose and with an excellent story to tell.,"First: no, I never read the original book, I never found it in Portuguese in any bookstore. And starting from that base, I will refrain from checking if the film makes a good adaptation of the source material or not. However, I can already say that many critics have stated that the adaptation was reasonably faithful to the book. Therefore, I will rely on these statements.The story of this film is absolutely delicious. I was not able to fully appreciate it at first sight, so I decided to review it. I'm glad I did! The film is absolutely remarkable in many ways. He was nominated for several Oscars (Best Film, Best Supporting Actress, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Soundtrack) but the 2008 ceremony was particularly close and competitive and ended up collecting just one statuette. It is true that the Oscars are worth what they are worth, but they are not an absolute value nor do they define the value and quality of a cinematographic work alone, and there are many examples of incredible films that the Academy did not appreciate.Directed by Joe Wright, the film begins in an English country house where two sisters live: Brionny Tallis, a prodigious aspiring child writer, and her older sister, Cecilia, who has a passion for Robbie, who works at the house and everyone cares a lot. Brionny has a vivid imagination and is convinced, after seeing things she doesn't understand, that Robbie is a dangerous sexual predator. Therefore, when a teenager, visiting the house, is sexually abused by a man that Brionny does not get to see the face of, she swears to have seen Robbie, hiding from everyone that it could not have been him. The lie will haunt her and change the lives of everyone involved, forever.I loved the story of the film, the way it develops is simply delicious and involves the audience until the end. The environments in which everything takes place, from the country house to the fateful beaches of Dunkirk, are the perfect stage for history and the script knows how to save the best for last and surprise when we no longer expect anything.The cast has several well-known names, but it is the young beginner Saiorse Ronan who deserves worth in this film. She has an incredible charisma, she manages to steal all of our attention and direct the film, giving her character a dose of ingenuity mixed with a subtle malice and a premature, but quite marked, maturity. Not far behind, we have an excellent Keira Knightley. She is very gifted for films of this kind, especially if they are set in the past, and has done wonderfully well. James McAvoy is very good and credible in his character, but this is definitely a female film, so he will always be a bit in the shadow of the two actresses I mentioned first. Romola Garai was competent in her work, but even better was Vanessa Redgrave, who closes the film with a flourish by revealing the surprising end of the whole story.Technically, the film is good: cinematography is very elegant and discreet, taking advantage of the colors, light and shadow. Even more notable are the costumes and exquisite settings, where a great effort was made to honor historical rigor and create a genuine environment: from the use of the last ambulances of the time of the World War II, all of them museum pieces today, to the complete transformation of the seafront of a small French town to resemble a chaotic Dunkirk, the production did what it could, and deserves a praise. Although the film won only the Oscar for Best Soundtrack (and in fact it deserved it, with the masterful use of the typewriter sounds in the main melodies), I think it would have perfectly deserved that of Best Art Direction.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Deeply flawed but graceful adaptation of an admired novel,"In this war romance based on a critically acclaimed novel, a girl through a series of misunderstandings accuses her sister's lover of a crime he did not commit, and it subsequently changes all of their lives. Joe Wright directs, and Keira Knightly and James McAvoy star. Another successful movie from Working Title, Atonement is a unique and sometimes powerful drama with shortcomings which fail to justify the number of academy award nominations. It's a good film but it's over-hyped. The film's selling point is its visuals, which are exquisite. The dazzling cinematography never fails to impress, and the legendary single take Dunkirk sequence is a beach scene to rival Saving Private Ryan's Omaha Beach battle sequence. Joe Wright's steady hand keeps the film afloat and his direction emphasizes the tension and (sometimes) the emotional power that the interesting storyline conveys. The visuals cannot be faulted, although the film too often spills into style over substance territory. Still, through the direction and staging, many individual scenes are powerful.The trouble is that due to the complex narrative, the film keeps hopping between different events without coherency, which blunts its impact. The film isn't as powerful as it should be, since the love story is rushed and underdeveloped and the war scenes are just soldiers walking around mainly. Acting wise, James McAvoy does a good job and delivers on charisma and emotion with great success, but Keira Knightly, incapable of changing her voice even for one line, rarely touches the viewer. If she does, it's in a more distant way. She's not as awful as some say, but she just doesn't let her emotion through enough. As for Saoirse Ronan, she's striking at times, but too one note and emotionless to connect to the audience properly. Why she was nominated for an Oscar while McAvoy wasn't is a mystery. Overall, Atonement's script is uneven and only sometimes delivers on the emotion. Beautiful as the cinematography is, there's too much emphasis on visuals and not enough on the romance, which makes the story hard to care about at times. Still, that ending is a devastating sucker punch.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Amazing film,"Bitterness, annoyance, anger, aggression, resentment, sadness.An approximate range of emotions that you will experience both during and after viewing this picture, as for me, this is what it is good for.First of all, the drama should evoke emotions in a person so strong that he should associate himself with the character, experience the same as he does, at the same time abstracting and being a bystander.As it is clear from the title, the film does it perfectly.There are a lot of advantages, but separately I would like to highlight the staging, shooting angles, costumes for the film and background, lighting, which plays an important role.Of the shortcomings, for me personally, only the ending. As for me, this picture is ideally suited to be finished on a sad note, rather than once again reminding about the meaning of the novel.

They reveal the characters, and it seems that I, as a viewer, should empathize with the characters more strongly thanks to them and hope for a happy outcome, but this does not happen.Maybe I need to go to prison, go to war for rehabilitation, or wait for a lover who is going through these things. Maybe.Nevertheless, two advantages cannot be taken away from the film: this is the beauty of the picture and McAvoy. He's still young here, and he plays great.

Atonement,"The movie 'Atonement', which is based on the novel of the same name written by Ian McEwan, is a dramatic movie directed by Joe Wright. The leading roles are incredibly talented James McAvoy and Keira Knightley. The movie starts in 1935 in England. We see Keira Knightley (Cecilia) as an older daughter of a British wealthy family and James McAvoy (Robbie) as their housekeeper's son who loves Cecilia. The movie is about Cecilia's little sister's misunderstanding that causes other's lives to be ruined.First half of the movie was generally fascinating. Especially costumes and places absolutely look like they are from 1930s. In addition to costume designs and locations, I liked transitions between scenes as the director showed us some scenes from different people's perspectives. Although it is a 2007 film, I can say it was visually impressive with brilliant flashbacks at the right time.The outstanding things about the movie are certainly the acting and the songs. Both James McAvoy and Keira Knightley were excellent. And the songs were in admirable harmony with the scenes. In most scenes my eyes filled with tears because of those.On the other hand, particularly the last half of the movie can be tedious for some people. Because the last half mostly included war scenes. The movie was totally outstanding for me except for the ending. The ending of the film was surprising and sad. People who like happy endings like me might be disappointed. Despite everything, it is one of my favorite dramatic movies and I would definitely recommend 'Atonement' to all dramatic movie lovers.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Telling A Vicious Tale,"Some of the best elements of Wuthering Heights and The Children's Hour are combined in Atonement to make a really fine romantic film. It's been nominated for several Oscars and is certain to take home something from this year's Academy Awards ceremony.James McAvoy and Keira Knightley are a pair of fateful lovers who novelist Ian McEwen no doubt was inspired by Charlotte Bronte. McAvoy is the son of the housekeeper and Knightley is to the manor born. They do so look like Heathcliff and Cathy as performed so many years ago by Laurence Olivier and Merle Oberon.But they've got a young Mary Telford in their midst from The Children's Hour. Class distinction robbed Olivier and Oberon of earthly happiness, but in Atonement it's a terrible and vicious lie, told by a young girl with too vivid an imagination.Saiorse Ronan plays Knightley's younger sister who tells the vicious tale. I can't recall another instance where a juvenile performer has been up for a Best Actress Award. Usually those are confined to the supporting categories. But young Ms. Ronan may just pull it off at this year's Oscar.The main parts of the story take place in the United Kingdom from the late Stanley Baldwin years to the beginning years of World War II, of Dunkirk and the Blitz. Romola Garai does a fine job in portraying a slightly old version of Ronan's character. The sets and the cinematography showing the period have gotten deserved nominations.The coda to the story is provided at the very end by Vanessa Redgrave in today's times. She's become a very successful novelist now and she brings the audience through a television interview the rest of the story. Her portrayal of a dying woman who now wants to make some amends is so moving I am mystified why the Academy voters overlooked her in the Supporting Actress category. There is no way anyone will leave the theater with a dry eye.While it's still in theaters don't miss Atonement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

We all agreed that the best bit was how amazing the three actresses who played Briony were  in the looks department and with their mannerisms. I absolutely loved the typewriter music, and how everything seemed to slot together much like a typewriter - fitting in with the theme of how storytelling can have both a destructive and redemptive power. I also loved the fact that the scenery in the first part of the movie took me to a child-like place of fantasy stories. As for the storyline  I thought it was magnificent  and I didn't expect the ending at all.

"""Mr. Minghella, your time is over"" - Joe Wright.","So it seems Anthony Minghella has a successor. Two years after his feature debut, a pleasant adaptation of Jane Austen's classic novel ""Pride & Prejudice"", Joe Wright makes another good feature - ""Atonement"", a movie that shamelessly screams Oscar. Both Minghella and Wright have proved their undeniable visual talent and taste for megalomania. The biggest compliment I can give ""Atonement"" is that it's better than Minghella's ""The English Patient"", although it's been almost equally overrated.Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie, but it's not particularly memorable. What really bothers me is the old formula that is so finely used here: a gorgeous-looking couple of protagonists (James McAvoy and pouting queen Keira Knightley), stunning cinematography (by Seamus McGarvey, ""The Hours""), classy music score (by Dario Marianelli), pretty costumes (by Jacqueline Durran), to tell a tragic story of love and war based, of course, on a best-seller (by Ian McEwan). The cast is precise: McAvoy, officially the ""new Jude Law"", gives a good performance, although not half as impressive as his turn opposite Forest Whitaker in ""The Last King of Scotland""; Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave are all good as the anti-heroine Briony Tallis, but no one really gives THAT performance. Keira doesn't ruin the movie because she didn't have much to do except looking pretty (which she's great at) and sad all the time, but she still needs some acting lessons - this girl is definitely one of the most overrated young actresses of our time.Undoubtedly, ""Atonement"" is a feast for the eyes, and has elements to please romantic audiences and critics alike. However, its emotional sterility shows that Wright can be Minghella's successor, but is still miles away from a master of beauty AND heart, like the great David Lean. 7/10.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It's a drama romance movie set in the 1930's during the Second World War.

Nice movie...,"""Atonement"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch how easily the lives of some people can be changed after a young girl accuses her sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.

The plot was very interesting and along with some plot twists made this movie even more interesting. The interpretations of both Keira Knightley who played as Cecilia Tallis and James McAvoy who played as Robbie Turner were very good and I believe that they both reached their potential. Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Saoirse Ronan who played as Briony Tallis when she was 13 years old, and she was simply amazing.

It is so good, in fact, that I feel compelled to discourage viewers from reading the book before they see the movie, as Ian McEwan's striking, audacious prose is impossible to resist, but will also lessen the impact of the most shocking film epilogue I've seen this year.Much more adult than director Joe Wright's previous pairing with Keira Knightley (Pride & Prejudice), Atonement is quite similar to Capote in its analysis of the writing process and the sacrifices the author has to make. The author in question is Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), a 13-year old who is going to have her cousins perform a play she has written, the occasion being a dinner party at the family estate in the British countryside (the year is 1935). During the preparations, she notices the sexual tension between her older sister Cecilia (Knightley) and gardener Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) and misinterprets certain signals, leading to a pretty big lie that ruins the evening and destroys the young lovers' future.The film then cuts to World War II, deftly moving from a Merchant-Ivory England to a ravaged France, where Robbie is stationed and forced to witness atrocities every day, his only consolation being the hope that he will meet Cecilia again some day. Back in London, instead, both of the Tallis sisters work as nurses, albeit completely isolated from one another, leaving Briony (Romola Garai) with plenty of time to think about her mistake and plan what to say, should all three ever happen to be in the same room one last time.Although I said this is primarily a movie about writing, another key theme that never leaves the picture is a painful reflection on lost youth, evident in the casting choices: almost all the roles are played by twenty-somethings (the more adult parts, like Brenda Blethyn's cameo, are so brief they barely matter), and every single scene focuses on either Briony, Cecilia or Robbie, emphasizing how one little event altered three lives radically. Such attention to character requires good acting, and the performances are all equally superb: McAvoy, sad and angry, carries the film's second half with no fatigue at all, Knightley is dark, complex and very sensual in her first adult role, and the Ronan/Garai duo embody the young scribbler's ambition and ingenuousness with impressive sincerity.Every bit as seductive are the visuals, further proof of the great eye Wright had displayed on Pride and Prejudice. None of the beautiful sequences, however, are there merely for their own sake, each and every one of them, even when evoking the director's previous work (the fog and rain look very familiar), having the purpose of setting a specific mood, a task in which they succeed at all times. One sequence in particular blends Wright's unique visual style with the impenetrable sadness he intends to convey: a five-minute tracking shot that follows Roobie's walk on a French beach amongst mutilations, deaths and overall suffering. Not since Scorsese followed Ray Liotta and Lorraine Bracco through the Copacabana's rear entrance has a long take stuck in my memory with the same intensity. Also notable is the movie's only sex scene which, no matter how tender, leaves an omen of tragedy in the air, making the tormented love story even more excruciating to watch.And yet, for all the great thesping, editing and lensing, Atonement is, fundamentally, a story about the impact of the written word. The best writers are those who manage to trigger contrasting feelings in the reader, often simultaneously, which is why the bold, relentlessly cruel epilogue (featuring a priceless Vanessa Redgrave as the aged Briony) is so moving and infuriating in its controlled manipulation of what has just been seen. A masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Nothing to ""Atone"" For","""Atonement"" is a rarity; the prestige-slathered Oscar treat that, far from being driven by look-at-me desperation, is both watchable and commendable. The story is epic, but Joe Wright moves along Ian McEwan's epic of childish lies (the child being the radiant Saoirse Ronan) and adult war (waged, both socially and on the frontlines, by soldier James McAvoy and nurses Keira Knightley and, playing an adult version of Ronan, Romola Garai) with the precision and clarity of a diamond cutter. The acting is all around top-notch; with the performances being that of McAvoy and Vanessa Redgrave (playing an even older version of Garai). Both have a moment or two where there character turns the film around, and they both manage to do it not only without looking ridiculous, but with a simple, clipped poignancy that lends the film an edge of raw emotion. This movie, however, is driven by behind the scenes workers. Cinematographer Seamus McGarvey (robbed come Oscar time!) has created an incomparable visual feast of the kind not seen since the hey-day of David Lean or Stanley Kubrick, and Dario Marinelli creates a brilliant, moving score. Sure, occasionally the movies reach exceeds its grasp-the war scenes never do cut deep enough- but who cares when the grasp is so bold and ingeniously constructed? Atonement is a flawed but impeccable gem in the crown of a great, great year for movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
with Joe Wright and Keria Knightly you can't go wrong,"Joe Wright and Keria Knightly are one of those few that I will see there movies no what the film is and so this one was a no question that I had to see. From the directing, acting and writing this was a very well made movie and certainly want to see it again. Joe Wright just like he does in Pride & Prejudice does a fantastic job and with only two films made by him had become a major influences for me I can't wait for his next motion picture. James McAvoy which he caught my eye in ""The Last King of Scotland"" does very good job. for the coming years. Keria Knightly gives a great performance in this film but kinda falls short of her performance in Pride & Prejudice but not that much. The new comer Saoirse Ronan does great job for a 13 year old and was kinda surprised with the globe nom. Romola Garai does a fantastic job and should have got the nom and was just great. But I would say that Vanessa Redgrave gives the best performance of the movie and should get the Oscar.

A Magically Crafted Film,"As a lifelong admirer of movies, I have come to believe that everyone has a cinematic sense, the way they would envision of a film of their own. Atonement beautifies my own cinematic sense, thus I relate so intensely to director Joe Wright's techniques. Though he admits to his beautiful, emotional, near logistically impossible tracking shot that entirely composes the powerful Dunkirk evacuation sequence as showing off, that doesn't matter, because the impression with which it furnishes us is that of an uninterrupted perspective, not James McAvoy's but ours as we behold the juxtaposition of what he is ceaselessly seeing and his reaction to it. Each scene is its own self-contained short film, almost as if Kurosawa had directed this film. Kurosawa was never as hyperkinetic or confronting as Wright, the visual language of Atonement has the same tautness and precision serving as genesis of an emotional response as Sanjuro, Seven Samurai, or One Wonderful Sunday.Wright's meticulous stylization is thorough and consistent, as it isn't simply lathered on top of the story but is essentially the storyteller, enhancing and driving the story, segregating itself as its own version of Ian McEwan's novel, rather than simply a novel told on film. Each scene flows seamlessly into the next, a tremendous credit that goes to the editing as well as the already honored cinematography, creating an amalgam of each character's point of view of the same events, their different reactions, our own reactions, the achingly longed-for fantasies the characters attempt to will into reality, and of course reality itself.Keira Knightley and McAvoy are airtight within the feelings and personal interpretations of an upper-English student and the son of her parents' housekeeper sharing an obstructed and undying love and animal attraction, however it is Saoirse Ronan, the young girl who plays the 13-year-old version of Knightley's avidly creative younger sister, portraying a stage in the younger sister's life that has yet to realize the overwhelming regret she will endure. It's Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal of her in the final stage of her life that almost magically reflects Ronan, something you cannot just plan.Despite recent achievements in American film that have shattered standards and transcended the capabilities of each aspect of the medium, Atonement outdoes in both departments. It's hard to bring to mind the last time I saw a movie so alive in all departments. I was even fascinated with the way people smoked in the film. Even the music goes beyond the expectations of even masterfully done films, as it takes the form of the uniform sounds recognized in the characters' lives, masking itself as the many-sensed rhythm of the story.2007 is a tremendous year for American movies, one of the best in its history. It would only be right for Atonement to receive the praise, recognition, and accolades with which other masterpieces of 2007 are awash.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Picturesque...,"Plot:1935, and 13 year-old Briony (Ronan) changes the course of several lives when she misreads the relationship between her sister Cecilia (Knightley) and housekeeper's son Robbie (McAvoy). Later, as World War II rages, she tries to atone for her mistake.My Review:This is Briony (Saoirse Ronan), forged by her family and aspiring to be an accomplished writer and playwright and pedantic know-it-all; who uses that same enthusiasm to run riot with her advocated mind full of plethora's that seem to lie down like a silver-platter full of misconstrued actions.Her lucid creativity and lack of self-awareness; all too common with some kids these days, as she verges on the precipice of all too well known adolescence, adding a twisted sense of her judgement, in effect creating a series of shocking revelations.Romola Garai plays the elder counterpart of Briony gets the more difficult less pungent role, a character that lives an almost entirely introvert life. Some screen mannerisms shows this gamut, she's overshadowed by Saoirse Ronan as her 13 year-old self, who seems more aware of herself and her surroundings.Her sister on the other hand, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), with her sharp tones are exactly posh enough to fit Cecilia; lounges by the pool smoking with Brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) all the while keeping her distance from nonentity Robbie (James McAvoy), a scholarship boy with little to recommend him than himself. The elder cast actors barely get a look in or even a second look - near-cameos from Brenda Blethyn, and Vanessa Redgrave aside, the three are in the centre stage. McAvoy astoundingly impresses, while Knightley who finally stakes her claim in a grown-up part and does more without a pirate's rusty blade.Fantasy refined with a pragmatist sense of underwater scenes make the stately home feel like a home, heat, tension, sexual and or otherwise, cracking from under the marble floors. All leading to an erotic sex scene audiences' will not expect, but be stunned despite the fact that both parties remain almost fully dressed. All seems too well; time seems to be against them.1940, as World War II rages around them, we see the central three characters - Cecilia, Robbie and Briony (now played by Romola Garai) a few years later. Cecilia and Briony are working as nurses in London, Briony giving the indication of following her sisters' footsteps to atone, while Robbie is part of the ill-fated British Expeditionary Force, trying desperately to reach the boat for home at Dunkirk in the last and darkest days of Britain's war effort. Innocence of youth has faded to something chilling, a world that's covered in veils and old faded photographs with impiety and an ever-present paucity of light. The second act sees Briony turn from self-righteous to stricken in the turn of a page. We have the chance to wallow in the mess she has left, and realise the full extent of the crime for which she must atone.Some very neat and summer-tinged French countryside through which Robbie and his comrades tramp is already war-weary, provides some beautiful and some brutal detours that make the surroundings more of a shock than welcoming. Some have and have not seen clips and small sneak peeks about what's going to make Wright's reputation. In a gob-smacking (literally) five-minute tracking shot on the beach at Dunkirk, as Robbie's exhausted troopers stagger in to find not refuge but chaos. To incessantly babble of it would not give its full constructive meaning. This is as effective a World War II beach scene matching to Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan's opening.The quality of the production as a whole removes any indication in flaws in the narrative; which are almost immediately overshadowed by the next esteemed scene. When on some level you are left with a crescendo volleyed ending, you are left reeling and wanting more. The end plays as a shock, is there ever a happy ending?Verdict:Delicately handled, goes from pure heavenly fantasy to brutal war-time drama. Well contrasted with gorgeous cinematography, a picturesque score and unquestionable performances. 8/10.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Masterpiece?  NoMore Like Masterpiece Theatre,"There is an Audience for This Type of Thing. Frustrated Females, Film Critics, and Those that Have the Patience of the English. The Film is Mounted Like Masterpiece Theatre, Hallmark Greeting Cards, and it is the Mounting of a More Personal Nature that Propels the Story that Spans Years and the Consequences that Result from ""Bearing False Witness"".The Angst of the Story is that the False Witness is Beared by an Egghead Aspiring Writer in Her Early Teens and the Guilt She Carries as the Lives of Those She Falsely Witnessed are Affected Beyond Repair.Saoirse Ronan who Plays the Girl Gives the Best Performance and Got an Oscar Nomination (one of 7 the Film received).

I Was Not Enthralled,"Other than the lush scenery and ingenious photography, I see no specialness in this film. Set in pre-World War II England, the story is about a girl bearing false witness and how pettiness can ruin the lives of many. The plot is revealed in stages, showing sequences through the eyes of one character, then another, divulging important facts in the second viewing. At times, the vignettes play out of chronological order so that the audience is deliberately in the dark as to when the events are taking place. I enjoyed this technique and it does add ""punch"" to the overall piece. It seems that the movie is aimed at, and essentially about, the inner life of immature females and their writing and re-writing of scripts in their head. On every level this film feels like a chick film based on a romance novel. I should add at this point that the most shining example of great acting in the film is achieved by Juno Temple as a supporting, but pivotal character named Lola.I did not feel a strong reason for the two main characters Cecilia (Kneightly) and Robbie (McEvoy) to love each other. Erotic thoughts are inadvertently revealed and suddenly, there is lasting love? It didn't work for me. The ending is supposed to be bittersweet, but I just thought it made the title seem silly. I'm avoiding spoilers here, but the actions taken by Briony offer none of the redemptive qualities of atonement. There are no scenes where she finally grows up and drops her infatuation with her own inner drama. Her attempts to orchestrate lives and feelings in real life as she can on the page, are never tamed. No, I'm afraid this film fell well below expectations for me both as a love story and as a film about Atonement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Excellent film on all counts,"I live in New York City. Saw the film in the best possible conditions opening day, third screening, with a good friend who'd already seen it in Sandwich, Kent this past summer.

"An Artistic, Technical, and Emotional Masterpiece","Atonement opens on a young Briony Tallis jubilantly finishing a play to be performed that evening for her family. She stands and walks through her home, searching for her mother, and we follow her, ghostlike, looming above, as she searches. In a way, the themes of this film are summed up in this first shot: Briony, aimless, searching for truth in her imagination and fiction. And if this sounds like a contradiction, trust me when I say you will come to understand this by film's end.I have not read the book, written by Ian McEwan, but after viewing this film, I am eager to pick it up and follow the thoughts of the characters more intimately than what is shown on film. What we have here is amazing work, both technically, artistically, and emotionally, yet on some level, it is unable to grasp the concept of writing fiction from Briony's point of view. There are no doubts about the talents of Joe Wright, who at 34 has now made two exceptional films (Pride and Prejudice being the other one) with his lead actress Keira Knightly, who herself grows in her abilities with each passing year.James McAvoy cements his position as a leading man, creating a brilliant life in Robbie that glues your eyes to his predicaments and his thought on the world around him. He carries the weight of the film, and is the one who undergoes the most change. From his fresh faced boyishness in the opening scenes to the rugged, worn, and tired eyes in the latter, McAvoy is able to successfully convey the innocence of young love to the brutalities of war, and we love him for it.Joe Wright has again, proved his talent as a film director, whose use of the tracking shot will be among the greatest, up there with Goodfellas, Pulp Fiction, Children of Men, and Magnolia. His use with a camera lens is so poetic at times, they could be freeze framed and placed on walls as pieces of art in themselves. My only qualm is sometimes these shots are too technical, and distracts from the film itself. Though that is more of a personal observation than a general one.And let's not forget to mention the score, which only enhances the epic feel it brings, successfully weaving diegetic noise (the typewriter in particular) with the non-diegetic, Dario Marianelli, composer of Wright's previous work, Pride and Prejudice, creates moody, dramatic pieces that perfectly set the tone of the scenes they play in. It's one that will be recognized in years to come.Without a doubt, Atonement is one of the best films released this year, and certainly a must see for lovers of film in general, if only for its amazing tracking shot of a war torn beach in France. I, for one, look forward to viewing it a second time in the near future.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great Movie,"Movies don't get much better than Atonement. It was nice to watch a critically acclaimed film that left you surprised by its power and intelligence, usually it's the other way around. Atonement is a beautifully told love story that is both gripping and tragic.Without going into too much detail, the story shares some common elements with the English Patient. Both are based on acclaimed novels and include a pair of star-crossed lovers. Both stories are set before and during the Second World War and feature military hospitals, aristocratic men in tuxedos and a British army in retreat from the Germans. Another key similarity is a beautiful upper class English woman who falls in love with an outsider and finds herself punished by events beyond her control.Joe Wright is a wonderful director and the cinematography and look of the film are impressive. Keira Knightley and James McAvoy are both excellent. The period dialog by Ian McEwan and Christopher Hampton was smart and refreshing. Highly recommend.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
You want to watch this film? Then read plot beforehand.,"I Heard from my brother that the voting of ""Atonement"" on IMDb was quite good, therefore I was expecting a lot from the film.

Movie captures spirit of McEwan's Great Novel,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS Ian McEwan's ""Atonement"" blew me out of the water when I read it shortly after publication. It was better than any other novel I've read in the past 25 years. Although it changes certain details, the movie captures the essence of the novel: the tragedy caused by a 13-year-old girl with a vivid imagination, wrecking the lives of her older sister and her young lover. With Saoirse Ronan as Brioni, the 13 year old, Keira Knightley as Cecilia, the older sister, and James MacAvoy as Robby, the young man sent to prison as a result of Brioni's misidentification of him as a rapist, the movie gets off to a swift start and hurls along with the outbreak of World War II, the British retreat at Dunkirk and the bombing of London where both Cecilia and Brioni (now played at 18 by Ramola Garai) are both working as nurses. The shock at the end of the novel is also delivered by the film. Keira Knightley, James MacAvoy and Saoirse Ronan capture their characters perfectly in the early part of the movie when the beginning of the tragedy unfolds. The second part of the film is a bit less satisfactory, partly because McEwan's description of the retreat to Dunkirk was considerably more vivid than what the film is able to show -- possibly because it would have taken greater resources to capture the sweep of McEwan's narrative. The London scenes also suffer because the novel concentrated on the Cecilia-Robby story line whereas the film focuses to a greater extent on the older Brioni (and Garai is a much less compelling actress than Ronan). Still, considering the eventual outcome, the choices made by Joe Wright, the director, and by the screen writer are defensible. The story, after all, is Brioni's in the end. However, whereas ""Atonement"" was a great novel, in my opinion the film version -- despite superior cinematography and excellent acting --is merely very good.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

'Down from the Hill film' that is finally worth watching,"In my home town we have a phase for films like Atonement, and that is ""Down from the Hill"". This refers to those predominately middle class folk who come down from the top-end of town to make their 1 or 2 annual visits to our local cinema, and always to watch films like this. Past films that have fallen into this category have included such worthy, but rather dull films, as 'The English Patient', 'Gosford Park', 'Pride and Predudice' etc - ie those films that tend to fall into the 'English Heritage' mode of film making. This year's movie to satisfy their need is Atonement, but for once this is a film that, to my mind, is actually very good.The film is very cleverly structured, and this adds to the understanding of why certain decisions by certain people are taken, leading to a train of events which pull you, the viewer, along to a quite superb ending - which I have no intention of giving away here! Needless to say the acting is uniformly excellent, especially from the younger members of the cast. The psychological side of the film is also wonderfully handled, and I felt genuinely moved by what I saw on the screen.I feel sure that this film will do well at the Oscars - not that I pay any attention to any awards! - and for once it is a film that deserves all the praise it is getting.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A simple unhappy story,"As we know impubescent children, mainly girls, tend to be mythomaniac in what concerns sexuality mainly when moved by scenes that they watch and whose meaning they don't understand or feel fully, considering his age and the absence yet of any sexual urge. This is aggravated when someone they love is involved. Then they can be led to lie and arrive to convince themselves they are telling the truth. In this movie a small girl accuses falsely a man she loves of raping a friend moved by this kind of feelings and with that she ruins her life and the lives of his elder sister and his lover, the man whom she accuses. The story is rather simple, very simply told and not original enough to deserve a high mark. However the movie is well made and worth to be seen mainly by the acting of all three main characters involved in that tragic story. The atonement suffered by the young girl develops itself through her whole life and ends in a remarkable and moving scene (the last one of the movie) in a very original way that one which makes us to wonder where reality ends and fiction begins.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The Weight of Regret,"""Atonement,"" directed by Joe Wright, is a movie based on Ian McEwan's book. It talks about love, guilt, and how false accusations can ruin lives. The story happens in 1930s England and follows Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), whose love gets destroyed by a lie from Cecilia's sister, Briony.The movie is praised for its great acting, especially by the main actors, and its amazing camerawork. The story is told from different viewpoints, which makes it interesting.One cool thing about ""Atonement"" is its music, which uses the sound of a typewriter as part of the score, showing how stories and words are important. There's also a really impressive long shot of the Dunkirk evacuation.Overall, ""Atonement"" is a beautifully made movie that captures the feelings of the book. It shows how our actions can have big consequences and how we can try to make things right.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Clarification at last,"""Atonement"" (2007): With hesitations: I need to see this one a second time. It may go up or down in my categories. There's no doubt the acting, lighting, and photography were great. The 1930's story has too much of what I've long been weary  Constipated English Gentry. There is a glossy, invisible division between the viewer and the characters, making them seem less real. The story jumps around and often morphs, which I didn't mind, but doubted its usefulness until the last 15 minutes, when it was finally clarified. It didn't take long to understand the idea of ""atonement"", but I WAS caught by surprise as to how it was all happening. This was interesting to me, and finally removed the ""glossiness"" with which I had trouble.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Watery wartime soup,"Just as food was rationed in World War II, the watery-thin story line of this film is strung out and made to last for 130 minutes. There is simply not enough meat here, not enough to get your teeth into and I left the cinematic table still feeling hungry.But setting the story aside, there is much to appreciate. The casting is perfect. Although good in the role, Keira Kightley's character doesn't have enough to do, and not enough to merit her Bafta nomination. James McAvoy is excellent, and a worthy contender for his nomination. But he has no chance against the towering performance of Javier Bardem in ""No Country for Old Men"" this time around  his time will surely come. Vanessa Redgrave makes an appearance at the very end of the film, and spends 10 minutes or so in close up. Using every nuance of her facial expression, she is wonderfully moving.Wartime England is fastidiously recreated, with meticulous attention to detail, and with remarkable authenticity. I really felt like I was there. The cinematography and art direction are exquisite, as are the costumes, and easily merit their Oscar nominations.It seemed to me as though 90% of the budget was spent on one scene; on the beaches of Dunkerque, an enormous sprawling set with thousands of extras, where the camera wanders around and through the activities of the soldiers (not sure why?). it goes on forever. Perhaps they had some cash left in the budget and so decided to splash out on a ""big"" scene. Big it is, and painstakingly created, but it is to my mind also superfluous; visual padding to compensate for the inadequate storyline.There was a wartime joke in England: ""If this is chicken soup, then the chicken must have walked through it on stilts"". That just about sums it up.This is watery soup served in an exquisite hand-painted porcelain bowl",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of the strongest movies of 07,James McAvoy gave the best performance in Atonement. I didn't think I would think that but he was terrific. I would give him an Oscar nomination for sure. Redgrave's eyes at the end tell all. Seriously you didn't even need her tremendous speech because it's all in her body language. Garai is great during and after her encounter with the french soldier as well as the apartment scene. The praise for Ronan doesn't capture how good and natural she is. Knightley was fine but doesn't rate with any of the Briony's or McAvoy.The cinematography in the movie is remarkable. Not only for the stunning tracking shot but for when Briony goes into the library.

More smart than heart,"In a 1935 hot summer day, the destiny of three characters is changed for the worse. The first part of this drama takes place in an opulent country mansion where despicable 13 yo, would-be writer Briony lives with her family and some guests.Briony has -allegedly- a crush on Robbie, a lower class, bright boy, son of a servant, who's helped financially by Briony rich family to pursue his studies. Robbie is in lust with Cecilia, Briony's older sister and their mutual attraction sizzles and coalesce as a quickie in the library before a formal dinner.They're caught in the act by Briony, who gets immediate chance at revenge, by accusing Robbie of having raped 15 yo Lola, who's staying in the mansion during her parents divorce.Robbie is incarcerated, Cecilia gets estranged from his family and only at the start of WWII Briony begins to understand the damage she did with her lie. Robbie gets out to prison under the condition of enlisting and ends up in Dunkirk. Cecilia works as a nurse in London and the two exchange love letters planning their future together. Briony also attends the nursing school, as the first step of her atonement.There follows a very long sequence in Dunkirk, showed as a hellish circle in long and nausea-inducing shots.The third act takes place in the present and discloses whether Robbie and Cecilia got their second chance. Following the eponymous novel, the film is cleverly plotted but not heartbreaking, the main issue being the Robbie-Cecilia love story.It just never rings true, because they only have a couple of minutes together ""for real"" and that shows only the first stage of what could have been a strong infatuation, but not necessarily ""love"".Also, Briony's motivation for her lie is never really explained, unless one buys the fact that she had a crush on Robbie, but even that is not sure. All the character seem cardboard cuts cleverly moved on a chessboard to elicit strong feelings, which they fail to do.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Tedious, monotonous, pointless, meaningless, absurd...have I covered it?","The main thing I need to enjoy a movie is to like one or more of the characters. I disliked every single person portrayed in this useless and empty film. None of them had anything redeeming about their personalities or purpose in life. A good story helps too, which Atonement sadly lacked. My wife and I suffered through, hoping somehow a good ending would make up for a depressing bummer of a movie. We were sorely let down.There--that's my 10 lines for IMDb. This movie doesn't deserve any more description than this.

A Beautiful Film,"'Atonement' is a true Oscar film. It received seven nominations- and it deserved every one. It's the story of Briony Tallis, a young writer who sees something she thinks she understands, but really doesn't. When she accuses her sister's lover of a heinous crime, it changes the course of three people's lives forever.The cast is wonderful here, with Kiera Knightley and James McAvoy giving perfect performances in the roles of the two young lovers. Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garei, and Vanessa Redgrave all play Briony at different points in her life. Ms. Redgrave is especially affecting in easily the smallest part.All production values are done perfectly, with great direction from Joe Wright. Cinematography, art direction, costumes- all very well-done. And that music!!! What a fantastic score, intriguingly mixing sound effects and music together. It's a shoe-in for Best Original Score.In the end, though, it's the heart-wrenching story that makes the film a masterpiece. As much mystery as it is romance 'Atonement' is never boring, but always changing and moving. And as far as endings go- this one is perfect, unlike anything I've ever seen. Whatever you do, don't spoil it for yourself! If 'No Country for Old Men' doesn't sweep the Oscars, it will probably be because 'Atonement' was right at its heels. Do yourself a favor and see it on the big screen while you still can! 8/10 stars!Jay Addison",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Daring and Challenging for a Mainstream Film,"I had put off seeing ""Atonement"" because it looked like so many epic romance films that came before it.I was pleasantly surprised. This is a film that takes a lot of chances. First and foremost is the narrative structure. Some of the scenes are shown out of sequence. Some of the scenes are shown twice and from different points of view. And some scenes, we later find out, never really happened.For the most part, we are not told any of this, so you really have to pay attention and think about what is going on. Unlike most films these day, you cannot passively watch this film.In addition, the film is carried by young Saoirse Ronan who dominates the screen whenever she is on. The other actors are good, but Miss Ronan's performance is really special.The directing also takes a lot of chances with lots of close ups and camera angles. The music is memorable and incorporates a typewriter as a musical instrument. It reminds me a lot of the film music of Phillip Glass.If you have been avoiding ""Atonement"" because you thought you had seen it all before, think again. This is one of the most daring and experimental mainstream films to come out in a long time.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Great Movie... with a few problems,"The first 45-50 minutes of this film were absolutely beautiful. Had the film just been released as that I would have perhaps loved it more. The director Wright is certainly coming into his own and I am anticipating all of his upcoming films. Saoirse Ronan was wonderful as the young Briony, her performance really impressed me, especially considering she is so young, her academy award nomination was very much deserved and not at all one of those nominations that is just tagged onto an epic film to make it look better. I think I can almost even say that once her part in the film is over nothing quite holds up as well.I guess this is mainly why I feel the film is disjointed, we spend the first 45 minutes of the movie exploring ONE single day, then we breeze through the final hour or so of the film and cover a span of several decades. So we go from the minute exploration of the details of a day to the cliffs notes of the rest of everyone else's life.This film was around 2 hours and really should have been right at 3 hours, I felt so much was left unsaid and unexplored, the pace for the first hour indicated that you were in for an English Patient type of film and yet at some point the filmmakers decided not to be so bold with this project.Speaking of the English Patient, I am a film scholar and the director of the English Patient shows up near the end of this film in a small role and that completely took me out of this film. All I could think of was why did they put Anthony Minghella in this film? I mean I know I shouldn't have been so distracted but I was.This films marketing came in completely wrong, it seemed arrogant, all of the magazine interviews only focused on how it was believed that this film would rack up 14 Oscar nominations.But all said and done I still believe this film is worthy of its Best Picture Nomination, and of the nominees I might almost consider it the best, although There Will Be Blood was quite interesting.Bottom Line: See it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"An almost flawless, visually arresting film (my review)","When I read Ian McEwan's masterful novel, Atonement, upon its release, a film adaptation seemed unfathomable. McEwan's metafictional, multifaceted novel is a tour de force of (what I believed to be) inimitable depth. Here, screenwriter Christopher Hampton and director Joe Wright turn McEwan's novel into an epic beauty with powerful acting, visual complexity and a story that is gracefully paced until rewarding its audience with an ending of moral consequence that many films often fail to deliver.The film opens with young Briony Tallis, typing away at her typewriter a play named, The Trials of Arabella. At age 13, Briony has the mind, perseverance and imagination to become a successful writer. The film does not convey her peculiarities about writing in the same, playfully elegant way the novel does, but it still conveys her obsession and willpower. However, as her superficial play endeavors fall apart, the plot takes a turn. Briony is a witness to four key events that change the life of the story.As Briony is in distress about her unsuccessful play, she looks out the window and catches her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) stripping down to her undergarments. Staring at her is Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), the son of Briony's family's housekeeper. Briony is baffled and looks away for a second. This is the first of four reasons for Briony's imagination to run wild and believe that Robbie Turner is a sexual fanatic.The second event is a mistake on Robbie's behalf: a note, written out of frustration for expressing his feelings about Cecilia is giving to Briony to give to Cecilia. It is too late when Robbie realizes that he handed Briony the frustration note, not the final draft. Third: a scene in the study convinces Briony that Robbie is a sex maniac. The final event is one of the crucial events of the story, and it is crucial to the theme of ""Atonement.""While Wright shows both Briony's perspective and Robbie and Cecilia's to show the audience the different perspectives, it is easy to empathize with the young, imaginative Briony. Briony believes she is witnessing inappropriate sexuality, while Robbie and Cecilia are simple exploring their sexual curiosities. At first, it seems easy to assume that Briony is an evil girl, but she is simply an adolescent full of curiosity and a bit of frustration. Although Briony is the cause of dreadful things, she is not a despicable character by any means.""Atonement"" is the type of film that could have easily been an overdone love story, but Wright turns Hampton's strong script into a story of love, war and loss. This film works on many levels, including: great acting, a great score by Dario Marianelli and flawless directing with one of the most unforgettable tracking shots in recent film history.In the final sequence of the film, we meet Briony again, now much older, and promoting what is said to be her final novel, entitled Atonement. The audience learns what happened (or what could have happened) to Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis from the mind of the atoning novelist, Briony Tallis. The story told through Briony's character is a heartbreaking saga of the only thing she felt she could do to give herself the atonement and piece of mind she desperately needed.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"ATONEMENT (Joe Wright, 2007) ***","This year I've fallen so far behind in checking out the films up for an Academy Award that this one is actually the first of the heavyweight contenders  and the ceremony is just two weeks away! Anyway, this is a very British product: exceedingly refined and, therefore, teetering on the edge of boredom  in short, overrated, and encapsulating what passes for an Oscar-worthy title these days. Given the film's old-fashioned appeal and being unfamiliar with the work of director Wright, I was surprised by its flashy technique (perhaps adopted to disguise the thin plot which, such as it is, doesn't really compel attention) with the entire war segment and, in particular, the apparent necessity to present it in such detail i.e. not merely graphic but even reverting to unsubtitled French for a couple of scenes, coming off as a distraction more than anything else! The lengthy tracking shot on the beach seen during this segment is a valiant attempt even if, again, it doesn't present us with anything we haven't seen before in countless war-themed movies.Rather, it's the central idea of a single impulsive action (by a child) having terrible repercussions on an amorous young couple  and, by extension, her own life  which is the most interesting and sensitively handled (particularly when, during the moving finale, it's established that part of what has gone on before is purely wish-fulfillment on the girl's part!). Incidentally, she's the real protagonist of the narrative  despite the couple (James McAvoy and Keira Knightley) being top-billed; the girl is actually played by three different actresses (including Vanessa Redgrave)  since we see her through various phases of her life  and all of them deliver fine performances (the youngest, in fact, Saiorse Ronan has even been Oscar-nominated). In essence, this is a reasonably good film within the (low) standards prevalent nowadays  but, as with most of modern cinema, it doesn't really warrant more than a cursory viewing for me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The whole was less than the sum of the parts,"There is lots to like about this movie. The acting was generally very good, particularly the contained intensity of Brioney. Most of the scenes are well constructed, with the exception of the outdoor shots in wartime London  which are a little awkward have feel staged.The five-minute one shot sequence at Dunkirk would have been a brilliant achievement in a different type of film where it served a purpose (as in Children of Men). In this one it's out of place, self conscience and makes the audience feel the same.Overall its an enjoyable film that does draw you in and hold your attentions but it fails to leave any lasting impression.

#1 on worst movies of all time,"I think if I hear one more comment about Atonement being an outstanding movie I might just hurl. Considering I saw comments before the movie saying things like ""One of the greatest love stories of all time"" and ""Heart-wrenching"" or ""A true master-piece"" I'll admit I was expecting something wonderful. My expectations were high, and I was very excited as I sat in the theater before the movie began. I had been told that it would be as good as The Notebook, and it would make me cry repeatedly. This just added to my anticipation. The movie started off slow. It was okay though, movies that I love have started off slow, so I was not going to be quick to judge. However, the movie continued for the next 45 minutes to be boring and quick frankly about nothing. As I looked around the theater I saw many people looking calmly at the screen or glancing around. A few even text messaging on their phones. It was an hour into the movie I decided I could not handle anymore and went to get a refill of popcorn. When I came back and asked what I had missed after being gone for about 10 minutes (I decided I needed to use the bathroom and make a phone call while I was out there) my friend stated ""uh well...nothing actually."" Wow I thought that is so surprising since so much has been happening this entire movie. When they movie finally and thankfully ended I sat there a little confused. I thought it was supposed to be a story about love. The love in Saw IV was greater. No looked sad as they walked out of the theater. No one looked thrilled after seeing such a marvelous movie. Everyone just walked out, and no one spoke. I finally reached my car and asked what everyone thought. The responses were all the same ""well it was okay I suppose...I mean it wasn't really about love or really about anything except war so..."". I would rather go and see Norbit 10 times in a row before I saw this movie again. If Atonement wins anymore awards or praise I am going to scream.

Absolutely Worth Your Money!,"After searching around for a movie to watch yesterday, I finally came across ""Atonement"". I did the usual on IMDb before watching it: reading the trivia, taking a glance at the cast list, reading a spoiler-less review or two...Being the Nicholas Sparks fan that I am, I have to say that I was expecting the ""usual"" with someone dying of a terminal illness or something along those lines. I was even expecting the unusual ending like the one from the French film ""A Very Long Engagement"".The ending of this film was totally unexpected.Who knew that something so simple could develop into a monstrous misunderstanding that changes the entire outcome of things... This is a very different film, and it does things in a way that makes you question why, but by the end it leaves you thinking why not. While parts of it may be confusing, everything becomes clear by the end. The ending is simply marvelous. I've never seen anything quite like it. You would like to think that it's complete, but after what has happened it can never be. There is humor. There is mystery. There is romance. There are twists and turns, and there is heartbreak.It is not everyday that you come across something as powerful as ""Atonement"", and when you do it's something that carries you out of your seat and blows you away, leaving you awestruck at the sheer beauty of it all as the credits roll...",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Powerful story, powerful film","One of my favourite films of 2007, this made a great impact on me when I saw it in the cinema, and watching clips screened on TV since only reminds me of the many highlights that it features. The storyline of the film is well-structured - based around a young girl's confused and spiteful reactions to her older sister's romance. Joe Wright as director subtly shifts styles, leading from the clipped and mannered 1930s through the upheavals of WW2, and on to the dramatic revelations in the sterile TV studio at the conclusion (delivered by the excellent Vanessa Redgrave). This is one of those films that makes terrific use of the wide screen, nowhere more so than in the excellent recreation of the soldiers' views of the long wait for evacuation from Dunkirk. Performances from the whole cast are very good, with James McAvoy in particular delivering what will hopefully be just one of many memorable roles to come. Highly recommended!",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""Our story will resume...""","I always recall Roger Ebert's comment on Anna Paquin's character in ""The Piano"". He says she plays a little girl who is intentionally mischievous; who sees things and uses them to hurt others. Well, there's a little girl in ""Atonement"", called Briony (the intense 14-year-old Saoirse Ronan), who's exactly the opposite: she reads something, she witnesses something and makes a mistake that will chase her for the rest of her life.It's England in the 30's; formality and distance between one person and another are the basis of Ian McEwan's famous novel; what Briony witnesses are two young people bursting in love and passion as you didn't see every day during those times, but how could she understand? And she drives Robbie (James McAvoy) and her sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) away. He ends up in a war, she whispers ""come back to me"", he writes ""the story can resume, our story can resume""; we wait.However, this is not the ""Cold Mountain"" storyline in which the blue knight has to face impossible obstacles to get to his princess, no. These are two lives that have fallen apart and before they did they sat together in a family table full of unspoken secrets, sexual tension and disappearances, all in one single day. And the little girl experienced too much in such a short period of time: too much to take for a joyful soul, writer of plays full of fantasies. ""Atonement"" is also the little girl's story, we come to realize; and in a way, the story of every individual present that night when everything collapsed.Joe Wright teams up with Keira Knightley again after ""Pride & Prejudice"" and I can't help comparing both pieces. I was expecting at least something better, but ""Atonement"" makes Wright's screen debut seem like a piece of broken glass in the floor you don't want to step on. The appropriate, correct direction it's gone; characters don't seem like puppets with final destinations anymore.There's a creative turn this time around, with the British director worried about the camera work (Seamus McGarvey brilliantly inspiring cinematography); a work of immense proportions that shows affection for the characters it's shooting. When you watch ""Pride & Prejudice"" you say: ""how beautiful this looks"", and it stops there; when watching ""Atonement"" you say: ""how beautiful it looks and how powerful it is"". I think Wright has done something more powerful than what he imagines.Keira Knightley may not live up to her work as Elizabeth Bennett, but she is perfect and looks beautiful in a completely different character with more strength. And James McAvoy takes another huge step; you may want to watch ""The last King of Scotland"" and then thisWhat a leading man! I'll say no more. Maybe it's the novel: how different it is from Jane Austen's beloved tale and how well Christopher Hampton adapted it, covering the time changes and the different stages of life it goes through.Dario Marianelli's score, unnoticeable in 'Prejudice', is definitely present here; loud, clear and meaningful although a little repetitive if you pay attention. Now that I mention repetition, if you think the film abuses of flashbacks, you are right; but it has a purpose. You see, every flashback is from 'that day' and 'that night' and, in different moments, each of the main characters relive the events in their own way.Take the little girl as an example. I mentioned above that she makes a mistake that haunts her lifeBut she thought she was doing the right thing! Then she grows up, and when we see her as an old lady, portrayed by Vanessa Redgrave in a heartbreaking final speech, we wonder: How long does it take for someone to realize the wrong they have done? And everything that question means.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Nutshell Review: Atonement,"So now we know why the young must be protected from vulgarities and from sexual scenes, because with vivid imagination, they could probably be quick to jump to conclusions, being unable to grasp and fully understand the situation at hand, nor the gravity of their actions, especially when they're shooting from the hip.Initially, I thought I would be able to watch Atonement if I had managed to make my way to Tokyo for its International Film Festival last October. But I didn't, and I waited, and waited, and when I finally managed to watch it this evening, I felt that it didn't work for me, no matter how much I can identify with the longing to be with someone, and being unable to. It contained themes I very much like, but perhaps I'm beginning to get tired of it, since they are somewhat negative emotions that do take their toil over a period of time.Set in the 30s England just before the outbreak of WWII, we get introduced to the rather aristocratic Tallis family, where we witness the budding start of a romance between Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and the housekeeper's son ROBBY (James McAvoy), with the help of flimsy, wet lingerie to bridge the divide separating their swearing of true feelings for each other. However, to sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan, who clinched an Oscar Nomination), she starts to see a different side of it, made worse by a misunderstanding and in actuality, a mistake Robby made when he handed over a letter written with tongue in cheek and brain in the gutter (yep, you can say men think about sex most of the time).And that one single day had everything a loving couple could have wished for - the discovery and declaration of love, the passionate love making, but only for everything to come crashing to a halt when Robby gets accused for a crime he did not commit. And you can feel the disappointment and anger of course, at the accusation because it was somewhat steeped in presumptions of class or the lack thereof, and the hypocrisy, coupled with seething rage as we the audience, with knowledge of hindsight (and the benefit of just knowing), can tell that it's so utterly wrong, with obvious clues of course to who the perpetrator might be.While we love to see the lovebirds coming together, the movie's more about the time they spend apart. And that unfortunately somehow sagged the movie to low depths, as we see them spend their screen time independently, with McAvoy brooding over his life now in disarray as he volunteers for war to escape from the confines of a prison cell, and Knightley unfortunately becoming relegated to a support role, which you can hardly feel her character, her pain, and her love for the man now so far away. It is hardly any wonder why both actors missed out on Oscar nominations (not that it mattered), because their roles hardly challenged what these 2 actors could have delivered. The scene stealer turned out to be child actress Saoirse Ronan, who is the cause of the turn of events, though the mantle of her character get passed to Ramola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave.What made Atonement work though was the technical side of it. The score was excellent and director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice) made sure it gelled so well with the visuals, that it becomes an extension to what's on screen. You can't deny that art direction and cinematography were superb. Editing was non-conventional, but never confusing, offering you both what is perceived truth, and hindsight knowledge, just as how Briony would have experienced it. But what's missing, for a romance at least, and the danger of having every technical aspect delivered so clinically, was the absence of an emotional resonance, because without it, a romance movie can be pretty empty, and soulless, going through the motions without attempting to allow you to crawl under their skins to empathize with them and their sorry plight.I had looked forward to Atonement with so much anticipation, that I guess when I've finally seen it, my expectation got deflated so bad that it turned out to be anti-climatic for me, even with an ending that should have wowed and kept one thinking and discussing about the unfortunate futility of one's actions, set in stone, setting the wheel in motion, and being unable ever to be turning it back.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Tantalizing but detached.,"When I first saw this I was quite happy with the film. I thought it was a tasteful adaptation of the brilliant novel. I've been surprised, however, at how forgettable the film is. It's not a film that takes a hold on you even for just a little while. The book pulls you in and includes one of the best descriptions of what it must've been like to work at a hospital during W.W.II that I've ever read. The film is beautiful to look at, and Joe Wright is a capable and gifted director. However there is a sense of detachment that permeates the whole film. James McAvoy, wonderful in ""The Last King of Scotland,"" is stymied by the painterly scenes that don't let their characters be real, breathing people. The music is pleasant but has the effect of just adding to the whole package. The music says ""Now, you must feel this way."" The only thing that is truly worth seeing in this film is Vanessa Redgrave at the end of the film. Sure, the film will get Oscars. It's the kind of film major award-givers love. It's a love story set in the inter-war years that segues into W.W.II. There is a long tracking shot of a battlefield. Who can resist these? But it's all glitter and not much substance. I like the fact that there are filmmakers willing to adapt complex novels into films, and they should continue to do so.

Honestly...,"I don't know what to say about this one. A very twisted, pathetic, pitiful story. Not that I don't liked it, it was a good movie.

I really don't know what to think about it. Did I understood what happened? Did I really enjoy it or it's just my nature to not criticize so harsh a work? Did the story it's just that captivating and interesting as many others say? Or I just applied the ""sheep"" thing and convinced myself it was a good film based on others opinions?These are my feelings for now after a half hour waiting, after seeing the movie to put all the pieces together in order to write my opinion. I understood the hole point of the story, I understood the story itself and what happened, but...I don't know. Maybe I expected more.

So many pregnant pauses it could have had sextuplets! A waste of great actresses like Brenda Blethyn and Harriet Walter. Unfortunately, this film has got the critics eye and will no doubt clean up at the awards, another travesty. Interestingly nearly half the people who commented on this film hated it despite it's high score.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Contemporary twist film that uses romance as its drive before hitting us with the tragedy.,"Such a film like Atonement is one that sneaks up on you; it builds and builds seemingly going nowhere or not doing anything to suggest anything fantastic before hitting you with a contemporary twist. It's a film that makes you think; thus already elevating itself above a certain level of quality, there have been films that have used this little tactic in recent years that have spawned both great hate and admiration; films like: The Usual Suspects, Fight Club and even The Village. The films hit you with a series of scenes that although seem disjointed and random, all make sense when the apparent 'twist' makes itself known.After the film had ended; it got me thinking, which is a good sign. 'What does Atonement actually mean?' I thought to myself and that's when the penny dropped. Such audacity to have a major clue in the films title hinting at the possible results that will happen following the events that occur in the film's first plot point. If that sounds complicated then good, because clever films are complicated. Following Atonement's finale, I think two thirds of what I was going to say about the film were rendered either incorrect or useless; such is its nature that it relies on twisty, bendy and fate driven incidences to get across both its story and tragedy. I was sceptical for the best part of this film, noticing a lot of frustrations and rather a few incidences of inconsistency.Firstly, I did not buy how Briony (played by three different actresses) put two and two together regarding the incident at the fountain and how she would perceive it to be anything sexual; secondly, I find it amazing how even in the 1930s it would seem a thirteen year old girl would be able to identify the ""worst word of them all."" Granted, the third occurrence of a sexual nature that happens in the library Briony observes is the most blatant but I feel if she'd spied them kissing previously or whatever instead of the incident at the fountain that had nothing to do with anything sexual, it would've made for a better build up. To sum up; I fail to see how a thirteen year old girl can honestly 'see' sexual discrimination between two people who are standing at a fountain talking; before one of them has to take their top off so that they can get into the fountain to retrieve something. But these events lead to the bigger picture because when she finds them in the library, things really screw up her psyche.This is where the film's reoccurring theme of luck/chance comes in; if their hadn't been a wasp in the room, Briony wouldn't have gone to the window; if Robbie (McAvoy) hadn't sent the wrong note like he so stupidly does, everything would've been fine; if Robbie and Cecilia (Knightley) had spoken to Briony after she caught them in the library perhaps explaining what was happening and how everything would be alright, Briony wouldn't have felt as bad as she did. Little inconsistencies like this do bug me in films where the logical thing to do is substituted for sake of a story. But the initial incident also has a lot of inconsistencies; such as the fact Briony sees another example of love and/or sexual relations in the form of forced said events; in such quick proximity to one another in a certain time frame. The attacker is also stupid enough to recognise the witness that is Briony and run off without confronting her. I remember feeling that the attacker must not have known Briony otherwise they would've hung around to explain their actions  turned out they did know Briony but ran off anyway  how could they assume she didn't see their face?Following said events, Robbie finds himself in France just before the Nazi invasion and the event that was the Dunkirk evacuation which is brilliantly captured in one, long take. Running parallel with this is Briony's life as a nurse in London, treating the injured. Here, I wondered why we were following Briony and this where the film makes you think it's flailing and flailing but really it's playing you because it's doing everything right. True, Briony would have no idea what's happening to Robbie in France but we are shown it anyway; instead, Cecilia is ignored only until she is visited by Briony  an event that I was tearing my hair out over when questioning the character's sanity and ability to let it all go: Robbie gives her an earful because of her action. But where I thought Atonement was going through the numbers of trying to make its apparent hero make up for past mistakes; suffer an epiphany; yadder, yadder yadder.........but no, it was playing me.It may sound like I am bashing Atonement but it does the business in the end. Getting there is a little messy but the story is very smart with a real feeling of: 'what if said event hadn't happened' and the closing montage of the fates of people is stirring because you don't see it coming; you have been led to believe one thing and then had what you thought turned on its head. There is enough authenticity and beauty to be had in the photography and costume with an air of tragedy and regret flowing throughout as the film switches perspectives in a confusing but rewarding manner.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
he sleeps so deeply,"My generation grew up on the novels of Ian McEwan. As undergraduates, we ate up the illicit thrills of First Love, Last Rites and The Cement Garden. We reveled in the delicious viciousness of The Comfort of Strangers. It crescendo-ed with the cathartic joy of life, death and re-birth in The Child in Time. Nothing lasts, of course, and Black Dogs, Amsterdam, and Enduring Love all failed to scale previous heights. We smiled indulgently at the dabble with children's literature. This list isn't comprehensive, but you get the point - there was a distinct cooling off between McEwan and his public.And then along came Atonement. An incredible, startling return to form that ripped your heart out.Film adaptations of McEwan have hardly set the heather on fire. I approached Atonement the movie aware of all the plaudits, but expecting, at best, a decent-ish bastardization of the novel. Instead, the film achieves the cathartic heights of its source material. McAvoy is outstanding, the weight of injustice chiselled on his every expression. The technical aspects of the film are superb, the Dunkirk extended steadicam shot both outrageous and aesthetically appropriate. The score is playful but serious, in perfect harmony with McEwan's devastating conceit.McEwan fans will appreciate the elliptical structure, rewinding of time, flash backs and flash forwards. Having said that, my Japanese viewing partner had not read the novel but appreciated the film immensely.For some odd reason, The Child in Time, McEwan's best novel, remains unfilmed. I sincerely hope the people responsible for Atonement will one day turn their attention to that masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
My Favorite Film Of 2007.,"I love period dramas. I love a movie with a good story and good characters. Atonement has this and more.First, I love the way the story is told. The way it's divided and the change in tone.Robbie (James McAvoy) and Cee (Keira Knightley) are characters I could identify with. Their love story is one of the most beautiful as well as heartbreaking I've seen. The love and passion between them makes it one of the best romantic plots I've seen in a movie.My favorite character, however, is Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan). Not only she's my favorite character from the film, she's my favorite film character from 2007 altogether. Briony is such a complex character played amazingly by Saoirse Ronan, who got nominated for an Oscar and gets my personal win.The acting is flawless from everyone involved. McAvoy and Knightely have superb chemistry and portray a very realistic romance. Ronan is brilliant and gives my favorite performance.The direction by Joe Wright is impeccable. I really liked his work in Pride & Prejudice, but he truly shined in here.The score is astounding and it's the only Oscar the film won. The cinematography is beautiful and captivating. Art direction and costume design are great as well. The green dress being a popular item.To conclude, I love this film. I think it's one of the best period dramas and one of the best stories ever told. Not only romantic stories, but stories overall.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"A Disappointing And Dispiriting Adaptation, Only Worthwhile As A Brit Calling Card to Hollywood And Oscar","Atonement seems more natural a subject for a novel, rather than a film, as it concerns writing and its momentous consequences, be it a note, a letter or a novel. Moreover, Atonement has a writer at its centre, and is therefore at an even greater disadvantage for film-making, as the craft of writing is laborious and involves little physical action. It is essentially a solitary, even obsessive, occupation, and so doesn't lend itself to the active demands of a film. But it may be argued that a clever, imaginative film would find some way round this.Unfortunately, Atonement is not a clever film. Instead, its makers seem to have been rather complacent and smugly thought that the film would sell on the back of the alluring parts of the novel, in other words a lavish country house in high summer where there is upstairs-downstairs class antagonism and illicit sex scandals, and later a shift to a harsh wartime romance. The filmmakers seem to have thought that this would suffice. However, stretched over two hours, the film seems rather thin, even threadbare.The characters in the novel have unusual depth and subtlety. While this has been retained, to an extent, in this adaptation, on screen they seem unreal, lifeless. And with the exception of the three excellent actresses who play Briony at different ages, the (no more than) competent acting complements the competent, but still lacking, characterisation.Christopher Hampton, who usually engages as a writer and director, has written a disappointing script which loses the charged, sweltering promise of its first act (which would actually have made a much better short film) and gives way to a staid middle act which relies on wartime sentimentality and tries far too hard to elicit pathos in the viewer.Joe Wright seems content to direct Atonement as a calling card to Hollywood and Oscar, his highpoint being the long scene showing the Dunkirk evacuation, which is technically accomplished and stunning, but also wearying and approaching banality as this kind of thing has been done as well so many times before. The film's denouement seems tacked on to provide a smart-looking, post modern ending.Atonement is a disappointing and dispiriting adaptation of a clever, intriguing novel.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Pretty good but not memorable,"Did this movie live up to the hype?No,not really.It is a watchable film to be sure but at the end of the day I felt it was OK and nothing better than that.I won't go over the plot of the film as I am guessing that you have already watched it.It is a good story and very well filmed but I didn't feel a connection with any of the characters at all and felt no emotion throughout the film.It is nicely directed by Joe Wright although I did feel that the Dunkirk sequence was overdone and almost felt as though it was the directors way of showing how clever he was.He does do a good job overall though in fairness to him.Acting wise,James McAvoy was fine as Robbie but Keira Knightley was average at best and I am puzzled that a lot of people were pushing for her to be nominated for an Oscar.She struggled at times to show emotion and though her performance is reasonable,believe me we are NOT talking about award winning stuff here.The two best performances for me were from Saoirse Ronan as the young Briony and Vanessa Redgrave as the old.They are both excellent and the best things about the film.So 'Atonement' is a pretty good watch but not for me a classic.It is one of those films that I was struggling to mark,maybe a 6 or a 7.I decided on a 6 finally because it isn't a film that I would watch again.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Outstanding!,"Atonement is the best romantic film that cinema has seen in a long time. It contains everything needed for a romance to tug at our heartstrings.The British press gave Keira Knightley a lot of credit and were outraged when she didn't receive an Oscar-nomination or a Bafta Award. She is a brilliant actress, stunning in that classical look and I believe the biggest acting sensation since Meryl Streep. However, her performance as Cecilia in Atonement isn't a very large one and therefore I agree and think that the awards went to better performances. The star of the film is without a doubt James McAvoy. His performance reduces you to tears as he is sent to fight in the war. Critics should have made a fuss about him not receiving an Oscar-nomination. He's definitely the best British acting sensation so far and is seriously underrated. His performance is breathtaking.The music is beautiful and goes perfectly with the story. It is original and one of the best.Overall, Atonement is a must see! The cast are brilliant, the music is wonderful-and the story is heartbreaking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Epic Sweep and Complex Character Arcs Bring Ian McEwan's Masterful Novel to Cinematic Life,"Cineastes will recognize the shadowy figure interviewing the elderly Briony at the end of this sumptuously produced 2007 film as director Anthony Minghella, who tragically passed away earlier this week. One can surmise that director Joe Wright's use of the estimable filmmaker for a well-placed cameo is something of a tribute to Minghella's work on similarly grandiose epics like ""The English Patient"". Minghella would have been an ideal director for Ian McEwan's emotionally complex 2002 novel, as would have been David Lean since the film concurrently evokes the sweep of ""Doctor Zhivago"" and the intimacy of ""Brief Encounter"" (especially in the wartime tearoom scene). Regardless, Wright does an admirable job in translating what is essentially an interior story into something quite cinematic. Much of the film's measured success has to do with his and screenwriter Christopher Hampton's abiding fidelity to McEwan's time-juggling story structure.The story is actually divided into two discrete parts. The first takes place on an inauspicious summer day at a rolling English estate in 1935 as precocious 13-year-old Briony Tallis writes a play for the children to perform at a dinner party that evening. She idolizes her beautiful older sister Cecilia and harbors a crush on the housekeeper's impassioned son Robbie Turner. When she sees the two together at the garden fountain, she presumes a situation more provocative than what really occurred. Later that evening, Briony makes a false accusation, and Robbie ends up wrongly accused of a crime and sent off to prison. The second part takes place five years later as Europe is engulfed in WWII. Robbie has moved from prisoner to foot soldier in France, aching over Cecilia while trying to get to Dunkirk in order to return to England. Cecilia has become a nurse, as has a now-grown Briony regretfully estranged from her sister. Where the story goes from there is startling and moving in ways that are quite unexpected.I'm rather divided on the performances. As the headstrong Cecilia, Keira Knightley evokes old-school glamour with her coltish beauty in an impactful manner reminiscent of a young Katharine Hepburn, but her character dissipates somewhat as the story progresses. James McAvoy captures the boyish magnetism of Robbie while gaining gravitas as his idealized character faces the fatalistic horror of war head on. Together though, Knightley and McAvoy somehow just miss creating the image of enduring passion necessary to carry the core story. On the other hand, Briony allows three superb actresses to seamlessly show the character's evolving fate. As the adolescent, Saoirse Ronan dominates the first third of the film with searing self-possession. She makes us care about Briony despite her repugnant act of self-interest. Romola Garai takes over as a young, uncertain nurse caring for badly maimed soldiers in a London hospital. Finally, Vanessa Redgrave carries the last scene by providing the denouement with her characteristic authority and giving the title its true meaning.All the production values are stunning  Sarah Greenwood's meticulous production design, especially in the Dunkirk scenes; Jacqueline Durran's simply designed period costumes; Dario Marianelli's stirring music score (with an effective if somewhat excessive use of typewriter keys to punctuate key scenes) and Seamus McGarvey's rich cinematography. Pay particular attention to the uninterrupted five-minute tracking shot at Dunkirk done with a Steadicam, a bravura set piece along the lines of the opening scene in Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"". The 2008 DVD has a fairly standard set of extras for such an elaborate production - an informative commentary track from Wright; a comprehensive, half-hour making-of documentary, ""Bringing the Past to Life: The Making of 'Atonement'""; a five-minute short, ""From Novel to Screen: Adapting a Classic"", in which Wright, Hampton and McEwan discuss the transition on a cursory level; and seven deleted scenes, about eight minutes in total with optional commentary from Wright.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Absolutely stunning film...especially if you read the novel,"I've only seen this film twice. Once in the theater and the second time with friends, only one besides me who had read the novel. The friends who hadn't read the novel were utterly confused throughout most of it, especially at the beginning, because there really isn't a lot of character development. To honestly appreciate this film, make sure you read the book. It opens up so many doors to understanding it. Overall, a brilliant adaptation, however. Joe Wright is a wonderful director, and Seamus McGarvey's cinematography was stunning.

You will forget Pride and Prejudice when you see this!,"You will forget Pride and Prejudice when you see Joe Wright and Keira Knightley in this movie. This would have to be one of the most beautiful adaptations of a book ever made. It kept to the storyline really well but not so much that the director was terrified of making even the slightest change. The cinematography and the music score in this are beautiful and clever. The flashbacks are great and less confusing than they were in the novel by Ian McEwan and the acting was great. I cannot stand Keira Knightley but she was amazing in this movie and so was James Macavoy who shows he doesn't always have to be remembered as a faun. However the three actors that really steel the show are the three Brionys. Saoirse Ronan was fantastic as the confused child who believes what she tells herself. Then Romola Garai who I think was the best really shoving emotion into her lines. Then Vannessa Redgrave who is on for about five seconds but still nearly brought me to tears in the way she executed her dialogue. If you see this movie I promise you, you will never forget it.

Human nature at its best,"Atonement tells a story, not a typical world war story. The war is there, no case trying to ignore it, but it is only the frame for this masterpiece, watching it makes us remember there were times in which upper social classes determined the destiny of those less lucky.This movie portraits our innate tendency to gain control, our human impulse to impose our will regardless the effects it may have on others.Briony is still a girl about to begin its journey through puberty, her inner perverse thoughts seem to come out after the sleeping period which is childhood. Young Briony is no fool, and finds a way to maintain her desires dormant. Robbie the object of her desire is unreachable, and not only that but he is also naive in believing Briony's purity and rightfulness.The conflict begins when it becomes noticeable that Robbie loves (and lusts)Cecilia, Briony's older sister. And as you may predict, feelings are intense and unbearable for the younger sister. Just like in real life, control is set by the Machiavelical thinkers, not by the innocent and well intended.Atonement is nothing short from being a Greek tragedy in which defying destiny brings terrible consequences. Cecilia and Robbie should have known that a Love that intense would only destroyed them, Society warned them it was not for them to decide, that the rules were pretty clear, they would not be together.Great performances transmit exactly what is meant to be transmitted, Love is not enough, not in this world; on the contrary the world conspires against those who show that which most of us do not have, mutual unconditional love.During the last couple of years the film industry has not been as appealing as before, at least that is the word on the street. What is the case of having 200 mediocre movies when you only get a handful of movies that are really worth reflecting on. I honestly think that Atonement is part of this select group.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement,"A magnificent, visually splendid, powerful drama (I cried towards the end!) which I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it.James MacAvoy plays one of those classic benighted, put-upon, noble, dignified, victim-of-fate characters that - unless Bjork's playing them in a Lars von Trier picture - are rarely more than rag dolls or punching bags for the writer to pile plot points on, but his character is so well-written, so likable, and his performance so good that every little blow he's struck resonates deeply.The initial stages of the love story at the heart of the picture somehow don't feel rushed even though the two leads spend remarkably little time on screen together, and - dare I say it? - Kiera Knightley turns in a fantastic performance that has proved to me once and for all that she is indeed capable of great things.Not only is there a powerful love story, there's also a fascinating moral question running throughout that isn't really wrapped up and is left to the viewer to decide.Aside from the stunning, sledgehammer twist ending, the final moments are incredible in that they dissolve all the film's flaws. Issues I had with pacing in one scene that seemed interminable and my annoyance at the overly-choppy timeline just went away, all fully justified by the time the credits rolled.It looks beautiful, has a great score, and the scene at Dunkirk, an endless tracking shot of huge scope and ambition, is as impressive as anything I've seen in a war picture.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It also shows you the result of one person's actions and then later regret.Atonement i must say has gorgeous scenery just breath taking, beautiful, i can't find enough words to describe the alluring county side.The acting was superb although the little girl at the beginning ""Briney"" did annoy me a bit, it has several twists, and at the end of the movie it wraps everything up in a neat little package so you don't go home wondering what happened to so and so or how did that happen.the movie jumps around a bit but you get used to it and you see it is a very clever movie making method.All in all i loved this movie, an film i really enjoyed seeing, this it is worth it, so if you get the chance i really encourage you to see it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Why Don't You Just P*** Off Then!,"After Atonement received almost unanimously excellent reviews a female friend  who had read the book - and I went off to our local fleapit to judge it for ourselves. In a cinema which was only about one eighth full I guess it was inevitable that a couple would plonk themselves right behind us. The man immediately displayed his credentials. As a trailer for 'The Kingdom' came on, he pronounced in a very loud voice, ""Well, that's a load of FXXXing propaganda!!"", and then continued to denounce every other item  including the adverts  in a similar fashion. Rather optimistically, I hoped he might quieten down for the main feature. It was not to be. 'Atonement' is one of those rather precious British productions which wear their literary credentials on their sleeves. One can admire the beautifully realised images of a sweltering hot English summer; the restrained acting which subtlety highlights the unspoken class structure that permeated through British pre-war society; the way Madden overcomes the non-linear complexities of the novel by using such clever techniques as the clicking of the typewriter as a joining mechanism. Unfortunately this also means that the overall effect can feel rather difficult, slow and dull. Obviously our friend behind us felt this to be so. Almost from the beginning, he shifted and shuffled in his seat, punctuating it all with low grunts, groans and barely suppressed yawns. Finally, as the revered tracking shot unfolded before us, he blurted out, ""God, this is boring!"" In an unexpected turn of events, however, my normally very well-balanced friend had also had enough. Violently jerking round and in a venomous whisper that would have caused Gollum to take a step back, she spat out, ""Well, why don't you p*** off then!"" Silence. This meant that the films' rather special cinematic representation of the chaos of Dunkirk was diminished by the fact that at any time we could have been embroiled in a real life fight. Anti-climatically, the couple quietly got up and left. So, what of the film? In retrospect, although very classily made, Atonement is actually less than the parts. The first section is too reminiscent of 'The Go Between' and the War scenes, although brilliantly realised are not creating new ground. It was well acted, especially Saoirse Ronan as the 13 year old Briony. Even Kiera is fine  although, as my friend pointed out, she works in the part as it calls for someone who is stilted and wooden (God, women can be far crueller than men you know). But in the end? Maybe our vocal friend had a point.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Meaningless, purposeless and utterly ridiculous","The whole story evolves around a freakish petty little lie of a jealous, cowardly and spoiled 13 year old girl that costed 2 people's happiness. The end. I'm not sure if I'm watching the same movie that got everybody praising about. There's no bigger meaning, no redemption, no resolution, no moral high ground and certainly no atonement! Instead, it made me feel rather cheap and ridiculous. The character is rather spiteful and cowardly as she eventually admitted in the end.I really don't mind watching a movie that reveals the ugly side of humanity, as long as it's done in a honest and proper way. The problem with this movie is that the story and character is so petty, but the music score and cinemaphotography makes you feel like you are watching an epic tale. It ended up rather strange and disconnected.It is the epitome of English hypocrisy: Petty, dishonest, self indulgent and meaningless. The whole thing has nothing to do with the Second world war. It was thrown in there in a desperate attempt to rub a little bit meaningfulness off the war. But since the premise is so petty, ugly, meaningless and unnecessary, it appears rather awkward. Everything is cheapened, incuding the war. I would rather go to the extend that it perverted the sacrifice of those who died fighthing the war. Remember, the whole story centers around a jealous 13 year old girl who try to destroy the man she couldn't get because he loves her sister.

I can become again the man who once crossed the surrey park at dusk, in my best suit, swaggering on the promise of life. The man who, with the clarity of passion, made love to you in the library. The story can resume. I will return. Find you, love you, marry you and live without shame.""Joe Wright's Atonement is a beautiful and imaginative film that deftly succeeds at being a perfect adaptation of Ian McEwan's psychologically involving book of the same name. Using every ounce of engaging story available, Wright tackles the film's themes with a confidence considerably rare for such a relatively new director.Towards the beginning of the film, Briony Tallis, an imaginative, yet foolish 13-year-old girl, bares witness to Robbie Turner making love with her older sister and then misinterprets a horrible crime she thinks she understands. Due to her naivety, she falsely accuses Robbie of the crime because of his earlier actions. Through her misguided convictions of the truth, she separates Robbie from Cecelia. The tale continues as Cecelia becomes a nurse and waits for Robbie to return from the war.Christopher Hampton, the screenwriter, quite skillfully adapts the novel into a poignant screenplay. His ability to transform the pages into moving art and transitioning perspectives without sacrificing the pace or emotion of the source material is stunning.Joe Wright excels even further after directing his first film, the spirited, yet simpler ""Pride and Prejudice"". His direction in Atonement is absolutely phenomenal, from the insanely brilliant single-take tracking shot through Dunkirk (perhaps one of the most beautiful and impeccably detailed scenes in film history) to the incredibly erotic and smart sex scene. His ability to deftly and brilliantly portray the most thorough and complex of emotions without the slightest of words being spoken is incredible.Assisting the direction suitably is the seamless cinematography. The decoration and meticulous attention to detail throughout the entirety of the film wonderfully captures the feel and look of each location. The visuals constantly heighten the mood and perception of the story to the point where it feels as though the characters and circumstances of the tale were anything but endearingly human and complex creations of a clever mind.The acting complements the visual prowess of the film perfectly. Saoirse Ronan and James McAvoy are particular standouts in an already top-notch cast. McAvoy instills in his character all the underlying emotions and exhaustion flawlessly. Ronan's talent shines through as she plays a character so complex and naive, the frustration and anger she makes the viewer feel towards her character defines extraordinary acting.On top of everything else, the score is hauntingly breathtaking, from the melodic strikes of the typewriter keys to the melancholic piano and the mournful violin. The music enriches the scenes with an infectious beauty and sadness.Joe Wright is a master storyteller and Atonement is an unforgettably brilliant, incredibly emotional film that deserves any sort of accolades it receives. It is one of only a very few films I have ever seen that I am proud to say is thoroughly without fault throughout its entirety.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement,"Atonement is based upon the novel of the same name by Ian McEwan. The film takes place in 1930's England where a young girl named Briony Tallis witnesses several incidents all in the course of one day and one of them involving her older sister Cecilia and the house's servant Robbie Turner. Not knowing what to make of the events, Briony lies to the authorities in a move that will affect Cecilia and Robbie for the rest of their lives and will also haunt her for the rest of hers as well. This film really is a perfect showcase for the different characters in the story and their emotions, thoughts, feelings and decisions. Going to the authorities and ruining the lives of the people around her are brought on by Briony most likely because as we can see she is brought up into royalty in a very strict, classy and conservative environment and probably has no insight or ideas of what she is later to learn on the night when everything changes. Because she has had such a carefree and in a sense isolated life she has been hidden from these sort of situations and also because of an underlying issue that we learn later in the film is the cause for her harsh and life changing decision she makes by going to the authorities. The film brilliantly captures the different characters at several stages of their life and how the events of the past have hurt them and how they will never be the same because of it. The emotions whether let out or bottled in are really shown by the very talented actors who portray these characters in the film and the film's script gives us a lot to think about and shows us a side of human nature that may seem cruel or ugly, but in most cases is probably more likely than we would like to admit. The story is at times moving, haunting, thought provoking and is paced well especially in the second half and is a film that leaves the viewer with a lot to think about after the initial viewing. Not because the film is in any way particularly confusing, but because of the different social studies of these characters and because of the decisions they make out of ignorance, or for other reasons. The film is set to a beautiful backdrop of wonderful looking cinematography, great sets and costumes that really capture the place and time and a beautiful musical score as well. The real gift of this film besides the very talented people in front of and behind the camera is the script and the book it is based on because it delves into these characters so deeply and shows us their raw and real emotions, flaws and what makes them do the things they do. I personally am one who likes a movie that makes me think and stays with me after I have seen it and this one did that for me. This was a wonderful theatrical version of a great script and novel that is brought to such life and beauty by the great cast and crew behind it. A beautiful, thought provoking and in ways a haunting film that stayed with me and made me want to analyze the film more and more because of these rich characters.

It is a powerful movie that will tug at the heart, the moral story behind the events portrayed is also extremely powerful.For guys like me who find romance movies rather boring don't be turned away by that aspect of the movie. No, there is not any action scenes, there is a few scenes that depict a great deal of graphic war images, but they don't depict any war fighting. The movie is more a crime/drama that involves romance.The movie also has a bit of a twist for an end.This years Oscars ought to be quite interesting between this, Sweeney Todd, There will be Blood, American Gangster, No Country for Old Men and IMHO Gone Baby Gone. See this movie! It is sure to win!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Horrible flick -- poorly executed in almost every way,"What is wrong with Hollywood, the Oscars, and the film festivals these days? I'll tell you. Politics. Atonement won an Oscar -- for what? It's a film whose story leaves you angry and dissatisfied. Briony did in no way atone for her crime (lie). In fact, she was rewarded by having her novels published and no doubt getting rich. Her punishment should have been abject poverty the rest of her life, to be followed by death.Anyone who liked this film has rocks in his/her head. Period.You know, I came out to LA (like so many other hopefuls) to look for my chance in Hollywood with my stories and scripts. Why bother?! This town is mostly blind to quality and good stories. Sure, there are exceptions. Magnolia (corny but very, very well executed story). American Beauty (amazing - Kevin Spacey, what a performer!). Legends Of The Fall (beautifully shot, acted, story - everything). About Schmidt. Look people, these are films with powerful messages, that give us hope, that are entertaining and not boring (Atonement), that shed light on our difficult human condition.I wouldn't waste my precious spittle on Atonement. Yuch! Get the point? Peace.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Spectacular,"I'm a huge James McAvoy fan and on discovering that he was making this (through IMDb no less), I decided to read the book before the film came out. I really liked the book and thought it would make an excellent film as certain chapters were too long and unnecessary. What a fine film it has indeed made.McAvoy is particularly powerful as Robbie Turner a character who completely transforms during the film and who you root for constantly. Saoirse Ronan too is amazing (both Ronan and McAvoy pull off perfect upper class English accents)as is Romola Garai. The only weak link is Keira Knightly who I really dislike as an actress as she is stiff and limited but the film is really about Briony and Robbie's journeys and so her performance isn't particularly crucial.The cinematography is spectacular (THE Dunkirk sequence is breathtaking), the chemistry between the leads is perfect (The scene where they meet over tea fizzles with tension and is one of my favourite scenes)and the score is completely right. The writing and direction fit the plot, setting and acting perfectly and Joe Wright is a director to watch for in the future.So far my favourite film of the year by miles and I'm hoping both the film and McAvoy & Ronan receive the recognition they deserve at the Oscars next year.Highly recommended A++",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A good film,"The trouble with hype is it sets your expectations too high. That said I thought this was a lovely film, and it just seemed to whizz by in no time. It was beautifully filmed and good performances were put in by all the cast , drawing you in and making you feel sympathetic towards the main characters. The twist toward the end of the film was unexpected as well. Being pedantic , the only thing that slightly irritated me about it was that ,in the Dunkirk scene, soldiers were singing"" Bluebirds over the white cliffs of Dover"" which wasn't written until 1941! Apart from that minor quibble ,I would highly recommend it but don't set your expectations ridiculously high like I did!",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Patience may be a necessity here,"This is one of my lower priority Oscar/Golden Globes-nominated movies,as I had no familiarity with the novel and the perception of this film came off as being a ""wispy,English period piece"". Those reasons and also that this was shown in somewhat limited distribution outside of NYC or LA up until closer to the Academy Awards. So with that in mind,I was resigned to seeing this film on DVD and probably long after the Awards had been given out.HAving finally seen this,I can say that while my curiosity was satisfied and I found stuff to like about it,I wasn't as awed or overwhelmed as some whose comments I've skimmed here.The damage done by 13-year-old Briony Tallis(Saorise Ronan,later to be played by Romola Garai)in regards to the relationship between her older sister Cecilia(Keira Knightley)and her prospective boyfriend,a longtime family friend and grounds keeper(James McAvoy)is deep enough to tear the two asunder,right as England is being thrust into World War II. Over the course of the movie,all three principals(and of course,to an extended degree,their friends and other family members)are affected in ways that are both profound and simple.Director Joe Wright paces this movie in a slow,somewhat detached way and,depending on your patience for artsy,disjointed narrative,will either fascinate or frustrate. There is absolutely no hurry to spell out the situations,or for that matter fill in any blanks that the story leaves. To me,it feels kinda like dirty pool being played here:sure,you're drawn in and intrigued,but it seems to string the viewer out and then leave said viewer perhaps confused and even angry by the third act.Beautiful imagery and attention to detail makes this film at least marginally above average. Credit cinematographer Seamus McGarvey and film editor Paul Tothill with that. This movie is certainly a visually intriguing offering,but as overall entertainment,this could be considered a bit of a test,where patience is more than a virtue.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I didn't know until the very end,"how much I loved this movie. And I have to say it forced tears out of me quite violently. What a beautiful film.As you can tell from the trailers this story is about the consequences of a misunderstanding. I don't know if people realize how much damage something like this can do. In the movies, it almost never happens. People say and do the right things all the time unless it's funny then wackiness ensues. But in real life it happens all the time. I almost wonder if some people will think that these things don't really happen and that it makes the movie unrealistic just because they're not used to seeing it.Anyway, the film itself is beautiful and there is an incredibly amazing sequence when they get to a beach. It goes on for a few minutes and I really thought that was breathtaking. I don't think I'm familiar with the director but he did some great work. He and the cinematographer, because to look at it, it's just sumptuous. The cast was also amazing. A few different actresses played the young girl at different stages and I don't know if they really look that much alike or if I just bought into it because the movie was so absorbing, but they all did fantastic work. James McAvoy has one of those faces, it's so clear. You can't stop looking at him, kinda the same way you can't stop looking at Al Pacino. He was under-appreciated in 'The Last King of Scotland' so I'm glad to see he's getting some attention for another great role. And Keira Knightley continues to surprise me. Beautiful as she is she could just kick back and do a lot of vanity projects and collect Pirates royalties, but she continues to prove herself as an actress.This movie will be loved by people who love a film like 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'The English Patient'. It's not as long as those but it fits into that epic love story genre. And Zhivago is on my very short list of favorites so I wouldn't say that lightly. There are some graphic scenes but of war wounds. Not the kind of graphic I was expecting. And there is one very bad word in it that becomes somewhat of a focal point. But if you're a mature individual who doesn't mind those things and who enjoys classic film with war and romance then this is most likely for you.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement,"Atonement initially fails to deliver on any major level. Most of the time the plot remains fairly slow moving and somewhat routine. Hoewever it works due to the fact that it is very powerfully acted by the lead roles namely Romola Garai, Keira Knightley, Saorise Roman and James McAvoy. You can tell that this story was initially a novel and in the opening sequence it is difficult to determine whether this is meant to be a musical or a period drama, which it turns out to be. On saying that, unlike many clichéd period dramas this one actually delivers something of subsidence in the form of the clever twist at the end. The great tragedy of this story is that it shows what can happen when a child comes into contact with a situation that they don't understand and due to the time in which they are, no one is prepared to give them any actual guidance as to how to behave or to respond to that type of situation. We can be thankful I suppose that we live in the age that we do where people are a bit more clued up about male and female relationships then they were 60 or 70 years ago .",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A poignant and moving tale,"What a film! Entirely unpredictable - and utterly compelling - ATONEMENT is a breath of fresh air amid the countless stale remakes, sequels and juvenile comedies that have been filling our multiplexes as of late.I haven't read McEwan's book, but from the trailers to this film I expected a romance. I got it, but also a lot more besides. It's as if a traditional romantic movie has been injected with a massive dose of realism to bring it into the real world, with not always happy results.One or two plot contrivances aside, I was compelled by every minute of this production. I also saw two actors, McAvoy and Knightley, give fine, subtle performances that I hadn't witnessed in either of them before. Especially Knightley, who I usually see playing simpering characters in the likes of those pirate films.Joe Wright - who also directed Knightley in the 2005 PRIDE AND PREJUDICE adaptation - does a brilliant job of getting the tone and mood just right. His five-minute tracking shot of the Dunkirk beaches is breathtaking and on par with those seen recently in CHILDREN OF MEN and WARRIOR KING.Kudos too for the inclusion of some unreliable narration in the latter stages, something films usually avoid in fear of alienating viewers. It works perfectly here.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Stunning!,"The ABSOLUTE proof that movie awards are just another form of commercials for movies that would otherwise leave the distributors with a loss. I was so BORED I tended to fast forward through all the filler. My wife who loves sappy movies would encourage me to fast forward FASTER! The real story was only about 15 minutes long. This is the worst movie ever made slow boring and had a dumb ending. I rented it on the reviews of other posted here so I thought I would worn the rest of you to stay away from this ridiculous mockery of a love story. If you are interested in this movie just read any synopsis written about this movie, it will leave you more content and happy then to actually rent and watch this CRAP! I am completely ANGRY that I had to spend .99 cents to rent this horrible attempt at a movie!",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Magnificent love story given the Ivory-Merchant kind of treatment...,"ATONEMENT ranks as one of the classiest love stories told in recent years, boosted by some brilliant color photography, a lyrical background score, a well crafted script, and some fine ensemble performances. KEIRA KNIGHTLEY sometimes falters with her too clipped way of speaking and throwing away important lines, but otherwise the cast is impeccable.Basically it's a dreamy looking tale of a wealthy family enjoying the summer days in the English countryside and there are hints of a gentle romance going on between a rather snobbish young woman (Knightley) and a handyman at her father's estate (JAMES McAVOY). Their obvious infatuation with each other only incites jealousy in her younger sister Briony (amazing performance from SAOIRSE RONAN), who happens to spy on them from an upper window. She's a girl who once threw herself at the young man by pretending to drown so that he would jump in and rescue her. He does, but is annoyed when he realizes she purposely pretended to drown.From that point on, the plot moves forward and backward in a structure that never becomes clumsy even though it moves between past events and present to tell the tale of how a single lie changes the course of three lives. In director Joe Wright's hands, the tale never becomes maudlin or too complicated to follow and we see the development of strong characters and are satisfied, by the conclusion, that the tale has been told in a very effective way.VANESSA REDGRAVE comes in toward the end, as the older version of the young woman who told a lie, and she has some surprising comments to make that wind up the tale in an oddly affecting way.The standout performances are given by SAOIRSE RONAN as young Briony and JAMES McAVOY. McAvoy is impressive throughout, totally in command of a difficult role, almost emotionally draining in the film's detailed war scenes that have him wandering around in an almost shell-shocked manner. His confrontational moments with the eighteen year-old Briony (RAMOLA GARAI) are brilliantly played by both performers.Many stories have been told where a lie at the very center plays a part in extending the whole tale. This one is very powerful and yet, at the core, remains a tender love story of tremendous emotional depth.The background score by Dario Marianelli , distinguished by lots of piano music, is highly effective in creating the many changing moods of the multi-layered story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A Labor of Love,"Atonement is a labor of love. Each frame of this film is crafted with patience and diligence. You can almost see the storyboard sketches that went into creating what you see on screen. There are some amazing shots which, in fact, the film could have done without while still retaining the quality that it has. But that the makers chose to work hard even on those scenes tells about their attention to detail. For instance, the scene where the Robbie (James McAvoy) is walking with his two fellow soldiers and there is a reflection of the fighter plane on the water canal.The sequence of the army base/camp at the sea shore is amazing. It is the most elaborately designed and executed shot I have ever seen.Besides the technical brilliance, the film rides on a very strong script and good performances. Briony Tallis' guilt is the center along which the story revolves. The love between Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Robbie is complex. The duration that their love is latent is longer than it is actually expressed. Even more longer is the period where it survives only in their memories and thoughts, with the war and the distance separating them. I guess it was the cruelties and the distress of the war, and the times, that makes them hold on to their love. Otherwise, possibly they would have moved on.The film adopts a non-linear narration style. It repeats may sequences and events, looked at each time from a different character's perspective. This acts like a dissection of the events, making the story look complex and yet opening it up threadbare.The ending, I felt, did not live up to the rest of the film. Briony opening up to an interviewer to tell the actual truth seemed unlike her. I wonder, if I take that ending out, what would have Briony made of her life. Would she have been consumed by her guilt completely? Would she have moved on? With this ending, I guess she did move on.A brilliant film. One of the best I have seen this decade.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
On the Same Page,"Wow, you completely summed up the feelings I had for Atonement. I completely agree with you. The first third, with the sweltering chemistry between Robbie and Cecilia, along with the imaginative Briony, is pure cinematic brilliance. The second part, with the Dunkirk scene, is abruptly less powerfully emotional than the beginning. The third act, with an older Briony, is even less emotional, and to me it was confusing and almost out of place. I think you were right in stating that the screenwriter had the most difficulty adapting the book somewhere in the middle of the movie. I am glad that someone besides me was somewhat disappointed with the second half of the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Brilliant masterpiece,"This film is a brilliant masterpiece that will allow you to appreciate art in film. It composes many elements of literary symbolism, and you will always find something new every time you watch the movie. The movie demonstrates cinematography at its finest, by the way camera angles were used and the constant movement of the cameras. Many people will not appreciate this film, unless they find the hidden meanings to certain objects and scenes in the movie.The film is a prime example on how we see things a certain way, and we think we know, but in reality what we know is the wrong thing. We learn that assumptions can go a very bad way, without clarifying our thoughts that are clouded by our emotions. Atonement is a must see movie. If you have not seen it, you can rent it at your local video store. It is like Poetry in motion.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Slightly disappointed...,"Well, two of my best friends thought it to be a masterpiece! Also, a teacher in the university recommended it. Well... well... a masterpiece it was not! That's for sure. Interesting? Definitely. Well made? Absolutely. A masterpiece? Certainly not.I think the symbols in the movie were the most interesting thing about it. Water and drowning represent the dialectic between passion, life and death. I also liked the fact that it turned out the whole movie was a novel; so almost everything about it was fiction!So, 'where's the problem', you'd ask. Simply put: It was too 'american-hollywood' stuff. Something that's meant to win an Oscar -in the end, it didn't, but I'm sure the intention of the producers was the golden statue. In my opinion, the way the director presented the old writer in the end, was the worst possible. She simply tells us everything! No ambivalence, no art, no symbols! What a waste, my God!Anyway, to summarize: It could have been a lot better. The way it is, it's just good. Nothing more, nothing less.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An excellent WWII romance/unsolved mystery story,"Joe Wright (the BAFTA Award-winning director of Pride & Prejudice) has reunited with his film-making team and his Academy Award-nominated actress, Keira Knightley (one of my favorite actresses), for another classic British romance, starring James McAvoy as her leading man. I had read the original novel, and I thought it was a good WWI romance/unsolved mystery story.I would quiver and twitch during the suspension in the film, like when Briony saw Robbie (her crush) and Cecilia (her older sister) by the fountain. And also when she read the letter written with sadistic-perverted undertones when, in reality, it was a second draft that Robbie deemed too silly to use. Briony assumes that Robbie is a nymphomaniac, and it is with this notion that she accuses Robbie of the rape of Cecilia, but really they were making love... HEL-LO! She's only 13; she shouldn't see that! So overall, my last word is that this is a great film to see.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Beautiful Film, I left disappointed...","Everything about the file was beautiful. I did not read the novel and given the historical circumstances of the setting, The Battle of Britain and the brilliance of Dunkirk I was ""let down"" that they were relegated to mere background to the relationship of the three main characters. I am an American man (raised on Hollywood) and although love stories are not my favorite genre, there was a chance to give a little something to everyone. I wonder what was left on the cutting room floor. The heroic work of the average citizen on the home front, refusing to cave under the pressure of unrestricted air war, and the heroic efforts of the navy and private citizens to rescue the Army off the Beach at Dunkirk, while not unknown on this side of the Atlantic certainly are owed more that the limited attention given them.Respectfully, SR in NY",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Keira was a letdown,"it was excellent, a well made movie with some thoughts to ponder...accompanied by strong cast, good script and an amazing score...however there are holes in the plot; some things that were not explained and they seemed to be ignored, and Keira is dull as always...putting on her usual one-dimensional acting which was fortunately covered up by her counterpart McAvoy's stronger performance. At times the characters' faces looked disgustingly unreal, perhaps too much make up? the dressing (esp keira's) seems to be too revealing for people living in that era; and nothing moving enough or thought provoking enough to impress my mind. Disappointingly speaking, there were many more better and Oscar-deserving movies of 2007",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Superb Triumph,"Gripping, heart wrenching, thoughtful, and pieced together brilliantly. Notice the subtle nuances of the filmmaker, how Cecilia's foot slips out of her shoe during the love scene in the library, or the piece of china sinking to the bottom of the fountain. The depiction of war is perhaps one of the most accurate in recent history, bringing the horror to full effect.This provoking story gives everyone pause to reflect on the fanciful lies that children can tell, and the havoc they rake.The acting is perfection.

Mesmerising...,"I can't praise this film highly enough. Sufficient to say it is cinema at it's very best. Beautifully directed, filmed and acted, in my book it qualifies as a classic already. Keira Knightly, although stunningly beautiful...with the perfect delicate look for the era the film was set in, has failed to impress me with her acting in previous films, but here she captures the essence of Cecilia beautifully. As for James McAvoy - what a star this young Scot is going to turn out to be! His facial expressions alone spoke volumes - and with those beautiful eyes how could any woman fail to fall in love with the lovely Robbie? A subtle yet truly great performance from him - and the rest of the cast were excellent.If this film doesn't get recognizxed as the Best Picture of the year when the awards ceremonies come around, then I for one will be sorely disappointed.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of the best picture of this year!,"Since I have wathced ""Pride and Prejudice"",I fell in love with Keira Knightly. So, as long as her movie is on show, I will watched it without any doubt. ""Atonemnet"" is included,too. Sorry for my pool English, I can not find a exact word to describe such an amazing movie. Maybe ""fantastic"",or maybe ""marvelous"". I just wanna say that ""Atonement"" will be surly nominated by the Academy Award,because of its unforgettable storyline and the fabulous acting. I say from my heart that I have deeply touched by this story. It reminds me of the same category movie ""Coldmoutain"", which told us a story about love in the war. I think in some way that ""Atonemont"" is a little bit similar with ""Coldmoutain"". But it is more successful than that Anthony Minghella movie,which means that ""Atonement"" has that kind of power to make you cry, especially the sense that Cecilia and Robbie had a chance to gather again,and Briony could make everything right, and later the old Briony told your all of that was only in her book. As I previously mentioned, the performance in this movie is one of the most significant element to make it outstanding. It's nice to see that James McAvoy, a young Britain actor who has charming appearance and talent, gave us a perfect show. His put his passion into every expression of Robbie and every line he said, which made such a complicated role alive. I am pretty sure that James will get a nominee of Oscar. He deserved it. And attention must be paid to Keira Knightly,which the main reason why I watched this movie. She has proved that she is not only a young Britain girl with beauty, but a talented actress with wonderful skill. She gave us another perfect performance by the role ""Cecilia"". But it is still I can not say it definitely that she will get the nominee as a ""Best Actress"". Generally speaking, Cecilia cannot be called the heroic role in this movie.

A clever and emotional piece of film-making.,"Being the jaded soul that I am I wanted to hate this film, mostly because everyone else was loving it (does that make me a bad critic?) but you see the thing is I just couldn't dislike it in anyway. It is told so well, edited so cleverly, the music is powerful, the story is multi-layered, there's that six minute tracking shot in the middle which is simply breathtaking (filmed on a set that cost £1 million pounds), all in all it is everything a movie should be. Based on the Ian McEwan novel it tells of how a simply misunderstanding can have disastrous effects and escalate a situation way out of control. With a backdrop of World War 2 the two star crossed lovers, knightly (still wooden) and McAvoy (always brilliant) communicate through letters and long to see each other again but the war and circumstance may have other plans. A real human story packed with emotion and depth it's like a British 'English Patient' and I wouldn't be surprised if it isn't in line for an Oscar or two.

One of the best love stories in this century.,"I watched this film at Skopje Film Festival '08 and it was one of the best that this year's festival offered to the Macedonian audience in Skopje.I'll try to explain a couple of things.At first, it is very slow at times, be prepared for that. That's the only minus i can think of in this movie. I think a few scenes could be left out and the movie wont lose anything at all. But if you know the history of great love stories on film, you know that the most of them are long flicks: Titanic, English patient etc. Which is understandable considering the fact that the viewers will get to know more of the main characters so it would be easier to feel the things the characters feel.You'll feel sad but satisfied at the end of this movie. You'll enjoy Keira's performance, her best till now & she is beautiful in the movie, although she would be much more attractive with a few kilograms more :).The performances were great, i cannot say who was better or worse, all were convincing. The original music score is one of the best i've heard in a while capturing the emotions in the movie and creating the atmosphere when needed.The movie works as a whole and it's rewarding once the credits roll down. I think that this film is one of those where ""the sum is better than the parts"".Some that read the book may not like it as much as me(i didn't even know that there is a book) but as a movie it is a great piece of cinema and i recommend it to everyone that looks for quality stuff in every aspect of the art of cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
brilliant film certain to move you,"It is rare that a film in which nothing really happens, can have such a huge impact on the audience. I was really stunned by the cinematography, and the brilliant acting of all the actors.I went into the film not sure what to expect but came out amazed (and a little depressed!) It's not just a love story, but one of personal reflection and facing up to the consequences of your actions, even if you have to atone for them your whole life.I think the performance of 13 year old Briony really deserves a mention - it was essential that all 3 Brionys link together seamlessly, to make the film effective. However the young Briony's the first we see of this central character - if she'd been a whiny annoying brat the entire effect would have been lost but she played it so well and it was believable that she didn't simply lie; she was so appalled as to convince herself of Robbie's guilt. A great find.Aside from that I still can't believe this epic work was only Joe Wright's second, and he's so young. A very talented director who stuck faithfully to the book - which I'm now going to read and compare. He captured the emotions and motives well, leaving no doubt in my mind about each characterisation. The slow tempo only allowed long still shots to emphasise this effect and that 4.5 Dunkirk scene was just breathtaking. Even though it wasn't like the opening in Private Ryan, which was gritty, this almost had a tranquil beauty, which nevertheless showed the realism of war in crystal clarity. The intertwining shots and objects through Robbie's eyes were also placed just right that there was always something to look at.The uniqueness of this film is that it is not memorable throughout (though it's certainly memorable) but that there are certain scenes, such as the library scene, the Dunkirk scene and the scene where briony goes to see Cecilia, which are so vividly done that they'll always stay in your mind, a long time after the end. A very raw film that has plenty of feeling. Definitely worth seeing, with some patience.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Watching Keira Knightly's face on the screen and the true elegance of her performance is really one for the pure enjoyment of a what it is to be brilliant young actor. And the supporting cast, like in GOSFORD PARK, make ATONEMENT a film you won't forget.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Consequences,"A 13-year-old girl, living in a grand English estate, watches some scenes and misinterprets the whole thing. What happens is a disaster, in the long run also for her.This is a movie about power. The one we're aware of and the one we're not. The first hour is tremendous and very clever made. You come to think a little about Antonioni's ""Blow-Up"", although this is quite another form of movie and another theme.What brings it down is the rather conventional way the plot develops. It's like two different directors have made the first and the second half. But the first one is a great thriller in a way you haven't seen before. Well worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
On the nail,"Atonement is a majestic and moving novel, one of my favourites by one of my favourite authors, so I approached the movie with optimism and trepidation in equal measure.I need not have worried; it is executed with impeccable taste, brilliantly directed, acted, soundtracked and photographed. Surely it will do some damage at the Oscars.It's essentially a caustic attack on the class society in England where the stiff upper lip leads to all sorts of under-the-radar cruelty.James McAvoy (essentially a bit of a Lady Chatterley's lover being as he is the housemaid's son) falls for the toffee-nosed Cecilia Tallis, (Keira Knightley)and, in the process, drives her 13 year old sister into a fit of jealousy that has tragic consequences for McAvoy.This is magnified when the young Brioney (brilliantly played by Saoirse Ronan) acts as go-between between the aforementioned James McAvoy (now certainly one of Britain's best actors) and Knightley (who carries the part off more than adequately).The film is in three acts. The first set in Brideshead Revisited English opulence, the second in Northern France around the D Day landings and containing a 5 minute steadicam tracking shot that takes the breathe away, the third in the suburbs of war torn London.Each is rendered differently and observed immaculately. In the snobbery of pre-war rural England the tension can be cut with a knife and the language and mannerisms of upper class torpor are fantastically realised.The war scenes, aside from the amazing tracking shot, are less well executed (budget restrictions methinks) but the ending is deeply satisfying.Special applause has to be reserved for Dario Mariavrelli's soundtrack which uses the sound of typewriter keystrokes as a hugely original percussion instrument that adds energy to the whole piece.Brilliant.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Despite the hype - it's a poor film.,"What a disappointment - what was the point of it. All the characters were weak - and the choice of actors playing the parts did not help. Neither Keira Knightly nor James McEvoy had the stature to carry off their parts and neither could evoke any sympathy from the viewer. Briony came over as a spoilt brat - why did anyone believe her at all - and why was the aftermath of the accusation just glossed over. The gap between the incident and the next time you saw the ""heroes"" only served to confuse. One part of the film was a total farce - the scenes of the retreating soldiers in Dunkirt with the fair rides, singing soldiers in the bandstand, drunkenness and scenes of apparent total confusion are contrary to any historical fact - what point was the film trying to make here - was it some anti-war message - if so it was in bad taste.",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An overblown rose,"War-torn romance is almost its own subgenre of drama. Though we feel we've seen it all, Atonement still has some fresh ideas to deliver. The film is a bouquet of imagery, and gathers three interesting stories into something of a twisted love triangle. Atonement's narrative may be too familiar, and often rushes past the point of empathy, but the movie is so beautiful that we can forgive some of these faults.Briony (Saoirse Ronan) is a serious storyteller on the cusp of ladyhood. She lives with her uninhibited older sister Cecilia (Knightley) on a large estate in the English country. Cecilia is in academic competition with a servant's son, Robbie (McAvoy), as both are attending medical school with support from Cecilia's father. Briony's imagination runs wild when she thinks she sees Robbie commit a horrible crime. Her testimony condemns Robbie to prison, and leads to his involvement in WWII.Atonement is most interesting when Briony's story is explored. She's a very smart girl, but not altogether perfect - a little too prim and prone to jealousy. But Briony is also fiercely loyal and protective of her friends. We can't completely love her, but we admire her complexity. Hers is a story of the confusion and dark dawn of adolescence, and her actions drive the rest of the film.Cecilia is something of a rebel - proud and sharp-tongued. I'm not a Kiera fan, but I enjoy her feisty, nonchalant performance through most of the movie. Robbie is cocky but highly sentimental. They're practically made for each other, and as you can guess from the posters, they fall in love before Robbie is sent to jail and war. This is where the movie starts to lose us.When the lovers are apart, we experience their generalized pain and longing, but it all feels like an outline instead of a heart-felt exploration. So much attention is given to the images of war and suffering, the costumes and despairing gazes, that we can't fully sympathize. This is complicated by how quickly their relationship develops, only to be torn and kept separate through most of the movie. We can't reminisce and sigh about the times they had together - there weren't many. We don't feel what they're going through, because it's mostly done in silence against highly glorified images of war. Their actions aren't especially telling. The misty looks to the horizon speak for themselves, but say little more than ""this sucks, I want to go home."" There are several parts of this film that lead me to believe that it's severely abridged from the novel. The secondary characters are nearly perfunctory, and one even pops on screen for a meaningful conversation with seemingly no context. Briony and Cecilia's parents are mostly absent. The lovers meet during the war, but how they found each other or why they're separated again isn't entirely clear. Five important years of Briony's life vanish. We don't have much trouble connecting the past to the present, but it's nowhere near as developed as it should be.However, the art of the film is very well established. All of the pre-war scenes glow white and are rich with pastels and florals. Briony always appears in white and is backlit through the movie for an ethereal innocence. The shots are all highly composed and symmetrical, with careful attention to the beautiful architecture and room design. When passion is introduced, twilight falls, colors become richer and deeper, and images are blurred. Montage is so prevalent, it's almost overused. There's a tracking shot of Robbie on the French beach with thousands of English soldiers waiting for boats to retreat home - the chaos and comedy of war is explored in this lengthly, dense footage bathed in brown and gold. Beyond the costumes and colors, the sound plays a pleasantly important part in the film. Briony's scenes are accompanied by the calculated clacks of percussion and typewriters. Scenes across oceans are connected by a thread of melody. Montage music dissolves into sounds of the next scene. These techniques may be considered too overt, but the were a joy for me.Atonement has its flaws, and I can see why some would spurn it completely. There are romantic clichés. There is not enough time given to building the romance. The ending is completely unsatisfying and gimmicky. But we're so cynical and well-versed as an audience that it's difficult to please, and nearly impossible to show us anything new without us assuming it's a trick to gain our favor. The primary focus of the film seems to be the art - I'm happy enough to hear a story that doesn't overshadow or detract from that stunning cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
the reason i got o the movies...,"ATONEMENT: FOCUS 2007 color 123 m Rom/Drama Keira Knightley, James McAvoy, Vanessa Redgrave, Saoirse Ronan and Brenda Blethyn star. Written by Christopher Hampton Directed by Joe Wright Rated R for language, sexuality and adult themes.I was privaleged enough to see the film ""Atonement"" tonight. A film that reminds me of all the reasons I go to the movies. I couldn't possibly even begin to praise this sensational film enough but here let me try. This second pairing of director Joe Wright and Keira Knightley is even more successful than there last go around with Pride and Prejudice. Although i throughly enjoyed that film I found spots in it to be a little long and the film ultimately offered up nothing more than witty adult entertainment. This time around the film centers on three central characters Cecilia (Knightley) Robbie (McAvoy) and Briony (portrayed by three actresses through the years). Cecilia and Robbie have spent their entire lives growing up next to one another until one hot, fateful summer evening they decide to finally embrace there emotions and tell each other how they truly feel. Briony witnesses some events through child's eyes and through a moment of jealousy lies, blaming the rape of her cousin on Robbie. He is torn away from his Cecilia that very evening and it isn't until almost five years later that she finally admits to making the whole thing up. Cecilia and Robbie are separated by the lie through jail time and than war but still remain very much in love. The film chronicles many things but the central theme is the consequences of telling a lie. And how it alters the fates of everyone around it. The film is very sad. One of the most effectively emotional films ever made. It's a sumptous feast for the senses from the picturesque cinematography. Which features some of the most beautiful shots ever found on film. Shots that radiate passion, wonder, creativity and enthrallment. It also features a wildly creative score enfused with the sounds of typing reminding us of the written word and how powerful it is throughout. The performances are all top notch. It's hard to put into words on how truly great these performances are. Keira Knightley is at the top of her game here and at such a young age. She manages to embody years of longing within a single glance. James McAvoy is wonderfully handsome and a fantastic treasure to behold as Robbie a gentleman to the end. Filled with such rage and such softness at the same time. He has a stirring intenstity throughout. His chemistry with Knightley is stellar and there scenes together are hauntingly romantic and will stay with you long after the film is over. This film will stay with you long after it's over. The direction from Joe Wright is monumentous. He is one of the most talented directors out there today. Althhough he showed a spark of professionalism in his previous film. Here he grabs this story head on and makes this films every moment completely enthralling and original. This may be the best film I've ever seen. I have emotions streaming out of my every pore and a headful of memories from the film that feel like my own. It's very rare to see such a spectacle. In the words of my friend it's just a privilege really. Atonement captures what the Notebook and Titanic aimed for but couldn't quite engulf. It's more than the best film of the year and one of the best films I've ever seen. It's one of the best experiences I've ever had.*****/5",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Atonement -- Brilliant Work,Loved The movie","Well the movie was looking very promising from the day one of promos and because of that the expectations were high and the movie satisfy what you can ask for from a movie.What i really like about the movie was when the movie starts, it shows the same incidents with two different perspective which obviously makes you feel that its in the eye of the looker how he/she feels about the situation. Perception can be different for the same situation.I have heard that this movie is based on some British Romantic novel by Ian McEawn. Personally i feel making a novel come into life on the screen is a tough job especially when the novel is itself as successful as this one thats why i would like to compliment their work.As in case of acting, Keira Knightley and James McAvoy are also brilliant.No words to define their performances. They should be nominated for the best prizes in their respective categories.Pleasure for eyes , would strongly recommenced if you wanna watch a real good movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Almost as good as it gets,"It is such a rarity, but such a delight, when an accomplished novel is successfully transcribed to the screen. I was enormously impressed by the exquisite prose of Ian McEwan's work ""Atonement"" and anxious about how it would fare as a movie, but the result is a triumph. Director 35 year old Joe Wright - whose only previous direction was the most enjoyable ""Pride And Prejudice"" - and screenwriter Christopher Hampton (helped by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey) have crafted a fine adaption which is faithful to the novel but makes impressive use of the film medium to give us a new insight into the work.At one level, this is an achingly poignant love story centred on the upper class Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley in one of her best performances to date in a role where her thinness is actually appropriate) and the son of the family's cleaning women Robbie Turner (James McAvoy in a richly textured offering with no hint of his natural Scottish brogue). But, at an another (deeper) level, this is a narrative of betrayal and atonement by Cecilia's younger sister Briony - played successively by Saoirse Ronan as the pubescent and overly-dramatic 13 year old, by Romola Garai as the tortured 18 year old, and by screen legend Vanessa Redgrave as the 77 year old author.No film can replicate or emulate the prose of a novel but ""Atonement"" the movie scores in other ways: an incessant and insistent typewriter-laden score, detailed invocation of period clothing and settings, repetition of crucial scenes from different viewpoints, a sharper, clearer and more emotional ending, and - above all - a stunning, lengthy steadicam shot of the hell on earth beach scene at Dunkirk. This is almost as good as cinema gets.",,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""I will return; find you, love you, marry you and live without shame.""","Joe Wright's 'Atonement (2007)' is a film that, on its glossy surface, seems practically perfect. The director has constructed each scene so meticulously that every shot looks perfectly positioned, every actor seems perfectly chosen, and every line sounds perfectly spoken. In the process of engineering this perfection, the film loses part of its heart, any sense of imagination or daring discarded by Wright's unwillingness to put a foot wrong. Adapted from Ian McEwan's critically-acclaimed novel of the same name, 'Atonement' is nonetheless an intriguing war-time tale of jealousy, naiveté and regret, and it offers much in the way of entertainment, despite lacking in depth. It's the sort of picture that is, dare I say it, tailor-made to appeal to the Academy, and a Best Picture nomination is certainly forthcoming, and not altogether undeservedly. A solid cast, including Keira Knightley, James McAvoy and young Saoirse Ronan, occupy the lavish sets, beautifully captured by cinematographer Seamus McGarvey; visually, the film is a sumptuous feast for the eyes.'Atonement' is divided into two distinct acts, contrasting violently between the luscious, sunny countryside of pre-WWII England, and the bitter, bleak, crumbling London that followed. The first act, probably the stronger of the two, takes place at a bright and cheerful country-house, where the eldest daughter in a proper English family, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley), falls in love with the household's handsome gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Younger sister Briony (Saoirse Ronan), aged 13, witnesses this romance flourishing from her bedroom window, misunderstands the situation, and steadily builds a resentment towards Robbie, culminating in a final, selfish act of jealousy that forever wrenches the budding couple from each others' arms. The power of written-word plays a crucial role in the events of the film; it is Briony's interception of a sexually-explicit letter that proves vital in damning Robbie and Cecilia's future, and, in the tearful finale, an older Briony attempts to use written fiction as the only remaining means of correcting past mistakes and destroyed lives. Dario Marianelli's pulsating dramatic score also recognises this symbolism, employing the sounds of a typewriter to augment the events unfolding on screen.The second act of the film is a lot more subdued than what had preceded it, and, despite numerous memorable scenes, fails to entirely satisfy. Unlike the first act, the war-time sequences seemed to be heading in no direction, wandering aimlessly towards an undefined goal. Perhaps this was deliberate {during this period, nobody's fate was certain}, but, without any narrative drive, the film failed to fully hold my attention. Now 18 years old, Briony (played by Romola Garai), has discarded a Cambridge education in order to become a nurse, perhaps her first attempt at atonement for what she did to Robbie. Meanwhile, Robbie, having enlisted in the British Expeditionary Force, is trying hopelessly to return home to his true love, the horrors of war closing in upon him at every turn. The centrepiece of this section is a breathtaking long-shot on the beaches of Dunkirk, as Robbie and his comrades observe the chaos and confusion of the British evacuation, certainly the most impressive shot of its kind since Alfonso Cuarón's 'Children of Men (2006).' Despite drawing too much attention to itself, and doing little to propel the plot, the planning and co-ordination that must have gone into this minutes-long tracking shot is worthy of the ticket price alone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Best Picture of 2007? Nope. But Does Have ""Best"" Items of 2007...","With multiple award nominations and plenty of news hype, I decided to check out ATONEMENT strictly to see what all the hubbub was about. Is it over-hyped or does it stand out as ""The Best Picture of 2007""? The answer is both yes and no.Visually it a feast for the eyes. The routing of the English army into Dunkirk is nothing short of amazing. Let me clarify that, too. We don't see the battle leading to Dunkirk but do see the aftermath in all its horribleness. The crumpled structures and damaged soldiers are dark and forbidding, and hold the viewers eyes even though one wants to look away from the destruction and seeming madness plastered on the screen. This was the most intense sequence in the entire film. It was also shot in a most uncommon way, with the camera initially following James McAvoy's character and then the camera splits from him and goes off on its own, but returns to McAvoy later. An interesting way to shoot this series of events.The costumes, sets, and props were perfect. There was not a single thing that took me out of the 1930s and 1940s. Specifically I enjoyed the woolen army uniforms, the streets of early London, and the nursing uniforms the young women wore (again, all perfect).The acting was good. James McAvoy (THE LAST KING OF Scotland) steals most of the show as the good-natured but ultimately wronged Robbie Turner, an educated groundskeeper at a wealthy estate owned by the family of Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN). Knightley does a fair job as Cecilia, a young woman in love with Robbie, a man far beneath her station. When Robbie is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime, Cecilia has to decide between her family or her eventual life with Robbie.But more powerful than Knightley was Romola Garai who plays her sister Briony. Briony is the one responsible for wrongfully turning Robbie over to the authorities after witnessing what she believed to be him performing a crime against a child. It is Briony who really rules the movie, giving us her fervent wish for ""atonement"" later in life after realizing what damage she's caused both Robbie and her sister.The powerful Vanessa Redgrave (VENUS) plays the aged Briony as the film progresses to the modern day and we learn how futile Briony's wish for atonement are. Although Mrs. Redgrave gives an astounding few minutes on film, it is only a few minutes. There've been rumors that she'll garner some award for this performance, but I hope that these rumors are unfounded. Don't get me wrong; she did a fine job. But her brief performance doesn't warrant any kind of prize.Listing the good above, I have to point out that the story is not an uncommon one. This is a war story, something we've seen time and again. Director Joe Wright does some interesting camera work and manipulations with time, but some might feel this as an attempt to force something new on a genre movie goers are all too familiar with.That said, one needs to be prepared for an uncharacteristic ending. If you're looking for a feel-good, man-returns-home-and-marries-girl-and-they-have-fifty-grandkids kind of movie, this one isn't going to make your happy tears list.This is a mixed bag as far as films go. An overused premise with some uniquely new ideas.But is it ""The Best Film of 2007""? It does have some of the best cinematography and great acting thanks to Romola Garai. But it's not the best. That prize I'm reserving for NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Begins Brilliantly Then Falters,"I have not read the novel this film is based on but after seeing this film i am curious to check out the book. The story driving this film is commanding and compelling and it is told in this same commanding and compelling style, or at least the first section of the film that takes place in England before the outbreak of the war. In England, all of the characters are introduced and the main story points are laid out beautifully. Ronan, Knightly, and McAvoy are all excellent and create well defined characters whose tale we are very much drawn into. And then the film shifts to the war in France and it's as if we're watching a completely different film, or a different director took over at this point. The change in momentum was so abrupt that all of the vitality, beauty, energy and good-will between the viewer and the film was gone and never fully recaptured. The remaining two thirds of the film of course plays itself out and the story is still there and we're still committed to the outcome but unfortunately Atonement ends with more of a wimper than one might have expected given all that is at stake in the lives of the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement,"I wanted to single out Vanessa Redgrave for special acclaim, as she brought the whole movie together, I felt, in a very purposeful summary of the consequences of her actions as a very immature and spoiled 13-year old. She is an astonishingly powerful and convincing actor. That takes nothing away from the other key actors, who quite simply were brilliant.A very thoughtless and selfish act, effectively created the plot for an astonishingly beautiful and well-crafted piece of cinematic genius. I saw this movie on my own, as my wife was away, and four young rowdy teenage girls walked into the theatre and sat beside me. Half way through the movie, I noticed that the girl immediately beside me was gasping and sobbing, which almost moved me to tears also. The whole four girls had the tissues out, well before the end of the movie. Atonement, I must say made me feel what it must have been like to live through the horrors of WW2 and it made me feel great compassion for the nurses, who gave so much of themselves at a time when there was very little that medicine could do and the best treatment was to 'just be there' and sit, talking with the wounded and dying.I agree with all the other comments I have read and will certainly go back and see this beautiful movie again with my wife...and take some tissues. I was extremely impressed with the unexpected impact this movie had, on my feelings. It was never predictable and had a great 'grab-bag' of emotions, scattered at unpredictable interludes, so you were kept guessing all the way through. I now need to go and buy the novel!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
over-hyped,"I have to admit that it was hype and hype alone which encouraged me to go and see this movie. For weeks, every newspaper and TV show had reports and clips of how ""great"" the movie was. Also, it was directed by the same man who did ""Charles ii the Power and the Passion"" for BBC television and that is one of the best period dramas to be made in the last twenty years. So off I went to the cinema with high expectations. Then reality set in. There are three distinct parts to this movie. The beginning, which is too long. The middle, which is too abstract and the end, which is too predictable and makes huge sections of the middle obsolete. Yes, there is some fabulous cinematography and the performances are mannered and well directed. But the story gets lost somewhere. Perhaps it just got buried beneath the mounds of pretentious camera work and over-the-top attempts to create upper class British characters from the 1930s. I've not read the novel so I can't comment on how good or bad an adaptation it is. But as a piece of cinema, it disappoints.",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Watching this move I was mesmerized by its beauty and captivated by the performances of the cast. James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, and Saoirse Ronan deserve every accolade. If this film has one weakness, it is in its pacing. Though it pains me to admit, it does drag in parts. If you are looking for a dramatic/action war film, this is not it. However, if you are looking for something that really does explore the human condition with all its strengths and flaws, then I cannot recommend a better film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Powerful,"I read Ian McEwan's Atonement novel a little over a year ago for class (it's not the type of book I'd read for myself). Naturally, I decided it would be interesting to see the critically acclaimed film adaptation. Atonement follows the novel faithfully, with the exception of a couple scenes. It tells the story of a imaginative child, Briony Tallis, who discovers a love relationship between her sister Cecilia and friend Robbie. She mistakes Robbie for a sexual maniac, and wrongly accuses him when another friend, Lola, is attacked in the night. The rest of the plot follows the consequences of this accusation and Briony's attempts at atonement.The film is Oscar quality in many ways. The direction is excellent; the complex plot is difficult to clearly convey on screen, but Joe Wright is able to put it together with few flaws. In the first half hour or so, the pacing is a bit jumbled; this clears up as it develops. The camera-work is well done; a notable scene is the five minute single-shot recreation of the Dunkirk beaches. The acting is good from all parts and the character development is solid. The music score was also excellent; it really fit the mood of the whole movie and added a nice touch to the key scenes.Atonement is an emotional film. It carries a sense of sadness that few films are capable of. The remarkable thing is that the sadness is not at all depressing, but more sympathetic. It is sad to realize the extent of such a small moment and how it could tear lives apart. That is the main thing that makes Atonement a film that I would highly recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Tragic Love,"Often it is almost impossible to undo a lie yet we tell them everyday, both to ourselves and to those around us. ""Oh I'll start a new diet"", but wait that chocolate looks so tempting, why not. ""Everything will be alright"", that's another, normally told just when it has become obvious that I really won't be alright. The lies we tell can affect those around us in unimaginable ways - be it losing confidence or perhaps losing a friend. In 'Atonement' the lie has even greater consequences - it sends a man to war.That man is Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), a servant/groundsman at the Tallis' country estate. He doesn't have to work there, but he owes Mr Tallis a debt from when his father ran away. Robbie is a dashing young man, confident and charming, so it is no surprise that he attracts the attention of the two Tallis daughters, Cecilia (Keira Knightley) and Briony (Saoirse Ronan). Cecilia is the elder of two, and the one whom Robbie has fallen for. She's a headstrong woman, yet afraid of giving into her feelings for someone below her class. On the other hand, Briony is a 13-year-old girl and a budding playwright, writing about things which she does not yet understand. However, she thinks she understands the world and the life which adults lead, which causes the dreadful lie which will impact everyone's lives.Shocked at seeing Robbie and Cecilia interacting flirtatiously by the fountain, Briony continues her profound misinterpretation when she picks up a letter from Robbie to Cecilia. The letter contains all sorts of naughty material, and reaffirms her suspicions that her one-time crush is a sexual maniac. So, this leads to the unforgivable lie - a false accusation against Robbie for a crime against Lola Quincey (Juno Temple) which he did not commit. Young Briony has misinterpreted love for lust and changed the lives of herself, Cecilia and Robbie.Cecilia moves away from her family and becomes a nurse in Balham, keeping in contact with the imprisoned Robbie via letters. Briony too has moved out to London to help with the war effort - it's her way of penance for her sins. But it is the accused Robbie who suffers most deeply. Given the choice between prison or war, he chooses the latter - fighting in France in the build up to Operation Dynamo in Dunkirk. He is cut off from his regiment and traipsing around Normandy with a couple of other soldiers, searching for the army and for a chance to return to his love. Eventually he comes to Dunkirk, and in a marvellous long take he see the horrors, despair and hope of the evacuation from Normandy.This is just one of many mesmerising sequences in 'Atonement'. The film is lit in abject darkness in all moments when Robbie and Cecilia are apart, whilst their tender, romantic moments are shot brightly, with the sun or Cecilia's green dress providing colour to a tragic story. Their time together may be very short, yet it is no less powerful and magical - the sparks are there for all to see. All except a 13-year-old child, who perhaps has her sister's best interests at heart but is more likely selfish of the love the couple are realising. Unfortunately, this makes the character of Briony extremely difficult to like - which becomes very important in the latter part of the film - and so the ending is unfulfilling and disappointing.However, the ending has not been changed from the widely successful novel by Ian McEwan, and writer Christopher Hampton (Dangerous Liaison; The Father) cannot be judged for this misstep. Neither can director Joe Wright, who follows up his Keira Knightley period drama 'Pride & Prejudice' with another Keira Knightley period drama. Wright has a feel for the period and is impressive behind the camera, knowing when to zoom and when to cut from Briony to Cecilia to Robbie. The aforementioned long take is one of the finest pieces of filmmaking in a long time, as he finds beauty in the brutality and hope in the suffering.The performances too are impressive, in particular that of young Saoirse Ronan. It is rare to see a child actor perform to such a high standard, stealing each scene she's in and managing to portray her character in such a clear sense. The inexperience and immaturity of Briony cannot be said of Ronan, who gives a performance well beyond her years. Her performance is so good that when Romola Garai turns up as 18-year-old Briony, she is completely overshadowed by her younger self. McAvoy and Knightley have good chemistry and bounce off each other well - the romantic tension between the two is believable and helps make an otherwise undeveloped romance seem like true love. Individually, McAvoy also gives the standout performance of his career - with an astonishing turn as he goes from a suave romantic to a betrayed, lost and despairing soldier.There's a strong sense of longing, of what could have been, in 'Atonement' and its that melancholic tone which makes the love between Robbie and Cecilia all the more believable. A romance ruined and cast out into war by Briony's lie. It is Briony who tries to atone for her sins and whether she does or does not is up to your judgement. For me, she doesn't, but that doesn't detract too much from an otherwise perfect tale of betrayal, redemption and romance.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Wonderfully crafted emotional adaptation,"The title, Atonement means to make up for what has been done. This film, thus portrays a mistake made in love, which must be repaid with sacrifice and pain. The emotional content for such a topic must be strong and the expression of the same should be clear and moving. This film stands up to this.An adaption from Ian McEwan's Novel 'Atonement', the film is based in the countryside of Britain and then some surrounding areas later on. The background score, first of all is very unique and rhythmic. Its suits and enhances the feel conspiracy, thrill and suspense which this is the base of the movie. Its mostly, taps of the typewriter, wonderfully set with shots by clever editing. At a few places, the sync of music and cuts is amazing. The cinematography and art direction is good too. The colour variations throughout the film, are wisely used to create emotions.The story basically is about Cecilia Tallis(Kiera Knightly) and Robbie Turner(James McAvoy). They live in a mansion of countryside Britain. Robbbie once mistakenly proposes to make love to Cecilia, who agrees. While they are doing it, Cecilia's little sister Briony Tallis sees them. Being a suspicious child she reacts aggressively and later on blames Robbie of a very serious crime. He is sent to jail on the basis on her testimony. War breaks out. Robbie as a prisoner is sent to war as a soldier. A pile of grief, in the form of this news falls on Cecilia, who had been eagerly waiting to be together with him again. She leaves her home and joins army as a nurse. The war goes on, both lovers eagerly wait to meet each other. And Briony, who had caused all this chaos, is left in deep guilt, waiting for a chance for atonement.A very impressive story this is, drawn out really well with great performances by all actors and very sensible and clever work by the technical team.

I love it!,"Atonement is an unusual movie that deals with dark themes. It's not easy to digest, so don't expect it to be a lighthearted film. The plot is intricately woven, and any spoilers would ruin the movie's impact. The climax is the movie's greatest triumph, leaving you shocked and reeling long after you've left the cinema.The performances are spectacular, especially from the two leads, James McAvoy and Keira Knightly. The score is beautiful, and whoever came up with the idea of using a typewriter as a musical instrument deserves praise. The music moved me.Keira Knightly, who starred in ""Pride and Prejudice"" and ""Pirates of the Caribbean,"" delivers a superb performance in this movie. Her character differs from her usual spunky roles; this time, she plays a proper lady who smokes a lot and is a bit snobbish. Knightly excels in the earlier, more relaxed scenes, but in the later, more powerful scenes, we see her true acting talent. Although Knightly's performance is praiseworthy, McAvoy's acting is simply outstanding. One particular sequence in the movie, set in Dunkirk, showcases McAvoy's acting talent without a single word. Saoirse Ronan also delivers a chillingly brilliant performance, playing a vital character named Briony. Unfortunately, Romola Garai, who plays an older Briony, doesn't measure up to Ronan's performance. While her performance is still great, it's not as effective or memorable as Ronan's.Atonement is a powerful movie with a captivating storyline. The movie centers around a lie told by Briony, which significantly impacts the lives of the characters, Cecilia and Robbie. Many unexpected events occur throughout the movie, and the ending is particularly surprising. The movie is well-directed, with beautiful colors and camera movements that are especially noteworthy in the summer house scenes. However, the most memorable scene is in Dunkirk, where a continuous five-minute shot shows the chaos of the battle. This scene is powerful, and the singing in the background adds to its impact.Overall, Atonement is an excellent movie with superb performances, a captivating storyline, and beautiful direction.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Atonement,"""Cecilia"" (Keira Knightley) has fallen for ""Robbie"" (James McCoy) - a man well down the social ladder from her family and their stately home. It's love, though, and the young man is doing his best to fit into their privileged world by studying (at their expense) at Cambridge with a view to becoming a doctor. Meantime, following a scene that she has completely misinterpreted and the reading of a letter that wasn't any of her business, their behaviour is being rather unhealthily scrutinised by her thirteen year old sister ""Briony"" (Saoirse Ronan) who soon becomes fixated on the couple, on destroying the couple and to that latter end she concocts a story that not only achieves her goal, but sees ""Robbie"" wrongly incarcerated for a fairly heinous crime. The war intervenes and that gives the lovers a chance to recalibrate their feelings for each other whilst the now more mature ""Briony"" (now Romola Garai) with whom her sister has become estranged, is having a serious crisis of conscience and travels to London to be both a nurse and to take responsibility for her behaviour five years earlier. This is a complex and detailed piece of cinema and McAvoy delivers really well as the honest and decent lad caught up in a web of deceit and envy. Knightley is less effective - but still contributes well enough as the truth is finally known before an inevitable tragedy strikes. It's a story about the ramifications of a lie, but it's also about people's abilities to love, forgive and to judge. Loyalty might only be skin deep but regret lasts for ever, and ever might not be so long as you might hope. Dario Marianelli has created a masterful score to accompany this story and the writing and Joe Wright's subtle direction ensure we steer well clear of the melodramatic and the sentimental as the denouement looms and Vanessa Redgrave appears for a quite fitting final mea culpa. A straightforward British period drama this isn't and it's well worth a watch on big screen for the a cinematography that marries the rustic charm of rural England with the horrors of bombs, bullets and blood poignantly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A love story with more than the ravages of war to contend with.,"This was a very good movie, but for reasons not normally listed here. To me I focused on the moral aspect, and the devastation which can be caused by its aftermath. I believe the girl suffered regret from when the realization struck home as the police drove the accused away. But instead of going the full distance to put things right, she worked at a job her 'society' posing would have let her bypass, and perhaps tried to make things right with herself more so than with the others.So the moral of the story? We all know that as we grow older a heartbeat can be enough time to take us from here to where death will take us. If we've done wrong, and it has and is hurting others, then the time to put things right is now. And the reason no better than it is simply the right thing to do. Forgiveness may be forthcoming, but it's got to be by-product of the process, not the reason.I enjoyed the movie, but I like mostly how it reminded me of what the wages of sin carries, and how that weight is sometimes careless upon whom it chooses to bear its burden.i think the young couple suffered greatly",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I preferred the little bits I seen on tiktok,"This movie is about being artsy. The big drawback with artsy films is that they become very dragged out and uncomprehensive. I watched this movie with someone else and they thought it was a 10 out of a ten. To be fair. It has gorgeous scenes, the actors was incredible. Am thinking of James McAvoy and Keira Knightley. I just wished for more dialogue, more interactions, less cinematics. I am not sure I even thought it was worth the watch, the incredible scenes that summed up in the trailer or the snippets on tiktok was enough. I didn't feel like it was worth seeing the rest.

Not a very faithful adaptation of the book,"Not a very faithful adaptation of the book, and a lot of details were omitted: the history behind the broken vase, more of Robbie Turner (James McAvoy)'s horrible experiences while at war, the gypsy woman and her pig, what happened to Lola and Paul Marshall, why Briony couldn't publish her tell-all novel yet and how she ultimately celebrates her birthday at the old house.The book was a bit annoying to read as author Ian McEwan did not allow readers to have their own imaginings; he painstakingly dictated each detail and embarrassingly disclosed each character's private thoughts, which of course, is impossible to translate on screen. But the beauty of the novel is the real ending (not the film's version), when it all comes together and explains why the book was written the way it was for the better part of the story.But the film did justice to the lush backdrops as described in the book, and the characters are well cast. Except perhaps for James McAvoy, who acted superbly but needed to be a bit burlier and taller (Briony was taller than him during the confrontation when he was supposed to be intimidatingly towering over her!). The actresses who played Briony at 13, at 18 and in her 70s all possessed the face and the manner you'd love to hate. Keira Knightley was beautiful and played the role of the haughty, careless but passionate aristocrat Cecilia perfectly. Paul Marshall was supposed to have some disfiguring facial feature that made him even more despicable, and Lola Quincey was supposed to be slenderer and prettier, but Juno Temple's portrayal was eerily exact.Visually arresting, the accompanying soundtrack and effects were also masterful, but the ending could've used a bit more help.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Much ado about nothing,"I decided to see Atonement when I saw its trailer: nice shots, life in England just before WW2, an interesting human drama, etc. I began to worry a little bit when I heard a critic say that ""it is in The English Patient territory"" - a film I deeply disliked - and worried even more when I read comments saying that Atonement would be a strong candidate for an Oscar, since Oscars are awards given on the basis of the commercial success of films, instead of their artistic merits.My worst fears were confirmed: Atonement is a pretentious but ultimately vacuous film. It reminded me of that famous line, ""he didn't say anything, but he said it so beautifully!"". It is very well shot, the actors are decent - if a little bit wooden - the locations magnificent and its basic plot is fine. But it never involves you. I found myself yawning, making shopping lists in my head and wondering what time it was.The plot? Without giving away anything important (not that there is anything much to give away) the film turns around a13-year old girl who, through a mixture of naiveté and jealousy ruins the life of a young man and many years later tries to make amends for it. It takes place in the late 30s and the 13-year old girl is one of the daughters of an upper middle class, wealthy family: beautiful country house, gardens, servants, the whole British cliché. The boy whose life is ruined is the son of one of the caretakers, but he's been taken under the wing of the family, has gone to good schools and is planning to study medicine at Cambridge, which means he knows how to wear a dinner jacket (when he's not carrying suitcases for weekend visitors).The problem is that the movie tries to be ""arty"" while having mass appeal. It uses quite a few fashionable tricks, such as an unorthodox sound track (lots of typing noises), high volume sound effects and long, ""artistic"" tracking shots. It never manages to involve spectators in the events that it describes and, ultimately, it's but a pretentious and shallow attempt to describe the way some people lived in England at the time. Uninteresting, boring and fake. Or, to quote the classics, ""much ado about nothing"".",4.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Positive film review tone for Atonement,"My original psyche of the period film ""Atonement"" was that it was going to be formulaic brit piece comprised of a bunch of socialites talking fancy, maids & butlers eavesdropping, protagonists trivializing major issues while defocusing on mundane matters, and all that ""mumbo jumbo"" talk that you get from the cinema Britannica. I must state that ""Atonement"" did encompass a few of the aforementioned elements, but the final product turned out to be a very enlightening film about atoning for one's immaturity. So ""Atonement"", I am truly sorry I did you like that. Because after ""I saw it with my own eyes"", I recognized that it did not merit my preconceived notion. I must atone myself now by writing a positive film review for ""Atonement"". The narrative stars James McAvoy and Keira Knightley portraying the romantic leads Robbie Turner and Cecilia Tallis. Robbie is the son of a Tallis' housekeeper and Cecilia is the eldest daughter of the wealthy Tallis family. So you see that Robbie does not have it ""made"" and Cecilia is constantly financially nurtured by those ""Benjamin tallies""; or whatever Prime Minister is printed in the British currency bill. Robbie and Cecilia romantically fall for each other and are on route for the eventual nuptial until the visual disaster occurs. That would come in the form of Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), the youngest Tallis who has a massive crush on Robbie, and her ravaging jealousy causes her to falsely witness a crime which she accuses Robbie as being the perpetrator. Poor Robbie gets convicted of the crime and ends up fighting in a war in order not to get jail time. So you can say that Robbie and Cecilia are apart because of the brawny Briony syndrome. The developmental plot of ""Atonement"" focuses on Briony in various stages in her life trying to make amends on the hell she caused, and also on Robbie and Cecilia's emotional solitary grief. The performances from McAvoy, Knightley, and Ronan hit the right thespian tone of ""Atonement"". Admirable brawny supporting work was also contributed by Romola Garai (who played Briony at age 18) and the legendary Vanessa Redgrave (who played the geriatric Briony). Director Joe Wright, who also helmed ""Pride & Prejudice"", should be proud of his unprejudiced direction of ""Atonement"". The costume design, art direction, and cinematography of ""Atonement"" were of picturesque amazement. Christopher Hampton's scribe was adequate but not Oscar-worthy; even though I love the ""I saw him with my own eyes"" line; It was an eye-opener! So all in all, you will not be sorry if you check out ""Atonement"". **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

It walks through the years and depicts how people's lives are affected - most notably the young, lower-income fellow who was accused and lady he loves.I can see how this story could be very powerful, but in terms of this movie, it's doesn't quite work. The first 1/4 of the movie sets up the incident nicely, but the rest of the movie seems a bit slow. I'd say that it's even easy to predict.

What a difference a day makes...,"Not having read the source novel, I came to this much-praised adaptation with open eyes and ears and left at the end impressed by its undoubted polish and keen insight into the damaged psyches of its ill-served star-crossed lovers, played with credibility and engagement by young talents McAvoy and Knightley. For me, there were minor echoes of Joseph Losey's work of the 60's and 70's, borrowing a little of the multiple viewpoint technique of ""Accident"" and the retrospective narrative-framing style of ""The Go-Between"" (not to mention the latter's shared theme of the innocence of teenage children corrupted by a too-close proximity to the physical passions of their elders). Beautifully if a little showily shot and excellently played, the careful plotting is stylishly arranged for the viewer and to me only drags occasionally, with too-long scenes involving the hapless, exiled gone-for-a-soldier Robbie (McAvoy) winding up at the apparently shambolic Dunkirk beaches before ""The Miracle"" evacuation took place and ""18 year-old Briony's"" scene at the hospital with a dying French soldier. Well shot and acted as these scenes are, (the former, in particular, featuring a too-deliberately flashy ""Tara""/""Gone With The Wind""-type 5-minute tracking shot passing through the Dunkirk site), for me pointed up a detrimental stylisation at play here and also slowed down the action too much especially as the final denouement is so effective in its ingenious invention and crisp depiction. Pre-War England is beautifully conveyed in its mansion-house glory, but beneath the veneer of manners and respectability seething passions drive the inhabitants, young and old, to extreme courses of action which change their lives forever. Although built around the strong performances of lovers McAvoy (natural and humane) and Knightley (ethereal and passionate), the remainder of the acting is also completely in simpatico, with the three actresses who depict the maturing touch-paper-lighting Briony, doing so to excellent effect. If in the end a touch too mannered and clever for its own good, this well-made film shows that even today imaginative period drama can entertain far better than any number of comic-book hero extravaganzas. Sadly ironic in a postscript that this was one of the final appearances by another purveyor of quality drama, the late Anthony Minghella, in a brief, almost unnoticed part as the elderly Briony's TV interviewer. One suspects he would very much have approved of director Wright and his team's work here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

What a drag,"I was looking forward to this, given the splendid reviews and having read Ian McEwan's book (not my favourite McEwan but he is one of my favourite authors) However, I found the reality largely tedious. Maybe this was because it dealt with unfamiliar emotions and unsympathetic characters. The ""big house"" atmosphere was dealt with competently, but the Dunkirk beach and town scenes just didn't flow. In the latter, one bit part actor after another was clearly waiting just off shot to do his bit. Which was funny but didn't do anything for the credibility of the movie.In fact,the clichés and cockney accents and the turgid nature of the scene setting were all ingredients for a (poor) comedy - a Whitehall farce perhaps. Maybe that's what it was meant to be ? On reflection it was probably too true to the original novel, which, as I said, isn't one of my favourites.

The love story between the main characters is epic. I am not afraid to compare it with the epic love story of Titanic. Personally, I think it is even better. The feel is intensely real because James McAvoy and Keira Knightley showed it in their eyes. I can sense the sorrows of the characters. They achieved their best trying to live out the characters.

She saw the rapist from behind, and he was one of three (four?) men dressed in identical formal wear and about the same height and age. That should not have been enough to convict him without some other evidence.

I thought the story was interesting but the problem was the two leads who were out of their depth. Funnily enough I felt that it was McAvoy who was the weaker of the two as Knightley did manage to generate a couple of acting moments but all too often it felt a bit Harry Enfield when they were trying to deliver their meaningful dialogue. In comparison to The English Patient where it felt completely natural for the characters to talk in that stylised luvvie dialogue, here it just wasn't working and as a consequence it was difficult to feel the characters' emotions so much so that when the emotional wrench does come it falls a bit flat. If they'd have gone with leads that were a bit more mature and had a bit more presence it might have worked but I still think there'd be a bit of a issue with the source material.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Good, but doesn't belong with the best.","I must admit, after all I heard from the critics about Atonement not being one of the best films of 2007, I didn't watch it expecting to be one. Nevertheless, I felt it was better than given credit for all the way around. The look is very good, especially in the first third set in the gigantic house of the Tallis' in England. However, as the mood of the film transposes, so does the quality of it. The young daughter, Briony, falsely accuses her older sister's lover of attacking her sister. This leads to serious conflict as well as the separation of the star-crossed lovers, Robbie and Cecilia. As the years go on, Briony becomes more and more guilty of what she did and Robbie fights in the war, facing death at every corner. The ending and the build-up to it is very well executed, as is most of the film. The sets and costumes are gorgeous, the acting is solid, and the writing is clever in many regards. However, what keeps Atonement from No Country or There Will Be Blood greatness is the lack of depth to the characters, especially the central ones of Robbie and Cecilia. We never really get to know about their relationship and it doesn't make for a great payoff at the end. The film is still very well-made and doesn't falter too badly, but the lagging in the middle and lack of character depth keeps it from being Best Picture-worthy and one of the best films of a very strong 2007.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Partly through the film, during the war scenes, the momentum of the film takes a step back. I believe that, after seeing the film, the celebrated five-minute Dunkirk beach scene that people have mentioned is positively over-rated, and didn't prove to be an interesting or integral part of the story.

"Good, but too long","A young girl (Ronan) tells a lie that literally destroys some lives. As an adult she tries to atone for that lie.I cringe when I hear about an Award type movie with Britons as the characters knowing I will go see it, but also knowing that I will cringe because I cannot understand what they are saying because the director has the characters talking way too fast. I have gone on record to say that all British movies must have Michael Caine talking all the male parts and Jane Seymour doing all the female parts. At least when those two speak I can understand what they are saying. Is that too much to ask? Apparently so.The Academy gave a Best Picture nomination to this movie because they couldn't understand what was being said also, and because the movie was British and understandably superior to American movies, they raved to everyone about it. The kicker is the people who were ""raved"" to about the movie figured the Ravers knew what they were talking about even though they couldn't understand anything either. Hence a nomination. And, there you have it.I found the movie much too long. The war scenes went on forever. In fact I think they are still going on. This could have been a more satisfying movie if the idle chatter in the beginning among the idle rich and the war scenes were drastically cut back. They didn't need to be that long. Give the audience some credit to get the point. This isn't advertising where repetition rules the day.The acting was good, and the cinematography was excellent.I must say that the twist at the end was excellent and powerful and no one saw it coming. In fact, the twist was so powerful I am at odds whether or not the character who gave us the twist did the right thing. Did the twist atone for all that went on before? You must decide.

"""Atonement"" exemplifies cinematic mastery, only lacking in action","If one were taking a course on how to appropriately adapt a novel for the big screen, ""Atonement' would certainly need to be among the required materials. Though I personally have never read McEwan's novel, the attention to detail that Joe Wright and his team bring to telling this story visually is superb.""Atonement"" is the story of a young girl named Briony (played well by three actresses at different ages of her life) with a very incurable appetite and curiosity for plot and drama, enough so that she tells a lie that separates her sister Cecilia (Knightley) from her newly discovered love of Robbie (McAvoy), the son of their mansion's grounds keeper. The rest of the film is the consequences of Briony's actions and her struggle to forgive herself for what she did.The acting is top notch, but not as deserving of accolades as the production crew and the minds behind the cinematic telling of this story. The art direction and Wright's choices are simple and beautiful and most notably is Dario Marianelli's original score that is both creative and effective, particularly in the beginning and end of the film.The only thing holding ""Atonement"" back is the middle of the film, which lacks attention- grabbing substance. The symbolism is all over the place, but the plot lacks a distinct something during the point in which Robbie and Cecilia are separated to really grip the viewer as the film's wonderful ending reveals itself. I can't believe that I would be the only one who really needed more convincing of the love and passion between them.That said, the story is still Briony's story at heart, hence the film's title, and her story is told with brilliance. Unfortunately, the aforementioned middle part keeps her out of the story for a significant amount of time. The film, therefore, requires patience and really keen eye for the the subtlety that makes a film more than just a story told with a camera.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I recommend this movie for viewing,"This is definitely one of the most exciting movies I've ever watched.

"Visually stunning but convoluted; not academy-award worthy, but worth a watch","No rhymes, no embellishments, no adjectives... just kidding...This film is a chick flick, which I insist is not a pejorative. That is not surprising, but it is one of the reasons I didn't adore this film. It is suffused with the kind of hopeless romanticism that I find, unfortunately, incredible. Some reasons why the kind of 'love' displayed is plausible in this case: the impending great war, the ww1 environment, human nature's tendency to translate desire into love. Still, it will always be a mystery why people rationalize, or should I say excuse, sex with love? It's not necessary, nor is it realistic. It is however a fixture of the dramatic, romantic chick flick. Apparently, people find it beautiful. Nicely portrayed in this film, but not necessarily appreciated.Frankly, the most beautiful thing in this movie - no, not Keira Knightly's sprightly, elfin body - is its photography. The cinematography is excellent. Varied, unorthodox, meticulous, it is delightful and masterful. The scenes of war and Dunkirk are particularly haunting.Additionally, the pacing and sequence of the film are stupendous... stupendous. They are inventive and interesting. Unfortunately, there is some amount of repetition, or should I say redundancy. The film could have been pared down. At 123 minutes, it is not excessively long, but for what was presented, it is a bit overdone and over-complicated. Additionally, it could have benefited from more characterization. The dialogue is smart and tight, but slightly sparse, especially for the minor characters.The story, of course, is one we have heard before. It is cherished, and treated wonderfully in this presentation. Acting is very fine, though I will never really fall for the histrionics of the semi-human Knightly. All in all, a very nice and even slightly philosophical and provocative movie. Who would have thought a chick flick could be so ambitious?",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

The best romantic movie,"""Atonement"" is a cinematic masterpiece that beautifully weaves together a heart-wrenching love story and the devastating impact of a single false accusation. Its strengths are abundant, from the outstanding performances by Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, who bring depth and authenticity to their characters, to the mesmerizing cinematography that captures the sweeping landscapes and the intimate moments with equal finesse. The hauntingly evocative score by Dario Marianelli adds depth to the emotional resonance, while the film's visuals paint a vivid picture of the era. While it earns its 9/10 rating for its compelling storytelling and remarkable craftsmanship, its sole weakness might be the emotionally intense journey it takes viewers on, which can be both heartrending and unforgettable. ""Atonement"" stands as a timeless romantic classic, leaving an indelible mark on those who experience its poignant tale of love and redemption.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Truly artistic,"This movie is artistically and well done, but as such, it can also move slowly at times. This movie reveals the horrors of war, poverty, greed, falsehood, and prejudice. Some of the horrors of war are graphically displayed. There is one very sad scene of a dying man in a hospital. There is a very touching moment where Keira Knightley calls her true love home to her. Large portions of the movie deal with the struggle for atonement and several of those moments are very poignant. When I rate a movie, part of my rating is my own enjoyment throughout, as opposed to the quality of the film. This explains why I haven't given it higher marks.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A masterpiece of recent cinema,"There is a historical discrepancy in this movie, for which I remove a star: the sailor in the Dunkirk Beaches relates that the Lancastria had floundered the day before, carrying with it 3,000 lives. The Lancastria did not really sink off Dunkirk but close to St. Nazaire and about two weeks later during Operation Ariel (try wikipedia.org) This event was a smaller -but still large- evacuation after General Weygand's plan, to counterattack the Germans northwards from the River Somme, failed and the British and French forces were pushed into the northwest coast of France. This was perhaps the biggest loss for the Brits during the War of France, because in comparison to the success of Dunkirk, an important number of troops was caught prisoners inside the city, the Germans having stormed in before they could embark. I highly recommend reading Churchill's War Memoirs if this chapter of history is of your interest. This remarkable and admirable leader won the Nobel price for his work, which is a way more valid and fair award than the highly criticized Oscar (which in my frank opinion under-rated such a delightful movie).",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

"Atonement is an exceptional historical drama, with extra praise for the direction and screenplay along with cinematography","Atonement is a film that I thought was perfect when I watched it back in 2013, now over a decade later, I find it even more perfect thanks to my appreciation for the aesthetics which is excellent, same for the cinematography and the director (Joe Wright), he works with such a great mise-en-scene and showcases exceptional direction throughout the film and also visual storytelling. He brings this fantastic script to life. The cinematography was done by Seamus McGarvey and honestly it's so magnificent, his work and Joe Wright's direction is truly exceptional, making each scene feel like a painting in a way. Truly fascinating filmmaking, this film is cinema on the highest level. What else is fantastic in each scene is the editing and the musical score which is nicely edited together with the scenes. Dario Marianelli does such a brilliant job with the music. Christopher Hampton wrote the screenplay which itself is based upon Ian McEwan's novel of the same name. There's so many things that this film does well, so many things that Joe Wright does well, ultimately creating one of the most artistic and best films of the historical drama genre. Mixing this genre with romance and war, which creates a film that chronicles a crime and its consequences over six decades, beginning in the 1930s. Back to the direction and cinematography, the one take sequence at Dunkirk, that has to be among of the best scenes in the 2000's. The story is very strong, quite excellent and intelligent screenplay.The film's premise: Thirteen-year-old fledgling writer Briony Tallis irrevocably changes the course of several lives when she accuses her older sister's lover of a crime he did not commit.Atonement includes a cast of familiar actors, some who became famous after this film. It stars James McAvoy, Keira Knightley, Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai, Vanessa Redgrave, Brenda Blethyn, Juno Temple, Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Kennedy and Harriet Walter. First of all, the breakout star of this film and who leaves the biggest mark is Saoirse Ronan who plays Briony Tallis as a thirteen year old, a role Romola Garai plays as an eighteen year old. It's a performance Saoirse Ronan was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. She portrays this autistic teenager perfectly and sells every scene she's in. James McAvoy is a great lead, giving us a charming and likable character whilst also going deep into the character's emotions. Among numerous accolades, Atonement was nominated in seven categories at the 80th Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Original Score, which it won; and also garnered fourteen nominations at the 61st British Academy Film Awards, winning both Best Film and Production Design; and won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Drama.The New York Observer's Rex Reed considers Atonement his favourite film of the year deeming it ""everything a true lover of literature and movies could possibly hope for"", and singling out McAvoy stating ""the film's star in an honest, heart-rending performance of strength and integrity that overcomes the romantic slush it might have been"", and praising Ronan as a ""staggeringly assured youngster"", while being underwhelmed by a ""serenely bland Keira Knightley"". Some critics praised Keira Knightley, Richard Roeper gave the film a ""thumbs up"", adding that Knightley gave ""one of her best performances"". I think her performance is great, but it could have been better. I think she does a phenomenal job at the body language and facial expressions, her performance comes off as bland in few scenes. To summarize, Atonement is an exceptional historical drama which will pull you in and make you invested in its story, thanks to Joe Wright's direction and Christopher Hampton's screenplay.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Technically excellent, beautiful, but somewhat remote","Atonement is a finely crafted, beautifully made film that, for me, just fell just a little short emotionally.Set shortly before, and later during, World War 2, the story centres on the false accusation by a young girl against her older sister's lover and the fall out that action creates. The lives of the young girl and several of those around her are changed forever.Keira Knightley plays the older sister, Cecilia, and James McAvoy plays the falsely accused lover, Robbie. Both are very good, though I think James's performance was the stronger of the two. In any case, they made a convincing pair.Technically the film is excellent, with gorgeous cinematography - equally good in portraying everything from a sunny English garden to a war torn French beach. The story is strong, the pacing good, and all the supporting cast good too. Much care and attention has clearly been put into the staging and lighting of each scene, and it works.Despite this, I never became fully engaged, emotionally, with the story or characters. I found myself continually noticing and praising the skilled film making rather than becoming enveloped in the lives of those portrayed.An impressive film, but one I enjoyed watching as an observer rather than becoming fully part of.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Brilliant and somber in unexpected ways,"I am quite surprised, although in theory I shouldn't be, since the title says it all.

For this very reason, it is difficult for me to give it a proper evaluation, as it takes me time to process all the factors outside of the script when the script itself leaves me bewildered.That said, it was easy for me to recognize the quality of the set design, the photographic composition of the scenes, and the ambitious cinematic style, particularly with the continuous shots. Evidently, McAvoy and Knightley's performances were brilliant. However, I still carry the bitter feeling of their story, which clearly does not allow me to evaluate it with greater freedom.

Some beautiful compositions and the colours were ravishing and there was a real sense of scale to many of the big set pieces. My reservations are that despite everything I wasn't as moved by the climax as I felt I was supposed to be. I felt that much effort had been made to build to an emotional resolution but somehow it left me feeling cold. Something about it felt a little contrived for my taste. I read the novel shortly afterwards and I can see that something about the climax is more satisfying in novel form.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Faceless, joyless, festival of dung","Don't make the mistake of thinking that this movie is a twisty-curvy, tightly plotted suspense thriller on the order of Notes on a Scandal. Instead of a plot that takes plausible but largely unforeseeable left turns, Atonement's story is obvious, too blunt, and crackling with cliché. Everything, from the haphazard direction and editing to the numb acting, is a bit of an embarrassment to all involved.Wildly overrated, Atonement is closer in style and scope to a Merchant-Ivory film, so if that's your cup of tea, you might like this one a little more than I did. But it's more like the dimwitted, held-back-in-school bastard child of such films, because although it contains all the proper hoity-toity attitude and pretty costumery, it has none of the subtlety or charm - in short, the characters are all largely unsympathetic, giving the audience no one to root for. This isn't always a deal breaker for me, but when the characters are dull, vapid, vacuous space takers, it does sort of put a damper on things.At age 13, Briony (Saoirse Ronan) is a pretentious, self-possessed newbie writer. She's supposed to be a child prodigy of sorts, but she seems more perfunctory than imaginative (to be sure, we don't get much of a glimpse of her writing efforts at that age; it's merely implied how great she is). She harbors a crush on the handsome, strapping son (James McAvoy) of her wealthy family's housekeeper, who has long had eyes for Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). On a hot summer day, Briony illicitly reads a note from Robbie (McAvoy) intended for Cecilia (gasp) and then later sees something she shouldn't have. Subsequently the girl swears to seeing something she definitely didn't see, her perspective colored by her feelings for Robbie and her interception of the note. This irrevocably alters the lives of all three, of course.The movie jumps around quite a bit, timewise, which at one point was an interesting approach to film-making but more often than not nowadays seems sort of played out and unnecessary; here it's done to confuse the audience a little bit, some trickery thrown in to distract from the fact that the plot itself is fairly bland and melodramatic. Because of Briony's misinterpretation, Robbie winds up in prison and later in the military, fighting in WW II. Much of the film describes his attempts to get back to London to be with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, works as a waitress - a job that's a bit lower than her family's station should allow. Briony forgoes attending an exclusive writing academy and becomes a nurse, all owing to her guilt (not to mention her obstinacy).But what does it all mean? That one person's sworn testimony can screw up the lives of somewhat-innocent people? Oh, there's news. In the end, it all feels like much ado about nothing. Has Briony truly atoned for her sin? Of course not. She didn't have the guts to say anything when she had the power to do so; to make herself feel better, she writes a novel over the course of the rest of her life. So, no real atonement, just a general sense of comfort and insincere assuaging of guilt.I think that's the crux of the issue here - the movie feels insincere. Are Robbie and Cecilia madly in love, or do they just want to have hot sex all the time? Little in the early half of the movie indicates the former, and plenty of evidence is shown for the latter. But even if they are in love well, here is where the issue of What the Movie Is crops up; this is not a psychological thriller, it's a dopey romance movie. It's a chick flick, even with some truly garish and probably unnecessary war scenes. (Do we really need to see burn victims? How does this further the plot?) The script is even based on a romance novel, by Ian McEwan. If pining for lost loves sounds like a grand old time to you, by all means dive into this murky, tortured movie.As for the casting, it's not terrible. Knightley, who has said she wants to play more mature roles, continues to look like a tall, bug-eyed boy, with her shapeless, bony figure. She's not a bad actress, but she might have been a little in over her depth here; at no point did I feel sympathy toward Cecilia, although she's supposed to be a victim here. McAvoy (The Last King of Scotland) looks a little more girlish here than Knightley does, what with his impossibly red lips, even in the war scenes.So. If you're expecting a thick-plotted, twisty thriller about what happens when a lie spirals out of control, this is not the movie for you; if you like costume dramas with actors rising to their material, this is also not the movie for you; if you like love stories with no apparent happy ending and actors sinking to melodramatic depths, this is a winner.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

A fine romantic drama that doubles as an exploration of perception & storytelling,"Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" concerns a fledgling writer who accuses her older sister's lover of a crime that he didn't commit, thus changing their lives irrevocably. Eventually she seeks to atone for her actions and what on the surface seems to be merely romantic melodrama evolves subtly over the course of the film into something wholly unique.The cast is well-assembled with fine performances all around, though perhaps none that are particularly outstanding. Saorise Ronan, as the young Briony Tallis, received an Oscar nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category. She showed herself fully able, at a young age (13), to match the high standard put forth by the rest of the cast.The story is an interesting one, though the chain of events leading up to the accusation somewhat stretches the limits of plausibility. These events are easier to accept in the end, though, as certain facts come to light which cast doubts on the entire story. I should note that the script garnered a not undeserved Oscar nomination.The direction by Joe Wright is excellent, so I am baffled by the fact that he didn't even receive a Best Director Oscar nomination. His debut, ""Pride and Prejudice"", showed promise and here he delivers on that promise. The art direction, costumes & cinematography all received Oscar nominations so it should be apparent that the film is easy on the eyes. The only Oscar win for the film was for the score, which is quite unique and memorable.I definitely recommend the film though some may find the romantic aspect off-putting.

4 Romantics,"A typical tragic, poignant love story that is augmented by a very well thought out story and technical and cinematic expertise in directing, editing and cinematography.If the audience did not read the book they might feel it is about a doomed love and how the lovers' would attempt to find each other after being forcefully parted, however, the story evolves, into a tale about the guilt and remorse of the one who disrupted the lovers' love and happiness. Her own naivety, immaturity, fear, and disappointment with her own attempts and wishes for passion, lead her to doom the happiness of the lovers and eventually severely regret her own actions.The progressive timeline is not straightforward. Futures occurrences happen before the past, a flipping back and forth, sometimes with a difference of several years other times only several minutes. This gave the movie an interesting texture and made it more artistically enjoyable yet clear since flipping back and showing what lead up to the crucial occurrence clarified the plot.Being a little slow, epic, and overly sentimental it may arouse romantics and annoy pragmatics The ending is heartfelt and sentimental as she does what she can (incorporating into her lifestyle) to atone for her past act of indiscretion",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Breathtaking, heartbreaking, but flawed","Ian McEwen's brilliant novel is one of the most popular of recent years. Ever since it was published in 2001 it seemed as if it was destined for the screen. However, there are undoubted problems with adapting it for cinema. The structure is anything but cinematic and there are so many perspectives that the novel is written from that adapting it successfully seemed impossible. This is nowhere near as detailed or as electric as the novel, but that would be impossible. This is a successful adaptation of a difficult novel that is filled with invention, quality and is genuinely beautiful.The starting point with any film is the script and Christopher Hampton's script can only be described as tough. It does a very hard job quite well. It is interesting, genuinely well written but he fails to do justice to the novel. The latter part doesn't matter, as each adaptation deserves to be taken on its own merits, but it doesn't manage to be quick enough at points and the film chooses to centre on the romance more than the real central character, Briony. As such, she suffers a bit.However, Joe Wright must be commended for his fine work on this film. He lifts the film from what the script is and introduces a lavish visual style to every frame, genuinely interesting directorial touches and, whilst this film is by no means perfect, he shows great potential. He evokes the heat of the English summer, the passion of the central relationship and the horror of the Second World War with apparent ease. The result is a film that is genuinely heartbreaking and breathtaking.The film is assisted by a supremely good ensemble. James McAvoy is the standout. He is spectacular as Robbie Turner and takes the weight of this film on his shoulders and carries it off superbly. The lack of awards consideration he's received is scandalous. Keira Knightley delivers her best performance to date, but is still somewhat outshone here. Saoirse Ronan is brilliant, as is Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave, all in the role of Briony.The visual style is near perfect. The cinematography is stunning, as is the costume, the production design and the make-up. However, the score is quite astounding. Dario Marianelli produces some ingenious music that incorporates the strangely lyrical sound of the typewriter with a superb orchestral score and emotive piano solos.All of these elements contribute to an excellent film. It is also helped by some quite extraordinary sequences, most notably the four and a half minute long tracking shot of the beaches on Dunkirk that shows the horror of that retreat and is breathtaking, but there are four or five of these moments. It is a flawed film, but it is a fine one. A film that doesn't have to be seen, but should be seen. Wright shows himself to be a promising director and McAvoy appears to be a tremendous actor. But, ultimately, this film shows the visual power of cinema and its potential, even if this is not a perfect example of it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Well-Made, but Messy","One of those films that you constantly see in edits online, with specific scenes that turn out to be completely different than what you had in mind when they're put in context. Not the type of romantic film you would expect, at times that was the appeal, but at other times it hindered the overall experience.The first 45 minutes stand out from the rest of the film, I liked the unexpected approach the story took and how it began to unfold, and what it would lead to. Unfortunately, the rest of it felt inorganically woven together to reach an ending that didn't leave me satisfied at all. My experience is that I left the film with it having little to no impact on me, despite liking a lot of aspects individually.On a technical level, it is brilliant and subtle in the best of ways. Beautiful score with great hints of the typewriter interwoven as a narrative device. Impressively immersive with its cinematography and production design. McAvoy is incredible, at times I felt his talent exceeded that which the film had to offer. On the other hand, I felt like Knightley's character was underwritten, looks aside, I felt unconvinced of what made her so appealing to Robbie, which the film heavily depended on.My biggest problems are with how the film is structured and how it fails to pay off what it builds up by the end of it. For me, the large chunk in the middle was uninteresting, yet necessary, but it felt like it was taking up time that was needed for other aspects. Lots of sections could be excused by the fact that you could argue it's supposed to play out like a book or a writer reminiscing, but it still needs to be structured like a film for it to flow well.Might rewatch it again in the future to see if I feel different about it, expected to love it more than I did. Enjoyed it, well-made, but not really connecting to the large appeal honestly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful and thought-provoking,"I liked the narrative structure of this film; by the end, it had me thinking deeply about the nature of Story itself. What started out with the promise of a lush romantic tale eventually both did and did not fulfill that promise, in the most intriguing way. This movie was very well acted, emotionally resonant, and occasionally breathtaking in its cinematic techniques (e.g., a single panning shot against the backdrop of a massive set filled with a couple thousand people and animals, complex in its execution; a lighting change that achieved a powerful emotional effect). The costumes were gorgeous and effective, the settings were a perfect complement to the characters' emotions, and the character interactions were compelling.

Twisted Lies and Broken Hearts,"The film, directed by Joe Wright, is a somber journey through the complexities of love, guilt, and the consequences of one's actions. It's like a bleak painting, drenched in shadows and sorrow, with only a glimmer of hope flickering in the distance.Set against the backdrop of pre-World War II England, Atonement follows the lives of the wealthy Tallis family and the tragic consequences of a young girl's misunderstanding. Briony Tallis witnesses a moment of intimacy between her sister Cecilia and the housekeeper's son Robbie Turner. But in her twisted mind, fueled by jealousy and imagination, she misinterprets the situation and accuses Robbie of a crime he did not commit. The film's atmosphere is as gloomy as a graveyard at midnight, with every scene shrouded in a sense of impending doom. The haunting score by Dario Marianelli adds to the eerie ambiance, like the mournful wail of a ghost lamenting lost souls.As the story unfolds, we witness the devastating consequences of Briony's lie, as it tears apart lives and relationships. Robbie is unjustly accused and torn from his beloved Cecilia. Their love is like a fragile flower crushed beneath the weight of Briony's deception, with no hope of blooming again.In the end, Atonement is a grim meditation on the nature of truth, forgiveness, and redemption. It's like staring into the abyss and finding a glimmer of light amidst the darkness, a faint hope that maybe, just maybe, love can transcend even the most unspeakable of sins. But beware, for this is not a tale for the faint of heart. It's a journey into the depths of human despair, where even the most innocent of actions can have devastating consequences.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
first 50 minutes were great !,"I found the beginning (first 50 minutes) of the movie was really good, the pacing was very well done and the romantic energy between Keira Knightley's Character and James McAvoy's character was clearly very clear with a lot of chemistry between the two. The cinematography of this film was very beautiful, it had beautiful landscapes of the war scenes, and the romance between the couple. The letter mix up was a funny twist to the story and made it very interesting and exiting to find out what was going to happen next. The costuming of Keira knightley's green dress was very well done, the green backless flowy dress, really made her stand out and made it exciting to watch. I found after the first 50 minutes the film began to get a little slow, i was expecting to see a lot more of the romance between Cecilia and Robbie but instead it was more between the loss of not being able to see each other and how it has been effecting them both separately. I found the character development in Briony very interesting, and the twist with her at the end talking about her book was a good ending and i enjoyed it. I just found the middle of this movie to be a bit slow and could of been a lot better, but overall i do think it's a pretty good romance/drama movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"""Pride and Prejudice"" was awesome - this was just plain annoying!","I was deeply disappointed, having forced myself through the whole length of this movie (I should have left after the first boring-to-death 45 minutes). The bitter lesson to be learned for me: an excellent team (Joe Wright as director and Keira Knightley as leading actress in ""Pride and Prejudice"") gives you no guarantee that their next movie is anything alike in quality!There was no chemistry between Keira Knightley and James McAvoy worth mentioning, like they were two strangers who are supposed to appear at the same scene (to achieve this: No Acting Required, as Robert Mitchum used to say). The narration of the whole story was erratic, and the motives of the figures remained nebulous. It is hard to find out what the whole story is about, what the meaning of the figures' action were (hopefully the novel is better, but I haven't read it yet, and in my opinion a movie shouldn't require the knowledge of the book in order to be understood).Last but not least I found it extremely embarrassing how the movie failed to connect its narration with the cruelties of the World War. I couldn't help feeling that the war background was just abused as a picturesque stage to let James McAvoy stumble around.",1.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

a child's anger and jealousy ruins lives,"Keira Knightley and James McAvoy star in ""Atonement,"" a 2007 film directed by Joe Wright, with a screenplay by Christopher Hampton, based on the novel by Ian McEwan.Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old girl in 1935 and an aspiring writer. She has a crush on the housekeeper's son Robbie (McAvoy) and at one point, jumps into the river so that he can save her. Robbie isn't amused - in fact, he's very angry, and Briony realizes that he'll never love her. From her bedroom window she sees her sister Cee (Knightley) and Robbie fighting.The Tallis family is being visited by cousins whose parents are in the process of getting a divorce, twin boys and their 15-year-old sister Lola. Briony's brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) brings home a very wealthy friend, Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch) for dinner. He meets the twins and Lola, and it's obvious that Lola thinks he's cute.Robbie meanwhile has written a letter to Cee, discarding the first draft which is very sexually explicit, and replacing it. He asks Briony to deliver it. Briony reads it; she has the wrong letter, in fact. She thinks Robbie is a sex maniac. When Robbie appears for dinner, Cee and Robbie have a confrontation which leads to them having sex up against a bookcase. Briony walks in on them.While everyone is at dinner, the twin boys disappear, and everyone goes out to look for them. Just as Briony comes upon Lola, a man runs away from her prone body. Lola has been molested. Briony accuses Robbie.Thus begins the ruination of lives in this beautifully directed and photographed film. Robbie goes to prison. His mother (Brenda Blethyn) is devastated. In 1939 he is given a chance to either stay in prison or enter the army, which he does. Cee's father was going to finance his going to medical school; he is now cut off. Cee knows Robbie is innocent and walks out on her family and becomes a nurse during the war. Briony (now Romola Garai) does the same.The question becomes, how much did Briony understand when she lied -- did she really believe her sister was being attacked by Robbie and that he was a sex maniac? Or was she jealous of her sister and Robbie and acted out of anger? The audience needs to decide.This film is filled with sadness and longing, with an idyllic beginning that ends in horror, and at the end, a final twist. As Briony must live with her burden and desire to atone, we are stuck with the results of her act and the havoc and heartbreak it causes.Keira Knightley is the perfect '30s young beauty here. In the beginning, she is a gorgeous woman from a wealthy family with probably no end of gentlemen callers - it's all ahead of her. Later she not only has to deal with the effects of the war but of the man she loves going to prison.James McAvoy does a wonderful job with a much showier role -- again, in the beginning, one is aware of his glowing youth and of him being in love; then he is dragged off to prison and ends up in the trenches.I must mention Benedict Cumberbatch in a small but pivotal role here, as I watched this film because of him. He's extremely dashing as Paul, and very charming. The film was made three years before he hit it big with Sherlock.The audience has to decide if there was any atonement as well as process the last half hour or so of this film, which comes as a surprise.An enchanting film showing the destructive power of a lie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Characters not as interesting as the events unfolding around them.,"Though not the great film some would have you believe, Atonement still has quite a bit going for it. For example it made me want to learn more about the Dunkirk evacuation and much more about the events leading up to WWII. Alas, this is essentially a romance, and the historical perspective and details take a back seat to weepy longings and misunderstandings caused by jealousy. The film looks terrific and the acting is more than satisfactory. Where the film goes wrong has to do mostly with its inability to sell the characters' motivations.The story deals with a mousy tween girl accusing her older sister's lover of a sexual assault. From there he is sent to prison, and then finds himself serving in the British army in the early stages of WWII. All the while the two sisters have given up their wealthy lifestyles to work as nurses as the elder sister longs for the return of her beau. While the younger sister wishes to atone for her lie by saving lives and hopefully one day reconciling with the star-crossed lovers. As one can tell, this is the type of plot that grows inside a romance novel. Apparently the novel this film is based on is quite well-regarded. If that is the case, then I might suspect that much of that book never made it the the screen.There are problems all throughout how this film is constructed. A viewer who doesn't let themselves get blinded by the sentimentality will question much of what they see. What on earth could be the little girl's motivation for seeing the young man blamed for such a terrible crime? And never speaking up for all those years to clear his name? Not realistic. The film seems to be channeling the movie Cold Mountain in some ways. We have two young lovers who hardly have much between them except a tryst in a library. And now, separated by war, the woman can only look to the horizon and repeat a phrase about wanting him to ""come back"". Silly. The first act seems needlessly drawn out and full of contrivances. The rest of the film feels a bit truncated trying to catch up the the present after the last few years of these characters' lives have happened off screen. What was prison like for Ronny? What was the fallout like between the sisters? Did Celia try to clear his name? What was his trial like?? All of these things could have made for some interesting viewing. Are they detailed in the book? The film does have some good selling points. Good acting, great period costumes and props. And the 5 minute unbroken scene along the beach is just as incredible as advertised. I wish the rest of the film could have been that good. 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.",6.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Not a chick flick in the least.,"When I first heard about this movie I was kind of in between if I really wanted to watch it or not, and boy am I glad I did. Although I am usually open to watch any movie and give it a fighting chance. Especially a movie that is up for a picture of the year award, then it is almost always a given that I'll watch it. Atonement is honestly up there as my picture of the year (either this or Gone Baby Gone which was poorly misrepresented in the whole award ceremony).Atonement provides the viewer a completely engaging experience, on multiple different levels. First it sweeps you up with an engaging romance that was completely misinterpreted and misunderstood. Then gives the viewer a look on both sides of the fence. Seeing the young man go off to war away from his love and how they both coped with being apart from one another. And more importantly the grown up little girl who separated the two young lovers and how she was dealing with the mistake that she had made. I like the presentation, I like the actors, and I just flat out like this movie. Most movies I watch (I do work at a Blockbuster) just seem to drag and I'm always watching the clock to when it will be over (Michael Clayton, No Country For Old Men, We Own the Night, and I could keep going) instead of watching the movie itself. But Atonement was a complete experience that I never lost interest in and was actually disappointed that it ended. It is a sad ending, I will warn the casual viewer, but don't let that draw you away, it's well worth it in the end.So guys if you like good movies, watch this one with your girl. You won't be disappointed and you might actually like it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Brilliant.,"It took me a long time to get interested in watching Atonement, even after it was so well received at the Oscars. Recently I watched the first 20 minutes or so and was immediately put off by the atmosphere and the characters (""I've been going completely doolally up here!""), for exactly the same reason that I am generally put off by books like The Great Gatsby or Faulkner's The Sun Also Rises, which feature characters of such wealth that their biggest problem seems to be what to do with all their surplus money and leisure time. Such people are difficult for me to relate to.For a couple weeks I put the movie aside and couldn't get up the interest to watch it, until finally I did and now I realize why it was one of the best pictures of 2007. Keira Knightly, a clearly talented actor who, for some reason, almost never impresses me, plays the daughter from a wealthy family living in the beautiful English countryside just before World War II, and James MacEvoy plays the daughter of a man working for her family. He is a promising and educated young man, but the son of a housekeeper nonetheless, so clearly a romantic relationship between the two would be highly taboo.The first 30 minutes or so of the movie depict a life devoid of trouble or worries, and yet still manages to create an atmosphere of slight tension about the war that we can almost feel approaching somewhere beyond the edge of the screen. Before long, Cecilia's (Knightly) 13- year-old sister sees a couple of things happening and makes some dangerous assumptions followed by some increasingly dangerous accusations, and radically alters the lives of her sister, Robbie (MacEvoy), and herself.The three main characters, from this point on, have remarkably little control over their own lives, reminding me of the struggles of the main character in Kubrick's brilliant film Barry Lyndon. The unusually structure of the film allows us to explore the results of a few catastrophic days in the lives of these three people and how they affected the rest of their lives.The film covers the course of many decades, tells a stunning and moving story, and never once comes off as pretentious or cheesy or preachy, even in the closing scene, which shows Briony, Cecilia's sister, as an aged novelist giving an interview about how that one decision during her childhood has affected her life. This is a story about life and how we affect those around us, particularly those closest to us, even when we think we're doing the best thing for them. One IMDb reviewer calls it ""pure poetry on film,"" and it's not easy to think of a more accurate description.Note: There is a scene in the film where Robbie comes across a horribly grisly scene in the woods during his military service. The following close-up of his face is one of the best pieces of acting I have seen in many years...",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A stunning cinematic adaptation and achievement-Spoilers?,"Atonement was adapted from Ian McEwan's book, by screenwriter Christopher Hampton. Director Joe Wright's previous work includes Pride and Prejudice. In an article in Creative Screen writing magazine, it is explained why it is so evident that the film has been well-received: it was decided to stay as close to the original story as possible.We've all heard the phrase ""The book was better,"" uttered by so many people, that it is pretty well expected to hear that in connection with film adaptation. However, it is rare that anyone dares to say that a film is actually better than the book version of the story.With Keira Knightley and James McAvoy in the leads, including a near-surprise appearance by Vanessa Redgrave, it is difficult to find any fault with the cast. In particular, despite her physical frailty, Ms. Knightley remains an emotional force to reckon with.The opening scenes of Atonement, are more than effective at setting the stage for controversy, even surprisingly so. It is doubtful that most of the audience members, unless they had read the book first, were prepared for the gravity of the in-your-face brashness of the first act.Taking place in 1935, as the world is on the brink of war, the story begins with families who have managed to still enjoy the sort of serenity reserved by the wealthy, in the isolated remoteness of the English countryside. But all is not as it seems, as is usually the case. Every family has its own drama, and the Tallises are no different. As 13-year old Briony (Saoirse Ronan, later played by Romola Garai), a budding writer who has already penned a play, bears witness to older sister, Cecilia (Kiera Knightley)'s coming of age, she displays the inevitable combination of envy, mixed with a potent anxiety, over Cecilia's hot, quick and heady entanglement with servant, Robbie (James McAvoy).While the film is a period piece, it is important that this doesn't dissuade anyone who is not usually partial to such types of films: it is simply unfair to relegate this movie to the unfortunate and derogatory ""chick flick"" status. It is truly so much more than that, romance aside. McEwan is most certainly, no Emily Bronte or Jane Austen. This film, marketed as a romance, is actually more about the importance of truth, and how the lack thereof can destroy lives, most importantly, the life of the liar, who must live the resultant life sentence of sadness and pity.The film, just as the book does, possesses sharply distributed dialog and character interaction, which strongly emphasizes the gravity of the story. The story's urgency is paralleled and very much affected by the wartime depictions of Britain and Northern France.The method that Wright embraces to enhance the cinematic nature of the story, includes shows events twice, from both Briony's eyes and a more neutral, honest perspective, which is effective at explaining how a young girl's impressions can mistakenly convince her to actually believe against what is really occurring.While Keira Knightley does issue a fantastic performance, the star billing she receives does not match the importance of Briony, played by three actresses: Saorise Ronan as a 13-year old, Romola Garai as an 18-year old, and the amazing Vanessa Redgrave as an older woman.Thematically, Atonement is tragic, whether its story is told in book or cinematic form. The film, augmented by its dramatic music score, by necessity, is far faster paced than the book. As Woody Allen uses the city of New York as a character in his stories, this film used a typewriter, which, as an instrument, manages to successfully remind one that there is a very serious story being told.All in all, Atonement is as finely crafted and visually stunning as a film can get, and its pace is every bit as good as any thriller, including its emotional, gut-wrenching surprise ending.© 2008 Susan S.

Thou Shalt Not Bear False Witness according to Oscar,"It's a cinematic masterpiece which SHOULD cop a ton of Oscars.

Briony has a passionate teen crush on Cecilia's boyfriend Robbie Turner played by James Mcavoy. Robbie is the house keeper's son. Briony makes a very strong almost sexual advance to Robbie which he totally repudiates and she is hurt terribly by this rejection.Briony witnesses one of her young girlfriends having sex with a much older man and accuses Robbie of the being the older man.

Probably the best movie ever,"The title may sound a bit pretentious or exaggerating but I can say a definite 'yes' when I'm asked if ""Atonement"" was a good movie. It was a phenomenal one.When I first read the book, I thought that it is impossible to convert the idea of the book into a film. In my opinion, there are certain books that are hard or impossible to adapt into a screenplay but I must say that Joe Wright has managed to do that in a very elegant matter.Elegant is probably the best word to describe this movie. There is a kind of soft flow to the movie; it isn't too fast nor is it boringly slow. It is the tempo I have seen before with ""Virgin Suicides"" and it is the perfect tempo for ""Atonement"" as well.This is the first movie where Keira Knightley (Cecilia Tallis) comes out of her usual role as a young beautiful girl who just ""is"" and becomes a young woman whose depiction of the character is brilliant. We see for the first time that Ms. Knightley is not just a pretty face but she has the potential of becoming a great drama actress.James McAvoy (Robbie Turner) is of course charming as all the ladies will agree but he also goes deep into the character of Robbie Turner. He conveys Robbie's pain and anguish as if they were his own and makes us all believe that his love for Keira/Cecilia is real.Saoirse Ronan is plausible as a the young Briony Tallis and Romola Garai's plea for forgiveness makes us want to forgive her but does not let us forget that her guilt runs deep. In my eyes, Vanessa Redgrave's portrayal as an old and weakening Briony is better than that of Ms. Ronan or Ms. Garai. Mrs. Redgrave knows what to say when and what emotions to reveal on her face. Briony's final act is what brings tears in my eyes.Being an avid moviegoer, I must admit that ""Atonement"" is the first movie over years that has managed to maintain the essence of the book but still stays unique and is not simply an adaption. And I think it doesn't hurt to say once more that ""Atonement"" deserves an Oscar.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Another excellent turn from Joe Wright,"Mr Joe Wright, if this directing lark doesn't work out for you, you CLEARLY have a sparkling career as a landscape photographer waiting for you. In a manner similar to his previous British literary adaptation, the infamous 'remake' of Pride and Prejudice, every shot was of such beauty, that for, as has previously been said of Raging Bull, you could take any frame of the film and it would a make a more than sizable photograph, and for my part I'd certainly put it up on my wall. Even the mind-blowingly long tracking shot of war torn Dunkirk beach was simultaneously filled with despair and yet a certain picturesque quality, perhaps intentionally contrasting it between the chocolate box imagery of the seaside and the stark contrast with the current situation. And as ever the sets in this film are so clearly painstakingly set up, the beach shot the most sizable notice of this, which even the harshest of critics could not fail to be impressed by. The first act was, again echoing P&P, almost like a film AND a ode of love to the great English countrysides and stately homes, panning over the trees and charmingly uneven hilltops, even adding a dash of glamour to what appeared to be overgrown weeds.In newspaper reviews, a couple of critics accused Joe Wright of being style over substance. The style is undeniably there. But I think in order for the film to have stood up as well as it did, there must have been a hefty great deal of substance also. I think the main problem was that the book, I'd imagine, with its to and fro narrative, didn't QUITE translate onto film. Although each section was beautifully crafted in its own way, it did seem to jump to time periods with no prior warning, such that you'd have to later realise what was going on. A minor niggle I know, and it may not annoy anyone else. As previously stated though, each part was expertly navigated by Joe Wright and of course this was also in great part thanks to the actors involved. The three actresses playing Briony were stubborn, numbly guilt-stricken and resigned respectively (the relative newcomer playing 13-year-old Briony is a standout find). James McAvoy again displays why he is so sought after with a sterling performance as a least flawed character in a film filled with imperfect people. Keira Knightley managed to avoid pouting her way through the movie and is again brilliant in her flawed English rose role, making the transition from aloof elitist to lovelorn with perhaps an over-swiftness, but that again may be what the script asked of her. The support cast provided a more than adequate frame, though not given much limelight to work with as the three main protagonists do such a brilliant job. As corny a prospect as it sounds, I think the sets and shooting locations should be credited as an invaluable cast member also, adding an additional emotional facet to every scene appropriately, taking your breath away without taking your eye away from the acting in the foreground.In short, mature and sensitive directing form Joe Wright (surely a name to look out for); Robbie, Cecilia and Briony x 3 all ever so much more than adequately portrayed; an excellent story from award and kudos-garnering Ian McEwan smartly adapted for screen; mouthwatering cinematography and locations tied up with another star turn from Dario Marianelli, returning for his second Joe Wright collaboration with an flowing and swelling score punctuated, appropriately by typewriter sound effects. All the emotion and beauty of Titanic set onland, sans boat and Celine Dion. A must-see.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A lifetime of regret,"In L P Hartley's ""The Go-Between"", a young boy in Edwardian England is sexually and emotionally scarred when he catches the two people he most admires 'in flagrante', having already acted as go-between carrying notes from one lover to the other. In ""Atonement"" a young girl of similar age is similarly scarred in a similar fashion having been 'emotionally betrayed' by two of the people she most admires. In both cases notes are involved, though the actions of Briony in ""Atonement"" prove more devastating in the end.Although somewhat different in tone and structure and setting from the L P Hartley novel, (and Joseph Losey's subsequent film), Ian McEwan's ""Atonement"", (and this terrific film version by Joe Wright), moves very much in the same ball-park. (They would make a fascinating double-bill). Both deal with betrayal, loss and regret and quite directly with issues of class, (in both, the sexual relationship is between an upper-class girl and a working-class boy). So far, so much the same but while ""The Go-Between"" contented itself with the relationship between the protagonists and its fall-out and left it there, McEwan goes further.It begins in 1935 in an England already preparing for war and after the initial events that set 'the plot' in motion, moves forward to Dunkirk and its aftermath; (there is also a coda set in the present day, something else it has in common with ""The Go-Between""). And the Dunkird sequences are neither mere plot contrivance nor window-dressing but a direct comment on the horrors of war, (Briony's 'crime' placed in a much wider historical and social context), and in this film version the whole Dunkirk sequence works in the most powerful and surreal way imaginable, (a tracking shot through the chaos is particularly stunning). Although seemingly divorced from the events that preceded it these two halves of the film work beautifully together and Briony's realization of what she has done in the past in superbly conveyed in Romola Garai's performance. Indeed, in a film full of great moments and perfectly sustained sequences its greatest coup lies in the casting of the three actresses who play Briony; Saoirse Ronan as the naive, uncomprehending child, Garai as the emotionally shallow young woman and finally, in a magnificent cameo, Vanessa Redgrave as the much, much older Briony, finally achieving 'atonement'.But the film isn't total perfection. When Briony walks away from her reunion with Robbie and Cecilia I felt strangely unmoved just as the sequences in Dunkirk left me unmoved, (they are magnificently done but where, I asked myself, is the feeling?). In so far as it goes you can't fault Joe Wright's direction or the burning intelligence of Christopher Hampton's screenplay. Intellectually you certainly feel engaged but emotionally you may feel short-changed.Perhaps the fault lies in the casting of James McAvoy who makes Robbie a very cold fish. (He is very good, however, at capturing the boy's cock-sure arrogance). But then the film redeems itself in its closing moments and the emotional punch packed into that final sequence more than makes up for what I felt was missing earlier. It could have been sentimental but Wright never allows it to trip over into such saccharine territory. And again this may be down to casting. Vanessa Redgrave is so over-whelmingly good in her final monologue she almost throws you off-balance. This is a great performance by a great actress even if it only lasts a few moments. Hopefully when the film is showered with Oscar nominations next February she will not be over-looked.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Cinematic Splendor: ATONEMENT reaches the standard of the novel,"For those who have had the immense pleasure of reading Ian McEwan's ATONEMENT not once but several times, basking in not only the brilliant story/mystery but also in the inordinately beautiful language, rest assured that the film not only does the book justice in the transference to the screen, but in the hands of screenplay writer Christopher Hampton (we know that McEwan approved of the modifications as McEwan is one of the producers of the film) becomes even more clear in its realization of the complex plot and finds the visual beauty inherent in McEwan's prose. Joe Wright as director steers this story well, finding just the right amount of back and forth nonlinear development that formed the magic of McEwan's initial weaving.The cast is uniformly superb. From the initial self-centered liar Briony Tallis (an impressive Saoirse Ronan) to the years' later sorrowfully guilty young nurse Briony (Romola Garai) to the 'epilogue' Briony of Vanessa Redgrave, the entire story is adroitly centered on this perpetrator of tragedy. But without the power of James McAvoy's falsely accused Robby Turner and Keira Knightley's tragic Cecilia Tallis the triad would not work. Even the smaller yet important roles assigned to Gina McGee, Brenda Blethyn, Jérémie Renier and countless others are played to perfection.The cinematography by Seamus McGarvey captures not only the misty tranquility of 1935 pre-war England complete with creative use of luminous light sources as well as the raw brutality of the battlefields as England enters WW II. Dario Marianelli's music score (much of it played by pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet!) incorporates the superb Sir Thomas Beecham recording of 'La Boheme' with de los Angeles and Björling as incidental music to the typing of Robby's fateful note and then proceeds to incorporate the typewriter as if it were an instrument in his orchestrations.Rarely has this viewer been so moved by a film (and perhaps that may have been related to just having heard a performance of Britten's WAR REQUIEM at the Los Angeles Philharmonic the previous night!): it is the perfect marriage of novel, cinematic realization and commitment on the part of all concerned in the creation of this superlative film. Highly Recommended on every level. Grady Harp",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
reality in que,"Strange how you watch a movie for a non specific reason ie (sexah MS Knightly) and are drawn to your own past and closeted memories. How little things can turn to larger broader impacting consequences. I suppose some of us are living out our own atonements or surviving thru another's consequences or sadly both. How our minds eye can help us see a situation as it is or as we wish to see it. Yet again this same inner reflection can twist one's reality beyond the scope.Everyday we live with things and hopefully before we center on it in our mind we let it blur past. Fortunalty I was alone at home when I saw This and when my walls were swept aside .. and my guard down the brevity ""of it all"" crushes like a long fall. Grief is so hurtfull bottled up and sometimes its release still hurts and for a time helps. LOSS is my one word for this. LOSS of youth, love or a loved one.I rate this highly. Yes it could have expounded on the characters of Robbie's two war buddies but that wasn't the point. The reflection we do of the story and the lives in the story as well as our own did not allow for too much extra filler info. Well done!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Fantastic and Captivating!,"I read McEwans book of Atonement before I saw the film, which I would definitely recommend. When I watched the film it was all I had expected it to be and more. I was captivated by the confusion of Briony's actions, Celcilia's and Robbies love and the brilliant ending. The entire cinematography were perfectly arranged around the story, and created a flawless atmosphere. The music and lighting was what really struck me, corresponding with the scenes fantastically. There was, I'll admit, a lack of dialogue - though the characters presented by McEwan had always seemed concealed with thought, thus allowing the audience to create their own reasoning; conveyed extremely well in the film.The war scenes were perfectly effective and truthful of gore and emotion. The ending was surprising, even though I had read the book; I had not fully understood it. I felt it was a severe twist to the story, yet made sense of Briony's character. The last scene with elderly Briony quickly became one of my favourites, with the truth of reality rather than a fairytale ending where everyone has a chance to right their wrongs.Atonement has become my favourite film, and for audiences who enjoy a similar genre, this is one of my first recommendations! Bravo!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Nothing To Be Sorry About,"Tap tap tap goes the typewriter. The tapping is coming faster and hitting harder. The pace is set and the race has officially started. Director, Joe Wright's ATONEMENT bursts out of the gate from the moment it starts, as a pan away from a modeled replica of the Tallis manor reveals a parade of toy animals and ends aptly on the purported queen of this particular animal kingdom, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan). Briony is only thirteen years old but she is just about to finish her very first play. This precocious child is captivating. She is at once frightening while just as frightened. Her focus is eerily burning and her need for command of the situation and those involved motivate her every decision. On this particularly sweltering day, Briony believes her play to be her greatest accomplishment yet and sees her future more brightly boundless than even before. She has no idea that everything is about to crumble beneath her. Chance allows her to witness a few things she was not meant to and before long she makes a desperate play to regain control of her destiny. Who knew that one little girl could cause so much trouble for so many people and invite turmoil into her family for the rest of her days by telling one misguided lie?When Briony falsely accuses Robbie (James McAvoy), her sister, Cecilia's (Keira Knightly) lover, of a horrible crime, he is arrested and sent to prison. It isn't clear whether Briony was aware of how serious her accusations were or how far Robbie would be taken from Cecilia and his future as a result but it is clear that she interrupted a love of immense proportion. ATONEMENT's first act goes back and forth between Briony's breakdown and the escalating sexual tension between Robbie and Cecilia. Cecilia is not your typical period drama maiden. She is provocative and sharp-tongued. For all her fierce self-awareness though, she has made a point to repress her longing for Robbie out of respect for status. Robbie too has been hiding how he feels to appease the rules that apply to status and boundaries, not so much out of respect though but rather for blind tradition. Society's restraints cannot hold back a love of this magnitude. The passion bustling between them is palpable and exacerbated by the heat; it is no wonder that it all comes to a head on this fated day and is halted no sooner than it is just begun. As they are only given the chance to wet their lips with each other's taste before being ripped apart, theirs is a relationship that will live in a suspended state of foreplay for a long time to come.When Robbie is taken prisoner, ATONEMENT shifts into a new and noticeably different movement. The intensity carefully crafted in the first act dissipates as the characters enter their own individual limbos, left to meander aimlessly in search of repair. The build toward Briony's lie was punctuated by a sharp, concise score by Dario Marianelli and highlighted by Seamus McGarvey's bright and elegantly fluid cinematography. Both artists employ entirely new approaches toward the action that unfolds in the lie's aftermath. The score becomes dark, somber - less driven and more haunting. The visuals follow suit, feeling heavy and dense. The change halts the flow of the film and feels like a misstep momentarily. Once you catch the breath you were holding previously, the severity of the scenario sinks in and the fresh aesthetic takes on its own significance. It cannot help but feel longer or slower in comparison but how else are we or the characters expected to feel when they are living their new lives lost and haunted by a past they could not control? Besides being relevant to the tone of the story, the shift also gives birth to a four and a half minute shot depicting the 1940 evacuation at Dunkirk Beach that is mesmerizing in its grace and awesome in scope.ATONEMENT is a fresh and surprising spectacle. Wright impressed with charm and poise last time out in 2005's PRIDE AND PREJUDICE (also starring Knightly) but his latest grabs the period drama by its snotty superiority and turns it inside out, thanks in no small part to Ian McEwan's much loved novel of the same name. The gravity of how one bad decision can ruin many lives resonates loudly and the guilt that follows gives way to the need for forgiveness from those who were hurt and from the one that caused the pain. ATONEMENT does not judge Briony for what she's done; instead it allows her the chance to heal and make things right without ever presuming that her recovery is inevitable. For breaking convention and for demonstrating sincere respect for the story, the characters and the audience, Wright has absolutely nothing to be sorry for.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Brilliant!,"This movie was at my ""last options"" list. The title didn't sound so catchy plus the covers plus the summary - I was trying, back then, to find some movie with more interesting title and plot. Of course, you can judge by my vote that I was wrong.The beginning of the movie was not really promising. I thought I was going to spend hours sitting and flowing through the infinity of boredom. I guess the elements sorted themselves during the movie and I was shocked - the movie I was watching was great! The plot (after realizing that I made a huge mistaking thinking this would've been boring) was great, the characters were emotionally developed and that dose of sarcasm throughout the movie was brilliant.If I had chance, I would see it again. If you're hesitating, don't! - watch this movie, you will not regret it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A poor beginning ruins a pretty good end.,"I felt compelled to write a review of this movie, due its critical acclaim and raving reviews. I disliked this movie in many ways, not one of which was the ending. The ending, I felt, was satisfying, even beautiful in its own way. What bothered me was the beginning. I don't hate slow movies, but I often felt this movie needed to have a little nudge and an ""okay, get on with it."" Besides the first hour being slow, it left a horrible distaste in my mouth. All it delivered was a typical smut story wrapped up in an elegant package; a story that replaces love with lust and hopes it tricks the audience into believing it's amore. When I saw the vulgar letter I was shocked, surely a man would not write such things about a woman he loved. I saw her reaction and was absolutely disgusted. (I hate the word, and believe me, I don't hold back on expletives). I'm no prude, love scenes can be beautiful if the love story makes sense, but this love scene was intensely awkward and unemotional. Sure they say ""I Love You"" right before they start, but that did little to appease the situation. Then it lasted for about thirty seconds too long, making me want to return the popcorn I'd eaten back into the bag. It's not that it was grotesque; They didn't show nudity, or thrusting for that matter. It was the situation that kept this from working. While this was clearly supposed to be more, it came off as a mere 'hook-up' in a fashion many porno movies have taken: rich girl gets gardener/pool boy after gardener says something dirty. Love? I think not. You can't just have it in the script ""They are deeply in love."" This has to be shown. And the movie does show it, it just comes later on. But the first instance of their relationship looks so loveless and trite that it's hard to accept it after the fact.The second half had some redeeming qualities, and the cinematography was spectacular, though Keira Knightley needs to put on about fifteen pounds lest her bones break through her skin. If one forgets the first half and just starts the story where two young lovers are separated and neglects their the awkward beginning, it helps, but that's hard to do. The story of Brioney, the aspiring author who sees the dangerous mistakes she made, is a nice one, and her attempt at redeeming herself is admirable and moving. But it all gets to the root of the love story, which didn't convince me of love at all, turning what could have been a good movie into an overrated lust story that tried to make up for itself a little too late.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"A marvelous, sweeping love story","""Atonement"" is one of those movies that completely draws you in and never really lets you go, even after the credits start rolling. It is to the film's credit that it manages to be completely unforgettable, even after a year of having viewed it.The film is divided into two parts: the first half is a mystery that is slowly unveiled, and told from two different viewpoints. The second half is more straightforward, but it has a number of flashbacks. This is a densely plotted film, and, especially during the first hour, it requires absolute attention from the viewer (don't worry. The film is so good that this will happen anyway). As such, I can't give much in way of the plot (just watch the trailer).The acting is outstanding. Keira Knightly has never been one to ""sell out"" to Hollywood; she clearly only takes on projects that interest her and challenge her. Her performance as Cecilia Tallis is easily her best performance, and should have earned her a second Oscar nomination. She captures every emotion perfectly, and uses restraint to emphasize the effect of her emotions. Likewise, James McAvoy equals her, giving us a perfect romantic foil for Cecilia. McAvoy wisely avoids giving us a Harlequin romance lead; instead he creates a real person that has a powerful romantic connection with his co-star.Saoirse Roman, despite being very young, holds her own against the up-and-coming A-listers. She's a natural, and perfectly captures the complexity of her character. Much of what she does and feels is presented without words, and only a truly talented actress like Roman can pull it off. Her Oscar nomination was well deserved. Her older counterpart, played by Romala Garai, is so good that it is hard to believe that these are two different actresses, and not one character that simply grew up. It's tough to pull off, but Roman and Garai are perfectly in synch.""Atonement"" could have gone wrong in so many ways, but director Joe Wright manages to keep it all straight. He keeps things moving, including a 5-minute long, unbroken take across a soldier-filled beach. Additionally, the soft light he chose for the film enhances the experience, producing an almost dream-like quality to the film, and even in the war scenes, it works.The best part of ""Atonement"" is that it's kept on a personal level. While all the characters are caught up in an extraordinary event, the story that connects them is purely personal. There is no ""national scandal,"" or flashing photographers wanting a scoop on this drama. There are only a few characters who knew about what happened, and novelist Ian McEwan and especially Wright wisely focus on them. Wright keeps the epic scale of the war intact, but he personalizes the drama.""Atonement"" is a beautiful and harrowing film. It is not to be missed, and was easily one of the best, if not THE best, films of 2007.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
I suggest that you actually WATCH it first before you judge it.,"""You can only imagine the truth.""It's got the worst tagline that I've ever read, but who cares. Just wink at the so-so romance of ""The Notebook"" and pan your eyes to this award-winning tear-jerker coming from director Joe Wright (director, Pride and Prejudice).""Atonement"" is definitely the best movie I've seen in weeks. This romantic tale is something that I've never heard of, and by far, it is the best love story that I've ever pondered on (it even overshadows the love story of ""Amelie""). Just neglect the unremitting clamor of the film's critics (they criticize this movie heavily because Keira Knightley's in it and for the plot's ""shallowness""). Every facet of this movie is truly extraordinary: the story, the performances, the direction, the art direction, the score and the cinematography. I could go on praising this Hollywood gem for years.It tells us about the tragic love affair between Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and their gardener, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Their liaisons were later torn apart by a testimony coming from Cecilia's young jealous sister, Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), falsely accusing Robbie as a ""sex maniac."" Robbie was arrested and was sent to the army, leaving Cecilia behind, crying over their love's ill fate. Their three-way tale kept on rolling over the years, until Briony on her late teens (Romola Garai) realized what mishap she has caused.It's about a lie which severed multiple relationship ties. It speaks of how the mishandling of words can lead to chaos, and how tough it is to accept your wrongdoings and take those words back. I loved how the three Brionies (Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave) delivered those crucial few words of wisdom. I love Ian McEwan (author of the novel this film was based on) for shining the light on that maxim.Saoirse Ronan undoubtedly has delivered the best performance among the acting ensemble, which rightfully earned her an Academy Award nomination. Meanwhile, Keira Knightley keeps on irritating me with her perfectly shaped jawline and that accent of hers, but thank God, her performance did not ruin the entire film (unlike what she did on all the three ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" installments). James McAvoy was great in his role. I cannot imagine where would this movie go without him. It's a pity that he wasn't recognized that much.Joe Wright's camera-work is reminiscent of Olivier Dahan's direction in La Vie En Rose, and I admire him for that. We owe the movie's big hit in the box office to him and his directing prowess. His long shot on the Dunkirk beach is something that every movie buff should see, also for its wonderful cinematography and the set design.The original score of Dario Marianelli was too much like Philip Glass' score on ""The Hours."" But if we should compare the two, Marianelli's would come out as the better one, hands down. It was Marianelli's score which kept me awake throughout the course of the film (romance/war movies easily puts me to sleep) and it also glued my eyes to the screen. The tone's generally hyper, it grows even more tense whenever the plot arrives at one of its climaxes, and it practically enlivens any scene which lacks some vivacity.With Joe Wright's direction, Saoirse Ronan's powerful execution of her role and Dario Marianelli's compelling score combined, ATONEMENT is a film that you seriously wouldn't want to miss.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Overrated is an understatement,"You know what, something must be very rotten in Hollywood these days when the likes of Michael Clayton, No Country for Old Man and Atonement are getting nominations and awards. Unless ""There Will be Blood"" (which I haven't seen yet) is the intelligent, well directed epic I expect it to be, I sure hope that the above mentioned average-at-best flicks will be deservingly dwarfed at this years Oscars by the unlikely hero Juno turned out to be.Now, don't get me wrong, I just love epic melodrama and I'm also a sucker for Merchant-Ivory, and, well, anything that contains a half-decent love story, beautiful photography, British and French landscapes and sexy British upper crust accents. And yes, I can even tolerate a bit of shallowness if the listed-above compensates in sufficient amounts. But what really annoys me (in any genre) is blatant pretentiousness.This film oozes egomania. The direction is snobbish in a way that the director seems to be more interested in proving his ""ingenuity"" than in telling the story. And truth be told, there's not much story to tell. After the interesting, yet not less annoying first 45 minutes comes the stupidest waste of money I have seen in a long while. The complicated 5 minute shot that everybody's heard about even before the movie came out - huge disappointment. And you know what - Hitchcock's been there. Spielberg's been there. De Palma's been there. Now, if you have nothing new or interesting to say about it - get out or you can surely expect to be humiliated by your incompetence compared to the masters. But no! This director (known only for the single stupider period piece than this one - the lousiest adaptation of Pride and Prejudice ever) had huge appetites to satisfy. And hence - we are served with a boring, pretentious, overly stylized shot of what a coast in WWII France never looked like and the disillusioning effect created by McAavoy leaving the shot from time to time that should never happen if you expect your audience to be drawn in the movie and sympathize with the hero.McCavoy is a great actor and we can surely expect great things from him in the future. But, hello, will the industry get over Keira Knightly already?! That woman is no actress. All she can do is pout her lips and strike a pose. The supporting cast is better than the leads, the photography is great, music is just fine, but, at the end of the day, who cares? If you do a love story and fail to engage the audience, fail to make them root for the couple in trouble, you failed period. We shouldn't reward movies for their redeeming qualities but as accomplishments as a whole.Go Juno!",3.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Atonement,"Atonement is utterly breath taking. Theirs this intensity in the movie that makes you think your there and makes you want to cry. Robbie and Cee love is eternal and the fact that she was acting stubborn proves shes lying to herself about loving him.

If you haven't seen this movie I recommend it 100% and better yet read the novel as well. Some people told me they thought this movie was boring""wtf"" okay lol its only boring to those that like fast pace non stop action.

Great British story,"First of all, a comment on style. Atonement ticks all the boxes in Britishness. You cannot but love the mannerisms, the photography and the dialogue. A classy film only Brits can do.Then, it's the acting. Although all performances are great, there are two performances that stand above the rest. James McAvoy and Saoirse Ronan. Sometimes characters define the actors, but these two actually redefined their characters. Keira is undoubtedly stunning and lovable and she did indeed great, but she's overshadowed by the sheer quality of the other two. From the other two Brionys, Vanessa Redgrave shows what an excellent actress she is by perfectly mimicking the posture, gestures and talk of little Saoirse, while Romola Garai unfortunately was not such a good fit (and it seems this is mainly a casting error).Finally, the story is very well told and while the movie may leave a sad taste, it is actually a proof of its strength. This is what good movies do. They have the capability to imprint sentiments to the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of the best productions in recent years,"Should I have read the book before seeing this movie? Not necessarily of course but in the case of ""Atonement"" it was certainly an advantage as I asked myself how the richness of the vocabulary, the suggestive delicacy of the verbally painted pictures and the intricate pattern of the relationships between the various characters would be rendered on the screen. The answer to these intriguing questions is not difficult at all: the cinematographic version has come as close to the original literary work as one can possibly get. The author, Ian McEwan, always excels in depicting life as it was in England in the early 20th century with its restraining formalism, hypocrisy and a numbing form of awkwardness that often lead to a lasting form of tragedy. All these elements are constantly present throughout the movie and together with the excellent acting, the captivating images of landscapes and the camera's keen eye for detail, one cannot but acclaim ""Atonement"" as one of the best productions in recent years.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
An act of malice leaves a bitter legacy,"Occasionally a movie comes along that leaves you with a great feeling of satisfaction. This movie has the layered effect of a modern novel, looking at life's events from the perspective of time and drawing them together In a way that gives some sort of closure. There is no way to change the past; we can look back with remorse but admitting the truth is the right way to deal with the human cost.Let it be said that the first 30 minutes are slow-going but this background is necessary to understand the story that follows. Pay attention to the perspective of the young people whose lives will quickly unfold and unravel after the initial scenes take place.The movie gives us images of great beauty, childhood fantasies, grotesque scenes of war, actual newsreel footage and a sad incident that haunts the main characters for the rest of their lives.British cinema and literature often deal with the underdog but not in the Frank Capra tradition of happy endings. This alternative tradition says that life can be mean and unfair, don't gloss it over with fairy tales cloaked in patriotism and heroism. This movie delivers that message in a fine piece of film-making by director Joe Wright.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Fantastic film!,"I just saw this film last night at a test screening in Chicago, and I must say that it was fantastic. The visuals and acting are both superb. The story is absolutely devastating, though there are quite a few bright spots. I really felt for all of the characters. There is one absolutely fantastic shot that goes on for nearly 10 minutes of Robbie walking around a British army camp. It really made you realize the absolute devastation that Europe was enduring. The scenes in the hospital are just as devastating. I more than likely will see this film again, not just because I am a fan of Keira Knightley and James McAvoy, but because it was a really high quality film. I highly recommend seeing this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Expansion,"Atonement starts at a great English country house on a hot summer day before the Second World War. It speaks of the attraction between two young Cambridge graduates, Cecily Tallis (Keira Knightley) and Robbie Turner (James McAvoy). Despite their shared educational background, Cecily is upper class (her family owns the great house) and Robbie is the son of one of the family's servants, and out of this disparity comes a remarkable and rather tragic story in the novel by Ian McEwan which Joe Wrightwho directed Ms. Knightley in Pride and Prejudiceworking this time from a screenplay by the skillful Christopher Hampton, has made into an impressive movie.The trouble with a movie that's a literary adaptation is that you may have read the book, especially when the book is as good as Atonement. Ian McEwan may not be a great writer but he's certainly a very good one. He writes delicious, intelligent sentences and with them tells surprising, quietly bold tales. The best film adaptation of a McEwan novel is Andrew Birkin's The Cement Garden. The Cement Garden, it's worth noting, is haunting and strange and touches on one of the most ancient of taboos, but as a story it's simple in its basic elements. Atonement is many-leveled and far grander and more emotionally fraught, encompassing as it does the decline of a ruling class and a great war and themes of sex and love and class and the danger of ignorance and the capacity of literature to redeem a lifeor not. Filming this novel is an ambitious task.McEwan's Atonement is a particularly dangerous novel to film because it's so easy to make the details overblown and lose the essence of the thing. This is what Joe Wright has done. He's still produced a beautiful, occasionally engaging and involving (but sometimes fatiguing) movie replete with moments of shock and sorrow and grandeur. But the book wasn't about wounded troops massed on the beach or an Underground tunnel being floodedthough these are among the more memorable images of the film. McEwan's Atonement really isn't about the grandeur of pre-War upper class English country life--whose details are just sketched in deftly by the novelist while he focuses on the emotions, the suspicions, the doubts, the passions. Nor, as one reads McEwan's novel, does one hear in one's mind the sound of large string orchestra playing with an incessant overlay of a loudly clacking typewriter. But in the film one never gets away from that. This is one of the reasons that novels about or from any period are timeless: the period trappings don't overwhelm, because we don't have to see them.As Henry Green wrote, ""Prose is not to be read aloud but to oneself alone at night, and it is not quick as poetry but rather a gathering web of insinuations ... Prose should be a long intimacy between strangers with no direct appeal to what both may have known. It should slowly appeal to feelings unexpressed, it should in the end draw tears out of the stone ...""Atonement, the novel, is about the mistake of a naïve, willful, dangerously over-imaginative girl that plays into the class prejudices of a great English family and ruins several lives. These are events that at various points you really cannot stage at all. They're things you have to tell aboutor rather, hint at, and make the audience think about. Where the book is delicateyet disturbingtears from the stonethe movie is more operatic, and not always opera of the highest order. It may be Merchant-Ivory or Masterpiece Theater, but it's not Brideshead Revisited. As Beresford-Howe said in Film Threat, ""Imagine if the team that made The English Patient tried to make the same kind of movie, with even more brave-lads-fighting-the-Jerries porn and this time with Extra Added English country manor porn, and without really good actors, and this movie is what you'd have."" This is the sad truth. One wants to like Knightley and McAvoy and they've been excellent in other roles, but they aren't quite up to their jobs this time, and neither are the two young women who play the younger sister Briony, Saoirse Roman as the eleven-year-old girl who makes the false accusations, and Romola Garai as the repentant eighteen-year-old. Briony is central. She needs to be infuriating, yet sympatheticwhich isn't so easy, and neither actress quite has those qualities. There is a great actress at the end in Vanessa Redgrave, with her immense authority and wisdom, as the aged, soon-to-die Briony, who appears in one speech to a TV interviewer about her latest, and last novel, which is called Atonement. But this is just last-minute exposition and since the message is one of failure and quiet despair, it's not the grand finale the elaborately staged scenes have led one to expect. Too much of the movie's time is thrown away on great paneled hallways and country house lawns, bright lipstick, period hairdos, silk blouses, little boys talking as little English boys no longer do, and haggard battle scenes that could as well be of the First World War as the Second.I don't side with those who think the vast scene of troops on the beach is a mere tour de force without emotion. Well, maybe it is, but it's still the most mesmerizing sequence in the movieperhaps it's involving because we don't know where it's going to go. And ultimately, pointless or not, the post-battle sequences are the closest thing we get to an objective correlative for the human tragedy the young girl has wrought. Other scenes, which can be evoked in a few lines in the novel, are so elaborately staged they overwhelm the ideas McEwan meant to evoke. We don't need to see that Underground flood. It's far more affecting just to learn what happened without seeing it. McEwan's novel isn't perfect, it's too manipulative, but it's a better story.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A movie that lets you have your own opinion about the film! and for me it was AMAZING!,"First off, i have to say, that people who thought this movie is terrible, is wrong! Im not saying they cant have there own opinion because thats what movies are all about, but they need to really sit down and watch this movie again, because it really gives you a scene of love, and Atonement.Second, for me loving movies, and wanting to be a director some day, i thought that this movies was so ravishing and spectacular, the Director really out did himself in this film. Although, i was worried at first because I saw Pride and Prejudice right after i read the book and was really disappointment. That was one of the only reason that i had from seeing the movie, but when my friend forced me to go see it, i had no objection, since it seemed amazing in the preview! the first 10 minutes of the film i was drawn! I love how they showed the girl as a writer, showed you how creative she is, and foreshadowing for later in the film. Also, the second i saw Keira Knightley and James McAvoy first hit the screen and looked at each other i saw the chemistry right away.I don't want to go off about the film, because this film you need ever aspect of it to understand, and i don't want to ruin it for others.For me, i loved how the director didn't rush into things and got the main point of the book out there. And yes there was a lot of scenery, but if you look closely into to film, you get the love and passion that the 2 lovers wanted and needed.I recommend that everyone see this film, and make your own opinion of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Love Between a Man and a Woman!,"Focus Features has finally gotten it straight in this excellent movie; showing love between a man and a woman. A fine story it is, one of the few films of 2007 aimed at the adult (over 12) audience. Fresh and original, what more could we ask for? Keira Knightly is always a sight to behold. At 5'7"" with super slender model looks, I don't think she has a single fat cell in her body. Any man who's actually held a girl like this will never again settle for the Playboy centerfold stereotype. Her acting is also excellent.During 2007, intelligent moviegoers had little to choose from. ""Eastern Promises"" was great, as was ""Juno."" But then there was ""No Country For Old Men"" -- a slasher flick for pseudo-intellectual empty-heads and the stupidest movie of 2007. ""No Country"" was pretty well rejected at the box office, but the mental midgets are still trying to peddle it via the Oscars. Don't fall for it! See ""Atonement"" and choose quality.We took the trouble to see ""Atonement"" in a real theater, not a multiplex; the Senator in Baltimore. Big auditorium, big screen.

Atonement,"The trailers were interesting. The star cast was stunning. The reviews were fantastic. The photography seemed perfect. This all lead me to see the movie  despite the fact that my boss  when asked how is Atonement  after a 5 second pause  said, um.meaning  not so good.The story is set around the decade of world war II. Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan), jealous of her sister Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) love affair with Robbie Turner (James McAvoy); accuses Robbie of being a sexual perverse and raping her friend. Robbie is sent to prison and after 5 years, sent to serve the army in WWII. Grown up Briony (Romola Garai), serving as a nurse, despairs her lies and as part of atonement apologies to Robbie and sister Cecilia, but it is too late for Cecilia and Robbie to unite.The movie is based on the popular novel written by Ian McEwan by the same name. The adaptation is synched in four parts  the first part of summer where Briony falsely accuses Robbie, the second part of WWII - Robbie serving the army, the third part of nursing  and atonement of Briony; and the fourth and final part of Briony's interview of the autobiographical novel.The first part winds up slowly  as slowly as the British rural summers. It is wonderfully shot and as audience, one gets the feel of the real summer. This part is the most interesting because of the romance between Robbie and Cecilia. The army part of heavily funded and created, but is loose and does not build up the interest. While the nursing part is slowly un-winding of the mind of Briony, who recognizes and waits for her atonement.I liked the first part the most. James McAvoy is the best thing in the movie, he brings to himself  so easily the boyish charm, and the vulnerability of an accused man, that his performance is worth noticing. One more cap after The Last King of Scotland. Keira Knightley has acted very well, but what on earth she has become? Like a walking stick  just bone and sticking flesh? Uh..what the world has come to be, defining her as the most sexiest and beautiful women. People must be really mad, and out of their minds.The role of Briony was the strongest and is the 13 year old Saoirse Ronan renders with great punch and epoch, while the grown up role by Romola Garai  even though having depth, does not touch you or does not even leave an impression. A lot remained in the part three of the movie.The best parts of the movie were the cinematography by Seamus Greenwood and the musical score by Dario Marianelli, which was near to brilliant  especially the type writers strokes and that turning into music, with a slight synch with the character's tap of fingers or crossing of door. Brilliant! But overall movie experience, it leaves a lot more to be desired. Director Jeo Wright could have made it a much better movie, with the amount of talent and money available to him. Jeo was too detailed in dwelling into the era of three parts and missed out on the gripping narration.A chance of good movie lost, but not that bad.(Stars 5.5 out of 10)",5.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Pretentious Mess,"At the outset I will state that I did not like the novel on which this movie is based. It's not that I don't like the work of Ian MacEwan - I loved ""Saturday"" - but to my dread, the novel which I thought shallow to begin with was made into an even shallower movie.I wasn't going to bother seeing it at all, but did on the recommendations of many friends who literally raved about it. Particularly the scenes of the war and old London.There was literally no chemistry between the two leads and the direction of ""lunge and thrust"" in a key love scene repels rather than engages. I find Keira Knightly affected in the extreme, her pouty lips and chopped off sentences did not engage sympathy. She seemed alienated from everyone.I was in a small mature audience at the screening and there was a lot of laughter at what should have been emotional scenes which again detracted from any investment in the film itself.The story is cliché ridden and I thought, several times, it would have done better in more sensitive hands. I found the direction choppy and frantic. The timeline moves back and forth with no valid reasoning behind it apart from fooling the audience.The war scenes are well done and would have worked better in another movie entirely. I found them ghostly and surreal, particularly the singing, the shooting of the horses, etc.I beg the question: why are so many nominated movies so dismally awful this year? ""Atonement"" I found completely overrated, there was literally no sublety (in a movie that begged for it) and the characters were all distant, not one of them got my sympathy. Possibly it might have worked a lot better as a mini-series, the time frame of the film itself was too short to explore the back story of each key character and particularly the key feature of the love between Ce and Robbie. Was it simply lust? The basic story revolved around Briony (Saoirse Ronan) who is that beloved child of British movies, - a precocious, pretentious, self-absorbed writer. She reads a letter sent by the medical student son Robby, (James McAvoy) of the family housekeeper, to Briony's older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley). Subsequently she witnesses scenes between them and a scene between a house-guest and a young girl and invents a story that puts the kybosh on the blossoming romance and sends our hero to jail and then off to war.Some of the more mawkish scenes involve his attempts to re-unite with Cecilia. Cecilia, meanwhile, keeps her passion intact by abandoning her family to work as a waitress and waiting patiently for Robby.There it is, I won't spoil the rest. Suffice to say it is a melodrama of a type of movie that were best done in the 1920's but best left alone in the twenty first century.2 out of 10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

Beautiful characterization and narration,"In the 1930s English countryside, young Briony, an aspired writer with great imagination, just added the final touches to her first ever play. She waits for her cousins' arrival to stage it with them and show it to her family, including her older sister Cecilia, and house employees. However, she is mostly exited to show it to Robbie, the house gardener, for whom she has developed a crush on. Briony is unaware that Robbie's heart is already taken by Cecilia, who reciprocates the feelings. Their relationship successfully remains a secret to everyone until one day a particular incident crashes the peaceful days of the Tallis household and triggers a series of events that will leave consequent scars on the characters.The movie is a two-hour long flashback seen at most times from the point of view of Briony, that we see growing from a young, naïve and selfish 13-year-old girl, to a more mature young women, and finally to a wise but regretful old lady. Everything within the plot revolves around the mistakes Briony has committed when she was younger and how she needs to understand them and to cope with their consequences as an adult, taking her on a journey towards personal development. The purity of Robbie and Cecilia's love is also very touching. Moreover, the way the movie is filmed is esthetically breathtaking, with a lot of beautiful and complex shots such as the Dunkirk beach one take scene. If the original soundtrack of Atonement won an Oscar it is also for a reason. Indeed, the music fits extremely well with each scenes of the movie and truly brings it to life. Some very well composed tracks include one of the first of the film which is made using the noises of Robbie's typing machine, and the long track which accompanies him during the Dunkirk scene and manages to this scene all its power. Finally, what also truly makes this movie worthwhile is the final twist, along with the very emotionally packed final scene. 
Atonement is therefore a very well executed movie whose beauty and uniqueness rests on its narration, its twist and turns, its complex characters and their development, its breathtaking cinematography and its original soundtrack. I highly recommend this movie to everyone but beware of some hard topics that are evoked in it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
The perfect Atonement.,"A quite faithful adaptation of Ian McEwan's most acclaimed novel Atonement. Christopher Hampton took the liberty to make some changes but they did not, in any way, affect the story and its tragic beauty. The direction and cinematography are out of the world! Joe Wright used his camera to perfectly communicate the unspoken words and the emotional intensity of the events to the audience. I felt totally absorbed in the scenes. Both Wright and Hampton managed to overcome the difficulty of turning words into visuals, especially when it comes to a novel that mainly deals with inner thoughts and personal perspectives.Although I am not a big fan of either Keira Knightley or James McAvoy, I have to admit that their natural presence on the screen breathed more life into the story. Moreover, Saoirse Ronan's mature performance as the young Briony foreshadows a great talent in the making.I also fell in love with the music score from the very first ten minutes!

A vibrant epic,"Jealousy and lie are part of almost all romantic tragedies, but the conclusion is that Atonement has carved out a niche for itself. Based on the popular novel of the same name, which swept many critical applauds; its movie version also manages to make audiences around to attach themselves with the character. The story of a lie, that dramatically changed the lives of people around it, will take you across a decade of human tragedy in Europe and the personal tragedy of the three protagonists. The strong performances by the all star cast lead by Robbie McCoy and Keira knightly adds luster to the already formidable written work. But a word of praise cannot be missed for the young Miss Ronan playing the character of young Briony Tallis. Her striking eyes and facial expression showing range of emotions along with a tinge of innocence shadows over every other performing artist in the rather long first act of the movie.The story unfolds during the beginning of the 2nd world war in a large English estate of the Tallis family. The family includes a rather stressed mother along with two daughters, played by kiera knightly (elder) who is busy with her awkward attraction for the servant's boy Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) who has a hidden love for Cecilia Tallis (Keira). Little does he know that his harmless show of his desires for Cecilia would turn his life upside down? And off course the young Miss Saoirse Ronan's character Briony Tallis, which in the next two acts of the story, set in separate periods of her life, is played by two other actresses. In Cecilia's own words, Briony has a fanciful imagination, which threatens to destroy everything around her. Not that briony is a spoilt rich child, but she is innocent and also has feelings for Robbie, which creates a jealous trait as she witnesses Robbie locked passionately with her elder sister before a dinner gathering of her family to celebrate the arrival of the two sister's brother along with his friend, who has a rather questionable character features. As that particular dines begins, an untoward chain of events begins to roll, which leads to Briony witnessing a forceful sexual act over her visiting cousin in pitch black darkness by a unknown person. But as the entire days events take a toll over Briony she concludes that Robbie is the guilty person. Her one false claims leads to Robbie being imprisoned for four years and then later driven into France to fight the war. Knightely abandons her family and leaves for London to serve in the war as a nurse, while keeping her relationship with Robbie alive. As Briony grows up, she starts to get the feel of the consequences of her is mistake.What transpires in the next acts of the film is the atonement Briony tries to find for her deeds. The movie moves along in swift pace after the first act. Miss Knightly do not have much of dialogues in the film, she rather makes an efficient use of her expressive face. Robbie holds himself and the movie strongly in many mono acts during his time in war. As mentioned earlier Briony played by young Ronan goes away with most applauds, while the other two actresses have very little space to evolve as they just end up taking leads from Miss Ronan. It is not just the three strong characters that make this movie worth watch, it is also the cinematography of the film especially prolong sequence of the Dunkirk evacuation which catches the audience breathless. In the end the movie does not deviate from its subject and concludes exactly like the fanciful imagination of Briony Tallis with reality firmly places around it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A tale of love lost and never found,"A good adaptation of a British novel.

And, her misinterpretation of a series of events which changes the course of all three of their lives. The visuals of the movie depicting the country-side are very pleasing.

So, watch out for it. The highlight of the movie is its last thirty-forty minutes.

Fails to completely engage,"When thirteen-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan) stumbles upon her older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) being embraced by the housekeeper's son Robbie Turner (James McAvoy) in the library of their country estate, it sets off a chain of events that alters the lives of every member of the family for years to come. Set in the English countryside in 1935 and based on the novel by Ian McEwen, Atonement is a tale of jealousy, betrayal, and the consequences of a lie. An epic of the doomed romantic genre, the film works hard to impress and has a few inspired moments but ultimately fails to completely engage. While it touches on class distinctions, it does not explore them in any depth and, though Cecilia seems somewhat more liberated than the rest of the stuffy clan, most characters are wooden and never come fully alive.Briony, in an Oscar nominated performance by Ronan, is a talented writer who writes her own stories and plays, and has a crush on Robbie. She even jumps into a pool of water to test whether or not he will rescue her but the incident only creates resentment that boils beneath the surface. Her discovery of an obscene letter written to Cecilia by Robbie intended as a letter of apology frightens and confuses the young girl, though the letter allows Cecilia to realize for the first time that she is in love with Robbie. Awaiting the opportunity to present one of her plays at a family gathering that includes new arrivals brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) and his friend Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch), a wealthy heir of a chocolatier, she sees her sister and Robbie embracing. Letting her fears run rampant, she accuses Robbie of assaulting her young cousin Lola (Juno Temple) and the repercussions of her lie are immediate and far reaching.On the flimsy and uncorroborated testimony of a thirteen-year old girl, Robbie is sent to prison and the two lovers separated at their most vulnerable time. Neither Briony nor Lola nor the real perpetrator ever makes a move to correct the injustice and neither seems to feel much remorse. Eventually Robbie is allowed to join the British Army as a World War II private while Cecilia becomes a nurse in the war effort. Before his unit deploys, the two lovers meet in London to rekindle their short-lived affair and she tells him that she left her family in disgust and tells him that she will always love him.What was fully involving in the first half hour becomes a chore in the middle however, as the film loses its momentum and the promise of its exciting beginning becomes a lost opportunity. As Robbie waits at Dunkirk for a ship to bring him home, Briony, now a young adult, becomes a nurse caring for soldiers wounded in the war, hoping in some small way to atone for the havoc caused by her lie. Many years later, as a successful novelist, she uses the power of fiction to try and make amends but her guilt is not convincing and there is ultimately little catharsis either for herself or the audience.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"

What a movie should be!,"I was handed the book by my teacher for my higher English exam and fell in love with the story then. So obviously I was wary of it being turned into a film, not just because it was one of my favourite books but because I knew it inside out.Films are never going to be exactly like a book as they are two completely different ways of telling a story. This film is such a good adaptation; i love the film as much as i love the book. All actors suit the roles perfectly. And the feel of the book is not lost. The first third is meant to be a little faster paced, as it quickly leads up to Brionys accusation. The last two thirds are how each person has been affected, so are a little slower; these lead up to the last scene when Briony is an elderly lady.It is a beautiful and moving story and the film has captured this. The long scene on the beach is a fantastic idea as it gives the viewer an idea of just how big and overwhelming the evacuation was. The jumping between different characters and different years was done brilliantly too.

One of my favorite movies of the last 10 years.,"""Yes. I saw him. I saw him with my own eyes.""It's past time I wrote a proper review for Atonement, as it's am excellent movie in all aspects and a personal favorite of mine.I'm quite the fan of Joe Wright. He's talented enough to make Pride & Prejudice into a movie that both guys and girls could enjoy, and pairing him with Keira Knightley again for another historical piece is basically a guarantee for success. The man knows how to craft a good drama.The first thing I love about Atonement is the cinematography. From the opening portions in the beautiful English countryside, to wartime London and the British evacuation at Dunkirk, this is a startlingly beautiful movie. Not a moment passes by without something eye-catching in the frame. From the settings to the costumes, it's a cinematic showcase.Second, the cast is outstanding. This was the movie that made Keira Knightley one of my five favorite current actresses, and made me a fan of James McAvoy. It was also the movie that proved that Saoirse Ronan is easily the best actress of her age. All three actresses who played Briony at different ages were good, but Ronan had the task of defining the character for the other two women, as well as the most challenging role in the movie. Her Academy Award nomination was completely deserved, especially for one so young.Third, this is an excellent adaptation of an excellent book. It's a movie that easily could have seemed disjointed because of the way it switches time periods, settings, and tone, but every part of it works and flows together. The changes from period drama to war film and back to drama are pulled off flawlessly.So yeah, I think very highly of Atonement. Any time a movie takes a genre that I'm not a huge fan of and MAKES me a huge fan, I'm impressed. It has something for almost everyone, and it's just a well-crafted film. Check it out, even if this kind of thing isn't normally to your taste.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
A disappointment,"Unnecessarily confusing and poorly structured even though it had to have flashbacks for its Rashomon-like storytelling; this decade's 'trend' away from the chronological seems designed to hide flaws. The film's plot is really fairly simple, so the director and editor had to give far too much screen-time to certain scenes in an attempt to gloss over this fact (cinematography over substance). For example, the scene when McAvoy's character is struggling to find the right words while typing his apology, which is interspersed with Knightley's endless smoking, is excruciatingly slow. Instead of spending so much time with this point, how about letting us in on how his character received the wound to his chest? Also, while the Dunkirk sequence is an impressive technical accomplishment, it drags on almost dizzyingly and seems as if it were designed to lend a more serious subtext to the otherwise flimsy story. Along these lines, the filmmakers felt it necessary to add gratuitous hospital shots of the war wounded (and, earlier, used that ""most horrible word in the world""). Of course, you have to credit them for using Vanessa Redgrave in the Titanic-like Gloria Stuart denouement, which wraps the whole thing in a prettier package than its contents.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
One of the best British films in many years,"This film is an instant classic, as everyone fully realizes. However, people should not be making such a fuss about James McAvoy and Keira Knightley, just because they played the romantic leads in the film, which of course they did very well indeed. There are easily a hundred actors and actresses who could have done just as well in these two undemanding parts (what is easier than to gaze longingly at someone? I do it every day at my wife, and no one has given me an Oscar yet, perhaps because I am not actually acting), and the idea that Keira Knightley should have won a Bafta or an Oscar rather than Marion Cotillard is absurd (and thank goodness she didn't, and that sheer genius was rewarded). But that said, this film contains some truly spectacular performances which made the film a success. The first is that of the thirteen year-old Saoirse Ronan, who in the story commits the terrible act for which no atonement is possible. She well deserved her Oscar, Bafta, and Golden Globe nominations. Without her, the film could have been tepid, as its core would have been weak. The other amazing performance is by that genius for all seasons, Vanessa Redgrave, whose appearance at the end makes the whole film click into perfection. There are excellent supporting efforts from Harriet Walter (fancy her dressed as Radclyffe Hall, whatever next, I ask you?), Juno Temple, fresh from her success in 'Notes on a Scandal' (maybe she wants to become a screen goddess now, having become bored with being only a Roman one), and frankly, all the others. Having achieved such a triumph, it seems pointless to repeat all the well-deserved praise which has been lavished on this powerful film which has burnt its way into the hearts of thousands with its searing story of remorse. Ian McEwan's story, Joe Wright's direction, and Christopher Hampton's wonderful script, have combined with the whole cast and crew to make a masterpiece.

Some people left the audience after this and the library scene.While the cinematography was beautiful in parts, there remain aspects of the movie I have yet to understand: The French soldier speaking to Briony in the hospital, the beach scene with the soldiers, and others.

I can't give it a perfect ten because I'm not the sharpest tool in the shed and there were far too many twists for me to keep track of. I still have too many questions. (Maybe that's WHY some people would give it a perfect ten) it is a heartbreaking film but I feel also a misunderstood one. When you're my age (34) and a movie revolves around a 13 year old with an unreliable narrative, you know this Isn't going to go well but you also know SHE'S 13! Without spoiling the film, some events happen prior to Briony falsely accusing Robbie of rape that aren't exactly outside the realms of possibility of someone that WOULD commit rape. It's not impossible for a young impressionable child to deduce this from prior events. I had a lot of pre conceived notions before seeing this film. Every time this movie is mentioned, Briony is referred to as practically the worst villain in the cinematic universe. Having seen the film myself now, I think we need to go easier on her. She repents (atones, as the film IS called 'atonement') but it's too late in a twist I won't spoil for you. Your heart breaks for the fate of the characters yes, but your heart breaks for the young girl who (understandably) never had the courage to come forward with the real story until she was an old lady too. Or at least mine did.My one gripe with the film is we never resolve once we do find out who did commit the crime and to whom, and in fact a little bit of logic would have told you who committed the crime based on who was missing that night, but I guess they weren't the point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
No Atonement,"The first half of ""Atonement"" is so deadly slow and dreary, in spite of the spectacular cinematography of Seamus McGarvey. However, the ending captivated and blew me away. Vanessa Redgrave surprises as an old Briony, now near the end of her days, talking about her latest and final novelan autobiographical story. She confesses, ""I don't expect to be forgiven."" The touching irony of Director Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" is that it is not. Briony may have spent her entire adult life in penance for what she did when she was 13 years old, but ultimately she may not be forgiven. Director Wright and Screenwriter Tim Bevan (who adapted Ian McEwan's novel) tell a story of star-crossed love and profound sadness. I really liked ""Atonement"" more than I thought I would. I truly admired the craft of the movie more than the touching tragedy. Personal preference aside, ""Atonement"" is a great movie.It is 1935 England before World War II. We observe the world of upper middle class England. Precocious 13 year old Briony Tallis (Saoire Ronan) fancies herself a play writer. Her beautiful older sister Cecilia (Keira Knightley) battles her raging hormones. She has a physical attraction for Robbie (James McAvoy), the son of the Tallis' maid. Robbie is the estate handyman. Briony too, has an unrequited crush on handsome Robbie. The Tallis' have house guests in the Quincey children, Lola (Juno Temple) and her brothers Jackson and Pierrot. Briony and Cecilia's older brother Leon (Patrick Kennedy) returns home from school with his bud Paul (Benedict Cumberbatch)a creepy young chap.Briony spies Cecilia with Robbie in a compromising situation by the estate fountain. Robbie gives Briony an accidentally enclosed letter for Cecilia, which she secretly reads before giving to her sister. Robbie (McAvoy) and Cecilia (Knightley) engage in a totally steamy and erotic tryst in the family library, which Briony witnesses. Then during a family crisis, Briony (Ronan) perpetrates a lie that sends Robbie to prison, and Cecilia is irrevocably separated from her true love. Though only 13 years old, Briony does not realize that her lies may have destroyed true love and more importantly the lives of people she loves.Now 5 years later, Robbie is in France in the middle of World War II. Cecilia has left home and has become a nurse. 18 year old Briony (Romola Garai) has decided to leave Cambridge to become a nurse like her sister. This is her attempt to reconcile with Cecilia. What echoes throughout ""Atonement"" is Knightley's plea to McAvoy's Robbie, ""Come back Come back to me."" ""Atonement"" is punctuated by profound yearning of the heart, and resounding sadness. Keira Knightley is sexy, amazingly strong, and movingly vulnerable. James McAvoy is compelling and compassionate throughout. He embodies nobility in Robbie's suffering soul. The surprise is Romola Garai as the older Briony. She is amazing as Briony begins to realize the pain and suffering she caused by her lie years ago. Vanessa Redgrave is powerful and sad as the old Briony, spent by a life in penance.Joe Wright's ""Atonement"" is touchingly sad. Life ends, and at best that life ends complete. However, we can not always expect to be forgiven for our misdeeds and unintended cruelties. So perhaps, the best we can do is be at peace with life being incomplete. There is no atonement in ""Atonement"", and that may have been the point of Wright's passionately moving story.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Deep and Dark Love Story,"Every once in a while or perhaps every year there comes your usual epic love story. What I loved about this one is that it doesn't play like an epic. Here is a story that is about making amends and a love that was so strong it became an individual's redemption. The film opens in London circa 1935: 13-year old Briony Tallis (Saoirse Ronan, who can break your heart with those eyes) is a blossoming writer who one day misinterprets a series of events that occur between the affair of her older and determined sister, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightely) and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy, a pure hearted leading man). But one night, Briony accuses Robbie of a horrible crime he did not commit and is condemned for. Five years later, the love between Cecilia and Robbie is as strong as ever and they correspond while he fights the second world war. Meanwhile, Briony grows older (Romola Garai, an true star in the making) and realizes the mistake she made, but can she make things right again? The film lapses between the points of view of the sisters and Robbie as they go through their own struggles between the war and the home front. This film is definitely worth seeing and on my top ten favorites of 2007.",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
"Brilliant adaptation, astonishing masterpiece","Atonement is the most recognized film to date by director Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice). Set in Britain in the time before and during the Second World War, Atonement comes across as a story about guilt, love and chaos.Bryone Tallis, a 13 year old girl comes to realize that she may have reached the end of her childhood. However she still lives according to her imagination. One night she sees her older sister, Cecilia and her childhood friend, Robbie, together in the library and after reading a forbidden letter, Bryone's naive mind leads her to take the wrong conclusions. When her cousin is attacked, Bryone accuses Robbie and that decision changes the family's lives forever. Robbie is forced to fight in the war, Cecilia becomes a nurse and gets away from her family and Bryone chooses to do the same over going to Cambridge and has to live with her crime for the rest of her life.This film deserved all the acclamation it received. It's one of the most brilliant adaptations in recent cinema history. It's very faithful to the novel, which is not an easy task since a lot of it is developed inside the character's minds. The director found a very ingenious way of translating this aspect to screen: the soundtrack. During the course of the film, we don't ever hear any thoughts, but we know exactly how the characters feel and that's due to the brilliantly placed music. The casting is almost flawless. Most of the characters are very truthful to their description on the novel, and some great performances make them very close emotionally to the novel. The only exception goes to Keira Knightley and her approach to Cecilia. In the book, she is warm, nice and caring, which is a contrast to the cold and snobbish woman we see on screen. She is the worst miscast. On the other hand, James McAvoy gives a spellbinding performance as Robbie, and the actresses playing Bryone do a wonderful job. The veteran Vanessa Redgrave captures perfectly the quiet desperation the character feels towards the end of her life. Another great achievement is the visuals of the film. The scene on the beach where Robbie and two of his fellow soldiers are walking among all the chaos is astonishing, as it's how closely they managed to portrait Bryone at all stages of her life.Overall, Atonement is no less than a masterpiece. It works as a brilliant adaptation, but it also stands on its own. It's impossible not to be affected at some degree by the film, whether it's for its love story,the chaos of the war or the desperation of guilt. Although it didn't have a place at the Oscars, it will certainly be a reference in the coming years.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Deserves its empty cinema,"I went to see this at the local multiplex yesterday.There were only about 20 others in the cinema with me.We should have found a better way to spend the afternoon.It was a dreadful bore with startling inattention to detail.For example we were told that the film started in the summer of 1935.Then we were told after an hour that it was 4 years later and we were with the BEF in France,bit of a mistake there since it should have been 5 years.Dunkirk was then shown to be a cross between Dantes Inferno and the Battle of Stalingrad.No organisation and soldiers going to see Jean Gabin and Arletty in a film in a cinema on the beach.Given the fact that this film could not even outdraw Run Fatboy Run at the box office it looks as if there is little chance that this film will make back its money.So my advice is save your money and time unless you are in need of 2 hours sleep.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Touching. The romantic drama perfection.,"Atonement is the second movie which Brenda Blethyn, Keira Knightley and filmmaker Joe Wright work together. This first movie was Pride and Prejudice (2005). The results? Well, quite good indeed. Most people don't enjoy watching drama movies. I understand why! But watching Atonement is something else; makes us feel human. It does make us cry, if you are sensible enough. It is a work of art and probably the best drama of the decade. Intelligent, touching, visually stunning... is the closest to perfection of a movie. What could we want more? Joe Wright gives a Oscar worthy direction. Deep in every way. Keira Knightley is provocative. Saoirse Ronan is the girl who gives all the sense to the movie; in other words, she is the heart of the movie. James McAvoy is passionate. Vanessa Redgrave makes everyone fall and cry. And the soundtrack is unbelievable; Dario Marianelli's best yet. It is, ladies and gentlemen, a must see, AGAIN!",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Pretty good movie,"First off let me say that this is an extremely well done movie, and I won't be surprised if it does indeed take the Best Picture honors tomorrow. The acting and directing are outstanding. I saw a lot of reviews that said Keira Knightley didn't do as good as job as others, but I thought she did a passable job. The cinematography was amazing, as well as the music.Now on to why I only gave it a 7. I just didn't care; it took 45 minutes for it to start getting at least somewhat interesting, but I'm not really much of a romance fan either. Also i thought the character of Briony to be a nosy little brat, and I couldn't stand her at all, not even at the end.If you generally like romances, it will be tough to find one done better than this, but if you don't (like me, you can at least appreciate this movie for artistic reasons.",8.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Beautiful storytelling,"This is one solid movie, and will no doubt win some awards, mostly the technical ones i feel.It is beautifully directed, has a great score, acting, and cinematography. One continuous/tracking shot on the beach is worth a mention; it was a very nice scene(one Spielberg would've been proud of). The movie can be a bit slow for some, but it seems that's how these war-romance dramas are, just like Cold Mountain. Both the lead actors were good, but I do not see them winning any awards for this one.Overall, a great movie making spectacle...I wont be surprised if this one gets the nomination for best picture!",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Storyline with Depth/Beautifully Filmed,"I had the pleasure/discomfort of seeing Atonement yesterday at our local brand new theater. After seeing a trailer or two, I knew I would want to see it on the big screen VS seeing it on a future DVD release. This film may be destined to be a classic... I thought all the Brionys were brilliantly portrayed! The main characters give beautifully felt performances as all the other portraits presented were also compelling. A good film leaves one entertained; a great film leaves one with questions and a bit of discomfort in touching upon true life issues. Atonement is truly great! I would surely want to view it again. Watching all the credits carefully, I missed the locations where the filming took place. I'd be interested in following up on that detail as well. Wonderful cast, fantastic recreations, and some breathtaking imagery, for me, make this my pick for many many Oscars! Cheers - ZB",9.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Excellent adaption of a great book.,"After watching this wonderful film, I was left with only two questions, why the limited release and when will it be out on DVD. This is a heart touching film with spectacular shots based on a very well written book. Its a film that after watching you want to go out and tell all your friends and family to see. Unfortunately most of them around me will have to drive several hours to see it. The film seems to follow the story line of the book closely, or at least close enough that the fog of several years makes up for it. Although some of the imagery from the book is missing (Aka you still have to read the book for that literature class), it would be impossible to include the depth of the book. The film is very well put together and running sounds and images help it stay whole.Over all a very good movie and one that is worth a second watch at the theater and well worth the drive! On some level I think the film wouldn't be worth watching in a normal theater, the audience in the theater where i watched it seemed both in aw and reverence to the film, you could hear a pin drop.",10.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
Pretty pictures and a director that ruined the story,"I bet this was a great novel. Sadly, though, it didn't translate. The director wastes a lot of time on plot that has nothing to do with anything (the play that Briony writes? what a waste) and as a result doesn't have the time to give us the character development and blossoming love that make the actual underpinnings of a love story.I still have no idea why the two characters loved each other. We weren't even given a montage to let us know they had spent time together in ways that would show their love.Similarly, we never get to understand Briony's growth. By the end, I don't know why she sought atonement.For all the romance-novel weepies out there, I'm sure they can just take all that as writ and have themselves a good heart-tugging cry. I myself expect a director to reveal characters to me and engender emotion in me, rather than just expect me to make it up out of nothing.On the level of craft, though, this movie was splendid. Beautiful shots, gorgeous scenery, nice-looking stars and crisp sound (and a nicely understated soundtrack that didn't insist on telling you how to feel ever moment). The two leads probably are quite talented, but here, they had almost nothing to do except mug a bit.It's too bad all of that was wasted, because if the director didn't force us to assume so much of the important events in the story (I seem to recall that love stories should actually have scenes that show you the people falling and being in love), this could have been powerful and moving.As it was, I was yelling at the screen and feeling nothing toward any of them. I was cheated.",2.0,Anonymous,"Mystery, Romance"
