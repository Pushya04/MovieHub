Most amazing CGI ever,"The Jungle book won the Oscar for best visual effect, without a doubt it was very great.. but everything was predictable, it was just perfectly done. However, what Doctor Strange did was more than perfectly done, it's about the most craziest imagination that anyone had ever done in movie industry up to date.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""We never lose our demons, we only learn to live above them""","I'm not a big fan of Marvel and, in my opinion, their movies are mostly overrated. This one isn't. This is probably the second best Marvel movie, after ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". If you expect a movie to have depth and the point, you should skip, not only this one, but whole Marvel production, but if you are looking for fun you are at the right place. Visually it is amazing. I recommend watching it in theater or at least on a TV as big as possible. Standard computer monitors or, God forbid, tablets are out of question. Although 90% of this movie is pure action and fighting scenes, compared to most of the genre, story and characterization are more complete and Benedict and Tilda are excellent. Sure, like in all Marvel movies, there is a certain amount of humor and finale is one of the funniest things I have ever seen in Marvel movies. The way Strange finally defeats the enemy is at the same time unbelievably stupid, unbelievably clever and funny to tears. I gave it 8/10 within all the movies I ever watched, but within the genre, it is pure 10/10.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Great,"I was not prepared for the visuals this movie offered. Nevertheless, I absorbed it in its full glory. It was easy to enjoy this movie not only because of its visuals but also because of the quirkiness and lovable characters. A must-watch!",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
One of Marvel's best,"This movie is fantastic. I truly enjoyed watching it!Unlike most other movies of Marvel franchise, there is a heavy emphasis on character development. This keeps audience glued to the story on a deep cellular level.The movie is littered with spiritual themes which adds further depth to this already amazing story.Those who like movies and TV series of medical genre are in for a treat. As the title suggests the story involves a doctor.I also like how the story blends in and moves forward, in prefect synchronization. Particularly given the complexity of the plot. Quite a tribute to the three screenwriters.Great movie, can't wait for the next one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A good entry into the MCU,"This one holds up surprisingly well on a rewatch. I was bummed to find some of the effects already looking dated in Civil War, but almost all of the visual effects-heavy shots in Doctor Strange hold up (probably thanks to how fantastical and decidedly not grounded in reality many of those shots are).There are some very cool visuals and set pieces, the cast is very good, and it's paced well, clocking in well under two hours if you factor out the almost 10 minutes of credits.Despite mostly working, I'd say as a screenplay it doesn't quite feel 100% satisfying, and great actors like Mikkelsen and Swinton are good but kind of under-utilised (Chiwetel Ejiofor is good but maybe goes a little too hard? He kinda sounds like a voice actor from the Elder Scrolls, the way he speaks in some scenes 😅)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Lots of magical and wondrous amazement!,"This movie's CGI is quite impressive and how well done the action scenes are, along with the origin of this character and the deeper messages provided regarding growth beyond limitations.

"More of the Same, But Different!","Perfectly enjoyable fun. Sound familiar? Doctor Strange being a different kind of hero doesn't really excuse most of this film's conventional plotting.There's a much more interesting film in here, one in which Mads Mikkelsen isn't the main villain (yet) and getting in the way of the hero's journey and in which Tilda Swinton is even more ambiguous. Her obvious parallels to Stephen are perfectly apt and yet not allowed enough time to breathe and spin. It's all a last minute reveal and then a call to arms because plot and all is well because plot.A lot has been made of the ""trippy"" special effects, and I guess they are compared to the traditional visuals employed in these types of movies. But let's not get carried away. Besides the travels through space and mind it's mostly buildings moving around like they're in Inception.I didn't buy the last end credits scene. Useless and not earned. I'm sick of hero's with photographic memories. Let the hero be exceptional on their own merits. Action scenes could be less choppily edited. But still, it's fun in ways other recent Marvel movies haven't been.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well worth expanding your mind for,"Saw 'Doctor Strange' (although fairly late perhaps) because of liking the cast a great deal, who can argue with Benedict Cumberbatch and Tilda Swinton, and having liked a lot of what Marvel has done, something that one doesn't see people saying a lot here.'Doctor Strange' is not a perfect film, but to me it was a thoroughly enjoyable one and is one of Marvel's best. Lets begin with the things that from personal opinion didn't quite work. Rachel McAdams does do a good job with what she has, but the character was underused and underwritten. Her screen time, while essential, was not large and her development was sketchy at best. Strange mastering magic does happen too fast, didn't buy how rushed that aspect was, and while there are a lot of fun and witty moments a few jokes felt random and out of place (i.e. Beyoncé).However, the cast are a major asset. Had reservations about McAdams's character but not with her performance. Benedict Cumberbatch really makes the interesting title character his own and knocks it out the park. The standout of the rest of the cast is Tilda Swinton, wonderfully mysterious as the film's most interesting character and played with relish by her.Chiwetel Ejiofor has a charismatic intensity and Benedict Wong has fun and enjoyed his chemistry with Cumberbatch. Do think that the villain Kaecilius could have been explored in more depth, but Mads Mikkelsen is intriguingly menacing.The story, making the most of a great innovative concept, is never dull and is told with absorbing atmosphere, exuberance and very rarely sacrifices coherence or credulity. There are some really interesting ideas here, explored with thought-provoking intelligence. The action excites and thrills, as well as being visually stunning, instead of being drawn out even though quite long the climax is great fun to watch (or at least it was to me).'Doctor Strange's' script has emotion, wit and tension and although he doesn't have the character growth one would like Strange is a well realised character and Cumberbatch has a lot to thank for that. The music score has great intensity, rousing excitement and nuance and Scott Derrickson clearly engaged hugely with the material.Where 'Doctor Strange' is particularly good is in the production values. It's very stylishly shot and edited and handsomely mounted in production design but it's the incredible special effects (particularly jaw-dropping in the climax) that take centre stage.Overall, while not quite finding it a masterpiece of film-making and having a few problems with it 'Doctor Strange' was a thoroughly enjoyable film and among Marvel's best. 8/10 Bethany Cox",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing Special Effects but that's it.,"This film is incredibly pleasing to look at but not so much to watch. Whilst Benedict is an amazing actor it is just not shown here.

My review after second watch,Revisited this beauty today.I forgot how massive this movie was with very well-done CGI works. It's just awesome. Normally this amount of visual effects would tire my eyes but they managed how to not do that to the audience by using a very professionally made color grading.Don't think I NEED to mention how Benedict Cumberbatch fits his role. It's like he was born to play Doctor Strange.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
visually mind-blowing,"In terms of the quality of the film as a whole, I would give Doctor Strange a 7, but because of its visual effects and implications for the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I am totally giving it an 8. Let me explain.Watching this in theaters with the sometimes too-loud sound, seeing the buildings and streets give way and rotate and otherwise bend themselves completely to a person's whim, immediately made me think of Inception. But this was even more hectic. This wasn't imaginary, this was real.Another thing. Finally in the MCU we have some sorcery, direct utilization of magical energy for combat. Discussion of other dimensions; even traveling between them at will. Doctor Strange's final outfit is just wicked cool. If you know the character from the Marvel comics, then you'll know that he's pretty damn powerful. Unfortunately this is an origins film, that is, it reveals how Doctor Strange became Doctor Strange the Sorcerer Supreme; the real deal will come in the third Avengers film hopefully.As a follower of the MCU who's seen basically all of the released films to date, I was eagerly awaiting this one, and I was not dissatisfied. The music was riveting as usual per a Marvel film (Giacchino), the fight sequences intense, the otherworldly conflicts enormous. I'm so glad this guy's joining the Avengers in their imminent battle with Thanos, or at least I'm pretty sure he is. Now all that being said, Doctor Strange wouldn't fall in my top 5 MCU films; Captain America, Avengers 2, for example were much better, but it's part of the MCU, and therefore is a must-see for any MCU fan.I also noticed a lot more wit and almost off-character humor in this film than in other MCU films. And of course, as all the MCU films are taking place chronologically within the same universe (or multiverse?), there are several references to the bigger pictures, i.e. the Avengers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visual effects that spoil the eye and Scott's good direction, this film makes us enchanted with beauty.","Marvel Studios' ""Doctor Strange"" offers very few insights into the childhood of its main character. It's safe to assume it wasn't easy growing up with a name like Stephen Strange. Perhaps that explains the complex that has driven Strange to become such an arrogant neurosurgeon.The studio has created a thrilling existential dilemma in which its flawed hero's personal search for purpose dovetails beautifully with forays into the occult New Age realm of magic and sorcery where Doctor Strange ultimately finds his calling.Marvel movies are all starting to look and sound the same, boasting bright primary colors and magic-hour lighting. Like the original pulp comics, they're printed with a standard four-color process that permitted a very limited palette. Feige deserves credit for bringing a master plan to Marvel's big-screen slate.Director Scott Derrickson's film follows ""Spider-Man"" helmer Sam Raimi from the world of schlock horror. IMAX audiences will benefit from more than an hour of footage captured on Sony's large-format digital cameras.The film is one of the best Marvel films to date, with an in-on-the-joke script that navigates major plot potholes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Trippy, Weird, Amazing and Jawdropping!","I was lucky enough to be among the press-junket last Wednesday to witness this movie! I usually rate movies by different aspects, but i'll also answer some questions my friends had about this film which I also had myself!Acting (10/10): This cast is amazing! They embody their characters instead of trying to act like the character. Benedict as Dr. Strange was a portrayal right out of the comics! Tilda as the ancient one killed it!Action (10/10): Wow! I could argue the action in this movie being on par with the scenes in civil war. It was so incredible watching this scenes with million pieces moving yet focus sing on the main characters. Wide angles, long shots and great choreography. what else do you want?Story(8/10) : This movie had a solid story and you believed what, how and why things were going on! Villain was good and actually a memorable one for once(stab, you're welcome dc fans). It was not flawless though. The pace kind of slows down before the final act which was unnecessary!Cinematography/VFX 10/10: The images in this film blew my mind! There is a scene in the beginning where the ancient one shows Dr strange ""the magic"" and it is great! Some serious mind-bending stuff combined with great visuals to let it manifest itself to the audience. Most artistic movie yet of marvel.Overall, i'd give this movie an 8.5. Though this isn't THE best marvel movie, it is truly one of best out there. After the disappointing Jason borne, jack reach er etc. we finally have a movie that lives up to the hype! GO Watch this movie in Max 3d if possible, because it is worth it for once!Some questions that my friends asked:""Is this better than civil war?"" - Well visual-wise on par, but story-wise civil war is better for many reasons including the fact that civil war had a lot of background information to work with. This was more of a standardized origin film.""Is there a post-credit scene?"" - Ah yes sir! Apparently there are two, but we got to see only 1.""Is this the most mind-boggling thing you've ever seen on screen?"" - Ehm yes and no. Yes, because the effects were amazing and things I've never seen before.

The Protectors of the Mystic World,"In New York, the arrogant Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a talented neurosurgeon with a huge ego. After a car accident, Dr. Strange damages his fingers and loses control of his hands. The surgeon Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), who was his lover, tries to help him. But Dr. Strange unsuccessfully spends his savings searching an experimental treatment for his fingers. When Dr. Strange learns that the paraplegic Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) walked again, he seeks him out and he says he was healed in Kamar-taj. Dr. Strange travels to Katmandu where he meets the sorcerer Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and is introduced to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She discloses the astral plan and other dimensions to him and explains that Earth is protected in the mystical plan by three Sanctums (in New York, in London and In Hong Kong). However, her former protégé Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) has summoned the powerful demon Dormammu, from the Dark Dimension, and wants to destroy the three Sanctums with his minions to let the Dark Dimension, where time does not exist and anyone can live forever, to rule the world. Will The Ancient One, Dr. Strange and Mordo save the world?""Doctor Strange"" is another entertaining film with another Marvel non- popular hero. The witty story is well developed, presenting Doctor Strange to the audience. The scene where Mordo delivers a piece of paper to Dr. Strange with the wi-fi password is hilarious.

"A fantastic, excellent and glamorous movie with everything. A class act","Without giving away too much, Benedict Cumberbatch just kills it. He is one class actor. Cumberbatch rocks as Strange and pulls it off with ease. The impressions his portrayal gives us is that he was born to play the role of the ex-neurosurgeon turned Sorcerer Supreme.

Every normal movie watcher will love the action, humour, adventure and fantasy throughout the film.A solid new character introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe with loads of potential.

"Not strange enough, Dr. Strange.","For a Marvel film, this is one of the weaker ones. Both Benedicts are great actors, the visuals are also great (though not as colourful as I would've liked) but the problem lies with the story...
The plot is not even bad, but it wants to do funny; it wants to do strange; it wants to explore the characters in an emotional level; it wants to have a theme of ""time""...... But none of them are done well.
Personally, I would've liked a stranger movie with even weirder effects including a consistent theme with ""time"". And showcase how much more of a human training in the mystic arts has made him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
People are so hard to impress,"I know everyone is entitled to their opinion but damn, really 1 star on this movie. This movie did not deserve one star. Its hard to impress people. I do basic video editing and i really have a genuine appreciation for the people who work on video editing and effects. The people worked on dr strange really did something special with the visuals and i find it amazing what they created. Some of the people giving this movie 1 star i would like to see them create these visuals or take up video editing and special effects and see how easy it is to create this stuff. Even if you don't like the story i think just off visuals this movie at least deserved a 6. Its sad, to be in an artform like this because everyone is a critic and desensitized. Some movies i go to learn something from, some i go to because i want a good story, and some i go to for pure eye candy and fun. This movie is an eye candy movie. Yes there are other super hero movies with better stories but before going into doctor strange, i went for the visuals to see what they can do based on visuals i seen in the comics and to me they achieved the fantasy reality. I had pure fun watching this and im sorry i didn't see it in 3d because this is one of those types of movies you have to see in 3d. Sorry to the people who worked hard on this film.

One of the most action packed films of the MCU.,"2016 has been a mixed bag on the whole for the superhero genre.Despite the noticeable potential, both DC blockbusters 'Batman V Superman: Dawn of Justice' and 'Suicide Squad' did not seem to live up to the hype with the majority. As for Marvel, it's been pretty good. It started back in February where Deadpool became more of a success then anyone could ever have imagined. It is now high up in many peoples films of the year lists. Then we had 'Captain America: Civil War', which was another very good installment from not just the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but the Captain America franchise. Then in the summer we had 'X-Men: Apocalypse'. It had mixed reviews, with the majority being satisfied with it.Now we go into new territory for Marvel Studios with Doctor Strange. The last time they went for source material that sounded pretty odd on paper was Guardians Of The Galaxy, and director James Gunn and his team gave us one of the best reviewed and most loved films within the genre.The stellar cast and marketing certainly had many people thinking this had potential to be up there with the best. It certainly is one of the most entertaining and is a welcomed addition to the MCU.The one element that people were most nervous about is that would the mythology work on screen to fit into other Marvel movies. Yes there is a lot of mythology, and I certainly got swept away with it. I understood it by the end of it, it got me excited when certain things were happening and it made me think how the other Marvel superheroes would cope with the mystical power of Doctor Strange.With the film going into magic effectively, it will be hard for some people to take it seriously. I can confidently say that the cast and crew certainly knew when to take it seriously and inject some fun into it. That will be a big reason for this to be a big success in the box office and with the critics.The cast is probably the most high-calibre Marvel have ever conjured up, and they did a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect choice for Dr. Stephen Strange. You believed his origin story and transformation. He IS Dr. Strange. Tilda Swinton was terrific was The Ancient One. I am big fan of her work and she definitely brought it in this one. Sadly, there were moments where I was confused as to why her character was not there. But that is the fault in the departments. Chiwitel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams were serviceable as the main supporting roles. Benedict Wong also had great comedic relief when needed. The big question in any Marvel movie recently, is if the villain will be a memorable one. While Mads Mikkelsen's character was certainly not the worst, it still was not a strong one.The strongest parts of the film for me were the action and the visual effects. The action is certainly some of the best in the MCU and in all of Marvel's films. They make great use of the abilities are characters had, and it had moments that even Christopher Nolan would have liked to have used in Inception. I loved those moments as I consider that film to be perfect. The imagery that the visual effects used was mind-blowing and really messed with your mind at times. The fantastic opening scene and use of visual effects will certainly give you a taste of what is to come.The only stopping me from giving a very good rating is the writing and story development. While it is perfectly fine and serviceable, it is nothing exceptional. The writing was nothing to shout about, and the story development felt the standard Marvel structure that I have seen with many of their features.That being said, there is lots to enjoy and I had a lot of fun with this. The action and visual effects is some of the best from this studio. A lot of the acting was great and helped the source material make sense to the mainstream audience. Another thing that worked like all Marvel films do, is the comedy. There are some good laugh- out- loud moments that are all well executed, and never felt forced or out of place.Another usual thing with Marvel films is the credits scenes. In this particular one, there is both a mid and post credits scene. The mid- credits scene is a cool idea, but I felt the execution of it pretty much felt like an spoon-feeding moment to tell everyone what is coming up next. The post-credits scene was better executed and was a nice tease to see which path the next Doctor Strange installment might go down.Rating: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Wonderful and Amazing Escapist Entertainment,"Way back when I first heard that Doctor Strange was being brought to the screen I was a bit worried. How could they translate the complexity of character and his true coolness but stay away from the cheeseball stuff? Dress a guy up like the books and remain true to the seriousness of the character? Well, they managed to not only pull it off but deliver one of the best hero origin films ever made.The director knew that you had to establish and truly care about the character. Making it grounded but still trippy really helps give it a flavor unlike any other comic adaptation. The Harry Potter meets Iron Man meets Ant-Man flavor was there yet it all feels unique. The MCU magic is there literally. Everything established in the Captain America films and both Avengers pays dividends in a way here. The universe has been established wonderfully and this film does the best job to date playing in that universe. Everything and every scene packs some sort of punch and resonates with true style and heart. They really let the action flow but also allow for key development of the overall story and over concept. This also allows them to probe deeper into the character's personalities. ALL the characters even the ones with smaller roles get to shine. This heightens the tension, so often missing from lesser comic-book movies, and adds real weight to the action sequences which are thrilling and often mesmerizing. Add more than a dash of thriller aspects and a few new characters that steal every scene that they appear in.I honestly can't think of one way to improve this film. The result is a movie that's just flat out exceptional and that honestly delivers the best visuals I've ever seen in a movie.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Visually stunning, witty and suffers from MCU villain deficiency syndrome","First off, I was blown away by the visuals, and the way cross dimensional scenarios were portrayed as if a comic book page came to life. Haven't read much of Doctor Strange comics, although one of my favorite Marvel characters. Being a DC fan, and so far a disappointing DCEU, went in with high expectations to fill my Superhero treat quota of the year. Was not disappointed.Now comes the story, it's your typical Marvel character introduction movie. Pretty much explained in the trailers, after surviving a near fatal car accident, he eventually goes to Kamar Taj for healing, thus begins his journey as the Sorcerer Supreme. Benedict Cumberbatch did the character Doctor Strange justice.I think Scott Derrickson did a fine job directing this multi- dimensional CGI fest superhero movie, as the plot served it's purpose quite well.Now for the negative roles, Kaecilius..once a pupil of the Sorcerer Supreme, the Ancient one, lost his way and turned to darkness, similar to the likes of Mordo in the comics. Not much had been shown to why he did so. He isn't that scary, and they mention his atrocities several times, we don't see them actually. But Mads was fine as he was, could have been much deeper and better. But that seems to be a common issue in the MCU. Not much depth added to villains to make them less scary ..to make them watchable to everyone. The henchmen of Kaecilius were just wasted imo.Quite a witty movie, and there are laughter in very serious moments. I loved Benedict Wong and his comic timings.Rachel McAdams was okay, but she doesn't get much screen time.Chiwetel Ejiofor, or Mordo, again, lacks the depth.. which he apparently needed a lot. He is a real talented actor, and a very important character in the Strange mythos, so the writers could have done a lot better.Music and the score were good, not the best in the MCU, but syncs quite well with scenes.So the best part of the movie was Benedict and his portrayal of Doctor Strange, a simple plot and the extra stunning visuals. That's pretty much it. Overall, a decent movie. I just hoped the villains wouldn't be a let down like some of the past Marvel movies, sadly they were.There are two post credit scenes, both are quite important. One at the end of Major credits, another at the very end. Don't miss those ! Enjoy ..a must watch in IMAX 3D.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Emperor's New Clothes,"Despite the visual similarities to Inception, Doctor Strange (in 3D) looks incredible. In places it's breathtaking. Without a doubt, this is the closest to tripping you can experience in a cinema. However, all this eye-candy fails to hide the fact that underneath it all is a terrible, terrible, by-the-numbers film. It makes the same fatal error as Finn fighting Kylo Ren in The Force Awakens. The villain is powerful and experienced, but our hero, who is a beginner, manages to defeat him. This is only one of dozens of 'groan out loud' moments.The script is poor and the 'jokes' are misjudged. If there's one sure fire way of preventing your film from aging well, it's by inserting jokes about Beyonce.I can understand why Mads Mikkelsen did this film, as I'm sure he was well paid, but it's probably the worst film he's appeared in by a mile.Lazy and formulaic.

Introduced for the first time in issue 110 of 'Strange Tales' (July 1963), Doctor Strange is the superhero in charge of fighting supernatural threats, a neurosurgeon from New York, as brilliant as he is vain and that he lost the mobility of his hands after a car accident. The person in charge of giving life to Stephe Strange is the well-known London actor Benedict Cumberbatch giving a nice acting , who is well accompanied by notorious actors as Chiwetel Ejiofor , Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins.In the film, as is usual in productions of the Marvel scientific universe, there is no shortage of Stan Lee's cameo as the passenger of a bus in the middle of a chase in NY. Nor the post-credits scene in which material from the following Marvel films is advanced, on this occasion with a cover between Doctor Strange and Thor.Other films about this Marvelian role are: the sequel ¨Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness¨ (2022) by Sam Raimi with Benedict Cumberbatch, Elizabeth Olsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Xochitl Gomez, Rachel McAdams. ¨Dr. Strange¨ (1978) by Philip DeGuere Jr with Peter Hooten, Clyde Kusatsu, Jessica Walter, Anne-Marie Martin, Philip Sterling, John Mills. And an imitation of 'Marvel's Doctor Strange' : ¨Doctor Mordrid¨ (1992) by Albert Band with well-known actors from the best B-series: Jeffrey Combs, Yvette Nipar, Jay Acovone.This notable motion picture was compellingly directed by Scott Derrickson . Scott is a good craftsman with a lot of successes on the terror genre in which he's a great expert . An American filmmaker who is known for shooting horror films , such as ¨Deliver Us from Evil¨, ¨Hellraiser: Inferno¨, ¨Sinister¨, ¨The Exorcism of Emily Rose¨ and ¨black Phone¨. He decided not to direct ¨Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness¨, which resulted in Sam Raimi to direct the sequel. Rating Doctor Strange (2016) : 6.5/10 , better than average. The flick will appeal to Benedict Cumberbatch fans and superheroes enthusiasts.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
And this is why I love Cumberbatch,"This was my first time on IMAX and I actually did not know about Doctor Strange so I went into it fully open-minded.And you know what This was actually pretty good! Granted, some things were not very realistic and the character development was much too quick in certain parts but overall this was very well achieved.The movie is reminiscent of Inception and Matrix and I absolutely loved the first scenes, featuring the Ancient One.Cumburbatch played this character wonderfully. He is witty and egocentric and even though there is development to the character he never ceases to be true to himself. Some of the humorous moments are simply hilarious. He seems to have been born for this part, much like Iron Man seems to have been created for Robert Downey Jr.All the other actors performed brilliantly as well, though. Tilda Swinson was simply amazing and her interactions with Cumberbatch were so much fun and awe-striking. Rachel McAdams did great as well; it's not easy to shine in such a roll but she was very good and believable. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain was also superb. I had not expected such a humane approach to him.I had a great time watching Doctor Strange and definitely recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dazzling visuals and strange scenearios makes for exciting and fresher stories.,"Doctor Strange is a weird movie, because it has to be. Exploring never before seen boundaries, the MCU stablishes new characters and powers that may seem difficult to follow at first, but the film does a great job keeping track of its own plot and letting it breath before moving to the next scene. The action sequences are amazing and the film is pure entertainment giving us a welcomed breeze of fresh air, but that doesn't stop it from commiting the same mistakes, taking too much from the good vs bad formula.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Absolutely fun and what Marvel do best,"This isn't really a review, more or an informal statement.So this has been the number one film I've been looking forward to all year (yep more than Civil War and Finding Dory) for a few reasons, one its a marvel Movie which I am a big fan off, Doctor Strange is a great character and story, and Benedict Cumberbatch is my favourite actor. (just to say I have more a right than a lot of other people to say that Cumberbatch is my favourite actor as I have been following his career for 6 years now since the first episode of Sherlock) All this in one is just brilliant.Although this year I have been very nervous about whether it would be good or not. Don't get me wrong the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) have never made a bad film) but after some of the bi disappointments this year (Batman vs Superman, suicide squad, X men Apocalypse ( I like it but the majority of society doesn't)) and that the director Scott Derrickson has only produced not great horror films, I did worry slightly.But I am so glad to breath a proud sigh of relief, as Marvel have done their job as usual in creating a great fun action film with a great story and well executed performances. A really solid piece of blockbuster entertainment and fantasy.Doctor Stephen Strange is brilliant but arrogant neuro surgeon who's use of his hands fails him when he is victim to a car accident. He will then become so lost that he seeks help and guidance in the Ancient One, who teaches him in art of the dimensional and mystic arts to become a defender of his world to stop an approaching evil.First Cumberbatch, brilliant executes the role of Stephen Strange, an ignorant surgeon who becomes to obsessed with his ego and then transforms into the mystical sorcerer supreme. I was concerned about Cumberbatch's accent but its absolutely fine so no worries there. What I love about Cumberbatch is that he can tackle countless roles and characters which is what is very clear here, by displaying elements of being an ass-whole (excuse my language) becoming a strong confident hero and also a quirky humorous fellow.A big hats off to Tilda Swinton as well delivering an awesome performance as the mysterious Ancient One, showing off her wise craftsmanship as a teacher and skills as a defender of the dimensions.The story is a solid great structure with comfortable direction by Scott Derickson, just a bit rough around the edges in a few moments, but nothing to make me go mental over the internet.One of the big aspects of this film is the heavy visual effects, giving us a hint of Christopher Nolan's Inception at times (best film ever made). This wonderfully developed visual artwork really puts you in the realms of dimension and transports you to worlds never seen before in the MCU. I wouldn't be surprised to see this nominated at the Oscars.This is a key aspect that sets Doctor Strange from the rest of the movies, as it enters a whole new universe of super hero. But that what I love about Marvel is that the super heroes aren't really typical super heroes. (Cpt America, is a super strength patriot, Thor is a God, Hulk is a green monster, and Doctor Strange is a sorcerer) Doctor Strange was everything I wanted and needed it to be, a really solid good, fun, Marvel movie with a spot on performance by Cumberbatch, can't wait to see him in the future movies. Great fun Loved it 8.6/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Pretty average,"I think this film hugely benefits from being something at least a little different from most Marvel films. It's different in the focus that is on magic and sorcery and all of that. However, it's still quite familiar in its arc and predictable beats. The cast is fine, although nothing ever really great. Swinton manages to rise above her material, as predicted that she would. Rachel McAdams also adds a lot of heart to her character, who has a lot of screen time but who is really likable. The action sequences here are really impressive and they make a lot of the film worth it. As it is, it's not bad at all and it's enjoyable, just nothing too memorable.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel at its finest,"I had low expectations for this movie after the trailer and boy that was a pleasant surprise. Doctor Strange is one of the best Marvel movies and definitely FX masterpiece. Strong story line, strong characters and stunning visuals. Mavie has it all covered with tons of humor on top of it. We are introduced to a new superhero and a new mystical universe. Its a classical character journey of main character from the gutter to saving the world, but there is so much more to it. We have some power, ego and responsibility dilemmas, teacher-student relationships and I cant stress enough how much work went into visuals. But Doctor Strange has its downsides also. Jon Spaihts and Scott Derrickson lack of talent in dramaturgy is very obvious. Many important scenes were done carelessly and lack dramatism they needed. Also many poor cuts made into the final edit. This movie could be so much more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
WORLD-CLASS VISUAL EFFECTS,Probably one of the best films in the MCU. The visual effects were top of the line. My only problem was its almost rush pacing.

Absolutely fantastic!,"Why would any person over 45 enjoy this movie? Because it's deeply inspiring, especially if you have a disability or a chronic disabling illness. I have been severely disabled thanks to an ascetic practice of purification, water fasting, gone awfully wrong. I lost everything not just my health and I often thought about suicide. Some movies are therapeutical but this one was a straight health potion. When doctor Strange lost everything he had including his capacity to move his fingers, he too felt his life was over but miracles happen and one miracle is enough to reignite your faith. Doctor Strange had to literally jump into the mystical world of esoteric practices to discover something more about himself and the world around him. This movie motivated me to explore my inner self to understand that reality is not what it seems and everything is possible if you have enough faith.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pleasant Surprise,I started watching it with little expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. The movie turned out to be far better than I expected.

I was very impressed by the pacing of the movie. Neither too fast and nor too slow. I can't wait for the sequel!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Missed Opportunity,"Seasoning MCU formulas with philosophical ideas, Doctor Strange introduces themes of spirituality, ego, and surrender, yet sidelines them for a generic finale. Meanwhile, Strange predictably arcs by becoming selfless and the final battle resolves somewhat cleverly. Plus, the spacetime manipulations are refreshing. Still, this is all in shallow service of tired action shlock, limiting the script's originality, abstraction, and depth. Cumberbatch balances sarcasm, contempt, and vulnerability. Swinton is stoic yet tender. However, McAdams, Ejiofor, and Mikkelsen are trapped in flat characters. All told, Doctor Strange has decent emotions but could've been creatively transcendent.Similarly, Doctor Strange's technicals are regrettably restrained. Psychedelic special effects are paired with standard CGI. Likewise, the editing, cinematography, and sound all inconsistently commit to the hallucinogenic atmosphere. Engaging jump cuts, dolly-zooms, and echoes are underemphasized. Lastly, the production design exemplifies Doctor Strange's union of mind-bending concepts and bland familiarity. The alternate dimensions and supernatural villains all look fairly trippy, yet still feel routine. Complete with a forgettable soundtrack and the mild MCU tone, this film is safer than need be. Considering its abstract nature, Doctor Strange is adequate, but also a missed opportunity.Writing: 6/10

A trippy mind-blowing fantasy adventure!!! Excellent,"Marvels DOCTOR STRANGE is a fantastic, mind-blowing adventure about a world class neurosurgeon seeking a cure after a devastating accident leaves him unable to do surgery so he goes on a mission to find someone somewhere who can help him & ends up in a bizarre place known as Kamar-Taj- the front line of a battle against unseen dark forces bent on destroying our reality.Yep this is time-bending & mind-blowing film that reminded me of the first time i watched the Classic ""The Matrix"" as this film has done for Marvel what ""Matrix"" did for sci-fi action back then & their is similarities with their deep twisty mind-boggling stories of a man who enters another dimension type world that exists within their own reality, crazy & very trippy stuff.Benedict Cumberbatch is great as Doctor Strange, a man with a sense of humour & a big ego but is still likeable & it's a great performance & the cast is just fantastic with the scene stealing Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, the mysterious magical magician leader who trains Doctor Strange, she's almost like ""Mortheus"" was in the Matrix & she's such a presence on screen she steals the show. The rest of our ensemble cast is rounded out with Rachel McAdams & Benedict Wong & Mads Mikkelsen & Chiwetel Ejiofor & even a small role for the great Action legend SCOTT ADKINS!!! I love this guy but he's often underrated & here he's very underused as just a bad guy henchman type who doesn't get to say anything but does get to fight Doctor Strange so I'm grateful for that & it's nice to see him in a mega budget Blockbuster movie.Doctor Strange is one of my favourite Marvel movies now, it's full of great talent & it's visually a striking & extremely creative movie full of bizarre beauty & mind-blowing themes & images & fantastic magical fight scenes that are trippy to watch & there's some nice humour sprinkled throughout this psychedelic adventure. Simply a really enjoyable Blockbuster movie, a great Popcorn flick & a great introduction & origin story to Doctor Strange.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nothing Spectacular,"I went into the movie among high hopes. My friends told me it was fantastic and there were scenes that were ""out-of-this-world"". So entering this movie (with a certain elevation) I had high expectations. But it fell incredibly short.Overall, the acting. Monologue, boring, no worth while story, the hero who just entered the arts of magic is now suddenly one of the best in the business in a short amount of time, etc. etc. Now I understand that it's a Marvel and Superhero movie, but that doesn't change the fact that the script is entirely the SAME for every Marvel movie on the characters are changed.This movie was (for lack of a better term) boring. There were only three of those ""out-of-this-world"" scenes and those scenes were done well (save for the first. Focusing on a violently shaking your head side to side while flashy colors are beaming around you is lazy film directing at best).The movie was not what it was hyped up to be by my friends, other critics, and reviews. It is a generic action flick with terrible attempts at comedy with the usual on-liner and unbelievable looks of ""How did you..."" then to ""I just did."" and act all innocently.In short: This action/""comedy"" movie is generic, bland, boring, with few action scenes just to make sure you are distracted by the endless, meaningless conversations. I expected more from this type of movie. 2/7P.S. This studio has become arrogant and lazy.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Quite Possibly The Most Authentically Psychedelic Movie You'll Ever See,"Early on, during one of the first of many mind - and reality - bending moments in this film, it hit me that the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' movies made the past 10 years are going to be seen in a half-century's time as just as classic and golden an age of film making as Disney's heyday in the 1940s, or at the very least, Pixar's rule of animation from the 90s on.Yes, some are weaker than others - the second Thor film and the third Iron Man, for starters - but at their best they are very close to perfect, and so clearly what all those woefully misguided blockbuster abominations like The Force Awakens and Batman Vs Superman want to be. The elusive Marvel formula has been a fantastic balance of action, humour and heart, and this has all of those in spades - although if I have to pick any fault with it, it might be that the emotional charge is not as high as one might hope, and that's pretty much the only reason I took a star away. It was also apparent some PC coercion had influenced the casting and depictions of characters (white characters made black, male characters made female, and the only 'bad' or flawed characters in it being white males), but this was relatively restrained and unobtrusive and it would be churlish to kick up too much of a fuss over.The most obvious comparison to the visual effects on display would be Inception, but I was struck while watching it, with my mouth open and a permanent smile of wonderment on my face, how this film technically surpasses everything in that film (and every other film I've seen too), but also how far more FUN it is than Inception.So there we go, Dr Strange is a splendid, exciting, marvellously fun concoction that future generations are going to adore just as much as we do today. That's a rarity, and worth noticing while it happens.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing movie,"Incredible! Great movie in every detail. One of the best marvel movies hands down. Selection of actors is on point, visuals are amazing, and the story line is enjoyable!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Unique and unconventional style, but lacks the substance to make it better than it could've been.","Probably everyone's biggest immediate perception at what's so amazing about this film is of course the visuals, and yes there's no denying it was such an extravagant experience especially considering watching it in 3D and 4DX. The mind-bending, intergalactic, space time continuum trippy-ness of the film makes up most of the chunk that makes this film a cut above the rest of all the Marvel films and it's a breath of fresh air that it remains that way through out the film. Benedict Cumberbatch is well cast, if Marvel is indeed planning on making the new ""RDJ- like"" character archetype then they're lucky to find another Sherlock actor to fill in that role because his arrogance, charisma and elegance were all translated so fluidly in the film. In fact, the actors in this film are all individually strong and there's no surprise since almost all of them have been given Oscar nods and recognition to be well rounded actors.Nonetheless, style over substance is never usually a good thing, and I'm not making an exception here even if I do concede that the film looked hella cool. My biggest con in the film is probably how everything is either just so one or two dimensional (ironically, in a film about mind-bending stuff). If you take a step back and remove all the visuals, you get a run by the numbers generic plot with minimal impact. The plot leaves little to no tension with yet another ""world ending"" and life threatening plot line which will obviously be solved by an already existing deus ex machina. There are obvious and predictable foreshadowing hints wherein it really didn't feel like they were trying to be subtle anymore and force dialogue unto your face saying ""Remember this thing I'm telling you, it's going to be used in the future and you'll totally know when"". Also, the lack of tension in the film is quite appalling, sure it's executed beautifully, but that doesn't mean I'm going to fully appreciate the scene for what it truly is and what it means for the whole plot. Since the film focuses too much on the visuals, the audience is led to really forget about the tension and the possible stakeholders that might happen because cool unorthodox things are showing up on your screen. This makes it rather hard to relate to the characters and have slow and development heavy moments to be overshadowed. The second con is how we have no actual grasp of the extents and limitations of the powers in play here, IM NOT SAYING MAGIC IN THE FILM WAS A BAD THING, Magic can definitely be a good and special thing to do, but only if it is executed well enough not just in visuals but in substance as well. Sadly, the film glosses over that after such a strong first act. Suddenly after a span of reading montages, you sort of just have to accept he's this good and pro at this now. Even though from the start the film does show him struggle, the next few scenes, he's shown being able to handle toe to toe with a dark magic user who's way more experienced than him, and that's exactly the point. Sure there are quick explanations like him reading all the books in library etc etc, but it then leaves us with no grasp or knowledge as to what are the extents of the magic in this film, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each sorcerer or what are the possibilities for magic in battle and why do they even move God damn architecture. The point isn't that the visuals and the magic were horrible per say, but we had no grasp of what they truly are and are only left with ambiguity and cool scenes. Like the final battle was solved by such a convenient plot device that you even wonder why that wasn't even used before to prevent horrible events from ever happening, oh well they only explain that with a crappy one liner that doesn't work as well as it does in Doctor Who (""Time is Relative""). Lastly, the villain and the rest of the film is quite underwhelming and forgettable. It's a trend for Marvel films to have quite lackluster and monochrome villains, this isn't an exception even with Mads Mikkelsen as the actor. Not much to say about the musical score as well, ever since the ""Marvel Symphonic Universe"" essay made by Tony Zhou(Every Frame a Painting) it wasn't quite a surprise to have a rather generic and even non- existent Doctor Strange theme, odd considering solo films like Iron Man 1 and Ant-Man had their own distinct musical scores you can attach them too.Overall, it's not a great movie, not a bad movie either. It's perfectly up to you whether or not you will absolutely adore this film mainly because of it's unconventional visual style and not care about the lack of substance and a run by the numbers safe origin plot. It's definitely not as good as Civil War and debatable if we compare with Ant-Man, but nonetheless it's a solid and unique Marvel entry.Verdict: 7.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Mind Blowing Visuals,"After a car accident Dr. Steven Strange loses his ability to perform surgery. Not knowing what to do with himself he heads east to find a different way to heal his hands.The plot for this movie is great and has a very well done origin story. I really enjoyed seeing Dr. Strange learn his abilities and it's why I wish I saw more of it. The training aspect of this film was a little rushed in my opinion, I would have liked to see more of that. The beginning of this film needed better pacing as it is fairly slow going until Strange meets the ancient one.Benedict Cumberbatch is amazing as Doctor Strange. Strange is a really compelling character, he is the egotistical know it all but at the same time he is constantly improving himself.Chiwetel Ejiofor was really great as Mordo along with Tilda Swinton as the ancient one. Mads Mikkelsen is really good as Kaecilius but he doesn't get enough screen time to be considered a compelling villain. Rachel McAdams was good as the semi love interest but her character felt forced and didn't seem all that important to the story.The visuals are phenomenal, every single scene looks unbelievably realistic and allows for some highly entertaining action sequences.Overall a really entertaining film.

Well Multiversed,"In the latest Marvel film (notably now available with the snazzy new Marvel production logo at the start) Benedict Cumberbatch (""Sherlock"", ""Star Trek Into Darkness"") plays the titular hero: a neurosurgeon with exceptional skills, an encyclopedic knowledge of discographies and an ego to rival Donald Trump.After an horrific car crash (topically addressing the dangers of mobile use while driving) Strange loses the ability to practice his craft, and descends into a spiral of self-pity and despair. Finding a similar soul, Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt, ""24: Live Another Day"") who's undergone a miracle cure, Strange travels to Katmandu in search of similar salvation where he is trained in spiritual control by ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton, ""Hail Caesar"", ""The Grand Budapest Hotel"") ably supported by her assistant Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor, ""12 Years a Slave"") and librarian Wong (Benedict Wong, ""The Martian""). So far so ""Batman Begins"".As always in these films though there is also a villain, in this case a rogue former pupil turned to the dark side (have we not been here before Anakin?) called Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelssen, ""Quantum of Solace""). The world risks total destruction from spiritual attack (""the Avengers handle the physical threats"" – LOL) and the team stand together to battle Kaecilius's attempts to open a portal (""Zuuuul"") and 'let the right one in'.Followers of this blog will generally be aware that I am not a great fan of the Marvel and DC universes in general. However, there is a large variation in the style of films dished out by the studios ranging from the pompously full-of-themselves films at the ""Batman vs Superman"" (bottom) end to the more light-hearted (bordering on ""Kick-Ass-style"") films at the ""Ant Man"" (top) end. Along this continuum I would judge ""Doctor Strange"" to be about a 7: so it is a lot more fun than I expected it to be.The film is largely carried by Cumberbatch, effecting a vaguely annoying American accent but generally adding acting credence to some pretty ludicrous material. In particular he milks all the comic lines to maximum effect, leading to some genuinely funny moments: yes, the comedy gold extends past Ejiofor's (very funny) wi-fi password line in the trailer.Cumberbatch also has the range to convincingly play the fall of the egocentric Strange: his extreme unpleasantness towards his beleaguered on/off girlfriend (the ever-reliable Rachel McAdams (""Sherlock Holmes"")) drew audible gasps of shock from a few of the 'Cumberbitches' in my screening. (As I'm writing this on November 9th, the day of Trumpagedden, we might have already found a candidate able to play the new President elect!)In fact, the whole of the first half of the film is a delight: Strange's decline; effective Nepalese locations; a highly entertaining ""training"" sequence; and Cumberbatch and Swinton sparking off each other beautifully.Where the film pitches downhill is where it gets too ""BIG"": both in a hugely overblown New York morphing sequence (the – remember – human heroes suffer skyscraper-level falls without injury) and where (traditionally) a cosmic being gets involved and our puny heroes have to defend earth against it. Once again we have a ""big CGI thing"" centre screen with the logic behind the (long-term) defeating of the ""big CGI thing"" little better than that behind the defeat of the ""big CGI thing"" in ""Batman vs Superman"" (but without Gal Gadot's legs unfortunately to distract the male audience).Music is by Michael Giacchino, and his suitably bombastic Strange theme is given a very nice reworking over the end titles. By the way, for those who are interested in ""Monkeys"" (see the bob-the-movie-man.com glossary) there is a scene a few minutes into the credits featuring Strange and one of the Avengers (fairly pointless) and a second right at the end of the credits featuring Pangborn and Mordo setting up (not very convincingly I must say) the potential villain for Strange 2.Not Shakespeare, but still an enjoyable and fun night out at the movies and far better than I was expecting.(Agree?

Marvel A-Z,"Took the boys to see Doctor Strange this afternoon on it's opening day here in the UK.The best way to describe it is enjoyable but very much to the Marvel formula they have been running with since Iron Man eight years ago. It's a typical superhero origin story where you can pretty much guess where the beginning, middle and end will fall and how they will play out. It still works, but might start to become boring for future standalone films for Black Panther and Ms Marvel if they stick to the same plan.What makes this work are the outstanding effects and the lead performances. The effects are seamless and flow perfectly into the story. I know that much has been made of the Matrix and Inception type of effects, but those on display here far surpass those two films. Look out for how the cape becomes almost a character on its own and you'll know what I mean.Fortunately the actors are not overpowered by the effects. Cumberbatch is superb as Strange, embodying not only the look of the sorcerer but the change in his manner throughout the film. Swinton is clearly enjoying herself in the type of role she doesn't usually get and gets some of the best action scenes. Ejofer and Mikkelsen are two of the best screen actors around at the moment and bring class to their slightly underwritten roles. Rachel McAdams also achieved a first for me in being tolerable on screen, though her part was largely non-existent.So in conclusion well worth seeing, though it suffers from a feeling a deja-vu and a slightly disappointing battle with the 'big bad' at the end.Oh and just to remind viewers to stay until after the credits where there is a more significant scene that that during the mid-credits",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Doctor StrangeThe worst part of being a medically trained super-hero is everybody wants a free diagnosis.Thankfully, the villain in this fantasy film is keeping their moles to themselves.When an accident leaves his hands mangled, noted neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeks out a powerful mystic (Tilda Swinton) in hopes of regaining mobility.Instead, the conceited clinician is introduced to an ancient magic that imbues him with the ability to cast-spells, travel between realms and astral project.Elsewhere, an embittered ex-student (Mads Mikkelsen) gathers the numinous articles needed to summon a dormant evil from the dark dimension and release it on New York.Intriguing enough for amateurs and faithful enough for diehards, this mind-bending adaptation of Marvel's Sorcerer Supreme is a masterpiece.

He's left with a palsy that makes being a surgeon out of the question unless you mean tree surgery.Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor John Strange and like Tyrone Power in The Razor's Edge he goes to the mystic east to find healing with the Ancient One, a gender bending guru played by Tilda Swinton. He learns a lot about the metaphysical nature of the earth and how worlds co- exist in the same space and how some chosen few like he's been chosen are guarding the portals between those worlds.

solid introduction,"New York neurosurgeon Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is brilliant and arrogant. His only friend is ex-love ER doctor Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams).

One of the best Marvel Movies!,"Doctor Strange is basically about Dr. Stephen Strange, A brilliant yet arrogant doctor. Who got in a car accident (As we all seen in Trailers.) And found The Ancient One in Nepal who got stunning powers then asked by Strange to teach him to become also a powerful human. I found this movie pretty damn great! Saw it on 2D, Even though it's not intense as 3D. You can still see the intensity, the awesomeness of this movie. The first Pro is Cumberbatch. He did a very great job in this movie. The visual effects is also very good. Even though it's not as good as The Avengers and The Winter Soldier. It's still a little better than Civil War. McAdams did also a really good job. I like her in Spotlight and Southpaw. I also like Chiwetel Ejiofor. I like him on 12 Years A Slave that's why i owe that on DVD.

The limits of suspended disbelief,"This was the most difficult of the Marvel Universe, for me, in which to suspend disbelief. When you take away a base line of reality, the whole universe has no stability or consequences, thus no dread, thus no failure. It's like with Doctor Who, if the sonic screwdriver can diagnose and remedy any problem, there is no adventure. This movie lies too close to that edge. I also felt the horizon shifting contortions were too abstract to imply real danger so the action became hollow for me. Although I give it points for CGI concepts and executions. There were excellent performances, Benedict Cumberbatch (with a flawless North American accent, no less) and Tilda Swinton are excellent performers and Rachel MacAdams can ring romance out of a dish cloth.

Doctor Strange Review,"Marvel introduces a new superhero Doctor Strange, to the Cinematic Universe. The comic book famous, Sorcerer Supreme was brought up to the big screen by Director, Scott Derrickson. The cast for Doctor Strange includes Benedict Cumberbatch playing Stephen Strange, Rachel McAdams playing Christine, Chiwetel Ejiofor playing Baron Mordor.Doctor Strange is the origin story of how a very successful surgeon ends up in a unexpected car5 crash, that ends up damaging the nerves in his hands. What other doctors would call incurable, Stephen Strange is left to find a way to cure himself but stumbles upon a way to gain unimaginable power. The story itself follows the comics in a way that, a comic book fan would be excited and normal everyday movie water would be stunned. Doctor strange brings new feeling to a superhero movies that the past movies could not.Benedict Cumberbatch who plays doctor strange was in a very intriguing role. Co-stars Rachel McAdams and Chiwetel Ejiofor help make doctor strange different and stand out from marvel other 13 movies in the MCU.Fans were excited to see how Benedict Cumberbatch will portray the character and after watching the movie i could say he does the character justice. Benedict cumberbatch said this when asked about him being casted as doctor strange, ""Excited. Really excited. There's a lot of work to be done and i'm just at the beginning of it all so i'm not going to talk too much about it but it's a thrilling gig to get. I just can't wait. Very excited.""With stunning special effects that would even make you feel like magic is real, Doctor Strange introduced Magic into the MCU, which open up an entirely different universe. This allows an entertaining movie to become a visually stunning entertaining movie that would leave you wanting more. The graphics will wow you before the story even begins. Doctor strange has such a great visual aspect that if you don't like the story at least the visual aspects will blow you away.Doctor Strange is an incredible movie and i recommend it to everyone. Acting 9/10, Benedict Cumberbatch nails the role as Stephen Strange. Visual aesthetics 10/10, this movie sets the bar for the best appearance. Story 8/10, follows the comics but may not please everyone. Doctor strange is a great movie and is a must watch for any comic book fan.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great special effects; nothing else. No story, no humor, nothing clever","This was one of the greatest disappointments to me as a movie. There are great (if repetitive) special effects. Very impressive, they must have enormous computational power to achieve this. But are special effects enough to make a movie? I don't think so. There is really no story. No tension. Why no mind-games? One might expect these with Benedict Cumberbatch as the lead. Why wasn't Dr. Strange faced with some terrible ethical dilemma? The climactic scene is pathetic, with no drama, no suspense. Do truly evil beings REALLY always keep their word?

Best movie I've seen in a decade,"Absolutely stunning movie, far exceeded expectations. Everything in it just works.I'm not a big movie goer, but I had huge expectations for this one, so I went to see it 3D in pre-premier, and I was absolutely blown away by the beauty and magic and absolute fantastic storytelling in this movie. By far the best Marvel movie yet.The characters are real and believable and both main and supporting characters have good character development, as far as will fit in a single movie. The plot works. It's a lot of new material, but it's introduced well and it just makes sense. Nowhere in the movie are you wondering what's going on or why.Doctor Strange is a complicated character in the comic books, and Marvel did an amazing job at translating it to the screen in an original and breath taking way. He's a hard to like character, but they've managed to make him charming. And I absolutely loved how well they handled introducing magic. This isn't kiddie-TV-show magic, or apologetic-well-its-sorta-science like we're used to, this is gorgeous and powerful and credible. The excellent special effects certainly helped bring everything to life.Even if you're not into superhero movies, this works just great as a stand alone.

Another Marvel Masterpiece,"It's what the MCU has been known for and that's delivering characters we care about. Yes, the powers and action is usually very cool but without texture and depth, would it matter?Just look at the other big budget films this year. The reason most of them fell flat (BvS, Suicide Squad, ID Resurgence, Star Trek Beyond) is because every one of them delivered shallow lead characters that didn't connect emotionally with the audience. They were all written poorly. It's clear that in each case the action beats were written before the actual story and then pieced in to a sloppy script. With Marvel, it's clear that story and character comes first. Then, they unleash FX teams that are second to none.The case with Doctor Strange may be an all-time bench mark because while nailing the depth they went above and beyond in terms of visuals. What hits the screen is all-time amazing and will certainly earn many an award. Still, without character depth, it wouldn't mean as much.

A good way to introduce magic into the MCU,"I really like the character of Doctor Strange, and they manage to introduce him in a really good way, his story despite being simple is still interesting and keeps your attention at all time. The special effects used in the movie are very creative and you wish you could see more of those. The problem of the movie comes in the first half of it. That part of the story despite being simple but effective, after watching it a couple times, it feels too simple, it beginning to be actually interesting on the second half, leaving the first half a little empty and forgettable. And it also feels a littlo too slow at times. And as a side note, the comedy for me doesnt work most of the time, the best jokes are just mildly funny while the others break with the rythm and just dont make me laugh. Still with all those mistakes, I still really like this movie for managing to be very entertaining despite a boring first half.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Dr Strange backstory was an engaging one and made you think that this movie could be different to all those other adaptations of comic book characters.Sadly, it was not to be.

An expert surgeon injures his hands.

Some of the characters are different gender than the comics and it works even better.I can not think of anything I did not like about this movie.

Takes The Comic Book Genre To The Highest Level,"You can rest assured that Doctor Strange is an astoundingly amazing movie and YES as good as any Marvel origin movie to date.

The critics all agree (as if that matters) and they are single-handedly saving 2016 in movies.This movie really takes the comic book genre to the highest level. It reinvents epic adventure by ""Marvelizing"" characters by making them more believable and more relatable. Then, they deliver visuals unlike anything that you've ever seen before. They certainly deliver a movie with as much feeling as it has action and intensity. It's a movie that has a wonderful balance that delivers intelligence with its fun.

Quack Handed,"Strange is a better ensemble character than a lead, and I enjoyed him far more in his supporting outings. All that and it's not nearly STRANGE enough. MCU films are usually a watered-down concept made safe for complex box office reasons but this one stings the most as you could have really gone to town here. The psychedelic touches are way too light and Giacchino is hobbled to only a few proggish touches in the score which you only really get to hear over the credits. The big complex twisty set pieces and the finale particularly, in deference to most MCU films, are the only interesting things in the film. The core story is weepingly thin, with McAdams apparently ""intentionally underwritten"" character like a ghost. Built upon the captivating story of an arrogant rich surgeon becoming an arrogant rich sorcerer which could only be of interest to men who buy fancy leather watches. So it has something else in common with Inception apart from the twisty architecture then.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Stranger Things,"For Doctor Strange being the fourteenth outing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe you would be forgiven for wondering whether by now things had become rote, stale and all too predictable as the allotted characters slot into place. It is with great enthusiasm and joy then that I can report that this entry is bar Guardians of the Galaxy, Marvel's riskiest outing to date.Stephen Strange is an egotistical, cocky, suave son-of-a-bitch and yeah as it turns out he is also a doctor; one that only helps those that have a 100% chance of being fixed up or cured. One day though he has a terrible accident leaving his hands broken and therefore any hope of him continuing his work is soon put to rest. Upon learning of a secret temple that may be able to fix him he travels and is taught the wise old ways of an ancient being. Soon Dr Strange will be the only hope that this world has to be saved from the oncoming doom that threatens it.First things first let's get the bad out of the way and then onto the great. Rachel McAdams is fine as Christine Palmer (I had to look up her name beforehand, never a good sign) but is sadly underwritten. She has no depth, we know as much as she had a relationship with Strange, conflicted as it may have been. But we don't actually know her as a person, given this much time, eight years in fact it's sad that Black Widow remains the only female character in the Marvel Universe that has been served well. A minor quibble to be sure but the product placement in the first act at least is irritating and shoved blatantly in your face. To the point of embarrassment with Adidas and Coke being the main culprits if you require solid proof.The acting talent here though is supreme, from Cumberbatch to Mikkelson. Cumberbatch of course imbues personality and a roughness of edge to his character without borrowing too heavily from Robert Downey Jr's performance as Iron Man. You only care more about him as the film approaches its truly dazzling climax that is a wonder to behold. Mikkelson's character may not be the easiest to sympathise or come to terms with but he's always intriguing to watch (Casino Royale was proof ten years ago) so it's a shame it's taken this long again for him to come into the fold as a central villain, that get this, actually poses a threat to our heroes.The action dazzles; a mix of Star Trek's action pounding thrills and humour in the strangest of places with a dash of the visual wonder of 2001: A Space Odyssey for good measure. It must be said that it is not often if at all that I compare a Blockbuster to Kubrick's masterwork. Marvel once again defies expectations and for once a film in their universe does not climax with a gigantic blue lazer beaming up into the sky. Yes the consequences of the battle may be earth shattering but the film is too steeped in its lore and characters for it to be formulaic in its approach in the slightest. It borrows off of Inception without feeling like a rip off and mixes up the Marvel formula just enough to ensure that a feeling of seeing this all too often and before, not once, not even for a fleeting second seeps into the picture. DC could learn a trick or two from Marvel and perhaps may need to if they are to ensure their survival.Scott Derrickson is to be sure a strange (see what I did there) choice for this project, not least because the majority of films with him at the helm have been horrors and none taken to all that kindly by critics. Based on his work on Doctor Strange however, should be a primer for things to come; intelligence, craftsmanship and action handled with rare skill and offering up sympathy for its characters.Doctor Strange is best viewed off of impulse with knowing very little about the title character. Its central romance may be underwhelming but rest assured that this is the only element of the entirety of the film that disappoints. The action thrilling, the stakes personal, real and potent, the characters interesting and a film lover's wet dream come to life in terms of the visuals anyhow. If you pass up the chance to see Marvel's latest on the big screen then maybe it's time that you had your mind expanded tooA",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Solid example of the classic superhero origin story, but with some flaws.","Doctor Strange follows the typical Marvel action formula that's worked so well in the past few years. It serves as the film's strength, but also highlights some of the weak points. Benedict CumberBatch shines as a brilliant surgeon who is humbled after a tragic accident.Without spoiling the plot, He goes on a mission to regain his lost talents. Eventually Strange finds his true calling as a Sorcerer, and changes his life forever. This film has some of the best visual representation of plot events that I've ever seen. The reality bending action scenes showcase outstanding cinematography and realistic choreography. Shots are edited in a uniquely frantic matter during each fighting scene. The plot was decent overall, but it borrows heavily from previous superhero origin movies like Iron Man and Batman Begins. In addition, the story can feel a little rushed and more time could be focused on Strange's development as a Sorcerer.

Psychedelic wizard kung fu,"As a once passionate comics fan, most often Marvel, I wasn't overly familiar with Dr. Strange, so I can't speak to how closely the film hewed to the canon. The casting was decent; I almost always like Mikkelsen, Cumberbatch, et al. The visuals-which I'm generally unimpressed by since almost anything can be done to a degree-were fantastic: psychedelic, dazzling, pretty. The story was OK, but I found the action itself played out mostly like another kung fu movie with a huge budget. I guess there's a challenge in providing an entertaining enough movie about sorcerers battling, but the battle sequences were sorta boring. Over all it was an entertaining watch, and I'm interested to see Strange shoehorned into the crowded movie Marvel universe.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

New York Stranger,"I think I've only read a few Doctor Strange Marvel Comics in my time which meant I could approach this introduction to the character with a fairly open mind. I must admit I was impressed.As ever, there's a lengthy origin sequence showing us just how arrogant, self-confident and ultimately selfish super-surgeon Dr Stephen Strange (yes he is a real doctor and yes that is his real name!) is before his inevitable fall from grace, in the form of a near-fatal car-crash the lasting impact of which, wouldn't you know it, affects his hands.So our hero heads East, as you do ,- it's a wonder he didn't bump into Batman and Iron Fist along the way, for a mystical answer to his problems where he comes under the tutelage of tough-teacher-cum-guru Tilda Swinton. This however only serves to drag Strange into a cross-dimensional war between good and evil, fought on three different battlefields, London, New York and Hong Kong, up against Kaecilius, the dastardly fallen angel of the sect and it all ends up with inevitably, the future of the world at stake in a big shakedown with a big-faced monster called Dormammu. Funny how these chance encounters in the Multiverse usually end up this way...It's as crazy as all get-out but the wonderfully imaginative C-Gen SFX scenes give the movie such a lift. A simple but effective use of green and purple camera filters matching those of Strange's later costume provide an intriguing and otherworldly, not to say enchanting exercise for the senses. Other much more complex set-ups, such as Strange's near-death, out of body experiences, shape-shifting, collapsible buildings, time-reversals in Hong Kong and a never-ending time-loop at the climax all add to the fun.Absolute hokum it may be but the near-psychedelic cinematography where you often feel like you're on the inside of a kaleidoscope, makes the film highly watchable. Benedict Cumberbatch must have been a big catch for Marvel at the time, it's just a shame that despite looking the part, he does such a poor American accent and is saddled with a dislikeable, flippant personality, whose idea of humour is to forever try to make unfunny jokes referencing contemporary pop-culture.No matter, once I parked my reservations on the character, I settled down to drink in this full-on blockbuster which just goes to show that sometimes the lesser-known comic characters seem to allow the director to use their seemingly untrammeled imagination, as here, to really go for it.Here it certainly paid off in a distinctive big-budget feature unafraid to take chances and one which is often beautiful, visually stimulating and exciting to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

In the past year I've rewatched the movie twice and I can say that this movie is def one of the better movies Marvel has put out.The movie looks INCREDIBLE. And is arguably one of the best, if not the best, looking MCU movies. The cgi is top notch.Cumberbatch does a great job with Steven Strange and immediately became one of the best in the MCU. The movie overall has good acting and it just flows well. The story is good but my favorite part is the message behind the movie. I think it is something we can all relate to.Rating : 7.7/10 - highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A mind bending film better than inception,"I must say after watching the 2, Doctor Strange was the film that really enraptured me. While at the end of the day, Doctor Strange was to many 'just another marvel film', that may not necessarily make it a bad thing, of which i would say that this is already one of the better ones, with a fresh concept that encroaches into confusing (in a good way)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor trip,"Doctor Strange is one of the most underrated Marvel films of Phase 3 and among Marvel's best solo movies, Benedict Cumberbatch is perfectly casted, I really can't think of anyone else playing one of my favorite Marvel superheroes.It also has one of the best MCU villains, the best vfx we've ever gotten from Marvel, and a great story.Doctor Strange has some of the best visual effects I've ever seen in my life, they are magical and incredibly trippy, the final sequence is eye popping and the villain is chilling.Rachel McAdams doesn't get too much screen time and they struggled with what to do with her, and some of the film felt rushed at parts, but that's pretty much the only flaws I can see with the film.But Doctor Strange is a feast for the eyes, a trip for the mind, and everything in between.And I'm gonna give it an A-",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just the Beginning.,"Dr. Stephen Strange is a successful neurosurgeon. He commits an accident and lives in a pathetic situation. His shivering hands made him under stress and trauma. Then, he discovers about some Buddhists in Nepal who could cure him. There he meets a world of magic and super powers.Apart from stunning visual effects, the movie is a perfect formula made. Of course that's exactly what we can expect. The movie can remind you of many films you have seen before, it's like a sweet nostalgia. More could be done, but I guess it was reserved for the sequel.#KiduMovie",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
My favourite origin story from MCU,"To be honest when I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with the trend after Infinity War, Dr Strange was probably one of those movies I was really looking forward to. I didn't know anything about Dr Strange, but I found him really cool looking (yep, the same thing as Captain America; you can check out my review for The First Avenger if you want). A cool, cape wearing man using magic to open portals and create yellow beams? Count me in! And trust me when I say this movie is even better than what I was expecting it to be.Dr Stephen Strange is just a casual minded, gifted doctor who is filthy rich and a playboy. Basically the medical version of Tony Stark. And after the accident he loses his power of using his hands. The very thing that made him special is taken away from him because of one moment of carelessness. I actually shrieked in pain when I saw his hands stitched. And then seeing him unable to use his hands left me in introspection. I had never realised how much I use my hands to do my everyday things.And then he goes to Kathmandu to get find the sorceress who could heal him. The thieves who came to attack him also left me in introspection - what would I do if something like that happens to me? He is saved by one of the wizards and is taken to the Ancient One. She teaches him to be a wizard. I rarely like the training montages in movies, but this one is an exception, especially when the handless man makes the spiral. The part where he steals the books from the library is also very funny.The hospital fight scene, the portals fight scene and the Dormammu scenes were all fun to watch. A lot happens in the movie and I don't want to give too much detail from it, so I'll just get to what all I like about this movie. The visuals are simply gorgeous, to say the least, the score absolutely suits it, Benedict Cumberbatch's performance as Dr Strange is just like his comic counterpart, every scene is fun to watch as it's either funny or engaging and a huge amount of character development happens throughout the movie.Doctor Strange is my favourite MCU movie based on one character, and my second favourite after Avengers: Infinity War. If I have to show a ""preview"" of what MCU is all about to someone who has no interest in the franchise (like my sister for example), I'd show them this movie, since I'm absolutely confident that they'd love it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"When do people get tired of Marvel stuff and their ""treatments""?","I can't say that I belong to the target audience of superhero films, but I do not exclude them; well, several of them have given me good moments and memories. Also, I do not declare that special effects would necessarily kill the idea or watching pleasure, particularly when looking back on movies decades ago when the technology level did not permit to include out-of-this-world or sci-fi elements in a way in conformity with the rest of the movie... But still, at present, I tend to come across that flashes and effects constitute the main frame/value of a work.Most of the above applies also to Doktor Strange, where even good character actors have limited opportunities to show their talent, when dialogues - even when witty - are artificially constructed, and the pre- ending scenes are predictable and consisting with action in the main. Yes, all is visually great and without ""bastings"", but the movie itself lacks novel approach and visions, resembling a known fairy-tale in a different sauce. Costumes and masks are great, but versatile actors tend to use their facial expressions and body movements while producing a wonderful role...Acting 9 points, script 5 or so, in total - 7. To me, the weakest movie with Cumberbatch involved - whom I admire a lot. On the other hand, I comprehend that fame and acclaim is often based on the number of viewers, and so more versatile roles are about to come.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Nearly two hours of mindless CGI,"I must confess that superhero films do not have me jumping up and down with excitement as they appear to be aimed at twelve-year-olds and those who need to see non-stop explosions and destruction to hold their attention. The first Batman with Nicholson was entertaining and funny, even the original Superman films had reasonable plots and enterainment value but Marvel and DC took the whole genre in a new direction As time has gone by, each successive superhero film reduces the human element while increasing the special effects and CGI. Doctor Strange has taken all this to a new level - I doubt if more than five minutes were filmed without using blue screens. It's sad to see the film industry deteriorate to the level where garbage like this draws huge box-office, encouraging more of the same trash to be produced. Hollywood's obsession with PC plotting and characters has lowered standards even further. The few intelligent films being produced for audiences prepared to follow a character-driven plot struggle to make a profit so we appear to be stuck with superheroes for the foreseeable future.",2.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Shockingly good comic based movie.,"I didn't have particularly high expectations for this film and was pleasantly surprised. CGI is on full display but it's well incorporated into the story rather than being something which blasts you in the face the entire movie.Characters are entertaining, Benedict Cumberbatch is exceptional as (almost) always. Story has gravity to it and there's a nice balance of being ""deep"" without feeling like a lecture from your parents. As a movie on it's own, I'd give this a solid 8 but have to give another point just for being so much better than most Marvel/ superhero films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Top notch marvel storytelling,"Doctor Stephen Strange is an incredibly gifted neurosurgeon and one of the best in his field, but a man engorged in his own ego. After a tragic accident driving his high end sports car, his fingers are totally mangled leaving him lost and he loses his profession from being unable to preform the work. Strange is then plunged into obsession to fix his hand unsuccessfully, this bleeds him dry. Yearning to apply his gifts he seeks out guidance which lands him in Nepal where he learns to use the strength of his mind to heal his body with the help from the mythic arts he is able to tap into his metaphysical abilities giving him the sort of purpose that not even his past profession could even fathom. Once Strange is introduced to the Ancient one, he must once again focus on his skill and any deductions he notices to tap into the depths of his being in order to overcome this intensive power struggle.This is by far some of the prettiest visuals you'll see in a Marvel film its quite honestly top notch in my opinion. The cast also a great strength of the film in my humble opinion Benedict Cumberbatch was born to play a Marvel superhero i mean that name is pretty badass and really iconic already. The roots of this film ties into the entire Marvel universe so beautifully. As you continue through The Infinity Saga you pick up on things from this film even years later, thats amazing storytelling and as every last film of the Saga was successful this story was executed magically.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Decent intro to the mystic arts.,"Going on to about a dozen films or so in the Marvel Universe, there comes a point when you have to present something new to the audience. Everyone was on board with the individual films, which led to the team up of the Avengers. People were blown away with how well they pulled that off. Shift to the second phase of films and we get some decent and generic sequels. Knowing early on that they had to spice things up a bit, Marvel took a chance on some third party characters, hoping that they were unique enough to be considered ""refreshing"". So we are introduced to Guardians and Ant-Man. This seemed to hold the fans attention for a bit longer. Now were closing in on another set of films and I'm sure Marvel was asking themselves, what can we show them now? Their answer is Doctor Strange. A wonderful kaleidoscope of imagery to grab your attention, despite the same tepid story Marvel has been chugging out for years now. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, the movies are all good in my book, but I feel that the spectacle will not be the only offering people want in the next phase of films.Strange is a genius surgeon, the best in his field. The only thing that matches his talents is his arrogance...hmmm, sounds like another goatee wearing hero on the marvel universe. Anyway, one night while driving, he ends up in a terrible accident, which destroys his hands. Determined not to live a life of mediocrity, believing he is better than that, Strange dedicates his life to bettering himself. The search takes him to some far corners of the earth and opens his eyes to a new healing power, the power of magic. Quickly learning his new formed powers, Strange must battle some guy who has some evil plan....this is where the story gets a little generic and forgettable. So forgettable, that I forget the villains name, I only remember that he was played by Mads Mikkelsen.That has been one universal issue that everyone agrees on when it comes to Marvel films. The lack of a compelling villain. Save for Loki, the Marvel films have continuously dropped the ball in this department. They seemed to try and steer back into the right direction with this year's Civil War, but Strange seems to throw them back down a peg as Mikkelsen is not given enough screen time to shine. Before I look anything up, if I recall correctly. He was a former student of the Ancient One, who has suffered some personal loss. This turns him evil and he teams up with a giant cloud monster to bring the destruction of earth. Hmm, some pretty hollow motivation if you ask me. So I'll copy and paste some info from the Marvel wiki to clear some of that motivation up.Kaecilius was a sorcerer and a former member of the Masters of the Mystic Arts who became disillusioned with the Ancient One when he felt his mentor was not allowing other dimensions to come to Earth, which he believed could reunite him with his deceased wife and son. He formed the Zealots with the intention of defeating the Ancient One and bringing the inter-dimensional being known as Dormammu to Earth.So with this new information in my mind, I still stand by the fact that these films tend to drop the ball on the villains. So where does the film excel? Well, for starters the aforementioned Ancient One, played by Tilda Swinton. I'll admit, at first I was not a fan of her. Her alien like features and dramatic turns seemed to turn me off of her acting in previous films, but I have since developed a new found appreciation for her. I guess if she sticks to genre flicks or quirky comedies, I like her. She is the highlight in Doctor Strange for me. Cumberbatch does well enough for himself, he plays the arrogant jerk to perfection, but he will have more time to develop that role. For now, this film belongs to Swinton. Rounding out the rest of the supporting cast is Chiwetel Ejiofor, with an irritating character arc and Rachel McAdams, relegated to being the girlfriend sidekick.I mentioned earlier the kaleidoscope imagery...I literally meant that. The background images of this film were obviously inspired by the images one would find looking through the glass of the toy. Strange takes the Inception leveled effects and kicks it up a notch and to great effect. These visuals are what makes the film stand out from the other entries. Strange's first venture into other dimensions is trippy enough to warrant a viewing.Doctor Strange is another generic entry into the Marvel franchise, but those generic entries are still pretty damn entertaining. The film fumbles with the villain and some forced comedic bits that don't land, but is strong enough entertaining you that you might not mind. It cleverly sidesteps the usual ""city destruction"" climax and turns it on its head. Doctor Strange is a welcomed addition to the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Spellbinding Adventure,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Doctor Strange. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired October 13, 2016. It has a runtime of 1 hour and 55 minutes. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by Scott Derrickson, it was also created by Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko.Summary: Dr. Stephen Strange, a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon whose life takes a dramatic turn after an accident. When traditional medicine fails him, he embarks on a journey to Nepal in search of healing and enlightenment under the guidance of The Ancient One. This transformative experience opens his eyes to the multiverse and the profound powers of magic.Review: -I liked how quickly the movie escalated in intensity. I found the casting to be exceptional; the actors were perfectly suited to their roles, and their performances resonated authentically within the film's narrative. I appreciated the film's humour, which adeptly intertwines comedic elements with serious themes, making it both engaging and thought-provoking. The movie cleverly subverts traditional superhero narratives by featuring a flawed protagonist whose journey is shaped more by significant internal conflicts than by external battles. It illustrates that failure is an essential part of personal growth, as the character faces numerous setbacks that ultimately contribute to his evolution into a more capable hero. Throughout the narrative, Doctor Strange learns that his extraordinary powers come with considerable responsibility. This theme aligns with progressive ideals regarding accountability in leadership, resonating strongly with contemporary audiences. I appreciated how the film addresses mental health issues, including trauma and recovery, while challenging conventional notions of masculinity by highlighting vulnerability. However, I acknowledge that some viewers might feel uncomfortable with the depiction of mental health struggles, as it risks trivializing serious conditions and implies that mystical solutions can substitute for medical treatment. I appreciated the exploration of themes such as humility, acceptance, and the pursuit of knowledge beyond one's own understanding. Doctor Strange's journey underscores the significance of relinquishing ego and embracing new perspectives, which resonates with values often cherished by those who prioritize social consciousness. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue. I was happy that it told us what was being said when it was in another language.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Wide shots effectively establish the expansive mystical landscapes and intricate architecture, setting the scene for the film's unique environments. Close-ups delve into the emotional depth of characters, particularly highlighting Doctor Strange's transformative journey from neurosurgeon to sorcerer. Over-the-shoulder shots foster intimacy during character dialogues, drawing viewers into their interactions. Point-of-view shots immerse the audience in Doctor Strange's initial encounters with magic and alternate dimensions, enhancing the psychedelic experience. Tracking shots follow characters through diverse settings, conveying a sense of motion, while aerial shots provide sweeping views of cities and landscapes that emphasize scale. Dutch angles create a feeling of disorientation during intense action sequences and surreal moments, whereas slow motion underscores key dramatic events.I think the film exceled in its breath-taking CGI, particularly in the Mirror Dimension, where cityscapes morph into surreal landscapes. This visual creativity not only captivates but also deepens the narrative by distorting physics and immersing viewers. Advanced rendering techniques enhance intricate details and fluid movements, giving action sequences a dreamlike quality while elevating stunts and fantastical elements. The use of motion tracking and capture technologies ensures seamless interaction between digital effects and live actors, allowing for realistic character movements and expressions that reflect authentic human behaviour. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.-I enjoyed meeting the characters and learning about Doctor Strange's story, particularly as I discovered new elements alongside him. His character development was compelling, and the relationships he formed, especially with the Ancient One, emphasized themes of mentorship and community support over individualism. I appreciated Christine Palmer's portrayal as a competent and independent woman, which contributed to strong female representation in the film. However, I would have liked to see her have more screen time than she ultimately received.-I found the conclusion to be quite satisfying, and after watching this movie, Doctor Strange has now secured a place among my top five favourite Marvel characters. I eagerly anticipate what lies ahead for him. I was happy to discover two cleverly integrated extra scenes during the credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 7.7 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Strangeception,"One could see heavy influences from the movie Inception. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it was also not new.The effects are good and the cumber batches his role quite well as usual. I also had quite a few laughs during the movie. However the extremely weak bad guy in terms of the characters just not being very exciting brought some flaws to the movie.I just couldn't get as invested as I was with Winter Soldier or Civil War. Doctor Strange has potential though to be an excellent addition to the MCU and we'll have to see where they go with him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"""Forget Everything You Think You Know.""","Before this movie, my only real exposure to Doctor Strange was in The Spider-Man animated series. So seeing this film was a good way to know more about the character.Doctor Strange follows Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), an arrogant neurosurgeon who's among the best in his profession. When he loses the use of his hands after an accident, he travels to the land of Kamar-Taj to find a way to fix them. There he meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), the Master of the Mystic Arts, and Karl Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who offer to instruct him in the ways of sorcery. He then gets involved in a magical war against the Ancient One's former student Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who wants to obtain the powers of the Sorcerer Supreme for himself and gain immortality.Doctor Strange is another fairly straightforward hero's journey. Strange loses his hands, something he really values, and on a quest to fix them, ends up gaining something more meaningful. Sure, this kind of story has been told numerous times, but the thing with Marvel is that they're always able to sell it in a way that feels fresh. This is largely due to the vast number of different characters they have at their disposal. These characters manage to make us care about the story.Benedict Cumberbatch is great as the title character. He manages to sell Strange's arrogance as well as you'd hope, and it makes his eventual maturity into a wiser man all the more worth investing in. Of course, Cumberbatch also turns out to have great comedy side, leading to some pretty funny moments between him and his fellow sorcerers.Ejiofor's Mordo is such a fascinating character to watch. He's fiercely loyal to the Ancient One, and his friendship with Strange is also engrossing. This movie tests Mordo's loyalty to his friends in several ways, and it leads to him becoming strongly disillusioned with the ways of magic by the end. I'm really looking forward to seeing more of him in the future; hell, if Marvel plays their cards right (and they probably will), Mordo could end up becoming one of the MCU's best villains.Meanwhile, Wong (Benedict Wong) ends up becoming an entertaining foil to Strange. He's a no-nonsense librarian as well as a skilled sorcerer, but he too has great comic timing. I especially liked his first foray into pop music and the funny bit with him laughing at the end of the film.Mikkelsen's Kaecilius is a fairly interesting villain for this film; he makes Strange question people's concept of right and wrong and how far they're willing to go to protect the world. The Ancient One makes for a great mentor to Strange, and Swinton's performance is excellent.The action scenes are so entertaining; the Cloak of Levitation is its own character with its movements and behaviors, city blocks twist and turn and everything in between, and the time-travel hijinks allow for even more visual-effects goodness.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun ride for Saturday night,"If you like Benedict Cumberbatch in Sherlock you will enjoy this adventure as well. If you are also in awe with the idea of Matrix, this movie is for you for sure.

I only think that the movie was too condensed and the plot was rushed, series would be the right format for this story, in my opinion.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
By the numbers fluff,"I'd read some gushing reviews about this film in the press that claimed it was a masterpiece of originality, so I decided to go watch it. My gut instinct with superhero films is that if they're made by Marvel they are very formulaic and if they're made by DC they tend to be an overlong mess. This film just confirmed that I should trust my gut instinct. Benedict Cumberbatch is well cast, in fact I don't think I could quibble with any of the actors performances, but the script was a typical superhero origin film with no surprises. They gave Dr Strange spiritual powers instead of the usual ""medical experiment gone wrong""scenario, but that just added to the feeling of overall silliness about this film. Nothing in the script made me care about any of the characters and plot-wise this was an attempt at ripping off the Matrix but with magic instead of Kung fu etc. And for the umpteenth time in one of these films it ended with a big CGI fight to save the world. I mean really? Can't these people come up with anything different? The sight of Cumberbatch and the rest running around the city streets in their silly capes and LOTR style costumes was laughable. I've seen some terrible films this year, like Suicide Squad, Star Trek Beyond, Ghostbusters, Batman v Superman, Independence Day, Magnificent Seven, to name just a few. What a complete lack of originality we're having dumped on us this year. I think Independence Day was the worst one but this runs it pretty close.

#Movie Review,"Doctor Strange (2016) is a solid movie! As the story unfolds you quickly get captivated by this new magnific universe. Great performance by Benedict Cumberbatch I enjoyed seeing him on screen. Probably the best thing about this movie is the visuals. They are stunning!A few things bothered me and they go as follows :
1. Pacing problems : There are things happening on the screen but you don't know how much time has passed or any time references . Doctor Strange's journey seems a bit similar to Batman Begins but I feel like they handled the essence of time better in that movie.2. Underwhelming villain : They should have added more depth to the villain's character. There is no tension built when it comes to the villain and it seems like there are no stakes involved and that he is just a fancy generic bad guy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The best MCU film,"The MCU is a collection of fun films. But they are at their best when they have a lighter tone; the films repeatedly stumble when they try to invoke serious issues or real world horrors. This is why the more comedic entries-i.e. Ant-Man, Ant-Man and the Wasp, The Guardians of the Galaxy etc.-play a lot better than the more grimdark ones-i.e. Age of Ultron, Endgame etc. Doctor Strange manages to have a more serious story-it is about a very smart man being humbled by what he doesn't know-while have a very trippy vibe and a goofy tone.The film is such gleeful nonsense; but it is so committed to that nonsense that film sweeps the viewer up into its world. A lot of this has to do with visuals. The mystic visuals are fully realized and you feel like dropping acid while watching them. Best the film is willing to push the CGI into some expressiveness and not all shots try to replicate the camera. Oh and the fights scenes are really engaging.A guess a person could complain the story adheres too closely to an origin story. Yeah the basic story is more or less Iron Man and/or Ant-Man. But the film manages to shuffle the tropes so they seem new. And the climax-and how it reflects the initiating incident- is the best bit of writing in the MCU. Doctor Strange's story starts because of a car crash in which Stephen was too distracted to experience the moment-he was everywhere but being in the moment. The climax of the film is quite literally nothing but Doctor Strange staying-eternally-in a singular moment. It is a really clever solution to the plot while reinforcing the themes and characters. I hope who ever came up with it got a bonus.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Sorcerer Supreme,"Marvel Doctor Strange is The MCU's leap into the world of Magic. We Follow the story of Dr. Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch), an acclaimed neurosurgeon, who after a car accident renders his hands useless. Months of throwing his saving away trying to find a treatment. Soon hears of a secret location Kamar-Taj that might offer the cure. Arriving he finds out that it's a sanctuary of Sorcerers led by a woman called the ancient one(Tilda Swinton) who protects the multiverse from interdimensional threats. Seeking only to fix his hands Stephen reluctantly gets dragged into a mystic battle, when a renegade Sorcerer threatens to combine their realm with another one ruled by the dark overlord Dormammu. This is a movie that feels like just ecstatic alone its feels like one of the most ambiguous comic book Films. The MCU succeeded in bringing the Avengers to the big screen. The films played it safe for the most part and kept the Action to Earth. Then Guardians of the Galaxy came out and it took us to the Stars, to explore other planets. While Thor hinted at the magic it wasn't really in tune with the rest of the Film. Doctor Strange gives that mystic wonderous it an all-around entertaining film that is a visual spectacle that does justice by viewing on a large screen. In taking clear inspiration from both the 70s comics and films like inception with the mirror dimension. It showcases various abstract imagery and psychedelic colors. The cast all do a good job. Benedict Cumberbatch of course as Strange much Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark is a spitting image of the character. He's arrogant and self-righteous, egotistic. He's a jerk, yet a good guy, and in many ways is very charming. I also like the connection between him and Mordo, the whole student mentor concept is handled well. In many ways, you can see the contradiction between the two of them. Wong is awesome he gets some funny moments. Tilda Swinton has one the lesser impact on the film, Yeah unfortunately she's not a Tibetan old man, but she does get some moments in the film. It just feels like there should have been focus given to her with her connection with Mardo and Kaecilius and being the one to push Stephen into the role as the Sorcerer Supreme. Same with Mads Mikkelsen he's a great actor and has played serious villains before in other things. Le Chiffre from Casino Royale and Hannibal from the tv series. Kaecilius is a very bland and generic villain much like a lot of the villains in the MCU. He would have worked better on the side while Dormammu was more in the spotlight. Overall Doctor Strange is a fun and entertaining film while the story is basic where it doe shine the best with its style and Mystic tone.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not as good as I expected,"So, we are getting magical now. From the trailer I was hoping for a thrill ride of a movie. I saw the movie in 3D and the Inception-like effects were the most anticipated by me to see. To be noted that I never felt sick by 3D but those effects were so 2005, like in a bad computer game, that a felt a little sick. The effects in Inception are top-notch compared to this version. I mean, Marvel Studios has now enough money to make great special effects, why are all the effects in the mirror dimension so bad? Remember Legolas from LotR jumping around? So bad were the effects. The other special effects of the movie were OK.The story was OK, but not great. There was never a real villain. Mads was great, as usual, but the role was not interesting enough. The Ancient One was not good at all, just annoying. This was a very bad role for Tilda, who was always great, but now... she is just not convincing. She was just there, stiff, forgettable and bland.Forget about the plot holes, just focus of the fact that Dr. Strange saves the Earth just a few scenes after he learns how to open a door to another dimension/ place. Maybe his photographic memory is helping him, but he has no time to practice, he just beats wizards that practice magic for some years now, and he also is smart enough to save the world. As the movie unfolds you have the feeling that from the learning of spells stage, Dr. Strange jumps directly to the saving the world, and it just feel like there were a lot of missing steps, or scenes. Maybe they will release an extended version, because like this, the movie feels chopped.I know that people are going to praise this movie, because everything Marvel is gold, but for me only the first movie of every superhero in the MCU was good. All the sequels were just bad, and cashed on the success of the franchise. Now Dr. Strange was not so good from the beginning, so there is place for improvement in the next one.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
ONE OF THE TOP SOLO MARVEL FLICKS,"Dr. Strange is awesome any way you watch it but I enjoyed it much more upon my second viewing. Which was years after my first time seeing it and just after Wandavision wrapped up. This film is the true origin story of Marvel's next phase that will explore and focus heavy on the Multiverse. It is also one of the more visually stimulating of the Marvel movies. I'd put it right up there with Ragnarok and both Guardians films. Definitely not only worth watching before going too deep into the new phase, but I think it's required.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Strange,"This was a solid origin story. I thought the writing for the origin was great, the writing for the whole movie in general was great. The plot of Strange trying to get his hands healed by trying to harness the mystic arts, then his becoming one of the most skilled, and being needed to help Mordo and Wong fight Dormomu and his followers was great. Since this is a brand new character joining the Marvel universe, we are always a little curious about how the acting will be and how well the character will be portrayed, all I can say is Benedict Cumberbatch was amazing, he played Strange perfectly. Not only did he do well, so did Chitwel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton, and Rachel McAdams. It is very rare to have the entire supporting cast in a movie play their roles to perfection. Everyone who has been in Marvel has played their roles well, but these actors did great. Lastly, the effects in this movie were some of the best I have ever seen. No wonder this movie got an Oscar nomination for visual effects. They were able to turn New York City inside out, the city was being folded, bended, and twisted. That alone was great, but they were also able to successfully do a fight between two ghosts (Spirit form, not dead) while someone in their real body was still in the room. They were also able to do what they did in New York, with the inside of buildings. Lastly, they were also able to create portals to different locations, I thought that was very cool.If you want to experience a visual masterpiece with a Marvel storyline and great acting, I severely recommend this movie, it was great all around.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Not one I love, but it is one I like","One of my least favourites so far in the MCU. Still a good film, no doubt.'Doctor Strange' features a lot of intrigue and lore, which is certainly interesting to see unfold. I just felt a few pacing issues, nothing that frustrated me but it just felt a little slow moving in moments. I still enjoyed it, the story is a pleasant one and all the effects look splendid.Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the lead role, I thoroughly enjoyed his performance.

Marvel meets Fantasy meets Harry Potter meets Escher,"Thor: ""So Earth has sorcerers now, huh?""Indeed, I wasn't sure which universe we were in when this movie started. It sure didn't seem like the Marvel universe which mostly consisted of science-fiction elements if we overlook the demi-god Thor.But now? We have magic, sorcerers, an Ancient One, the sorcerer supreme, a mirror dimension - and even a Cloak of Levitation reminding of Harry Potter's artefact, also being a cloak. The cool mirror dimension is clearly Escher'esque and it does Escher justice.Sherlock Holmes finds himself in a magical adventure mastering the arts of magic.

Really cool visuals,"Dr. Strange it's about a guy who discovers there's more to life and Earth than he knew, and it's in the discovery of these other worlds and possible abilities that he finds a purpose that should work towards his healing. One thing's for sure and that's the fact that the movie is extremely trippy. The ways the laws of physics and nature are distorted in various ways are indeed strange, but really cool. Buildings and entire cities fold in on themselves, people move through time and space, literal out of body experiences. It really is crazy but looks amazing. The film has a really good cast which also includes Rachel McAdams, Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mads Mikkelsen. The guys I thought did a great job in their supporting roles. The film manages to fit in plenty of action in what seems unusual of Marvel less than 2 hours. At the heart of it though is also a really good story. A lot of it is crazy trippy! But it's still a well told narrative. There's good dialogue with the occasional comedy thrown in. The relationship between Strange and Wong was particularly funny. I'm not sure how intentional it was but it came across like the movie had a religious current running through it. The idea of eternal life, which is central to many faiths, was a fairly important element to the story. There was also a sense that in order to see what is beyond this world you must dismiss what you think you know and truly believe in the higher power that exists. This is an interesting and unexpected theme ingrained within the story.On the whole, Dr strange is an exciting, funny, well written flick. The CGI looked really amazing. Benedict Cumberbatch was terrific. It had the feeling of a Marvel movie, but with a psychedelic twist. Very fun and enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"CAL-YOS-TRO, NOT CAG-LEE-OSTRO!","For me, the hard 'G' pronunciation of the Italian 'Cagliostro' really jarred --never heard it before--, and I see it was included in Goofs. However, it appears that like many mispronunciations, it has become accepted American usage. Tsk! It's like pronouncing lasagna 'la-sag-na' instead of 'la-zan-ya'. It makes the learned mystics sound ignorant.Another gaff is the pronunciation of 'primer', which is anyone's earliest school book. While it's spelled 'primer' as in other applications, it's pronounced with a short 'I' as though spelled 'primmer'. It's a somewhat antiquated term, so is not common in conversational English; thus someone reading it may have no clue that it should sound differently from other 'primers'.People certainly went to town on technical errors for this flick! It goes to show that filmmakers can't do too much research when presenting medical and scientific details.As far as the overall quality of this picture, the special effects are of course dazzling, and the humorous element is definitely welcome. I found it excessively violent, and soon wearied of battle after battle after battle-- but that's what Marvel appears to be all about, after all. I remember reading a few Dr. Strange comics in the late sixties, when Strange stood out refreshingly from the muscle-bound superhero crowd. It was disappointing when they took away his baggy trousers and put him in tights like the rest, but I wasn't really paying attention to Marvel comics at that point and read the underground variety when I read comics.But it's interesting to see what's being presented now that Marvel comics have been made so big and real on the screen. Nowadays anything that can be imagined can be made real for the moviegoer, though not all of us care to see all of it!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This Year's FANT4STIC,"This movie is astoundingly terrible. The first 45 minutes of the film feel like bad long exposition and yet nothing really happens, it's all just more mindless CGI farts from Disney marvel and the effects and style are obvious rip offs from Batman Begins and Inception(but better movies). The writing is all over the place and we don't get to know the characters, they're simply put there.Because Kevin Feige and Disney are in love with fart jokes,kiddie one liners of course we get to see and hear those (again!) and of course, more explosions (because why not).As for the characters: ancient One barely does anything in the whole movie, The emo looking guy (cant remember his name lol) is a one note villain, Doctor Strange phoned it in and The British Woman was NOT Ancient one at all, as expected she played some feminist(BECAUSE IT'S 2016).Finally, the big battle comes and nothing really happened, the world is being destroyed and the governments sit quiet.SPOILER ALERT!This movie has NO SOUL whatsoever, boring, badly acted, awful written, the worst movie of the year so far.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Aged really well,"Very underrated and not talked about enough when it comes to the MCU, a great origin story with an incredibly strong first two acts that also suffers a bit from a lacklustre third act.Benedict Cumberbatch is the casting that makes this film what it is, and that is saying a lot because this may be the best cast MCU solo film to date. The supporting cast is spectacular, Rachel McAdams can do no wrong and Chiwetel Ejiofor is a talent that was criminally wasted as the lead villain in this films atrocious sequel, similar to how Mads Mikkelsen is also wasted here. The problem with the villain of this film is that he is only given ONE scene to be a tiny bit relatable or have any human element to him, which Mikkelsen of course sells completely, but other than that he is as one-dimensional as every MCU villain is.The visual effects still look so beautiful and sharp, it's incredible how well utilised the CGI is with the storytelling. A great character arc for Doctor Stephen Strange that is elevated by stellar performances, the role of the villain isn't as weak as I remember it to be but it's still the weakest part.The decision not to allow Scott Derrickson to direct his own sequel to this film with horror elements that involve Nightmare and Mordo and instead making the atrocity that is Multiverse of Madness (2022) is the most frustrating thing the MCU has ever done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

None of the dialogue was special and I was fighting myself to stop it, but it was a boring day so I just stayed to the end.This is an introduction to Eastern mysticism and since I've been down that road and rejected it, I found the premise offensive.

"""A live action M.C.Escher puzzler...""","Horror writer/director Scott Derrickson, famed for Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose and Deliver Us From Evil, has his wicked way with Marvel's Doctor Strange, the 14th film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Derrickson is a big, self-proclaimed Doctor Strange fan and he even funded his own concept film to impress Marvel studios so he could direct. This franchise, without Doctor Strange, has already reaped a whopping estimated £10billion!Doctor Strange, or otherwise known as Stephen Vincent Strange is a strange character indeed, even for Marvel standards, being the first hero that dealt with magic and mysticism. First appearing as a filler in Strange Tales back in 1963 before getting his own origin story five issues later. His physical appearance was based on horror legend, Vincent Price, hence his middle name.Now, I've never been a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch and when I heard he was given the role I was originally put off, thinking, and I still do, that Game of Thrones' Aidan Gillen could have made a brilliant Strange. But, Cumberbatch does good, playing the egotistical, super-surgeon who goes in search of some mystical healing and ends up something stranger. He looks the part, acts the part and I even forgot for most of the movie that he was Cumberbatch. I think he's done a better job than what Joaquin Phoenix could have done.It's an all-star cast and I'm thinking eventually every actor/actress is going to have a part in the MCU. I know there was a lot of controversy around the casting of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, but I agree with the creative reasoning behind the decision, being more of a title as oppose to a single character.Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mordo, but not exactly the Baron Mordo comic fans will know with this film possibly leading up to him, as Mads Mikkelsen plays the key villain Kaecilius who has a much smaller part in the comics. Mikkelsen never fails to play the bad guy with that unflinching, menacing look, however I don't think he was bad enough.Benedict Wong is superb as Wong and I do hope he's around for the rest of the story as Doctor Strange's sidekick valet. Rachel McAdams, Benjamin Bratt and martial art film-star Scott Adkins make up the rest of the cast and all do extremely well. I don't think McAdams read the script because she sincerely looks shocked for a lot of her part.The movie itself is way out there, being very much like its source material sticking to Marvel canon. When the comics were first published, some readers thought creator/artist Steve Ditko and others behind the story to be high on something and this film goes way beyond anything we've seen from Marvel before, not even from Fox or Sony Pictures.It's like Marvel has taken the ingredients of Inception, The Matrix, Harry Potter and then mixed with a bit of Big Trouble in Little China and a dashing of Edge of Tomorrow. It's beautifully mind- bending, like a live action M.C. Escher puzzle inside a psychedelic kaleidoscope.Even Pixar's regular composer, Michael Giacchino does an interesting and broad score to reflect the vast weirdness of the movie using an array of instruments such as chimes, bells, harpsichords and a choir; no two tracks are the same with some baroque and even some backmasking which is quite spooky.It has all the Marvel trademarks including the comedy elements which are, actually very amusing, especially the personification of his cloak. I like the little nods and connections to the rest of the universe that might be missed first time round, tying in with the incoming Infinity WarsIt's well paced, visually mind-blowing and a good addition to the MCU. I'm looking forward to seeing how everything comes together. But it isn't the best, different yes, but not as good as some of the others we have seen. Be sure to stay right till the very end for the usual couple of linkages.That's it from Marvel Studios this year but 2017 is looking good with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2, then Spider-Man: Homecoming followed by Thor: Ragnarok.

"Another 'solid' movie from Marvel, but not the 'refreshing new take' many claim","Doctor Strange was presumably named as such because Doctor Familiar does not roll off the tongue. However, it may have been a more apt title in a franchise that has become the Toyota of movie franchises with reliability being their cornerstone. A lot has been made about the 'refreshing' nature of this movie, however, this isn't the first time an intelligent, quick witted hero has fought and quipped their way to saving the world in a Marvel movie. Don't get me wrong, this is a solid movie, as most Marvel movies are, however, it hits the same beats as all Marvel movies before it, has the same brand of characters, has yet another bland sound track and puts on yet another impressive, yet heavily CGI visual feast.Firstly, this movie's plot is written from the exact template that barely has time to gather dust in the Marvel vault before it's whipped out to produce another hit. We have a villain with a clear motive, to bring earth into a 'dark dimension'. Why? Why not? We have a hero who is cocky, head strong and a genius who will prove to be exceptional whilst not missing an opportunity to get a laugh. At first, the hero is somewhat in it for himself, but later comes round to being a team player proving that all it takes to save the world is a good attitude and a good set of friends. Though super intelligence and almost god-like powers doesn't hurt. In the end our hero out-smarts, out-muscles and out-quips his enemies by mastering some relatively vaguely defined spells relating to time and time-looping and using it against a giant CGI monster.The movie does a decent job of creating its universe and a passable job of explaining its laws. Just enough exposition is given that on first viewing one does not feel the plot is entirely based on a series of screen writer conveniences, however, the movie very much avoids getting too complicated in its explanations and the audience is expected to give a fair amount of leeway to the plot, the ending being an example of this. Perhaps my biggest gripe with this movie, as with almost all movies in the franchise to date, is that it does the bare minimum when exploring its own philosophies. Strange's mentor, The Chosen One (or a title to that effect), espouses, almost off-handedly, that death gives life meaning. Why? The bad guys want to engulf the world in some sort of eternal life in the 'dark dimension'. What that would mean is glossed over. Also, if the giant CGI monster of this dimension lives eternally, does his life have no meaning as a result? If so, why can he even be bothered to try and engulf more and more worlds into his dimension. For a movie to transcend the 'good', it really needs to have more than a physical battle between its heroes and villains. There needs to be a battle of ideology. This movie alludes to this battle in passing before hurrying on to the next jump cut fight on a green room treadmill. Lastly, whoever first jokingly penned the term ""sling ring"" must have found it hysterical when it made it into the final script!My next big gripe is with the music of this movie. Tony Zhou, from Every Frame a Painting, did a fantastic video discussing the Marvel Symphonic Universe where he puts a challenge to a bunch of people to sing a single original composition from a Marvel movie. No-one could do it. And after watching Dr Strange I can say I would once again be unable to sing a single melody from its soundtrack. The movie plays it very safe with its music. When excitement is happening, generic exciting music is playing, when something sad happens, generic soft sad music is playing and so on so forth.Finally, to the visual effects. And yes, these are unusual and one feels like this is where the movie's creators wanted to get people to write their reviews saying ""this is a refreshing new take on the MCU"". Unfortunately, whilst the CGI is spectacular, I can never quite get over the fact that these are just a bunch of actors running on a treadmill in a green room towards a CGI portal that they really should have just created 2m away rather than 100m and they would have escaped danger easily. The action sequences are frenetic and heavily edited with seemingly multiple cuts a second. Keeping track of where characters are in space and time is impossible, though, to be fair to this movie, that is kind of the effect they were going for. Some of the visuals could rightly be compared to inception and one would assume the visual effects designers took a lot of inspiration from that movie. Yet scenes of people fighting inside rotating hallways just felt more real in Nolan's movie, perhaps because the were filmed in a real rotating hallway. It's the subtle imperfections in the actor's movements through the hallways and the way the light falls on surfaces that just can't be matched by computer generated images. The human eye and brain can always tell the difference.In conclusion, this movie is good. A solid 3 out of 5. It'll get you from A to B without missing a beat, 'oh what a feeling'. If you want a popcorn flick, it's as good as they get. However, the movie is once again played very very safe. If you were looking for the 'refreshing new look at the MCU' then you're going to walk away disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Much better than I expected.,"This blockbuster Hollywood movie, actually makes an effort in presenting the character of Dr. Strange in a more accurate light and in accordance with the characters origin story. Benedict Cumberbatch did a fine job of giving the leading character some depth. He projects arrogance, conceit, vulnerability and intelligence with relative ease. The actor who played the Ancient One was also very good. The film has a good pace, some imaginative touches and a solid plot on the whole. The dialogue is pretty good apart from a few lines that strike a false note. I believe that fans of the Dr. Strange superhero will be pleased with this adaptation. I hope a sequel shall follow. I reckon this might happen, if the final scene is anything to go by. Watch this and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A weaker entry from the MCU,"As a Marvel fan I will have to admit that Doctor Strange is one of the franchise's weaker entries along with Thor the dark world and some of its earlier solo pieces. The film had no focus and the pacing was off a lot of times.However to start of I would like to point out the positives, One of the most well done parts of this film is establishing the absurdist, strange and sometimes trippy world of the famed sorcerer supreme. As the recent All new all different doctor strange storyline does so very well this side of the Marvel universe is being represented quite well, in the comic book continuity and in the Marvel cinematic universe we are really seeing Doctor Strange in a sort of return to forms with all of this absurd and all around 'strange' world that is the mystic and interdimensional side of the Marvel universe. I think this was a good approach and representation to the interdimensional side of this vast comicbook continuity.Another job well done would be in my opinion Benedict Cumberbatch, he is an actor who can sometimes be really good as one that everyone loves to hate and hates to love. The 'Draco Malfoy' of movies, BC as he quite often does portrays this snobbish know it all character in a great way that makes audience really find him annoying and overly arrogant. Now as BC so often portrays this character type I wouldn't say that this is some sort of a major acting breakthrough but all I can say is I guess it was a good casting choice for BC to play Doctor Strange.Now the movie also as mentioned have several flaws one of them being a flaw that has been throughout the entire MCU, the villains. Once again we find ourselves in an MCU film where the villain has the most simplistic plans and is defeated by the most basic things, in the sense that they don't seem to pose any major threat at all. We did get introduced to the character of Dormammu but my god, the moment I saw him on screen it immediately reminded me of Galactus from 'Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer', Why MCU? Can you not have a good villain other than Loki. The film constantly foreshadows and references this coming villain but when he finally shows up he barely does anything at all. Just no. I guess the MCU can never have a good villain so they'll just have to keep bringing back Loki.The pacing of the film was off too, scenes can sometimes be dragged along really slowly and at times days would go back in the matter of seconds. It really just seems like things sort of pop out left and right with no correlation. I haven't even mentioned the many impracticalities and parts that didn't make much sense at all. The story as the foundation/backbone of this film was sloppy and not done very well at all. But it does manage to get the job of establishing a different side of the MCU and a new character: Doctor Strange done.Overall, yes this is probably one of the weakest MCU films but it isn't completely irredeemable, it can be hard sometimes to do origin stories so I would expect a second entry to be a lot better simply because this established world of Doctor Strange is a very interesting side to explore in my opinion and the character of Doctor Strange was established quite well as well which does make me quite excited for the following films where we actually see Strange interact with the other members of the MCU.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually Spectacular but some wrinkling flaws,"Doctor Strange did show a good blast with its stunning Inception-styled effects that is mind-blowing plus Benedict Cumberbatch was the right choice to portray the titular character in which his marvelous performance is perfect just like the way other actors in MCU did. Some of members of the cast such as Chiwetel Ejiofor, and Rachel McAdams did deliver a good performances.Rest of the others in case of Tilda Swinton gave a good performance which make it perfect but the problem is that, in the comics it was portrayed as an Asian character and it's no secret that this is white-washing noting that Hollywood never learns its lesson when choosing white actors to portray non-white roles.Then the flaw was with the inconsistencies of the plot and plot holes that leaves scratching their heads for questions. Mads Mikkelsen did give a good performance as a main villain though it fell flat and bland, then another villainous role such as Dormammu is poorly portrayed which leaves to be desired with.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The comedy in this movie is really great too. The visual aspect of this movie is simply unmatched. I really liked the way Stephen evolves throughout this movie. It felt natural and not at all forced.

Cliché' Marvel story telling,"I didn't quite know what to expect with this one, but being a comic book movie fan, I booked my IMAX tickets for day one of the latest Marvel movie instalment. Being that this would be the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, I was hoping for a movie that would showcase the magic and mysticism in an original, darker and less cliché way than the rest of the Marvel movies to date. Unfortunately, that wasn't to happen. It started off really well, highlighting Doc's origin, his arrogance, his thirst to be the best. I really liked Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, regardless of the complaints of the character being white-washed, I thought she portrayed the character very well. Benedict Cumberbatch played his role well, giving us a glimpse of the Sherlock Holmes arrogance.The second act is where I started to notice that the jokes began to get out of hand, and whilst some in the audience were laughing, I found myself and others starting to get quietly frustrated. There are times when jokes are appropriate and then there are times where they just take away from the seriousness of the story. Everything I've read to date about the movie described how dark it is compared to the rest of the MCU, but I really failed to see that. And when it came to the third act, the unnecessary jokes kept coming in thick and fast. Even at points where people were dying.Don't get me wrong, the visuals were stunning, especially in an IMAX theatre, but it didn't do much to allay the staleness of the rest of the movie. Benedict Wong as 'Wong' was pretty much wasted. A talented actor reduced to a moody librarian. Mads Mikkelsen, as talented as he is, was just a side line performer in a cliché villainous role with no real depth to him. Pretty much like every other Marvel movie villain. And the last act pretty much reaffirmed the lack of creativity, with an end-of- the-world scenario yet again and don't get me started on the way Doc Strange managed to defeat this villain, just pure awful!This makes me wish that the Russo Brothers helmed all of the Marvel movies and makes me hope that the DCU can do something to really rival Marvel's cliché way of storytelling... The best part of the movie was the mid credits scene setting up the way for Doc's integration with the Avengers and by the way there's also a post credit scene, so stay until the end.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Most Ambitious Yet Uninspired Marvel Film Yet,"Marvel has gained my (and millions of other people's) trust through 14 films in their illustrious Cinematic Universe. But it's that trust I felt was tampered with in Doctor Strange, which is their most ambitious yet disappointingly uninspired film at the same time.Doctor Strange is helmed by horror director Scott Derrickson, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Mads Mikkelson, and Tilda Swinton. Most of them are quite good in this stylish Marvel superhero flick, but I also don't believe any of them are given much to do. Cumberbatch plays a good a-hole, but we already have a better version of that in Tony Stark. McAdams was a strong point and provides the audience's connection to humanity, but there isn't much to her character yet, other than a love interest for Strange. Wong played the humor well. Mikkelson is one of the most dynamic actors working today, but I found nothing compelling or unique about his antagonist, Kaecilius. Nor did I think there was any believable motivation behind his actions. Tilda Swinton is probably the best part about the film, but again, she's used sparingly.I came into Doctor Strange wanting something entirely different than Marvel, or any other studio, has ever given us with a comic-book film. While there's something to be said about the trippy and horror-ish visuals this film displays, it actually ends up falling more victim to the superhero formula than I would have hoped. Take the humor for example, something Marvel has grown accustomed to trickling into their installments, but 80 % of the humor in Doctor Strange feels out of place. The trailers never once tried to sell me on humor. I came for a distinctly different story and mind-blowing visuals. I didn't buy my ticket to see Cumberbatch try and be the next Tony Stark. It would also help if the rest of the characters were using that same humor, but they aren't, most of them seem like they acted in a relatively serious drama. This type of humor works in Guardians or Ant-Man, but it's completely out of place in Doctor Strange.But it's far from all bad. Marvel at least deserves some credit for daring to actually take the fight sequences into that psychedelic territory. Granted, I wasn't as into the action scenes as I had wanted to be, because the story to that point wasn't all that interesting. If the film had stayed in the darker and twisted tone that some of those scenes presented, I could have been more on board with the end results. There are many strong aspects about this film, however. The visuals are unlike anything I have seen in a superhero film, Tilda Swinton kills it, McAdams is a strong love interest, and Strange himself deserves a place in the Marvel universe. But I was expecting something different. Perhaps that's on me, perhaps not, but this one just didn't do it for me.+The Ancient One+McAdams is a nice complement to Cumberbatch+Trippy and daring visuals+Unique fight scenes-But the story is paint by numbers-Mikkelsen gets nothing to do-Really really forced humor-Some third act decisions are questionable6.0/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually stunning!,I really like Doctor Strange. It is visually really amazing and total different than only explosions and something like that. Benedict Cumberbatch fits really great as the character of Doctor Strange and makes the character more memorable. The only problem is maybe the classic hero origin story but that doesen't bother me to much. All in all a great film!,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Playing it too Safe,"When I started to hear about the type of world this movie was exploring many months ago, I became more excited to see this movie than probably any other movie released this year. I am very interested in quantum physics and the whole idea of multiple universes, and the idea of being able to travel and manipulate other dimensions I thought was the basis for an exciting movie. Then came the reviews talking about how 'heady' it was, working at a higher level than your normal super hero movie. Along with that you have Benedict Cumberbatch, which not only sounds like an exquisite English breakfast, but is a very enigmatic actor who has made his mark in a very electrifying way. To top it all off, there was the promise of mindbending special effects that reminded you of Inception or Interstellar.So it is funny that all these elements on their own seem to be the right combination for a real audience favourite. So why do I feel rather indifferent? Here are some possibilities:Benedict Cumberbatch needs his English accent as part of his prowess, the lame American accent diminished his character. In general, he was too 'safe' as a personality to be engaging enough. It is inevitable that all Marvel films be compared to the first Ironman. Robert Downey Jr. was allowed to personify his character and was very engaging.The action scenes seem to come out of nowhere. The designated bad guy along with his evil plan are established right off the bat, so it is just by the screenwriters choice when to break away from a mentoring scene to start the 4D fight scenes. Then back to the mentoring.One thing that we all remember is the bombastic ""BBBBBBAAAAAAAA"" score from Inception. It has been noted that all Marvel movies have generic scores. My feeling that it is part of a greater sympton of the studio playing it safe when it comes to these things.The story structure, spelling out the origin story, has the same familiar beats. Again I think of Ironman, where both have a jarring incident in a vehicle to kick off their road to recovery. Going through origin stories have become tedious. I was hoping that with the more intellectual material there would also be a more intellectual approach to the filmmaking. My guess is that the studio wanted to play if safe with this material to make sure younger crowds wouldn't get lost. Yet I remember learning about the 'force' in Star Wars slowly without needing a great deal of exposition. Better yet, the capabilities of this power was revealed through major story points throughout the film.-Again, the special powers are introduced without any great mystical approach. The world beyond our dimensions can be strange and frightening, but this movie does it in a conventional way that is not that intriguing. Appropriate comparisons to the ""Matrix"" shows how revealing these strange powers can be done in an original and exciting way.What makes this film worthwhile?Terrific effects featuring the expansion of the folding skylines first seen in Inception. The best sequence in the film.Other fun sequences that make use of the other multidimensional universe.Great mentor character played by Tilda Swinton, I only wish the rest of the characters were written as well.The trademark self-mockery that allows the audience to buy into the goofy comic book world.Nice tight pacing that kept the film moving along and not exceeding the 2 hour mark.It is hard to fault any one department for the absence of real spark to this film. I would say it was the studio playing it too safe with the material as the main fault. But it is also that we have seen too many origin movies to be that absorbed by them. I think the bad guy proved to be menacing enough, but could have been far more intriguing and cerebral in his personality. (Too 'by the book' haha). But something as fundamental as a more striking musical score could have done wonders.I will recommend this movie, not being familiar with the comics, because there are enough engaging moments to keep you entertained. It is the potential that is lost in the business-like approach to making yet another superhero movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Another Marvel epic but with bolder directions.,"While not deviating long range from the estructual formula, Dr. Strange boldly manages to unfolds within a deeper sense of epicness effectivelty creating a nice balance between: blockbuster action and humor (the last sometimes falling cheap and forced in Marvel movies), great and imaginative visuals of grand scale that serves to the atmosphere, and a story with thematics of deeper concepts (altough self-limitied by the impositions of the formula) resulting in a solid origins story that positions as one of the best on the Marvel universe franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Five-Word Review: Visually Interesting, Entertaining; Epitomises Average","The Marvel machine thunders on with Doctor Strange, which stars an always-fantastic Benedict Cumberbatch as a surgeon/sorcerer, learning from Tilda Swinton and Chiwetel Ejiofor, whilst the threat of Mads Mikkelsen looms. It's clear early on that Doctor Strange is standard Marvel fare, yet it remains a fun film nevertheless and is worth a look.Though it's expected of a Marvel film by now, the acting is spot-on. Cumberbatch channels his Sherlock portraying the arrogant and cocky Strange, whilst Benedict Wong is a stand-out in the supporting cast. It makes for a good watch when the cast has such effortless chemistry, and the witty repartee between characters is helped by a script which often fizzes along merrily.Beyond the acting, the visuals are a highlight - notably, Strange's first introduction to the spiritual world is an eye-popping spectacle which evokes the art of Salvador Dali, the music of David Bowie, and the Moonmen song from Rick and Morty. Furthermore, the action sequences manage to show off some interesting visual feats, with city-bending, kaleidoscopic scenery making for some fun scenes.Though this formula is undeniably entertaining, this film just will not stick long in the memory and is not something I'll ever re-watch, nor does it have any particular fantastic scene which stood out. Mikkelsen offers glimpses of being more than a standard forgettable Marvel villain, at one point making Strange question his allegiances, but only briefly. Overall the case is that there simply isn't enough time devoted to character development (Rachel McAdams is particularly shafted in this department) due to the high amount of world-building required of this film.It's hard to muster much excitement for such planned, corporate-approved films, and it's especially disappointing to see great directors stifled by the conglomerate's cinematic universe machine, such as Taika Waititi, fantastic at the head of What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople, whose Thor: Ragnarok next year (which is teased in Doctor Strange) will surely be indistinguishable from the rest.But you may as well watch this stuff anyways; it's still a decent and fun way to spend two hours if you're alright to unhook the brain for a bit. 64/100.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

More Generic Kiddie Garbage from the Marvel Comedic Universe,"Is there anything more kiddie than a Disney Marvel production that disneyfies characters from the original work and turns them into punching bag for cheap laughs? We get it, the majority of people going to the theater for MCU films are kiddies. That doesn't mean you should change the original work and overwrite the author's intentions for lame jokes and laughs. What is the reason in this case with Tilda Swinton and the Ancient One? It's lame, unnecessary.Marvel also mishandled the response with Swinton outright lying by saying that the character was never meant to be Asian. Of course it was. From Wikipedia: ""The character who would eventually become the Ancient One was born in Kamar-Taj, ""a hidden land high in the Himalayas"". This was done of course for the kiddies sjw who can't handle strong man characters.As mature marvel fans we should all boycott these terrible kiddie mcu films.

Explores Interesting Ideas and Theories with the Super Hero Fun,"This is another of the Marvel movies that I wasn't overly thrilled to check out originally. What drew me in was needing to catch up before seeing Avengers: Infinity War. I did like Benedict Cumberbatch so that helped. Jaime was like me, but we watched it as we get closer to Infinity War and Endgame on our IMDb poster.We are following Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch). He's a brilliant, but arrogant surgeon. He is good at what he does. His problem is that he does it for glory. When a horrific car accident leaves his hands damaged, he seeks treatments to help. When that fails, he seeks out a patient that can walk despite modern medicine thinking it isn't possible.This leads him to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton). She at first turns him away, but she sees his potential. This plunges Dr. Strange into a world of magic and a war with Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen). Dr. Strange, much like in medicine, excels here, but immediately goes too far.What I was glad here is that this one holds up. We get to see another infinity stone, which if my memory serves is the stone of time. Dr. Strange doesn't believe in religion or mysticism. This is in line with me as I believe in science. Dr. Strange is forced to question his beliefs, but it is done in a way where there are logic explanations behind it. We are dealing with multiverses and time travel a believable way. These are two things that I love. This movie also feels like it is borrowing a lot of visuals from Inception as well. It is crazy and the effects are well done there. Much like other movies, this does go heavy with the CGI, but it looks great.Going along with that, the acting is great. I love the arrogance and sarcasm that Cumberbatch brings here. He is joined by great actors like Mikkselsen, Swinton, Chiewetel Ejiofor and Rachel McAdams. I also like Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg and Benjamin Bratt. This movie is one that pleasantly surprised me with things that it does. It is more of this lesser-known characters that someone like Scott Derrickson can play a bit more with, who has dipped his toe into horror. This one felt like it could go farther into that realm for sure. After my second watch, I think this is a good movie.My Rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Interesting movie,"I agree with other negative reviewers when they say the main characters were not developed enough to care about them. They don't have a good build-up to see progression or personal growth. I can't comment on acting because I get too caught up in the plot to notice acting. I notice the bad acting in a lot of Lifetime movies though. People are complaining about the formulaic plot, but I was too distracted by the weird sorcery, time travel, and dimension thing to notice it. Witchcraft in this movie was portrayed in a very different manner than what I am used to seeing in other movies, so it particularly distracted me. The evil elements and villains were really different from what I was used to seeing, and that made the movie interesting even if the plot was too much of a brain dead action flick. People complained about how the plot is illogical because Dr.Strange is new to sorcery, but he was able to beat top sorcerers, but they explain it by saying he is smart with photographic memory. He read a lot of magic books. Others complain that they didn't show how why he got interested in sorcery, that was clear to me too; He switched from caring about a cure to caring that the whole world was at risk of annihilation. Morivation was there. Others complained the romance didn't make sense and came out of nowhere. What romance? It was an ex girlfriend feeling sorry for him. Then it seemed more like a friendship built on familiarity, no romance. I watched this movie the same day that I watched Disney's Moana and I thought the plots of these two movies were so similar. No one else mentioned this. Really, watch Dr.Strange and Moana on the same day and you will see what I mean. Somehow this movie inspired me to work harder for what I care about. The concept of the dimensions and the motivation for the evil villains were very creepy and unique to what I am used to watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Doctor Strange,"Doctor Strange, directed by Scott Derrickson, throws us Marvel fans a complete curve ball, with his execution and style, but it paid off well! With Doctor Strange having a tough back story to sculpt into frame, Derrickson and the creative team made the best out of it, creating this inventive, mind bending film, with so many twist and turns, while involving new and creative ideas. Sadly, the biggest issue of the film, is the story. This, by the numbers premise, has been used and abused many times by the MCU. Derrickson created some great potential for a new world building opportunity, with a pace that doesn't have a lot of downtime to play around, but because of the clunky scene structure, choppy pace, and surplus of exposition, a lot of events and characters went underdeveloped; If this film was another fifteen minutes longer, it would've allowed for developing in their weak spots. Scott Derrickson didn't shy away from giving us that darker tone, involving decent risks, but when they tried to tone things down, the conflicting tones didn't mesh well with eachother.Benedict Cumberbatch was the saving grace of the film. He absolutely steals every scene he's in, bringing this tremendous amount of snarky wit and range to the character. Although he is a likable character, he reminds me of a generic Tony Stark, that just tried to capture his charisma, but he wasn't as interesting or exuberant. His character development was fine, but it was ran through so quickly, that the time frame just didn't add up. His love interest, for lack of better terms, in Rachel McAdams is fine; she serves her purpose, but she's pretty forgettable, not having much to do in the film. She tankfully wasn't over saturated, but the casting choice itself was a little much, riding the cusp of being disposable. Tilda Swinton is another casting that was a little over done, but she fits the role really well. Her character is complex, yet subtle, having a few interesting aspects to her character and backstory, but due to her character being slightly underdeveloped, we didn't get as much as we could've from her. Chiwetel Ejiofor was another solid addition to the film, putting on a good performance, but he didn't add that much, other than some exposition. Mads Mikkelsen put on a good performance as Kaecilius, being a real intense presence, but I needed much more on his character. We got a little backstory on him, but everything felt very forced, and fast with his character, that he just didn't get the development he deserved.The screenplay by Scott Derrickson, Jon Spaihts, and C. Roberts Cargill, had a tough time balancing everything, between the story, the characters, and the humor. They had a few high points, but the humor took me out of the film, due to it being really forced.This was most definitely one of the best looking films of the MCU! There was so many great colors and visuals that just pop off the screen, with immaculate detail and style. With this being a real effects-heavy film, it was one of the driving forces, being seamlessly crafted! The action of the film was fun, but it wasn't handled the greatest, lacking good shots and creative fight sequences.Overall, Doctor Strange is a real fun, and inventive film, but it doesn't come without flaws. Doctor Strange is one of the better films of the MCU, but it isn't one of those blockbuster hits like some of these other titles are.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Strange was another awesomely adventurous Marvel flick,"This was another AWESOME Marvel superhero movie I watched with my movie theatre-working friend.

So he travels to a faraway country to cure his body only to become a new man due to his now practicing some mystic arts of magic. I'll stop there and just say this was quite visually stimulating watching various far-out images of the things Stephen goes through. So on that note, me and my friend recommend Doctor Strange.

"A strange mystical origin story, but way too formulaic.","The next new character to be introduced to the MCU, Doctor Strange is about neurosurgeon Stephen Strange who has a fatal car accident only to resort to learning about mysticism in order to save himself...but little does he know he is involved in a much bigger threat. Some of you know, that this is my most anticipated film of the year. I've watched the trailers so many times that I probably know them off by heart. Firstly the acting was spot on, Benedict Cumberbatch literally became his character and his American accent was perfect. Tilda Swinton, Rachel McAdams and even the underrated Mads Mikkelsen were all great, I've not seen such a perfect cast for a superhero film. Director Scott Derrickson (who also directed the horrors Sinister and the underrated Deliver Us From Evil) is confident taking on a franchise movie and is particularly interesting to see how he has transitioned so well from horror to fantasy. The visual effects are outstanding, obviously this film will remind people of Inception, but what this film was able to achieve was such a high level of imagination and technical excellence that really takes the viewer into the world on the screen. There is one great scene that reminded me of MC Escher where the camera pans around and creates the illusion of an isometric view, mind you that whole act was great. The script was funny and witty which is what one would expect from a Marvel studio film, we have to remember that this behemoth of a studio know exactly what they are doing now and can make origin films constantly. That is where the problem lies. This film is so formulaic that it borderlines on boring, I literally at a point wanted this film to get going and do something different but alas it did not. One of my friends told me ""if it isn't broken, don't fix it"" in which to my reply was ""it will eventually get broken if something doesn't change"". Some of the visual effects for the humans during fight scenes were done poorly and did take me out of the film slightly. The villain played by Mads Mikkelsen was weak and once again forgettable which really irritated me because he is such a waste of talent on this, why can't these films have better villains? (I shan't spoil it but there is another villain in which I did not like this interpretation of). Also a lot of the fight scenes were choppily edited and filmed which was a shame. Overall, Doctor Strange will satisfy fans with its great cast, witty script and sublime VFX but ultimately it's just another formulaic origin story that borderlines on boring.

7/10,"Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is one of the most successful neurosurgeons in the world, he care a lot about is job, but he is also an arrogant individual, with an enormous ego. When an almost fatal car accident deprives him of the use of his hands, Strange, left with no other opportunities, embarks on journey to Asia to find out about one mysterious method a man told him about with which he regained the use of his back after a paralysis, yet there might be more to what he initially set out to do.Doctor Strange has been one of the most enduring and interesting Marvel Characters for the past fifty years, taking part in almost every crossover story line in a key role. Marvel here had the gargantuan task of condensing the iconic origin story and paying homage to the fifty years of lore in a single feature. Whilst the film doesn't quite manage to establish its world both singularly and as a part of the MCU, Marvel has yet delivered another flick full of fun, wonder and rich characters.What is remarkable about these films is to see how Marvel, even after all this time, is able to put out a product that first and foremost is about the filmmaking behind it and even more admirable is how this product always ends up being good. You always feel the effort of every single crew member and that is something really rare to find, it is such a pleasure and such a joy to see that the most successful studio of our times is driven firstly by passion and the will to tell good stories, it is something that always transpires through to the audience and it is the reason why even with this film, which has its number of flaws, there is just a sense of great fun and storytelling that give all of these films an effortless engagement with the viewer.Whilst it could have been cool to see a little more of the horror sensibilities, Scott Derrickson did a great job in bringing this tale to life. The casting first and foremost is pitch perfect. Mads Mikkelsen might not be given lots to do (that being due to story problems), but Cumberbatch shines high and owns the role from the first to the last frame, his addition to this universe is more than welcome. Yet, the stand out here is clearly Tilda Swinton as the ancient one: this is ideal casting and the way Swinton brings the role to life is magical, she gives a touching performance with a real edge to it, that surprised me as much as I appreciated it: every second with her on screen was gold.Moreover the film does have quite some visual spectacle to spare and whilst I thought the action sequences were decent at best, the visual imagery employed in them was absolutely breathtaking and more than that, the non-action parts where Strange is catapulted in other dimensions during training were the best ones, with truly inventive visuals and flawless special effects.Whilst I'll explain later why I find the script to be quite messy from a world building point of view, which ultimately undermines a lot of the story, I also can say that a great part of it was really well written, with edgy comedy, great character development and a very fluent narrative with essential plot. Moreover, the film has a fantastic sense of discovery engraved in it, you want to know more and more just like Strange does and it makes for a very gratifying experience to be taken on.As I said, the film has quite a number of flaws and whilst as the movie went on, I was never taken out of the flow or the excitement, it is frustrating to see that this could have been a much better film. Sloppy pacing, anticlimactic finale, weak villain and poor logic are all problems the film has and I believe that they can all be traced back to one single problem core flaw: mythology. There is just too murky of a world building going on, the mythology does not manage to establish itself to the audience in a rational and logical way and you are left with more questions than answers. I am the first one to say than not everything needs to be explained, what film needs is simply a rational understanding of the inner workings of the world and you are never given that. Not even with my comic book knowledge I managed to understand how all of this fitted. There are many expositions scenes and I love an exposition scene when it is done good: when the character wants to discover as much as the audience, yet the filmmakers commit a mistake in using these scenes just to spit out a train of information, without organizing it and without giving an overall sense to the world.However, this is getting a little too nerdy, ""Doctor Strange"" is a great addition to the Marvel canon, I want to see more from this character and that is a sign that overall the film just was a great ride and a incredibly fun experience to have.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Great climax, promising beginning and plain oatmeal in the middle","A massive amount of effort and money went into rebuilding this dusty old property from the Marvel library.You merely have to look at the John Mills film version -- or any of the forgettable animations -- to see the scope of the challenge.Part of the problem is that when Lee and Ditko first conceived Strange, neither had much of a clue about mystical stuff. So they came up the Eye, and Nightmare (probably the next movie) and the world's most forgettable villain Dormammu. Even the spelling of the name should tell you how quickly the original story was thrown together back in the day.However there are few problems on this planet that millions of dollars cannot fix. The casting of Cumberbatch was brilliant. OMG he looks exactly like the original character, right down to facial bone structure.However at the end of the day you have just another Marvel ""origin"" story cleverly designed to permit either future individual stories or, as a last resort, to merge the doc into the Avengers. Wherever there is the most profit, I presume.The beginning is above average -- Tilda Swinton brilliant as always -- and the ending is BRILLIANT.In the middle you have a lot of sound and fury signifying mainly nothing.

Strong Visuals And An Interesting Story,"Since I was not very familiar with the story of Doctor Strange, I was pleased that this film is an origin story.

He learns to challenge everything he knows. Being the rebel he is, he disobeys some edicts and searches for learning beyond what has been proscribed. This leads to existential battles and further knowledge.The film includes strong visuals and numerous fight scenes. Some of the visuals are undoubtedly patterned after the works of M. C.

Set Up For a Better Sequel,"You have Mads Mikkelsen as the Villein and Benedict Cumberbatch as the protagonist. Seeing them together makes you think that Cumberbatch would make one hell of a Bond.Not that it's a complaint, I'll watch them both any day of the week. Class acts. Although there is hope that, in future installments, Sherlock will drop any attempt at an American accent. The MCU breaks enough canon, let Strange just be British and it will be easier on the ears.Otherwise, Doctor Strange was clearly a set-up movie like so many others in the MCU. It didn't have the pure entertainment value that Iron Man or Ant Man had, but it was a lot better than most and lived up to the trippy feel of the comic books.The visual effects were stunning and in a film like this, it really can't be over-done, it's sort of the point and they did a great job at mimicking well known pieces of art in the process. It makes for a great addition to a narrative that is only so-so at best.However what it lacks in story it makes up in charm. The subtle nods and not so subtle references to Sherlock and the MCU, combined with some cute, albeit slapstick, humor give the film a light hearted feeling that will either annoy viewers or be refreshing given the otherwise dark nature of the plot allowing the movie to be child friendly.In the end you leave with a Captain America feeling, the movie was just a set-up to establish the character in the MCU. And though it did a great job, you understand that it was an introductory piece.However, it's not to say that the movie was bad and you walk away with the sense that the follow-ups will certainly be better. You want to see more of Doctor Strange and the set up for what's coming next is tantalizing.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Beginning of something Strange...but wonderful,"I have just gotten back from seeing Doctor Strange {28th October, 2:24}, and, wow, was it intense. I'll definitely have to see it a second time to take in all the action and set pieces (not to mention Easter Eggs), but I can say, without a doubt, it is within my top 5 Marvel movies (the top five including Captain America Civil War, Captain America The Winter Soldier, The Avengers, Guardians Of The Galaxy, and Avengers Age Of Ultron; Doctor Strange is tied with The Winter Soldier).The effects are mind boggling, and the magic helps mask the whole ""fake looking"" problem that some movies suffer from. Yes, Benedict Cumberbatch's Stephen Strange is similar to Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, but where they defer is really obvious: while Tony was humbled by his incident, Stephen becomes more arrogant and distant from everyone he knows. However, much like Iron Man, the story of Doctor Strange is that of finding oneself and becoming a better person because of it. The supporting cast are absolutely amazing, and Tilda Winton as the Ancient One was a choice I thought was odd and didn't suit the character. I was happily incorrect with my first assumption.The music is truly something that does work in favour for Doctor Strange unlike previous Marvel movies (while I enjoy other Marvel movie music, I can admit that they do pale in comparison to that of Star Wars or The Dark Knight). The story is one that has been told many times now, but Doctor Strange adds creative elements to it that make it stand out (such as magic; big shock, I know), and the final act of the movie is one that works in making Doctor Strange stand out from the standard Superhero movie.Doctor Strange is a strange movie indeed...and I can think of no other movie that would work better with such an uncanny nature to it.Doctor Strange is a Magnificent {10/10} movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"My favourite comic book movie of this year, and my favourite MCU film so far","I went into this film expecting some neat visuals, good performances, and a big battle with a CGI army at the end. Nothing special, I thought, just a fun experience. But, to my utter surprise, this was something more, something really great.Let's start with the acting. It's great, all around. Benedict Cumberbatch is massively likable and charismatic as the titular character. He brings the comedy perfectly but also the troubled man within. Tilda Swinton does a very good job at playing The Ancient One, I thought she would ham it up, but she out in a revered, quiet performance. Benedict Wong and Chiwetel Ejiofor do good jobs as supporting characters, and Mads Mikkelsen is great as usual, making a generic villain rather memorable. Rachel McAdams is good as well, but she doesn't get a lot of time to shine.Visually, it's far and away the best looking MCU film to date, beating out Guardians of the Galaxy. The scene in which Strange is first introduced to the multiverse is an awesome treat on the eyes, and the film doesn't let up from there. All the CGI is done to perfection, and the film takes great advantage of the nonsensical rules to create some of the best action sequences I've seen this year. The gravity defying streets are very impressive as well, I must add.The story and characters are great. The story is a little on the generic side, but it serves it's purpose well (just like in most of the MCU films). The characters are memorable, except for the love interest and villain, who come across a little flat. I won't spoil the end battle here, but it's great, and extremely different compared to the usual business of the MCU.A small negative I found was that Doctor Strange's learning of his powers and mastering them is a little rushed. It cuts from him being an amateur to him having become quite adept at them. A small qualm, but I wish they expanded on it.So, yes, it's very great, and sits at the top of the MCU for me, beating out The Winter Soldier.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Watch it for the symmetrically bent buildings, Benedict Cumberbatch being charming, and a drug-free experience of LSD","Perhaps it is this writer's lack of knowledge on Marvel, but compared to the other groups of superheroes created by the American comic book publisher, such as the Avengers, X-Men or even the Fantastic Four, Dr Strange honestly draws a blank. That said, with the current proliferation of formulaic superhero movies, this unfamiliarity might have actually help the latest movie from the Marvel Cinematic Universe, *Dr Strange*.For the non-Marvel comics' readers, Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) was a real doctor – a neurosurgeon – before getting into a horrific car accident that destroyed his hands and effectively ended his career. Unable to accept this result, Strange exhausted his resources trying to regain full control of his hands and in the process, alienated the only person who still cared for him, ex-lover Dr Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams). As a last resort, Strange journeyed to Nepal to find a cure at the Kamar-Taj, met the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), started to practice the mystic arts, and in the process, somehow did not regain full functionality of his hands.Just like how *Deadpool* was a breath of fresh air compared to the Avengers and X-Men series, Dr Strange was a departure from the angst- filled drama of its more established counterparts. Instead, the movie showcased its free-spirited 1960s origins, bringing to mind the trippy LSD-taking, orient-obsessed, self-proclaimed mystic bohemian vibe stereotypical of that era. This was put on full display when Strange first arrived at Kamar-Taj, and was forced on a roller-coaster ride through dimensions, galaxies and worlds. There is only that much of psychedelic-ness one can take before getting turned off by the kitsch, and the movie thankfully pushes that boundary but does not go pass it. On the other hand, what really made the 3D effect pop was, in my opinion, the fight scenes where the characters manipulate buildings and structures, bringing to mind the dreamscapes from *Inception* but with prettier, more symmetrical set design. If this is not your thing, perhaps just skip the 3D option.As for the protagonist, Stephen Strange also fits nicely between the crass and never-serious Deadpool, and the overly stoic and tortured Captain America. Despite all his failings – selfishness, arrogance and stubbornness – Strange never quite felt like the high-performing genius and jerk he actually was. Kudos to Cumberbatch for that, who perhaps had more enough practice for the role while playing other socially awkward but brilliant people (Stephen Hawking and Sherlock Holmes in TV series *Hawking* and *Sherlock*, and Alan Turing from *the Imitation Game)*. As Strange gets increasingly proficient in the mystic arts, his character does change to someone more compassionate and open-minded, but never losing his snark, as evidenced by how he saved the day. This consistency probably contributed to the character's likability, and was the most real/ convincing thing that would happen in a superhero movie.With the movie's overwhelming focus on Strange, the other characters were relegated as Strange's sidekicks and support team. McAdam's Dr Christine Palmer made use of what little screen time she had to aid and heal Strange, although McAdams could probably do nothing and still be likable; Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo was the good-natured and straight- laced teaching assistant, whose rigid personality probably made him the most disillusioned by the Ancient One's doings; and for all the cries of whitewashing, Swinton does an admirable job playing the mystical and otherworldly Ancient One.For the Marvel fans – this review would probably not change your mind on this movie. So for the non-Marvel fans out there (like me), the movie was an entertaining departure from the other superhero movies throughout the year, and worth the watch – even if it is to tide you *Sherlock* fans over until next year.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Visually awe-inspiring.,"Marvel Studios has had solid success when it comes to bringing their second-tier heroes to the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU): Ant-Man was a fun little heist flick and Guardians of the Galaxy is still one of the franchise's best entries to date. This multi-realm fantasy film sits comfortably in the top echelon of MCU movies thanks to its ambitious concept and dazzling set pieces, the mind-bending parallel dimensions arguably the greatest challenge Marvel Studios has set themselves yet. Director Scott Derrickson and his VFX team visualise the multiple plains of existence with jaw-dropping splendour, the Inception-esque world-shifting of the dark dimension is awe inspiring and lends itself to a superb action sequence in the final act. What the climactic battle lacks in originality – an otherworldly entity wants to destroy Earth – it makes up for in sheer visual awesomeness, with our human heroes and villains going at it whilst a recently demolished town in Hong Kong mends itself in reverse. If the action is A+ then the story is a respectable B+. The pre-powers backstory of the titular hero is mercifully brief and there is a plethora of jokes that hit the mark, however there's some clunky exposition serving as narrative shorthand and the odd bout of dire-logue that could've been cleaned up. As for Strange himself, Benedict Cumberbatch plays him with a dash of Tony Stark's arrogance, a pinch of Steve Roger's sincerity and a sprinkle of Scott Lang's what-the-hell-am-I-doing bewilderedness, all the while adding a touch of the rock 'n' roll to his brain surgeon turned sorcerer. It's a mixed bag elsewhere though, Tilda Swinton's mischievous Ancient One and Mads Mikkelsen's malevolent Kaecilius are compelling, but Rachel McAdams is given little to do as Strange's love interest Christine and Chiwetel Ejiofor is frustratingly dour as sidekick Mordo. All in all Doctor Strange is a hugely entertaining blockbuster that once again cements MCU's position as the preeminent superhero series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Salvador Dali's psychedelic backgrounds meet Mortal Kombat characters, but it's still a Marvel movie","If you want to get straight to the review itself, skip the first paragraph.Before anything, i just want to let you know this is my first review, so despite knowing that many people have established a certain system in their reviews and have everything divided into sections, i wont even try to go there, and instead give you my honest opinions and impressions to hopefully give you some insight.So, let's get straight to business. The very basic question would be, is the movie good and worth watching? Yes. And no. It really depends on a couple of things, and it all pretty much boils down to what a fan of Marvel universe and/or Marvel movies you are.There might be a couple of very minor spoilers ahead, so be warned. I'll play fair and won't spoil anything important, but still, i feel like it's worth letting you know first.The very first thing that made me wonder if i really am watching a Marvel, very anticipated, very well funded movie, is something in the opening scene. We are shown the movie's antagonist, Kaecilius. While Mads Mikkelsen's performance is stellar, as expected from such a good actor, his whole appearance is something you'd except in a Mortal Kombat B movie, not this movie. Even his lackeys have this 80s baddie and his gang vibe, that kind of doesn't fit in a Marvel movie, at least not for me.Benedict Cumberbatch also performs very well, to me, the way he just fits the character of Doctor Strange was very similar to how Robert Downey Jr. made me think ""Oh my god, THIS is the perfect fit for Iron Man"" when i first saw the first Iron Man. There isn't really much else to say, he just fits. Perfectly.What doesn't fit perfectly is the movie's pacing. Something that was bugging me a lot was how little time is given to the establishment of certain environments and scenes. You know where you are, what you are watching and what's going on, but that's pretty much it. This makes you feel that despite the fact that the number of sets that the story takes place in is not small, it somehow ends up feeling like it. Thanks to this sort of strange pacing of some scenes, we end up with a lot of information and not a lot of time to process it. And thanks to that, you just float through the story, without being given enough time to enjoy it properly. As a result, Dr. Strange is one of those movies you have to see twice or thrice in order to let everything soak in and give your brain time to focus on things you didn't have time to process when watching earlier. This is a reoccurring problem with Marvel movies, but i guess it is something to be expected when you need to squeeze rich story into short screen time.One more thing comes to mind, the story itself. It's not BAD. It makes sense, it IS enjoyable, entertaining etc., HOWEVER, i can very honestly say that what you see in the trailers are pretty much the major points of the movie. And i mean those shots itself, like Dr. Strange and Mordo standing in front of a shifting city. That's it. The story is there, but the visuals just push it into the background as you are bombarded with psychedelic scenery after another, and an explosion after explosion, and a spell after spell... and before you know it, you feel as if you're watching some sort of a CGI demo reel that's just wrapped around some sort of a story that was quickly put together to give the movie at least some sort of a shape. There are some scenes that give a friendly nod to the rest of the Marvel movies, such as The Ancient One talking briefly about the Avengers or the fact that we are shown another Infinity Stone, but all that just feels like it's there just to remind us that these movies take place in the same universe.To be quite honest, i personally felt a little empty after seeing the movie, like something was missing, or like that wasn't all there was to the story. And these feelings are not without basis, that's how the movie is. It just doesn't feel like a part of this massive undertaking that Marvel has been doing for a long time now, and i know that there isn't much that could connect the story of the movie to the rest of the Marvel universe until the very ending, but still i feel like it could have been done better, and the movie COULD be a lot more satisfying to watch. But as it is, it just leaves you a little disappointed after watching it. Not even the soundtrack stands out, no catchy, memorable themes, it's just there, in the background of all the stunning visuals, just like everything else in the movie.So, for the verdict. If you are a Marvel fan like me, definitely watch the movie, but don't expect much. Marvel has a tendency to not do that much of a good job when exploring new territories, and Dr. Strange was in the realm of uncharted waters, and as a result, it falls a bit short, just like Antman or the early Hulk movies.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The sheep will be separated from the goats!,"Disappointed.Disappointed..Disappointed...Disappointed! Disappointed? Don't let these reviews fool you people.

Whoever, gave this a 5 or better, is lying, not only to themselves but to Dr. Strange fans in a whole. I've seen better magic done in The Incredible Burt Wonderstone.

Interesting!,"*I am not a native speaker, so i am sorry for mistakes or things like that.* I was very excited about the doctor strange movie. I never read a Marvel Comic so I had no idea what to expect. What I expect was a generic marvel movie with magic instead of ""avengers power"", I can promise that it is much more than that. The first 5 minutes of the Movie destroyed my prejudices. I was drawn into the world of Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange surprised with a comparatively slow narration. Our Hero doesn't get his skills at the next road corner after 10 Minutes. So we follow him on a interesting journey through the mind of a person that changes completely. The slow beginning of the story is followed by a short middle section, which is my only criticism of the film. The story does not get a ""routine"" and starts immediately with events which advance the story further. So the learning process is a little bit too quick for my taste. There is no real middle section of the movie. With 115 Minutes the movie is comparatively short compared to movies like Civil War or Batman v Superman and I would have preferred if the film had gone a little longer. So the Story of Doctor Strange is interesting and the setting is unused. The whole movie feels refreshing next to the other ""classic"" marvel films, a little bit like Deadpool (Really only a very very small bit like ""Deadpool""). The visuals of the Movie are stunning. It is absolute amazing to sink into the world of mirror dimensions and things like that. I would advise anyone to watch this movie in the cinema AND in 3D. I think this is the first time since ""Avatar"" that I would prefer a movie in 3D, but the optical illusions and changing dimensions are absolutely amazing in 3D. The music is good but inconspicuous, nothing centuries long lasting, but good and fitting. Benedict Cumberbatch convinces like the rest of the cast of the film. I haven't read the comics, but for me Tilda Swinton was a great embodiment of her role. I can't understand the debate of here role.The humor is similar to the other Marvel films, apart from Deadpool (this movie was glorious). The last thing I want to speak about is the overlaps with the Movie ""Inception"" some people talked about in advance. Doctor Strange is not Inception, some people will remember the optics to inception, but Inception and Doctor Strange are like apple and pear. I think it is a matter of attitude. So don't expect something like Inception and you will not be disappointed. So what we have is a real interesting character, stunning visuals and refreshing setting packed in a very good movie. If you are interested in the Marvel universe it is a very good episode. If you never watched a Marvel movie before (if there is a person in the world) it is a perfect beginning to give this sort of movie a chance. I give this Movie 9 out of 10, 8,5 out of 10 if i could.. Thumbs up Marvel I am very excited about the future of your universe. Thanks for reading.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A visual feast,"Doctor Strange. A somewhat odd addition to the MCU pantheon but I had every faith that they could pull it off. And did they?The Good: The acting on display is top notch. Benedict Cumberbatch absolutely nails it. Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong and Rachel McAdams do well with what they're given. I really enjoyed Mads Mikkelsen here and wish he had more to do.The visual effects and set design are great. They certainly set this film apart from the other MCU entries. Very cool and worth the cost of the ticket by itself..The Bad: The script feels somewhat generic. Yes, this is an origin story and as such there are some things that are hard to avoid.With so many bases to cover it felt like the pacing was a bit fast. It would have been nice to be able to linger a bit at various stages of his development instead of having to rush to the next level. But for a film that is already around the 2 hour mark I can see why they didn't want to make it any longer. It never felt boring or overly long that's for sure.The Ugly: Nope, nothing ugly about this one.Not the greatest film ever. Not even the best superhero movie of the year. But still a very enjoyable time spent at the movies and well worth the trip to the theatre. See it at the biggest, best screen you can.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
People who claim each MCU film is exactly the same must be blind...,"With the arrival of Doctor Strange, the Marvel Cinematic Universe now consists of fourteen films, a franchise that has introduced us to a number of iconic characters who have occupied the pages of comic books for many years, turning Marvel Studios into a box-office behemoth in the process.The continuing expansion of the MCU is something that each film has to keep in consideration but, while introducing new characters at this stage in a franchise, it's important that these films feel fresh. Doctor Strange does very well in introducing a character I'm not too familiar with, taking time to explore his origin story and becoming one of the most different offerings within the MCU.Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is one of the world's leading neurosurgeons who, after a major car accident, is forced to give up his career due to severe injuries sustained to his hands. After hearing of a potential cure, Strange sets off on a journey of healing to meet the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton).Strange's journey takes him to Kamar-Taj, where he discovers the mystic arts. Trained how to use them and taught about the purpose he can serve, Strange takes a path that will change his life forever.As I've mentioned before, I'm not all too familiar with the character of Doctor Strange in comparison to the likes of Spider-Man, Iron Man or Captain America. That worked massively in favour of the film as I was interested to see how a character like this would fit into the MCU and excited to see something new altogether within the franchise.Scott Derrickson really has done a great job in making a film that offers that something new while feeling right at home within the MCU at the same time. The exploration of the mystic arts is big enough but Derrickson juggles that with Strange's origin story to make sure this is a hero we want to root for. Derrickson's film flows at a steady pace and features some of the better humour we've seen in the MCU so far.It's no surprise that a Marvel film possesses impressive special effects however, when you see what they achieve with the effects in Doctor Strange, you can only be even more impressed with them. Watching Strange learn the secrets of the mystic arts gets pretty psychedelic at times while the action sequences, including a landscape shifting chase through New York, are quite breathtaking.Coming to the performances, Doctor Strange features a lead in Benedict Cumberbatch that proves, once again, Marvel have got the casting for one of their heroes spot on again. We know Cumberbatch can pull off the arrogance as we've seen him do it as Sherlock Holmes and he does it so well as Doctor Strange, both during his time as a surgeon and sorcerer. It's a trait that makes him a bit difficult to take to but then it's great to see the character earn the respect of the audience as the film goes on.Cumberbatch is joined by a mightily impressive supporting cast that includes Tilda Swinton, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Rachel McAdams and Mads Mikkelsen. There's been a bit of controversy surrounding the casting of Swinton in the role of the Ancient One, a problem seen quite often in Hollywood unfortunately, but there's no denying Swinton gives one of the best performances in Doctor Strange. I really enjoyed Chiwetel Ejiofor's take on Karl Mordo and I'm intrigued the direction his character will take in future instalments.It's the misusage of McAdams and Mikkelsen that leaves a bit of a sour taste, McAdams rather terribly pushed aside to the role of girlfriend while Mikkelsen falls under the curse of weak and underwritten Marvel villain. It's a problem Marvel have really struggled with throughout the MCU with Loki and Ultron being the only stand-out villains. Two memorable villains across fourteen films isn't really good enough though. I mean, McAdams and Mikkelsen both do there best with the limited material they're given but it's a real shame that it has to happen.As always with Marvel, there's two extra scenes throughout the end credits that tease future projects and it's the one in the middle of the end credits that left me pumped for a particular sequel coming out next year. It also felt like a great subtle nod to Sherlock Holmes, who Cumberbatch has played before. Thanks to a very good introduction to the Sorcerer Supreme, I can't wait to see how he's going to interact with the likes of Tony Stark and Star-Lord when we get to that point in a couple of years.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Have not seen a movie this good since the Matrix,"I have never written a movie review before but this movie is so exceptional I simply could not refrain. I have been collecting Dr. Strange comics since I was 7 years old, he is my all time favorite super hero, and I was filled with trepidation that they would ruin it; but far from it. Everything about it was phenomenal - the special effects, the costumes,the fight choreography, the acting... and it was very true to the original comics. Benedict Cumberbatch just nails the lead role and Tilda Swinton is amazing, as is Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mad Mikkelsen. The movie is thought provoking and inspiring as well as entertaining; I and my friends had an almost 2 hour conversation about, well, life the universe and everything after seeing it. You know it is a good movie when it evokes conversations of that kind. It is by far the most sophisticated of all the Marvel films to date, but then again Dr. Strange is probably the most sophisticated Marvel super hero.

Visually stunning movie that still sticks to the Marvel formula,"Doctor Strange is different than most superhero movies through its intricate subject and mindboggling visuals; however the movie fails to overcome its reputation as ""just another superhero movie in the Marvel universe"".But before I discuss that, let me explain why the movie still makes the top 3 of best Marvel movies (because I do think that Marvel has the ability to create entertaining movies). To begin with, the visual style of ""Doctor Strange"" was epic. It had something Inception-esque to it. This aspect really brought something different to the universe and made the cinematic experience for the audience phenomenal. I think this is the movie's biggest strength. On a further note, the 3-D effects worked very well. I was very skeptical of watching Doctor Strange in 3-D because usually movies do not tend to use the full potential of this technology, but to my surprise it was far better than I expected and there were some cool scenes in which the 3-D was used perfectly.I loved Benedict Cumberbatch. He performed his role in a brilliant manner and was definitely key to the success of this film. I don't want to spoil too much, but I can assure you that he nailed his role and the casting choice was brilliant.Furthermore, I was really surprised by the movie's score. Marvel isn't popular for their use of music, but in Doctor Strange it's different. This gives the movie a certain ""uniqueness"". I loved it. However, I have a couple of negative aspects to mention. Let's start with the story. For me, the exposition was too long. Origin stories can be a lot of fun, but for my taste they spent too much time explaining Doctor Strange's background. I was also unimpressed by the inciting incident which seemed a bit too random to me.Many people keep saying that Marvel solved the ""bad villain problem"". I disagree. The villain in Doctor Strange was yet another underdeveloped cliché enemy without clear intentions. (Mads Mikkelsen with a good performance though)Although the fighting scenes were very amusing and looked spectacular, they became repetitive after some time.To sum it up, Doctor Strange is a visually terrific movie, but still sticks too much to Marvel's formula by using a lot of funny one- liners, stiffly following the same plot patterns and spending less time to explore the depth of the villain. A lot of potential was wasted. But then again, it was finally something different and new compared to the usual superhero movies. ""Doctor Strange"" might not be a revolutionary movie in the industry, but it set its mark as a rather experimental superhero movie in the Marvel universe and perhaps might influence future projects. 7/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Review or Critique / Professor Unusual,"The use of nested geometry was my favorite part of the movie, aside from Benedict Cumberbatch's inspiring portrayal of Doctor Steve Strange. Exceptionally well done character development, with many comedic moments to break up any unwanted plot tension. The director obviously knew what he was doing. The scientific accuracy of the medical portion of the plot was impressive. The attention to detail in the movie with regard to how Steve Strange acquired his abilities is mind bending. There are TWO POST ROLLS, don't forget to watch both of them! I honestly cannot recommend this movie enough.

Dazzlingly brilliant!,"Doctor Strange tells the story of neurosurgeon, Dr. Stephen Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch). Stephen Strange is a brilliant doctor, who can perform the most complicated surgeries, effortlessly. Strange is also very arrogant & thinks no end of himself. One day, Doctor Strange meets with a fatal car accident. After he recovers, Strange goes on a journey to heal himself completely. This journey makes him meet people, who teach him about the mystic arts & the various different dimensions in the universe.Doctor Strange is a mind blowing film. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has made, yet another masterpiece. This movie is one of my all-time favorite origin stories, set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The visual effects are otherworldly. All the various dimensions shown in the film, look gorgeous. The scenes where Doctor Strange is traveling through various realms, look very surreal. You have to see the movie to appreciate the magnificence of these scenes. The 3D puts you right in the middle of this topsy-turvy, magical & amazing world. The highlights of the film are the New York set piece, the climax & of course, the performances. Benedict Cumberbatch is spectacular as Dr. Stephen Strange. Cumberbatch portrays all the different emotions his character goes through during the course of the movie, with aplomb. Chiwetel Ejiofor is outstanding as Mordo. Rachel McAdams is excellent as Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong is awesome as Wong. Mads Mikkelsen is brilliant as Kaecilius. Tilda Swinton is amazing as The Ancient One. Michael Stuhlbarg & Benjamin Bratt are great as Dr. Nicodemus West & Jonathan Pangborn, respectively. Stick around till the end of the credits because there's a mid-credits scene & a post-credits scene. Doctor Strange is another unforgettable film, in the ever expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe.

A movie so good this review is pointless- You need to watch it now!,"This was for me the best of all the Marvel movies, and I am a huge marvel fan. They tied this movie in perfectly with the Marvel universe. The special effects were 10/10. I'm really glad they waited to make this movie when the technology of movie CGI was finally good enough to capture the true world of Dr Strange. The special effects at times reminded me of Inception, except this movie made total sense and was 10x better.The casting was done perfectly. I don't think I've ever watched a movie as visually stunning as this one. It reminded me of seeing Avatar for the first time in 3D. His powers and abilities and story line and character development were incredible. There are so many layers to this movie I look forward to rewatching it many more times over the years.I was a huge comic book fan as a kid, but never read Dr Strange.

Marvel Formula is tired,Firstly the only thing that made me enjoy this movie a little was watching it in 4DX. Marvel's formulaic movies are really beginning to let them down. Benedict Cumberbatch was probably the person that could have done this film justice had all the other pieces of the film been more developed. There is an issue Marvel have in their films where the love interest is so superficial and you don't become invested in the 'love' they supposedly have because it is underdeveloped. Rachel McAdams was wasted in this. Then we get onto the villain. Mads Mikkelsen played Hannibal Lecter and was intimidating and scary. But here he just lacked depth and motivation. I don't know what lets down Marvel villains more...the script or the tone of the films because none of them are ever intimidating.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Mind-Blowing Visual Effects, But With a Weak Story","What made this movie was absolutely its visuals. I am not exaggerating at all when I say that they did things in this movie that I had never seen on screen before. You can definitely see influences of The Matrix and Inception in there, but it's ultimately its own thing. If for nothing else, Doctor Strange is worth seeing just for these mind-blowing, incredible special effects that I'm convinced will not only be nominated for an Oscar, but will by far win it. The creativity of the team behind this film shines through its technical brilliance. Not only did they continuously top themselves scene after scene with the level of complication behind these visual feats, but they found ingenious ways to incorporate these effects into the hand-to-hand combat. You could tell every big action set piece was incredibly well thought out and orchestrated. The action is also something we've never seen before, especially in any of the other Marvel movies. The way the filmmakers effortlessly blended the use of magic with the Asian- style fighting choreography was impeccable. Truly amazing to watch on screen. I didn't get to watch this film in IMAX 3D, but I'm planning on seeing it again in theaters, and I'll definitely make sure to check it out in that format...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"MARVEL Saves Their BEST Trick For Last with their Dizzying, Dazzling, Daring Foray into The Fantastical","I must still be in my astral form, floating in an etherium of utter, unbelieving, bliss, gliding, translucent and glowing, for my feet have not touched the ground once. Forget everything you know about Superhero movies, a beloved genre that began beautifully as an eccentric niche, and was falling dangerously close to convention. Let your mind be opened to the infinite impossibilities that await you...................Doctor Strange is a MASTERWORK worthy of the name, MARVEL!!! It is unprecedented in every mirrored and reflected facet, unparalleled in its incredulous abilities, there has NEVER been a film like it, it's breathtakingly innovative, truly groundbreaking, a kaleidoscope of unimagined vibrance, and mind-blowingly BEAUTIFUL!!!!! With a man at the heart of it all that is nothing less than pure MAGIC. I didn't watch a film last night, no, I EXPERIENCED a man transformed, body, mind, and soul into a superhero, and saw a star BURST into a powerful, blinding, supernova!!!! Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you an unstoppable force, the INCREDIBLE, INCOMPARABLE, SENSATION Benedict Cumberbatch!!!!Mr. Cumberbatch doesn't just act, he BECOMES, giving life and laughter to a BRILLIANT Doctor at the top of his profession. His Stephen Strange is arrogant yet endearing, prickly yet charming, well-liked and jovial. He's got the world on a string and he knows it, and his steady hands have been magic from the beginning, garnering for him wealth, and acclaim, a career that he adores, prizes as if it were a real and breathing love interest. Stephen Strange feels so intricately nuanced and real, as exquisitely woven as the nerve cells he so expertly navigates. It's as if he's the other dimension, American Cumberbatch, like he's been living all this time in a parallel universe, just on the other side of the mirror, an ingenious doppelganger, who's as talented at neurosurgery, as Benedict is at acting. I believed him completely, as this rockstar doctor, dancing to 70's music, outshining his peers, laughing and quipping with the interns. I believed entirely that he could actually perform all of those complicated, impossible surgeries without batting an eye. Again, Ben doesn't ""play,"" Stephen Strange he creates him.Mr. Benedict Cumberbatch has exquisitely OUTDONE himself in this fast-paced, highly decadent, soaring epic of an origin story. It's so refreshingly new, so unique, unlike anything ever done before, a novel and masterfully executed, feat of cinema sorcery. It's a soaring magical kaleidoscope trip through the infinite and the impossible, a Technicolor, twirling dream through time. With his Doctor Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch has broken into a whole new untouched celestial realm of his vast and uncharted talent. I'm still a bit shell shocked...........The visual effects are in themselves MYSTIFYING, and spellbinding, cleverly tricking the eye again and again, until you're SURE what you are seeing, is in fact real!!!! Think of the first time you saw a magic trick, no matter how seemingly simple, as a child. Remember that astonished look on your face, that wonder and baffled merriment as you tried to figure it, but couldn't!!!! THAT'S what Doctor Strange is!!!!! Countless times I thought, with wide, incredulous eyes, ""HOW did they do that!?!?"" I've seen movies in IMAX before, but I was not at all prepared for these breathtaking, heart-racing, effects that I not only saw, but LIVED through, up close in this EXCEPTIONAL world!The supporting cast is excellent. Rachel McAdams is the gorgeous, natural beauty of Stephen's Ex, who keeps up with him, puts him in his place, and brings out something tender and gentle in him, as revealed in a beautiful, and loving inscription on the back of his watch. It's a moment that surprises and quietly delights, tugging at your heartstrings in the sweetest way. Benedict Wong's straight faced, dead pan reactions to Stephen's tom-foolery, and wittily relevant pop culture references, is BEYOND perfect, and there's this HILARIOUS scene of him listening to Beyonce that made the whole audience laugh SO hard!!!! It's a wonderful moment, and you really get invested into Stephen's side sojourn to make Wong laugh!!!! Tilda Swinton is a REVELATION!!!!! She's ethereal and mystic, and preternatural, as the Ancient One. Her voice sings with such old world wisdom, and again, her chemistry with BENEDICT is scintillating!!! Her tranquil strength, her enlightened power........... all prove her to be the ONLY choice as Stephen's Sagacious Sensei. All those naysayers who were wary of her casting will be FOREVER silenced after seeing her in action.Marvel and Benedict Cumberbatch have made magic and mysticism real before our very eyes. Ben becomes their greatest, and most multi-faced, three dimensional hero. What makes him so compelling as a superhero for me is his vulnerability. He's not a hulking, gamma-radiated specimen. He doesn't have laser eyes, an iron suit, or even super strength. He has the power of his mind, the magic coursing through his fingers, and the inner peace of enlightenment. He's the hero that MARVEL desperately needed, to bring new enchantment to their Universe, to take audiences to new worlds, and show them places they can't even imagine. This film is a labour of love and a testament to the mesmerizing caliber of everyone involved. For the Man with the Magic hands, this is the golden portal to everything he's worked so relentlessly for. This is his moment, his entrance to the beyond. A level of stardom that he has so rightly deserved since he first uttered those immortal words back at Baker Street. Like Strange himself, he's got time on his arm, and magic at his fingertips. I'm ready to take this adventure with you, Stephen, by astral forms, between dimensions, and through conjured portals.The beyond, the awaiting wonders and dangers beckon. The portal opened, a limitless power protected, a hero rises, and the impossibilities are endless...............",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
another fast food item from McDisney,"While going to see the movie after several good reviews, I was pondering as to why capable actors accept these type of movie(where the scope of acting and thus challenge is minimal. At that time, I reached a conclusion that comic book characters are not any less creative than your regular movie characters. In fact they are product of a far wider (and sometimes wilder) imagination, giving actors opportunity to portray something they never thought of in their life. Hence it's a good enough motivation(of course the number one motivation is big money in the big blockbuster franchise).As I started watching the movie, I realized in the opening sequence itself that this isn't going to be amazing. And the reason being, while the special effects looked real, they didn't felt real -- neither to me or the actors who were supposed to be in a warped 'building-bending' realm. Why? Because there were no stakes. If you ask yourself, is building bending upside down world adding anything to the chase? It wasn't making it difficult for anyone. Compare this to the Inception, where there was a race for lives against time. This was like, 'Oh, let me twist things a little' **wink, finger snap.The story was very generic, bland and frankly it looked like it's assembled as per the standard operating procedure of Marvel Studio. I did not find the character of Dr. Strange intriguing. He acted well, but could not make me seriously care for him(part of the reason being the funny lines whenever things went towards serious.) When you don't look or act like a real person(I know it's about a Sorcerer, yeah, I know), I can't care for you like a real person. Therefore I wont' care if you die halfway (although, I know you won't die halfway because it's already announced that Dr Strange in next MCU movie) People are praising Tilda Swinton for her role, which I did not find charismatic at all. She looked like a lizard and not the Sorcerer Supreme they said she was. Compare this to Master Li Mu Bai in Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, he nailed the role as a superior skilled master. (And if you can notice, he is Asian, unlike Tilda Swinton). The villain(s) were weak and other supporting characters were forgettable. I feel sorry for Rachel McAdams, her role was the worst.So in all, it wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a satisfying movie. It felt like a fast food item. It has some taste but no nutrition. And just like fast food, people are addicted to these type of movies and they are making tons of money for their studios. Marval has perfected this crime and DC wants to do the same. I have no idea, why people are writing good reviews for these big budget, blockbuster franchise movies. They does nothing more than burning your pockets and killing your brain cells.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Absolutely Stunning, beautiful film....touching story.","I love first films of comic characters when they're made this brilliantly...and it can stand with Iron Man I, and Thor I, as the most delightful popcorn films.Made me feel like a kid again, and that's saying a lot....since I'm old and wrinkly.Cumberbatch is superb as are all the cast. The special effects don't bore one to death, as they are not all corridor scenes, but actually ""add"" to the story-line.

"Comeon Cumberbatch, don't give in to big studio movies!!","First reviewed on 'broth of blogs' on word-press. OK lets start with the good. The special effects were spectacular - I am just another one who feels it was Kaleidoscope-y/Inception-y but really, they looked great. But was there anything else?Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange was good, but not as great as Downey as Tony Stark like most people are comparing. I mean Stark was so much more defined. I didn't even see why people are saying there are comparisons - there were like 2 scenes where Strange is shown to be an egotist and a brazenly rude genius. I didn't really care he lost his hands but I did care when Stark was being held hostage because they developed the character there you see. With Strange, they just fast forwarded without showing anything.I didn't really care for the whole mysticism and magic - I mean I know and have read about chakras and energy and what one can do with practices like Pranic Healing and Reiki. The whole Kamar Taj nonsense just felt so superficial, fake even. You send Strange up to Everest and he learns magic because he can't take the cold? Come on folks!I really like the chemistry between Stark and Potts because, again, they gave it time to develop. We do see some history here with Strange and his ex-love interest Christine Palmer but I didn't feel any emotions when he insults her because that is what he has always done and says sorry when he realizes that he has been a dick all the while.There was just too much going on with the plot too. Instead of the film makers taking time to develop the characters and just sticking to one world-disaster waiting to happen, they just zipped past the jerk-turned- superhero-saves-the-world bit. You see, some of the other superheros are more common, I mean most people would know the stories of Superman or Iron Man or Avengers. But Doctor Strange, they needed more of a back story. Not exposition, of where there was just too much in the movie.And what was Tilda Swinton doing in the movie? They could have at-least taken an Asian as the ancient one. Don't even get me started on Chiwetel Ejiofor and his role in the movie. He just looked gave up too easily being the Master and all.I could just go on and on about it but I will stop.Folks, I don't have anything against the actors, I think they did what they were asked to and they did it to the best of their abilities - I blame the greedy studios, trying to make another superhero movie just to fit the MIU. This could have been great, memorable even, if they had just given it time.I think the only memorable thing in the movie was Benedict Wong as Wong. Lol, he was funny.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Well-balanced between conventional and outlandish,"Rockstar neurosurgeon mister, sorry, doctor, Stephen Strange(perfectly cast Cumberbatch, embodying both the early arrogance and the mature respect) comes out of a car crash with his hands as destroyed as a PG-13 rating will allow. Western medicine simply can't do more than it has. So he finds himself in Kathmandu, in a temple, finding out that magic is real, as well as a huge world of its own. As he becomes more familiar with it, so do we, without it ever losing the ""wow"" factor. By the climax, when numerous different kinds of powers are wielded on both sides, we understand the core rules of every single one. This sets a new standard for how well-handled and, yes, accessible, a big budget fantasy tale can be, even if it's not a household name. It's not always that self-assured. Friend, not love, Christine(McAdams, sweet, charming, and actually a presence in spite of the limited screen time) is essentially nothing more than a studio note that ends in an underlined ""if not, it gets too weird"". This borrows from The Matrix, Inception, and the continually expanding and exciting(we will see Benedict again *very* soon!) MCU's most played card, Iron Man. But it makes it all work.They couldn't have picked a better hand than Derrickson's. He handles the action incredibly well. Yes, as an origin story, the middle doesn't have a lot, and the opening is fairly brief, giving us a taste of what we'll later bathe in. On the whole, it is plentiful, no sequence is ever so short it doesn't properly register, it looks and feels like nothing we've seen before, even if it has pieces that are recognizable. A gritty reality being invaded by increasingly strong supernatural forces – and the fact that he did Sinister, as well, is evident in some gruesome material. I can just hear the pitch now, opening as I'm sure it did with ""the film will just about open with a brutal accident so bad that it leaves the lead partially handicapped for most of it"".The door has been opened. The multiverse is upon us. It's glorious. Colorful, with tremendous depth(watch it in 3D!), unforgettable, psychedelic, amazing. We don't spend a lot of time out there – this *is* the first, pardon the pun, trip. It's enough to satisfy, and we'll explore further, with the success this will have – oh, on that... trust me. Going in blind? Think ""comics"" mean Dilbert and Garfield? Go, see it. You'll love it. This is quippy, quotable and quick. Everyone gets to be funny, several times over. Characters stick with you. Loki and Ultron are joined in the ""memorable, cool villain"" club by Kaecilius, distracting Danish accent(he's my countryman – I get to make fun of it) and all.I recommend this to anyone possessing eyes, ears and a base understanding of the English language.

This movie makes Suicide Squad look like art.,"I'm not a comic book fan (I did see it with one who was also disappointed though), however I do generally like the Marvel comic movies. To me, the films should be able to stand on their own though because if they are relying solely on the people who have read the Dr Strange comics they will have lost the vast majority of their audience.Now for the review... This movie makes suicide squad look like art. The FX are overdone, the director hasn't really known how to express certain concepts and so has just resorted to quite cheap looking whizzing lights. The acting is okay but Cumberbatch is characteristically wooden and his character is unlikable (not his fault the character is supposed to be unlikeable). The female master (whose name escapes me for the minute) is too one dimensional to care about, the result being that there was no-one to root for. I barely remember the bad guys, they were way too (and I hate to use the phrase again) one dimensional and too many of them to focus your dislike on any of them. The plot also gets a bit iffy toward the end but I don't want to spoil it. ;) I know this is supposed to be on the periphery of the Marvel universe but it feels so detached from the rest of it you might as well consider it to be a different universe again. It's kind of like they have said 'and to hell with explaining the pseudo science with these characters, these ones are just magic, OK?'. And that may seem like a small thing but it isn't. It means that you can't ponder whether one superhero could defeat another because there is no logic to it that holds true throughout. It's just magic so anything could happen and all of it is on such a different level to what the rest of the superheroes are doing (fighting crime not alternate beings from other dimensions) that Dr Strange should effectively render them all redundant.

A surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character,"Doctor Strange is a superhero film based on the Marvel Comic Book of the same name. Although I wouldn't consider it a Top 10 film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I still found it to be a highly enjoyable origin story. Along with Guardians of the Galaxy, this film wasn't afraid to take risks or stray too far from the typical Marvel superhero formula.Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant but arrogant neurosurgeon, is involved in a car accident that seriously damages the nerve endings in his hands. With his career now ruined, Strange sets out for Nepal, where he heard a paraplegic learned how to walk again. While in Nepal, Strange meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), a mysterious person who runs a society of loyal followers tasked with defending the Earth from evil inter-dimensional threats. Intrigued by the possibility of unlocking his full potential, Strange undergoes a lengthy training process with the Ancient One to become a master sorcerer.Perhaps the most thought-provoking of the Marvel films, Doctor Strange is a surreal but interesting look into the psyche of the title character. Benedict Cumberbatch feels like he's giving it his all in the lead role and even his American accent wasn't too bad, although it is far from perfect. Mads Mikkelsen also gave a solid performance as the film's villain Kaecilius, who didn't just seem like a generic bad guy wanting to take over the world. However, Tilda Swinton steals the show as the Ancient One, Her spiritual lectures in the film really struck a chord with me. The visual effects were fantastic, strongly reminiscent of Inception and 2001: A Space Odyssey. So far, I'd say it's the most visually gorgeous looking film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I look forward to seeing the Doctor Strange character in the future Avengers film.I rate it 8/10.

"Amazing,Weird, And Cool At the same Time","Doctor Strange Is a one heck of a good movie, the cast is good, the joke is good as well. Benedict Acting was very smooth just like in the comic.

Worth to watch, better than Now You See Me magic trick (Of Couse) maybe surpass the Harry Potter's Magic. In DCEU movie contain darker theme than MCU movie maybe Kevin Feigi can Adopt this method to applied some darker theme to the movie maybe just maybe its makes all of the movie like Avengers looks way more cooler than ever, and makes a movie like GTOG vol.2 even funnier and cooler if added with more dark situation, and if you give rating A18 makes more blood spilling out everywhere",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Great beginning and the best LSD Trip on Screen so far, but potential wasted from the middle on.","Great beginning and the best LSD Trip on Screen so far, but potential wasted from the middle on.In the beginning the movie is quite spiritual and has some wisdom. The wisdom is deeper, than in usual movies of that genre, but still far away from deep. For example :""..we can not lose our demons but only live above them..."" This statement is deeper than the usual black and white philosophy of movies like star-wars etc., but still not really paradox as our quantum universe seems to be. Living above our demons, means no transformation, but only constant control. In order to master our demons, we have to actually stop fighting them and make peace with all our darkness. (see Erich Fromm /C.J.Jung) This realization is maybe the greatest Challenge to movies, books etc., because what can we write about, if the good is also bad and bad is also good?The movie first states that humans have a spiritual power, but quickly subjectifies it into smth which is material and not paradox at all. Spirituality becomes just another world to master and conquer. Surrender becomes a control of the ego, rather than an openness to something greater, than the material world. It acutely becomes all about magics, a movie for children. No mysticism like in matrix, (Neo realized the brightest light in the darkness of the machines, when he lost his eyes). More and more the special effects in the movie take away the viewers ability to imagine and go deeper into the subject and so the mystery and mystic feeling changes to a decent visual experience. In the beginning it was absolutely great, because the effects was driven by mysticism and a spiritual wisdom, which watered down towards the end.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The script is excellent, the cinematography is superb, and the acting is great. This movie clearly shows the origin of Doctor Strange's powers without leaving the audience with questions.The character development of Strange happens to be fast and for me, it's okay.The story is great but the resolution is a little bit simple.

Doctor Strange (2016) When the visual sustains a film,"The psychedelic aesthetic and things involving other universes is something I'm very interested in and that's one of the reasons why I love Doctor Strange. The whole look is wonderful and makes it one of the most beautiful films in the entire Marvel universe. However, he fails a lot on certain issues and at several times he is very slow and boring, but again he is supported by the visuals and makes the scenes a little more interesting. Stephen's learning seems very simple, they start by developing it very well and then try to make it as fast as possible so as not to take up screen time. The third act has memorable and very cool moments, but ends up being tiring. Benedict Cumberbatch is a great actor for the role and it works really well.

"""You're a man looking at the world through a keyhole. You've spent your life trying to widen it.""","Recently I think people have forgotten why we go out of our way to see a film in theaters. To me it's to experience something unique, entertaining, just to have fun. Almost every studio these days, it's all about the NEXT film, the bigger and better film. With Doctor Strange it comes to a new level, it's got flare, originality and that's why I think it's above most comic book films.Don't get me wrong I adore the team films and I love sequels but one day for me they'll get boring, that's why we need films like Ant-Man and Doctor Strange to show we can have original concepts yet still strive in a larger universe. The greatness of the film of course comes from it's ability to have an excellent story and it's visual storytelling to be through the roof.Let me first say that in my opinion Benedict Cumberbatch is a superb actor who gives an outstanding performance as Dr. Strange, who at times is an ass but at the same time he's able to portray him as sympathetic. He allows his character to ""consume"" him and gives his whole which shows and results in him becoming one of my favorite characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Despite the lack of her in the first half Rachel McAdams also gives a great performance outside her usual rom-com roles. She wasn't one of those defenseless love interests, she had a part to play and I love that. All three of the mystic team; Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, and Tilda Swinton, as the infamous ""Ancient One"" are all fantastic in their own rights as well. Mads Mikkelsen, oh my god, he is so good in this. I've seen him in close to nothing and now I want to watch every things he's in.Scott Derrickson, who I've never seen a film from, manages to have all these components put together beautifully and uses slick and smooth direction to enhance the experience and result in a hell-of-a ride. His pairing with the best cinematography I've seen all year result in the most beautiful looking film all year. Okay but seriously Doctor Strange has the best visuals I've seen in along time. It's just oozes magnitude. I was in shock and in awe for every sequence, my eyes were glued to the screen and I was so happy for that.Although it follows the mainstream marvel origin story, Doctor Strange still manages to not feel like every other superhero movie. Of all the Marvel Studios' origin story's like Iron Man and Thor thankfully Doctor Strange is in the top tier. I'm really excited to see where the MCU takes this character because he has a lot of potential and had a great start here.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
NON-SPOILER - Could have been so much better.,"First off, I liked the film. It's good, not great. Excellent visuals obviously, but this film was definitely dipped into that Disney glaze. Having read the comics, Doctor Strange is a dark character, dealing with his demons, and he faces dark situations. There was entirely too much comedy in this film. I felt like I was watching a Disney comedy at a point at it took me out of the rest of the film, because I knew the stakes wouldn't be there anymore. A LOT of the comedic relief just did not work and really should have been left out, and this film would have been damn-near perfect, with the perfect tone fitting the situations surrounding them. GREAT score, some fine action sequences, GREAT cast and performances across the board, and superb written dialogue for Chiwetel Ejiofor's Mordo, Benedict Wong's Wong, and especially Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One. She stole the show for me, which is saying something, because I was on the fence about her casting from day 1. This film starts off mature, for adults, but then turns into a child's Disney film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Excellent magical fireworks display,"It is actually quite some time since I watched Doctor Strange but somehow the movie must have slipped between the cracks since I appear to have forgotten to review it. So I am about to remedy that now. To put it in simple terms: This is an excellent movie. It is a wonderful display of magical fireworks with a decent enough story to keep it together.I have to confess that I have not really read many of the comics containing Doctor Strange so it is a bit difficult for me to comment on the aspect of the film versus the comics. From the little that I have read I got the impression that the comic book version of Doctor Strange was a wee bit more dark, serious and mature. This movie starts from the beginning of his career though so I guess there is some justification for the less mature Doctor Strange in the movie.Doctor Strange is a skilled neurosurgeon but a bit of an asshole. Actually more than ""a bit"". He gets involved in a accident, that he pretty much causes himself due to his arrogance. Fast forward to the interesting chapter were we get to see Doctor Strange being, reluctantly, admitted into a scruffy looking monastery on the other side of the planet. That is when the fun starts. Doctor Strange is in for a ride. Slowly Doctor Strange gets knocked into him that magic exists and he is expected to practice it.The time at the monastery, or perhaps we should call it a school, leads to a few funny episodes and I do like the head monk's bantering with Strange and the way she does things. Talk about getting thrown into the deep end of the swimmingpool first. Strange's continued arrogance and immaturity is a bit annoying from time to time though. That has to be said.What is the use of super heroes if there are no bad guys around. So after Strange having trained for a while, and mostly failed miserably, the bad guys starts to crash the party. So no more pretty living room magic for Strange. It is time to go head to head with some serious competition. Unfortunately, for a good chunk of the first fights Strange mostly falls on his arse. They are still cool and beautiful to watch though.Slowly Strange starts to get to grip with this whole magic thing and he also starts to shed some of that arrogance of his and take some responsibility. About time since the despicable bad guy are, of course, working towards freeing the real BIG bad guy, father of all evil and mother of everything else bad you can think of. Time for a showdown.As the fighting escalates so does the user of special effects and personally I though the special effects were both beautiful and spectacular. I really liked them.I am not sure Cumberbatch would have been my first choice for Doctor Strange though. To me he do not really project the image of the wise and skilled Wizard I expected. He is not bad though. The only other person that stood out for me was the chief monk and The Ancient One which I also quite liked. The rest of the characters, well to me they mostly lived in the shadows of these two, even though they were in general likable and sometimes fun.There were a few rather hilarious parts where Strange has to reveal the truth about what he stepped in to his former girlfriend. I have a soft spot for the surprise moments in both movies and books.I rather not get started on time travel since I generally hate it as a story element since it almost always leads to paradoxes or is simply so poorly done that it is blatantly obvious that someone tried to cover up for a lazy and shoddy story. However I guess I have to mention that screwing around with time is an important part of the plot in this movie. Luckily it is done in such a way that it do not, in my opinion, negatively impact the movie. Actually, to my surprise, it is used in a rather cool way.So, bottom line, a movie I liked quite a lot. 5 out 5 stars kind worth of liking.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
a unique blend of elements make for good storytelling,"Marvel Comics adaptation highlights the spiritual odyssey of Stephen Strange, a distinguished, self-important Manhattan neurosurgeon whose skill and arrogance have virtually overtaken his entire life, until a devastating accident takes away the use of his most prized possession: his hands. Still stubborn and conceited enough to believe that he can defy the odds, Strange embarks on a journey of healing, seeking tutelage from the Ancient One where he learns about the metaphysical world, alternate dimensions, and the all-powerful Eye of Agamotto. Extremely well-crafted chapter of the MCU is a visual candyland of mysticism and magic with phenomenal visual effects, thrilling action scenes, a colorful assortment of characters, and a witty, mischievous sense of humor. Cumberbatch is faultless in the lead, and he's surrounded by a noteworthy supporting cast. Eventually succumbs to the obvious, but still a lot of fun. ***",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Although I wasn't fond of the casting of a woman to play the Asian man as the Ancient one, Tilda did a pretty good job so I'll give her credit. It's a nice break away from the standard superhero films like the Hulk, Thor or Captain America and this is Disney's first film where they now can explore alternate dimensions and Magic. Something they withheld back in Thor and other films.If you're a fan of Harry Potter magic, you'll enjoy and love Doctor Strange.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A lot of fun! Great characters played by great actors,"Have seen Doctor Strange twice now, first in IMAX 3D, second on a regular screen. Go for the IMAX 3D if you can, but it still holds up in 2D. But this film should really be seen in a theater to get the full effect.Everyone in the cast is terrific, even those in smaller roles. More fun than I've had with most recent films--lots of action, good humor, very cool graphics.It IS an origin story, so some of the story is similar to others, but the settings, the new elements of magic, and the intersection with other Marvel characters and stories make it different enough to shine.Be sure to stay through all the credits. There is one scene mid- credits, but the more interesting one is after all of the credits have rolled. Check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Doctor Strange"" magnificently raises the bar and expands the horizon for the Marvel Cinematic Universe.","The wild superhero action-adventure-fantasy film ""Doctor Strange"" (PG-13, 1:55) does for the Marvel Cinematic Universe what the character did for Marvel Comics when he first appeared in 1963 – make a universe into a multiverse. When Marvel artist Steve Ditko brought his idea to his Spider-Man co-creator, writer Stan Lee, according to Ditko, it was ""a new, different kind of character for variety in Marvel Comics"". The film connects Strange's new world to previous Marvel stories this way: ""Heroes like the Avengers protect the world from physical dangers. We safeguard it against more mystical threats."" The story in this vibrant and visually remarkable film starts ordinarily enough. Dr. Stephen Vincent Strange (Oscar nominee Benedict Cumberbatch) is a supremely talented neurosurgeon, with the ego to match. (Think of him as an even better, but only slightly more charming version of TV's ""House"".) He has an emotional attachment to fellow surgeon Dr. Christie Palmer (Oscar nominee Rachel McAdams), whom he respects only slightly more than rivals like Dr. Nicodemus West (the underrated Michael Stuhlbarg), whom he doesn't hesitate to publicly embarrass. Driving to a dinner, Strange's Lamborghini tumbles down a hillside and his life comes crashing down with it. Still in charge of his faculties and in possession of all his appendages, he nevertheless suffers devastating hand injuries which effectively ends his surgical career. He searches in vain for a medical solution, becoming even more self-absorbed as he does so. When Strange learns about and tracks down a man named Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt) who completely recovered from a similarly devastating injury, Strange learns about a place of healing called Kamar-Taj, near Katmandu, Nepal, and literally spends his last dollar to get himself there.Kamar-Taj is a mysterious complex run by The Anicent One (Oscar winner Tilda Swinton) – and is nothing like Strange expected. The Anicent One thinks that Strange is too arrogant to bother with, but she is convinced by one of her followers called Karl Mordo (Oscar nominee Chiwetel Ejiofor) to let the rude but desperate doctor stay. She convinces him to look beyond his current reality by thrusting his spirit out of his body and into, as pluggedin.com wonderfully described it, ""hurtling through unimagined realms, galaxies and dimensions. He flies through the universe and finds another and another. He spins through time and matter - soaked in color, drenched in image, places pregnant with beauty and horror."" Strange begs to be taught and he progresses quickly, becoming a talented student of the mystic arts. But The Anicent One struggles to teach him ""the simplest and most significant lesson of all... It's not about you."" There's definitely something much, much bigger than Strange's problems for Kamar-Taj to contend with. A former master sorcerer called Kaecilius (TV's ""Hannibal"", Mads Mikkelsen) has stolen pages from one of The Ancient One's secret books of rituals and plans to use the spell to summon the supremely powerful Dormammu from The Dark Dimension in order to remake the natural world and give everyone in it eternal life. The Ancient One, Mordo and Wong (Benedict Wong), the Kamar-Taj librarian, all warn Strange about the danger posed by Kaecilius and Dormammu – and they try to keep Strange from experimenting with powers that he doesn't yet understand – but the newly self-assured sorcerer has to learn all those lessons for himself – while his own life and the fate of our world hangs in the balance.Like ""Deadpool"" earlier in 2016, ""Doctor Strange"" raises the already high bar for MCU films. The story is fresh, interesting and transports us to new worlds which excite the imagination. The visual effects are simply amazing and the score is terrific. The sights and sounds of the first sequence alone are worth the price of admission, but we get a full two hours of remarkable creativity and outstanding entertainment. (And make sure you stick around for the fun mid-credits scene and the game-changing post-credits confrontation.) Some have criticized the film's changes from the comics and/or the extreme efforts to be politically correct in this movie's casting, but the story works very well, and the cast is pitch perfect – Cumberbatch in particular. Others complain that the visuals are too close to 2010's ""Inception"", but they are completely in service to the story and take visual effects to the next level. My only criticism involves a slight overuse of slapstick as comic relief, but that's a subjective and very minor issue, considering how good the movie is overall. In the film, The Ancient One expands the title character's perception of reality, as the movie does for the audience, by telling her newest student, ""You think you know how the world works. You think this material universe is all there is. What if I told you the reality you know is one of many?"" What if indeed. ""A""",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel succeeds again,"It's strange but Marvel Comics seems to be able to provide an endless run of new characters for movie outings and a succession of successful screen adaptations, while DC Comics struggles to move beyond Superman and Batman and does not always score highly with its cinematic adventures.The latest Marvel character to hit the big screen is the lesser-known American Doctor Stephen Strange, played with aplomb by British actor Bendict Cumberbatch, and we are presented with an origin story that explains who he was before he became a super- hero and how he acquired his extraordinary powers. It's clear that Strange will be back on our screens because we have two extra clips, one early on in the credits and another at the very, very end of the credits.The story-line is pure hokum with characters like The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton at her androgynous best) and an evil one called Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen as a baddie yet again) and much talk of The Astral Dimension, The Dark Dimension and The Mirror Dimension plus copious references to energy. As The Ancient One explains: ""Through the mystic arts, we harness energy and shape reality"". Yeh, right ...Yet the whole thing zips along with great gusto and is leavened with some humour both visual (such as a Cloak of Levitation with a mind of its own) and verbal (such as a reference to a WiFi password). Above all, it looks wonderful with shape-shifting buildings and cities that put the beginning of ""Inception"" in the shade and frequent rides into the edges of our universe and apparently the centres of other universes. The special effects are impressive and, if you like 3D (I don't), you will probably want to take your glasses along.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
overall good,"Over all the movie was good, it had some really funny scenes and very good visuals that made it entertaining to watch. The plot was very cliché and the ending lacked some logic. A lot of it was very predictable to the point that you don't have to go to far into the movie to have a solid idea of where it is leading. It played a lot with mysticism, magic, and time making it intriguing and confusing which is OK if you're not paying too much attention, but if you do you might notice that some things contradict and defy the logic that was established previously in the movie. That was one of the issues I had with the ending, which I don't want to spoil. The acting was good and I feel like if I didn't like something about it was probably because of the plot. Although the plot was cliché people never get enough of the story and most movies today rely a lot on the visuals to entertain the audience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Strangely Marvelous!,"MCU's 14th installment in the form of magic and mysticism is something I had waited for since the start of MCU itself. Finally watching it coming to life on screen and that too by a wonderful performer by Benedict Cumberbatch himself is more than something to bargain. Doctor Strange is a visual treat for both Marvel fans and movie going fans alike. The 3D VFX throughout the movie is top notch and director Scott Derrickson just nails his way of weaving a story-line with a new villain named Kaecilius. To many, this villain may be underrated but once you pick up a Doctor Strange Prelude comic, you may actually know the back story of Kaecilius and his purpose of taking the dark side. Tilda, being an amazing actress herself, playing The Ancient One is a delight. I love the fact that Marvel is overstepping the borders of gender equality and racism stuffs. No Asian male, this time, it's a white woman with no hair, with a title ""THE ANCIENT ONE"". Yes, I dig it! As usual, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo is fantastic. Watching Chiwetel and Cumberbatch together after 12 Year A Slave is wonderful. Mordo's story arc is a solid way of portraying a future villain in future sequels. Personally, I have no issue with Benedict's accent as many others, it's absolutely great to watch him on screen and that too with so much visual effects. It's like Sherlock, but with a ruby red Cloak Of Levitation, a french cut and some mystical stuffs. My verdict - Go watch it in IMAX 3D and experience a mind-tripping movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just for Benedict Cumberbatch,"I am not a fan of Marvel so I can only judge this movie by itself. This three-dimension movie tries to show effects but actually makes itself dizzy. Two many confusing plots fill the whole story, and there is no gradual process for the protagonist to change from a layman to a master - he just finishes the process almost in a second looking at the mysterious book. What's more, in the end, the ending egg is even more ridiculous: Baron Mordo was loyal to the earth while he turned his back on it just after saving the earth without reasonable transition. Although I didn't read the comics, I can sense that the story would be much better and more integrated in the comics.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The visuals make it worthwhile.,"I was reasonably entertained by Doctor Strange despite not fully following the plot; my enjoyment was largely thanks to the sheer spectacle of the whole thing, the film featuring several jaw-dropping set-pieces that make the absolute most of modern digital technology. The basic story sees talented but arrogant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) seeking help from a mystical source when traditional methods fail to help him recover from a devastating car crash. Trained by a sorcerer known as The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), Strange learns powerful magical spells that come in handy when he and his new friends are attacked by Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who is trying to help a dark being from another reality take over Earth.While the script might be lacking somewhat in originality and clarity, every last cent of the budget is up there on the screen, director Scott Derrickson delivering mind-bending special effects sequences that really grab one's attention, from the opening fight in London in which buildings fold and distort, to the spectacular car crash that claims Strange's dexterity, to the astounding finale in which our heroes battle the bad guys while time runs backwards (words can't do this incredible technical feat justice: it needs to be seen to be believed).While not the greatest film in the MCU, Doctor Strange is a worthy enough entry that provides enough eye-candy for the duration.

Why cast Tilda Swinton as a bald Tibetan monk?,"First, the 7-star rating is based on the entertainment value. The movie moved quickly, and the action and special effects were pretty awesome. This is not to say there were some major issues with the movie.""Dr. Strange and the very Strange Tibetan Monk"" may have been the more a propos title. The entire time I was watching Swinton, a question lingered in the back of my mind. ""What, a white middle-aged woman is the spiritual and combat master leading the Tibetan monks?!"" This was a bit hard to swallow.Another issue with the movie is the story flow. It was more like watching action series than a movie. I had to either swallow and/or blink hard time the scene changed. The filming seemed to have wrapped up while the editing was in progress.Not to discourage you from seeing the movie, it is still fun but don't try to understand the complex and very improbably storyline.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not Magical Enough!,"'Doctor Strange' comes up short compared to its gargantuan expectations. Despite staggering visuals, a strong leading-man & some fun jokes, this superhero spectacle is eventually a disappointment. Reason? Lazy Writing & Uneven Pacing.'Doctor Strange' Synopsis: A former neurosurgeon embarks on a journey of healing only to be drawn into the world of the mystic arts.'Doctor Strange' begins dull, but gathers some momentum once Strange embarks on his journey. But, the pace drops again once Strange learns the magical force & a not-so-strong villain Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen, not in form this time), add to its disadvantages. The action is spectacular, though. Once Strange begins to kickass, there's not stopping him & its a lot of fun watching him do that. Even the jokes here evoke laughter, even though they come in limited doses. The visuals are mind-blowing, the action works, but Writing wise, its loopholes all over.Scott Derrickson & C. Robert Cargill's Screenplay works, only in parts. The pace, also, is uneven. The film jumps from being fun to plain dull. And no film, despite its technical achievements, can rise above a rather weak Screenplay. Derrickson's Direction, on the other-hand, relies on visuals to deliver. Cinematography is excellent, while the Editing needed to be sharper. Art & Costume Design are perfect. Make-Up is finely done, as well. Michael Giacchino's Score is tops.Performance-Wise: Benedict Cumberbatch as Stephen Strange/Doctor Strange, is superlative all through. He rises above the narrative's underwhelming edges & delivers a rock-solid portrayal of the superhero. Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One, is first-rate. Chiwetel Ejiofor as Karl Mordo, is underused.

Doctor Strange,"Doctor Strange is a mind blowing movie that you just need to see to believe. Marvel has done it once again with another masterpiece. Every movie they do just keeps on getting better and better. The 3D was the best 3D I have seen in a very long time, and I go to a lot of 3D movies so that is saying a lot coming from me. It had a great cast who brought the chearecters from a comic book to a live action movie that is now a house hold name and will probably be one for a long time.Parents this movie is not like Deadpool that is R rated and super sexual it is PG-13 rated and it is very intense throughout the film.

The Matrix meets Inception with House MD,"Went to see this movie at the Leeds/Bradford Odeon with my husband, son and son's friend last night.In this Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Deliver us from Evil) directed and written (with Jon Spaihts: Prometheus, Passengers and C. Robert Cargill: Sinister, Sinister 2) film, from the comic book character by Steve Ditko, Benedict Cumberbatch (Sherlock, The Imitation Game) stars as Doctor Stephen Strange the brilliant but arrogant former neurosurgeon.Rachel McAdams (Mean Girls, About Time) is his former girlfriend Christine Palmer, who finally tires of his wallowing cruelty following the accident that robs him of his surgeons hands. By chance he hears of a former physiotherapy patient who walked again following a seemingly incurable back injury, so he decides to find out more. This leads him to Jonathan Pangborn (Benjamin Bratt: Clear and Present Danger, Demolition Man) who tells him to seek Kamar-Taj and The Ancient One who can open his mind to unknown mysteries of the universe that could be the answer he is seeking.Once there, Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor: 12 Years a Slave, Children of Men) takes him to The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton: The Chronicles of Narnia, We need to talk about Kevin) who can begin his magical education.Strange's arrogance still has not left him though, so he distracts Wong (Benedict Wong: The Martian, Moon) from his post in the library and reads a forbidden text which leads him to the enemy, Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen: Casino Royale, Hannibal), and he must choose between his new life and his old.This film had so much fantasy action it made the head spin. Brilliant effects reminiscent of The Matrix and Inception, coupled with fantastic action and a good story. It also had a believable villain (though a tad underused) and set pieces of fighting/imagery that pulled you into the fantasy world and didn't let go.Cumberbatch was a strong lead and even though we felt he was channelling House MD, his arrogance did not tip over into being unlikeable (a fine line Marvel treads well, e.g. Iron Man), therefore we really cared about his character. The one liners that were trickled in helped to ground the movie and the odd nod to the wider Marvel Universe never hurts. Swinton was spot on as The Ancient One (despite fandom having a problem with her casting when it was announced, I think she convinced as the powerful yet flawed mystic) and it was great to have a strong female lead that got so much screen time. Sadly, the same could not be said for McAdams who though wasn't the romantic interest as such (Strange and Palmer had broken up), she did feel like a bit of a thinner character that the rest, which was a shame as she was clearly more than capable of just chemistry and laughs. Ejiofor was also outstanding (again a casting against character like Swinton), as were Wong and Mikkelsen, who unfortunately also suffered from lack of screen time, ditto the rest of the henchmen, but these are small problems when you take the film as a whole.The real heart of the film is the dynamic between Cumberbatch and Swinton and the scenes where they are together, resonate and fill you with anticipation for how the rest of the Marvel Universe characters (Superheroes and Gods) might fare against, or teamed with, Strange.A visual feast (which I am sure would only be enhanced watching it in 3D) and leaves me wanting more, roll on the Doctor Strange franchise.There are two credit scenes, so be sure to stay right until the end and don't worry about keeping your eyes peeled for the Stan Lee cameo, it feels so crammed in it nearly takes you out of the action of the film.Matrix meets Inception with House MD 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

My favourite MCU film,"I'm not a fan of most of the MCU. I like intelligent dialog, believable characters and am not fond of the hyper violence that MCU is renowned for. You also have too much political correctness jammed down your throat, which is why characters such as Black Widow are so aggressive.Doctor Strange is none of those things particularly. The cast are all-round excellent. Tulsa Swinton was superb, mostly through solid acting and that she didn't feel the need to be hyper violent. It was such a refreshing change. Benedict Cumberbatch walked a fine line of arrogant and charming and was very believable. Chiwetel Ejiofor wasn't over the top and he didn't feel like the typical 'larger than life black character' (eg. Like the Falcon who is so clichéd, it's numbing).The story was also solid. No scene felt out of place or dragged. There were no twists or dues ex machina that stood out.All in all, ignore everything Scott Mendehlson said about this movie. I disagreed with almost everything he said. It wasn't over the top. It was extremely subtle for MCU. The characters were believable for a change.Great, great movie. Very thoughtfully executed by all. Definitely my favourite MCU picture. I thought the movie was suitable for 12+. Some of the violence is eye opening (eg. A beheading), but was handled off-screen. There is some blood and depiction of a damaged body.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Entertaining film with good CGI,"Overall, I think the film was good and IT use was very good and flawless throughout the film, with consistently smooth CGI. I felt generally the acting was good with actors expressing themselves and changing intonation well.

Enjoyable but unexceptional,"Although I did read a single Dr. Strange comic book something like 50 years ago, it's fair to say I don't really know anything about the comic book. So I don't know how true it is to its source material. But divorced from that material, I found this a reasonably entertaining piece of nonsense that felt like it could have been better.The movie begins with a terrific opening scene in which people fight on the side of a building which is turning in on itself. Weird stuff happening with architecture is a common theme in the movie and is consistently entertaining.Then we meet Cumberbatch as a brilliant, arrogant surgeon whose golden hands are destroyed in an accident. Soon he discovers a temple in Katmandu that he believes can help him. It is headed by Tilda Swinton, and my response to that was, immediately, why is this white lady in charge of an Asian temple? This turns out to have been part of the Asian whitewashing complaints, but ignoring that entirely, it just seems weird, and goes totally unaddressed in the film.It is one of various small things that added together weaken the film. Another is the magical cape that makes an appearance. Again, I'm not familiar with the original comic books, but the cape in the movie seems like the silliest superweapon ever. It's played for laughs, which is perhaps the only option with something like this, but the cape slapstick felt out of place with the movie overall.The story itself feels a bit rushed. I got little sense of the villains or the actual stakes, and various ideas and twists were just kind of tossed out and never adequately pursued. Strange goes from jerk to hero without much actual character development.What saves the movie from its many flaws are some terrific set pieces, including a fight that takes place while time is reversing, and those crazy architecture battles. The action and special effects are quite good, Cumberthatch does a solid job, and the movie has a sprightly sense of humor.So overall I did like it. But I feel like there was potential for something better. Maybe they'll do better for the sequel?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel have done it again!,"The superhero genre is entering the stage where it will become increasingly hard to tread new ground and appease the masses, who over the course of a decade or thereabouts have been treated to a large contingent of high quality and highly entertaining outings filled with capes, dastardly world destroying villains, star studded casts and more quips than a John McLane Xmas party gone bad.Kings of the superhero domain, Marvel have been leaders in developing box office behemoths as their counterparts DC struggle to maintain pace after their Nolan Batman trilogy came to an end but even with the recent box office heavyweights Civil War, Age of Ultron, Deadpool and the well-received Ant-Man, Marvel to showed glimpses of the toll the superhero overkill has taken on the movie industry, trying to bring freshness and the wow factor that the genre once produced at ease is no longer as easy as it once was.Then along comes Doctor Strange.By no means reinventing the wheel but using the wheel in different ways, Scott Derrickson's film is very much an origin story that follows a well-trodden path, Doctor Strange, the story of the esteemed Dr. Stephen Strange who turns to the spiritual realm in search of healing from an horrific accident only to find himself our world's newest protector from nasty other-worldly beings, is absolutely the superhero film we needed right now, filled with fine casting choices, quick smart humour, an often bizarre and unique playground to dwell in and enough eye watering Inception-lite spectacle that will have many eyes laid wide open gazing at the big screen.Calling to mind the success of Marvel's huge breakthrough Iron Man from 2008, with Strange bearing more than a small resemblance to the origin story of a one Tony Stark (arrogance and wise cracking included), Doctor Strange excels off the back of Benedict Cumberbatch's impressive turn as the wonder-doctor and supported by the likes of Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton and the underused Rachel McAdams, Derrickson allows his cast to work their skills into the film while the director himself, who once seemed an odd choice (Sinister was beforehand his best film) showcases a talent for the imaginative that makes you hope he too will return for the next installment in this magic infused universe.Where Doctor Strange falls short is in the recently troublesome superhero 'big bad"" and despite the presence of esteemed actor Mads Mikkelsen (who sadly has become a bit of a villain typecast in recent years), the purple eyed Kaecilius, who wants nothing more than to meet a world destroying entity is anything but the adversary the unique Stephen Strange deserved, while the previously mentioned nature of this following the playbook origin story isn't breaking much ground in the way it tells the story of a man at his lowest finally realizing his true potential.After the stale Batman Vs Superman, the disappointing Suicide Squad, the fun yet forgettable Civil War and the overrated swear-laden Deadpool, Doctor Strange is exactly the type of comic book movie we needed and a nice change of pace (keep your ears open to for Michael Giacchino's un-superhero like harp infused score) for the direction Marvel was and still is heading into.A likely crowd pleasing experience that should be seen on the biggest screen available, this polished, inventive and most importantly fun thrill ride is yet another example as to why Marvel continue to pave out successes, where they should now be hitting bumpy roads.4 Wi-Fi passcodes out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The 14th film for the MCU was probably one of the best and visually outstanding movies that Marvel have done so far. Doctor Strange also sets up Thor Ragnorok as seen in the mid credits scene.

Marvel Does the Matrix,"As a person who both believes in science and works magic, watching this movie felt like remembering things I already knew. It reminded me of things I'd forgotten along the way, foundations buried by the dust of mundane life over the years. Some great stories sweep one away to another world, but this one swept away the dust off of this world, and showed it to be great and wonderful as any other.I'm giving this 10 out of 10 even though I do have a criticism, because my criticism did not occur to me while I was watching it. I had read a lot about the casting of Tilda Swinson as The Ancient One when the casting choice had been announced. I don't really know why they chose to change the Ancient One, but if it's because of the reasons bandied about in what I read back then, either reason is problematic in its own way. The most obvious reason would be to give any large, important speaking role to a white person for the sake of giving American audiences people they can relate to. Aren't we past this point yet, though? I mean, the Ancient One is basically a martial arts mentor, we had an Asian martial arts mentor in the old Kung Fu TV series even though the title character was played by a white guy, and American audiences had no problem with that. In the previews that played before Dr. Strange was a preview for a movie about the Great Wall of China, and, guess what, a white guy was the star. I'm just over hear shaking my head, wondering what sense that could possibly make in the story. OK, so there's that possibility, but the other one I read about back when the casting choices were made is more insidious if it's so: that they changed the Ancient One from being Tibetan so they could get the movie passed censorship by the government of China. So it could play in the Chinese market. So, now we're blaming Hollywood erasing Asian characters on China. OK then. I really would have liked the Ancient One to stay Asian. Given how much fighting the Ancient One does in the movie, it would have been great to have him played by an actual martial artist, too. All that said, though, none of that detracted from my enjoyment of the movie while I was actually watching it, it's just bugging me now, the next morning.Dr. Strange is a great spectacle. Even if you're not into the mysticism it portrays, the portrayal of the other worlds and the bending of time and space is done with excellent special effects that are great to watch. It reminded me of The Matrix in that it uses fx and fight scenes to show something deeper. On the surface, it's about gaining powers and defeating a bad guy like any other superhero movie, but underneath it has something to say about the nature of reality. There is enough plot to keep it from being just a psychedelic fx show. Each of the effects is necessary to the story.There are some great moments of humor. I especially liked the physical humor with the cloak. I laughed out loud at the near-pratfalls caused by the Cloak of Levitation.The character of Dr. Strange is one I can relate to because he's basically a human. Even though he starts out as an exceptional surgeon so he's up at the top of professional success, he's still just a human without any powers when he starts out. He's not a mutant or a demigod or an alien or given powers by a spider or gamma rays or any of the other ways superheroes usually get their powers. Strange is just a regular human being who learns stuff from books.I really liked how time and mortality were portrayed as positives. When the villains first explain their motivation, they don't sound like villains at all. They want to free the world from mortality, and that sounds great at first. It's only when we see the true nature of what they serve that the viewer realizes how wrong they are. I also like how questioning and bending the rules is portrayed as a positive. There isn't a hard line between the white hats and the black hats; the top good guys are gray.This movie delivers the action, fx, and humor one expects from a Marvel movie, including the obligatory Stan Lee cameo and a scene during the credits setting up another movie. Re-filling beer stein for the win, lol. It also serves up a mix of magic, technology, choices, and personal development that will please fans of Star Wars and The Matrix.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Entertaintment with capitals,"I'm not into superheroes comics or movies at all. I haven't read the Dr Strange comic ever either. I watched the trailer of this film at the cinema and I thought it looked too cool to let it pass. Besides the caliber of some of the actors involved in the project was a great sign that his wouldn't be yet another Marvel movie with more visuals than substance. Gladly, my hunch was good.Not having read the comic, I cannot comment on whether the adaptation to the screen is good or not. Thus, this review is just about the movie.Doctor Strange is utterly entertaining and has the right mix of drama, adventure, humour, philosophical teaching, character exploration, wow effects, goodies and baddies.The visuals of the movie are spectacular, and they are at the service of the story, not just to wow us with fluff. The styling, coloring, wardrobe, and city landscaping are awesome.To me the philosophical spiritual exploration of the main character is perhaps the thing that enjoyed the most, watching a prick transform from selfishness and narcissism into a person with a mission that transcends himself and puts himself at the service of others and of a greater cause, and that is done through inner hard-work catharsis.I found the British wit displayed in the film great!All the actors are believable in their respective roles. I especially liked Mikkelsen, Swinton, Cumberbatch, and Benedict Wong in this order. However, all the cast does a great job and are believable in their respective roles.Please stay for the full credits, until the very end, because there are two extras there that you don't want to miss.Entertainment as it should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Surreal effects, exciting development of story","This was a great movie to watch to relieve stress and have fun. The best things about the movie were the fantastic effects, of course by Marvel studios, and the humor that never stops. The story isn't very deep, teaching nothing to the audience except to not to text while driving, but comedy fills it up. Even the villains of the movie are comical. The graphics and effects playing with dimensions were very impressive and added to the quality of the movie.The cast was also great, although the movie drifted from the original comics where Dr. Strange was an Asian. The humor and the excessive talking of Benedict Cumberbatch was very natural, except that I really couldn't get used to his American accent, but it wasn't disturbing. The Ancient One's epicene look and character was also well played by Tilda Swinton.The story of the movie goes on pretty quickly, not allowing the audience to take their eyes off the screen. The plot is original and exciting from the beginning till the end, although some parts are predictable. It isn't at all realistic, but successfully lets the audience drift away from reality for the least 115 minutes. For me, this movie was one of the best Marvel studio movies.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

He is desperate to recover that talent at any cost which forces him to search for alternative therapies.The movie is certainly quite gripping throughout and the visuals are excellent.

Confusing and uninvolving,I'm a great fan of the Marvel films but this one is a dud.

Cliche but fun.,"Plot - This is a pretty cliche and formulaic story with mostly unoriginal characters. That being said, there are many elements of the story that are actually pretty interesting. Not everything is as throughly explored as it could be, but some of the plot twists and devices are interesting enough. If this movie focused on different things then what they did, it would've been fantastic. They rushed Doctor Strange's training, and if they'd spent a bit more stuff on that it would've made the movie much more interesting.Action - The action is amazing. Incredible effects are used to aid the incredible fight scenes, which are easily the best part of this movie.Characters - Though not all of these characters are very original, the acting is incredible. The cast brings these cliche characters to life, sucking you into this nonsense.Humor - This movie is pretty funny. Enough said.Cinematography - The effects are all amazing. The cinematography is great. The sets are awesome. This is a movie which is best enjoyed on the big screen - which I was lucky enough to see it on. The whole look of this movie is amazing.Overall this movie was fun. It wasn't super original and there's a lot of bs in it, but the action was good, the acting was good, and its something you can have fun watching.

Pretty ordinary fantasy film,"This film is based on a series of comics that I used to read many years ago. Its been so long that I cant really remember all that much, but I do remember that the comics were quite random in that the world it built had endless possibilities. So when this film concluded it did set up the possibility for that to be furthered in future films. Cumberbatch (Doctor Strange) was really good in this.His character arc is quite formulaic though. He starts out an arrogant holier than thou surgeon, but is brought down to earth when he is almost crippled while driving his over powered luxury car off the road. The road to recovery is littered with the usual trials and tribulation until the answer lies in the realm of the metaphysical, a realm that a straight laced surgeon has difficulty accepting. Accept it he must of course, because, as per usual in this type of story, the fate of all human kind rests in his surgically capable hands.The CGI effects were quite good. In fact they won an academy award. I admit I got a bit bored watching this though; I found the story to be predictable. If however you enjoy a fantasy film with a very three dimensional hero with real flaws and excellent cgi effects, you should check this out.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
And suddenly I felt nothing,"I literally left the theater without any impression. It's not a bad movie. It's not a good movie, either. It has nice visual effects. Unnecessary, but nice.The acting is OK. Not bad, not great, just OK. Dr. Strange could've been played by anyone. Cumberbatch, Whoopi Goldberg, Jeff Goldblum, it wouldn't make any difference. Cumberbatch is a fine actor but he brought nothing to the character.I didn't laugh once. I wasn't impressed with anything I saw. I wasn't displeased with anything I saw, either. The story wasn't good, but it wasn't bad.The movie looks the same, feels the same and plays the same as any other MCU movie.I grew up reading comic books and there was a time when I hoped they will make dozens of comic book movies a year, but, like they say, be careful what you wish for.Superhero movies became more generic and unimaginative, but also more expensive.Anyways, I don't know any reasons why anyone should see this movie, but on the other hand I don't see any reason why not.I hoped it would be better, and I wish I could say it sucked but it just didn't.It will probably make tons of money and we'll get a few sequels, which will be better or worse, but still nothing special.Have fun watching...

Marvel McMovie,"From the beginning, the movie had great actors, great writers and a great trailer. I was optimistic when I started watching, but simply put, it's poor story-telling. Drunk friends bragging of conquests innumerable have a better sense of plot and pacing.Before we get to it, Cumberbatch, McAdams, Ejiofor and Mikkelsen had good performances. I'd say kudos for Tilda Swinton, which is a great actress in her own right, but the role was convoluted from the beginning and it felt awkward.First of all, let's discuss the drama. Each origin story tends to be inspiring, and that is because of the darkness and despair that precede the hero's rise. However, at any point when something got even a little tense, someone would make a joke to diffuse the situation. I'm not talking only of Cumberbatch, though he made great use of his dry Sherlock humor, I'm talking about Mordo, Christine, Sorceress Supreme, Kaecilius.Let's talk about the plot. If you see a superhero movie for the first time and see this, you might go out of the cinema a bit happier than you went in. If you've started watching around, say, Batman Begins - well, the move's so recycled it's positively green: The Chosen One (anyone tired of that?), Fast learner, learn an ancient art in a Very Short Time, the not-a-killer discussion, doubting your teacher, evil monologue, getting a bright idea from the evil monologue.What about the love subplot? The chemistry was there, but in the face of saving the Earth - again - I couldn't have cared less. Why was that hogging screen time? In conclusion, go watch the Dr. Strange animated movie. It's slow-paced and it narrates explanations all the time, but it's a much better story.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Sherlock does justice, Ancient One falls flat on face","As a reader of the classic comics, Sherlock Holmes (Benedict) did absolute justice to the the character of Dr Strange. He brought that funny but serious but constructive character perfectly to him. I was not disappointed and is the only reason I gave this movie 4 stars.The reason I didn't give it more is they absolutely ruined ""The Ancient One"". They made everyone in the movie white. He was a saintly and extremely mystical figure. A Buddhist monk. They put some British chick! What on earth? It explains why they didn't give The Ancient One the screen time he deserves, because it was a totally out of character. Extremely disappointed.After the absolute disgrace of The Ancient One, they didn't do justice to Dormammu. They made him seem like he took a plea bargain. But Dormammu is such a immense character he's hard to capture. The Ancient One is also pretty immense but much easier to capture as he can be personified by a human. They even had a guy with white beard in the movie (the one with no hand).

A Great Origin Film,"I am off to see Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness in a few hours, so I decided to re-watch the original Doctor Strange film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees an arrogant neurosurgeon get drawn into the mystical arts in order to try and cure himself.Main Character
Benedict Cumberbatch plays Doctor Stephen Strange and he is great in the role. He plays both the arrogant Doctor and the Sorcerer really well and he feels natural as both. He is quite funny and as the film progresses and you see his character develop and grow an understanding on what he has to do as the character of Doctor Strange. It is a great introduction to the character and would lead to him being a big addition to the MCU.Supporting Characters
There was some controversy when Tilda Swinton was cast as The Ancient One but I thought she was really good and there is real depth to her performance. You go in expecting one thing and the film makes you thinking other things about her and this is big credit to the performance from Swinton. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Mordo and he is was a pretty cool character too, he takes up a mentor role for Strange but his character also gets time to develop and he progresses nicely with this new arrival totally changing his role as a sorcerer. Benedict Wong plays Wong and he is good in the smaller role he is given, the chemistry between him and Cumberbatch is good and it is a nice taster to what we would see in later film. Rachel McAdams plays Christine Palmer & Mads Mikkelsen plays Kaecilius, both are fine in there role and do nothing wrong it is a slight shame they weren't given more to do but they are both decent actors that try their best.Story
This is an effective origin story for Doctor Strange, it isn't the most unique one but it does a good job of building this character up and bringing this crazy wizarding world into play that was new to the MCU at this point. But some of the plot doesn't quite hold up, mainly the romance and villain plots, they just feel underdeveloped and like they were an afterthought which is a shame as it is a big part of the film.Script
The script is good, it is what is to be expected for a film in The MCU. There is a good blend of humour and drama and it pretty much all works. The characters are developed well and the plot is handled well enough for an introduction of a new character.Style
The film looks amazing, the magic looks incredible and so unique. Seeing this on screen is mind blowing and there wasn't really much that could reach these levels. When it is in the IMAX shots it looks stunning and absolutely incredible. Unfortunately, the film transitions between the IMAX and normal Aspect Ratio way too much and it is really jarring, I wish they had stuck to one or the other as it really takes away from this amazing looking film.Overall
Overall, Doctor Strange is a great origin film and does a really effective job in building this character for his debut and it is worth a watch for sure.Rating - 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Personal Favorite,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe can easily be divided into two categories - the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies (like Guardians and Thor), and the more earth-based/thrillers (like Iron Man and Captain America). It seems like everyone has one side of it that they prefer. Personally, I'm into the Sci-Fi/fantasy movies, which is one of the main reasons why Doctor Strange is my favorite MCU movie. I know it's not one of the more popular Marvel movies, and my love of it is very personal. I'm fascinated by magic, mysticism, out of body experiences, alternate dimensions, all that good stuff. So it's hard for me to judge this movie in all fairness. It's still a great movie.The movies' strongest aspect is easily, as I said, the fascinating powers and abilities of Doctor Strange and those who use the Mystic Arts. Watching them harness the mystic energy and use it is such a cool thing. The multiverse scene was probably the best moment in terms of visual effects, possibly ever. Some of the coolest moments are the ones that involve bending reality, and the difference between the real world and the Mirror Dimension. The best scenes are the multiverse scene, the astral projection scenes, and the scene with New York in the Mirror Dimension. The fact that this movie didn't win the Oscar for Best Visual Effects is appalling. The environment of Kamar-Taj is also interesting. It has people learning the Mystic Arts, a library of ancient books, and has doors to the three Sanctums in London, New York, and Hong Kong, which defend the world from evil forces. It feels like an Asian Hogwarts, but it's one of those movie places that you wish were real. Dr. Strange himself is very similar to Iron Man, with the whole cocky rich guy attitude, but Benedict Cumberbatch does such a great job at playing him that you still end up liking the character. The most interesting character, however, is the Ancient One. She brings a degree of moral ambiguity to the movie, and the truth about her is a great twist, and one that's very fun to think about. Mordo was an OK character. He wasn't dislikable or anything like that, but he was far from Marvel's best sidekick. Wong is a boss. That's all there is to it. Kaecilius also isn't Marvel's best villain, but his backstory does make it seem like he knows what he's doing may be right, even if he clearly (as the running joke says) didn't read the warnings. Needless to say, the scene with Dormammu was absolutely fantastic. And despite being one of Marvel's darker movies, it still has some very funny moments in it. I know from a storytelling and character perspective, it really isn't the best, but the fascinating environments, ideas, and visuals make it a personal favorite. I've watched it a dozen times, and I'll probably watch it a dozen more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid albeit unspectacular,"Marvel has a real knack for chugging out enjoyable content and Doctor Strange doesn't break that streak at all.Benedict Cumberbatch is one of the best things about the whole endeavor by far. It's yet another one of those castings where it's so perfect that you can no longer imagine anyone else playing the part after seeing it, much like Robert Downey Jr and Chris Evans. The rest of the cast perform admirably too especially Tilda Swinton as the ancient one. Sure it would have been appropriate to cast an Asian actor but Swinton does such a good job it's hard for me to get worked up about it. The rest are quite good too but Mads Mikkelsen (playing the villain) and Rachel Mcadamds's (playing the love interest)feel underdeveloped. Not bad but not good either really, just kind of mediocre.By far this movie's greatest strength however are the visuals and the action scenes. Comparisons have unsurprisingly been drawn to Inception and it is somewhat similar. Strange feels way more energetic though and get's more trippy and weird with the mind bending visuals. The effects are fantastic but I also love how it subverts the usual summer blockbuster bam, boom, explosions thing that we've all grown to expect. It feels fresh, new and very exciting to watch on the big screen.The movie also has a lot of comedy and it works for the most part. Sometimes the jokes don't quite stick the landing but it's never cringe worthy at least. The biggest problem for me though is that the movie relies too much on formula. If you've seen any other Marvel origin story you'll see most things coming a mile away. Arrogant guy learns the errors of his ways and reevaluates his life to become a superhero (does Tony Stark ring any bells?). Still it's not done badly and I think the crazy visuals and the action scenes are enough to make the movie feel somewhat novel.Another good Marvel entry that is sure to excite and entertain, although it's not likely to go down in cinema history by any means.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"If Inception, Star Trek, and Dragonball had a child, this is probably what it would look like","If it weren't already a comic, I would be scratching my head as to where this was coming from.There are familiar elements in every Marvel film, and this one checks them off one by one. Doctor Steven Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a Sherlock meets Tony Stark arrogant genius neurosurgeon who is forced to seek out alternative treatment for his damaged hands after starring in this year's feature-film distracted-driving PSA.He meets the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton), who while teaching Strange how to tap into the energies of the multiverse is facing a crisis brought on by her former pupil Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) attempting to bring about Earth's demise.It is by no means a secret that this film, like all Marvel solo films, ends with the hero facing the villain in a big showdown. The real surprise, though, is that the very nature of Strange's powers means that you don't really know what he's going to pull out of the hat next to solve a given problem.This makes it an enjoyable narrative to follow, even if the witty anecdotes sometimes go too far and break you out of the moment, where you realize there was just five witty comments in a row, and this is supposed to be a drama (ish).With all that being said, see this film. Just don't come drunk. Or high. The visual effects will be trippy enough.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The movie looks more fabulous with the use of great CGIs.Acting is great with Benedict Cumberbatch in the role of Doctor strange was so perfect it seems that the role was written for him, Mads Mikkelsen and Tilda Swinton are seasoned actors and had been tremendously great, Chiwetel and Wong were also superb, Rachel looked beautiful and charming.Climax of the movie is superb and as always has a surprise in the climax of the movie.

Required Viewing for Medics,"If films based on comic book characters are new to you, and you aren't quite sure what to expect with Doctor Strange, don't worry. Besides the fine acting of Benedict Cumberbatch, who is at the top of his game here, the viewer is treated to fun, quantum-leap style physics, and amazing, cutting-edge CGI that actually makes you think. Magic, of course, is what drives it, in the form of slide rings and ancient formulae. But that isn't why you should watch this. It's really a character study of how a man reacts to a life-changing event. The event is a problem in modern guise, but its solution is ancient.There are some excellent performances from supporting members of the cast – Chiwetel Ejiofor in particular, and also Tilda Swinton, who always manages to surprise, and Benedict Wong.

A Little Too Much Eye Candy Almost Ruins This Film,"Doctor Strange is about a surgeon with Tony Stark level arrogance and ego that lost the use of his hands. He discovers a place that will teach him mystical arts that will eventually restore what he lost. While there he gets thrown into a classic battle of good vs. evil and having to save the world.I did enjoy this film but it didn't seem to have the memorable moments of Winter Soldier or Iron Man. I think this movie will stack up very well with the other Marvel movies, just by the actors performances alone though. Cumberbatch was definitely the right choice for Strange as he played the character very well. I don't think there has been this type of perfect casting for Marvel since Downey Jr. as Iron Man. Rachel McAdams was also great as Christine Palmer. Their chemistry was again very similar to the Pepper Potts and Iron Man but I honestly felt Strange and Palmer worked better together. I think they are my new favorite duo. Mordo, The Ancient One and Kaecilius were all great as well. They all made this an enjoyable film.The main problem, I guess i have with this movie is the visuals. I am talking about the bending buildings and all of that eye candy. Yes it was great to see, but it just feels like too much filler. I would have preferred more character development on the villain, so we know more about him. The other problem I have is again the cringe forced one liners and jokes. Strange was trying too hard to be funny at times. I appreciated the more subtle comedic attempts by Mordo and Palmer. That is the type of humor I enjoy to see and hear. There is one more character in this film that was funny as well but since it wasn't shown in the trailer I will not say any more.Doctor Strange was a very enjoyable watch even though I wouldn't put it at the top of the Marvel list. 7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very interesting!,"I watched the film about the formation of Doctor Strange a few days ago, but I decided to express my impressions only now. Of course, the film was a success. It was a success as another large-scale Marvel blockbuster. Spectacular, mind-blowing, fascinating. Such a good comic fantasy. And this fantasy is based on three ""whales- - special effects, Benedict Cumberbatch and the fairy tale itself. Yes, it's a comic. And a fairy tale. A fairy tale about a man who became a powerful magician. Another thing is that there was no really deep touch to the origins of the myth. The hero of Cumberbatch is not Merlin, and not the Christmas magician. The genesis of this character takes rather in computer games. Yes, Stephen Strange became a combat magician. That's why his formation was shown so quickly, that's why his initiation looked so blurry. However, this is quite logical - from the place to the battle!

Spectacular psychedelic effects and cast let down by low-stakes narrative jumble,"Doctor Strange does just about enough as the 'smaller' Marvel film of the year to keep momentum up, even if it doesn't completely thrill and excite as one hoped it would. Still, it's brave and it's bold, introducing a new character so early into Phase Three and its a visual thrill, serving up some of the best effect of the year; in fact, I'd go as far as to suggest this is a front-runner for Best Visual Effects at the upcoming Academy Awards. You can't help but become frustrated that, after the incredible Civil War earlier this year, Marvel can't keep up with their own bar of success, but they still remain the clear frontrunners of the genre even with this more middle of the road serving. Visually, it's Marvel's most ambitious film to date - i just wish its story and formula was too.FULL REVIEW: goo.gl/uBgvKD",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Really Fascinating Character Who Challenges Many of Us to Hang in There,"I'm an old man with a son who loves these movies. I enjoy them too, but my foundation is so fragile. What I mean is, after watching things from the Marvel Universe and its ilk, I need to go to him to find out about what led to this guy or that guy. I think I like this one because it shows how a character has been shaped. Benedict Cumberbatch does a fine job showing how Strange becomes what he becomes, from the arrogant neurosurgeon who can't slow down on the highway, to going to a mystic to try to recover from monumental injuries that have taken away his livelihood. When I lost it a bit was trying to figure out who is adversaries were and how they came to power. Also, how the magic works as Strange works through the process to becoming a superhero. I'm still not sure how things are resolved but it doesn't matter because we know that he will appear again (and he does). He will become a force confronting a whole host of other characters that one needs a program to keep straight. Don't get me wrong, I do enjoy the spectacle of these movies, and the special effects are off the charts--creative and spectaclar.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
It's Good...ish,"Doctor Strange is a movie that does everything very well while also doing it very poorly at the same time. The movie through in and through out is eye candy, probably the most beautiful looking Marvel movie to date. It's plot is passable, and the characters are mostly developed. However Doctor Strange struggles most with motivation and purpose. Many times during the movie I found myself questioning what the purpose of everything was. The movie provides many broad answers to questions we didn't ask. Doctor Strange is not terrible but it feels like the time and dedication spent could've made a product that had a lot more depth. The whole movie felt rushed. Characters never really develop, and when they do it is off screen. Doctor Strange mostly succeeds in the comedy aspect but some jokes are just plain bad or cringey. The action and gore in this movie was pleasantly surprising. Fight scenes felt very new and thrilling and the gore felt dark and real. Doctor Strange is good but it's flaws are very obvious even from the first watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fairly true to the original,"I used to read Dr. Strange comics as a teenager and always found it the most imaginative of the Marvel universe. The movie capture much of the magic of the magic. Benedict Cumberbatch is great in the title role and Tilda Swinton shines as the ancient one. More convincing than an ancient old man with a beard - though that might have been good also. Chiwetel Ejiofor was good as Mordo - going through the degeneration from loyal hack of the ancient one to doubting Thomas in a believable way. Mads Mikkelsen was suitably threatening and believable as the arch zealot Kaecilius and was a worthy foil to the growing power of Strange.The special effects are wonderful - the dizzying mirror dimension scenes as well as the encounter with the Dread Dormammu (did they use 'Dread' in the film - maybe not). The pace is good and there is indeed a reasonable character development in Strange from the egotistical materialist to the less arrogant contemplative of the mystic arts. The film captures well the multi-dimensional world of Strange and evokes the threat from extra-dimensional beings in a way that's commensurate with the sense of awe in the original comic rendition. The film never degenerates into an overly fantastic atmosphere, with scenes in the hospital and city streets anchoring the fantastic in the real. The costumes are just right and true to the comic vision. I was glad to see that this film was added to the cinematic Marvel universe. Scott Derrickson directed the whirlpool of action well and gave it the right balance of real and fantastic. Strange's pilgrimage to Katmandu was reminiscent of Bruce Wayne's to Asia to find himself with a guru.Anyway - all in all a fine film and afterwards I felt I could open a portal into another dimension.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Worth the 3D glasses,"There's a lot They don't want you to know. Whether it's because you're too dumb to understand it or whether you're not strong enough to handle it, there are transdimensional, interdimensional, crossdimensional, counterdimensional, multidimensional, and super- dimensional things They are keeping from us.Dr. Strange, however, is a superstar neurosurgeon who drives too fast and crushes his hands in a car accident so he can travel the world in search of answers They know but will only share with a handful of elites. And to be really good, as in a good person who cares about the multiverse, you sometimes gotta play hardball and you have to dabble in the dark arts.Oh, Mads Mikkelsen, your stern face. Oh Benedict Cumberbatch, your stern face. And Tilda Swinton, you bring so much class, especially in 3D. There are a few uncomfortable moments for humor despite, once again, the entire world being at risk, but this time, it's Dormammu. DORMAMMU. Dormammu wants to absorb (?) the Earth and keep it all to himself in the Dark Dimension, a place where time does not exist.OK, well that all sounds rather, ahem, strange, doesn't it. Weird, even. But with the help of a Sling Ring, a Cloak of Levitation, and the Eye of Agamotto, it'll all be all right, alright?Dr. Strange is actually pretty fun, not quite as fun as Ant-Man or Deadpool, but the visuals are great in 3D and worth the extra bucks.

On the other hand, even though the cast is an unusual level of prestige for a film of this type, the characters and their arcs do not give them much to work with.

A Slightly Different Marvel Film,"While on a journey of physical and spiritual healing, a brilliant neurosurgeon (Benedict Cumberbatch) is drawn into the world of the mystic arts.One of the biggest problems with the Marvel film series is how clogged up they get and how hard it is to keep the plots and subplots straight. This is also their strength, as it ensures that people will keep watching the next entry. With ""Doctor Strange"", we avoid that issue altogether... even though we get vague references to the other films in the series, you do not need to know what an ""infinity stone"" is to appreciate the movie.The character of Strange is a good one and not your typical hero. Personally, I found the effects to be over-the-top, as they are in many of the Marvel films. But the ""Inception"" look aside, the plot is certainly unique. Seeing how Strange is used in the future, as he is not often connected to the Avengers in the comics, will be interesting. Perhaps this will open the door for Moon Knight or some other supporting character?",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Strange (2016) Review - 8.3/10,"I have to admit that I like this film better than most. And while I can understand some of the criticisms, I absolutely love this film. Especially the special effects, which are just top-notch in the MCU. Tilda Swinton and Benedict Cumberbatch also give great performances, which can only help.

Dr. Stephen: Or How I stopped Worrying & Love the Drive-thru Menu,"Just when you were hoping that Marvel was going to boldly go where it has not gone before the studio delivers another one of its brands.I'm as familiar with Dr. Strange as I am with Dr. Oz (not very). I have grown tired of Marvel's formulaic product which is becoming more pronounced now that is under the aegis of Disney (I fear that Star Wars may fall victim to the bland). Marvel is the McDonald's of movie studios. It churns out (seemingly daily) easily digestible & reliably satisfying movies that never rise above an OK cinematic experience despite some fantastic production values. (Counterpoint: they never dip below OK either.)I had given up on the studio following that large order of fries that was ""Captain America: Civil War"". However, I was intrigued by this seemingly off-the-comic-interstate character of Dr. Strange especially when Benedict Cumberbatch was cast along with Tilda Swinton & Mads Mikkelsen. These are always interesting actors just like Chiwetel Ejiofor who is also here. They normally are not in this kind of movie (the same could be said of Robert Downey Jr. in another lifetime). Heck, I was delighted to see Daniel Bruhl in Civil War.This movie IS different in many welcome ways from the other Marvel happy meal movies. The SFX are amazing. They're the best I've seen in the last few years. Imagine ""Inception"" or M.C. Escher drawings on steroids. They are trippy & far out, dude (here is your Oscar). Marvel has never stinted on production values, but you can say the same thing about all of those Transformers movies.My main (ground) beef with this movie is that I wasn't emotionally involved with it. The actors all give very professional performances & the weird doctor's cape is a hoot. The time in the theater moves briskly. This movie is never boring. I wish, however, Marvel would stop putting on all of those extras scenes on during & after the credits unless it is the studio's way of making sure you see all of the names & companies that evidently work very hard to put all of this eye candy up on the screen & thus thanking them (that is something I respect & forgive them for).Compared to ""Arrival"", ""Jason Bourne"" & ""Deepwater Horizon"", ""Dr. Strange"" didn't give me goosebumps watching it or any heart-in-the- throat moments. It IS occasionally strange. Think of a Big Mac with a dash of wasabi on it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Strangely Amazing,"To this day, this remains one of my favorite standalone MCU films to watch. There are simply many MCU films and despite their inspiring, differing stories feel too much the same. Not Doctor Strange. The humor and story are still pretty good, and the CGI is still pretty good overall too. It shows how it is different from other shows earlier on, relying more on magic than on physical attacks or weapons. The characters are, for the most part, pretty well done, showing how they must make difficult moral decisions. Still entertains me to this day.

I'm also not a major fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, unlike others, but in this movie he did a good job. The whole cast is enjoyable to watch. The movie might be long but you never have the feeling that it's getting boring or so. And that's mainly due to the stunning sometimes psychedelic visual effects.

Just another average film assembled from the Marvel Factory,"After seeing Doctor Strange I am honestly shocked at how high it is rated. This is the third Marvel movie released this year so far and it is honestly not even remotely close to thee quality of the two before it.To start, Doctor Strange in itself is not a terrible film. It isn't particularly great either, but it is at least somewhat competently made. It's just that compared to earlier Marvel universe films released this year and even before, it is extremely underwhelming and honestly didn't impress me too much.The acting is mostly decent overall. While I have never read the Doctor Strange comics before, I can safely say myself that Benedict Cumberbatch completely owned the lead character. He is a perfect mix of arrogance and perseverance. While his character's mannerism is very similar to that of Tony Stark's, he is still very entertaining to watch and is probably the most enjoyable part of the film. Chiwetel Ejiofor and Mads Mikkelsen are also great, but their characters feel underdeveloped. It would have been nice to know more about these characters and their motives considering they take up quite a bit of screen time. My favorite character from the film was the Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton. She completely sells the almighty powerful and hair-lacking ancient warrior. While many have complained that she is not the same race or gender as the Ancient One from the comics, she still does a great job. Seeing her character effortlessly fight off countless baddies wielding her spell weapons and dressed in her golden yellow cloak is absolutely awesome and leads to some of the film's most enjoyable moments. Rachel McAdams' character however is grossly underdeveloped and seems to serve no purpose to the story whatsoever. The love story portion of the narrative felt so forced and clumsy that it would've been better off without it completely. And this is bad, even for a Marvel film.The story is also extremely underwhelming. Doctor Strange's story is basically just a cookie-cutter copy of all Marvel films before it but just with a magic and sorcery filter over it. I understand it is a character origin story and it is based of the comic, but no effort was made to make the story stand out or be any different from literally any other superhero origin story. There were even times between the fight scenes where the movie was even boring. That surprised me considering that most of the Marvel films are entertaining and fun, but Doctor Strange's story was not at all compelling or interesting enough to completely hold my attention the entire time. But this is between the fight scenes. Those are a whole different story.The fight scenes and visual effects almost make up my entire score. Doctor Strange is undoubtedly one of the best looking films of the year. The visual effects are stunning as they even manage to make flipping buildings and morphing cities look realistic. And yes, it does look a lot like Inception's mind bending visuals, but that doesn't make it any less spectacular. There are so many memorable fight scenes in Doctor Strange that it might be hard to find brawls on a linear battlefield interesting from now on. Also if you were debating whether or not Doctor Strange is worth seeing in 3-D, let me just say that it is the best 3-D I have ever seen. While I may not see many movies in 3-D, I cannot imagine it being much more impressive than it was here. The effects were mesmerizing and the fight scenes were a ton of fun to watch. It is just a shame that the film slows to a crawl after these fight scenes are over.Doctor Strange doesn't flow very well at all. The film's momentum is all over the place and I found myself losing attention many times throughout watching. We would be treated to a spectacular fight scene but then after that is all over, we were brought back into the boring and uninspired story. There are quite a few good fight scenes however, but the balance is still off, which led to some genuinely unenjoyable stretches of bland dialogue, boring story and mediocre humor.Overall, Doctor Strange isn't completely terrible but it certainly isn't as good as critics or IMDb users are making it seem. It is worth watching because of the special effects, fight scenes and Cumberbatch's portrayal of Doctor Strange but I was still left unsatisfied at the end. While it is certainly not the worst of the Marvel Universe movies, it is tied with Captain America: The Winter Soldier for the most overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An entertaining solid movie with magnificent visuals,"Doctor Strange is another great movie in the MCU. While it may not introduce anything new plotwise, it is loads of fun to watch, with its humor, action, and Oscar-worthy special effects.Script- Like I said before, the plot is nothing new, but still good. Doctor Strange and The Ancient One are well-written characters, although the villains are underdeveloped.Direction- Like almost every other MCU movie, the movie balances humor and serious parts very well. The humor is well done and did not feel forced, and the serious and emotional moments are convincing.Acting- Nothing too special, but the actors do a great job at portraying their characters.Directing- For a movie like this, the directing is going to be challenging. The cinematography is amazing considering how much is going on in some scenes. The directing is solid.Visual Effects- This is what makes this movie worth seeing the most. It is mind-bending and jaw-dropping, with lots of color and things going on the screen. This is one of the movies that you need to see in IMAX 3D, or at least in 3D.Overall, the movie is a lot of fun to watch, and although it is nothing groundbreaking in most areas, the visual effects alone are enough to make this movie worth seeing. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

less a super hero movie than a psychedelic experience,"Forget Doctor Strange as a superhero movie and just watch it as a series of images.

Throwing in time reversal, mystic dimensional shifts, magic vs. hard science – even all that has been done to death.

The action in this movie shakes the imagination more than light drugs, and the scene with the final fight for 10 days doesn't come out of my head. I didn't see a more beautiful visual part, I was in an inexpressible delight. And of course, everyone's favorite Benedict in his repertoire. Narcissistic genius, how we liked him.

"What doesn't kill you, simply makes you STRANGE.","'Doctor Strange' is the latest hero and film added to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With great power comes strange abilities, and boy does this film deliver elements of the weird:)1. To start off, 'Doctor Strange' is the definition of a ""good"" movie, and that's pretty much all I can say about it. The one and only thing that makes this film stand out are the visuals and unusual powers the characters possess. In no way is it horrible, but it falls short of being something great since the world of Doctor Strange had damn near unlimited possibilities. We've seen the science and fantasy before, but this film deals particularly with magic and the supernatural. I can easily compare the tone of this movie to 'Thor: The Dark World', where it's satisfying but just okay.2. Apart from the journey of Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to find the Ancient One and regain proper use of his hands after a terrible car crash, the plot revolves around a rogue master named Kaecilius (Mad Mikkelsen) who has stolen pages from a book of spells in order to open a dark realm and unleash a dangerous evil entity. As far as intrigue, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't fascinated with the character of Strange himself, and his training in becoming the Sorcerer Supreme. The visuals are stunning, the creative action sequences, and (of course) Mr. Cumberbatch are by far the best parts of the film.3. For years now, Benedict Cumberbatch has been one of my top five favorite actors, and he delivers the best he can. The only personal flaw of mine is that I don't quite see him as Doctor Strange quite yet. I believe the script wasn't as keen as it could be on developing the character to the point where he feels solidified in this universe. Mad Mikkelsen is scary and physically brutal as Kaecilius, but the writing just isn't there to give his character more weight. He had the potential to be just as lethal as say....The Winter Soldier, yet the script doesn't do him justice nor the rest of the main cast.4. People may compare Stephen Strange to Tony Stark when it comes to ego and arrogance, but Strange is not so self-centered to the degree of Stark. Rachel McAdams is hinted to be Strange's love interest as the film progresses, but the dynamic between them isn't what you might expect. The only warning I'd give comes during the climax. Let's just say I got flashback's of 2011's 'Green Lantern' when a particular threat is introduced during an inter-dimensional sequence. The movie is only 115mins long, but things feel extremely rushed, especially the transition of Stephen Strange into the Sorcerer we know.5. I also give both Tilda Swinton (Ancient One) and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Mordo) a lot of credit since they play their respective roles to great conviction. If you do go see this in theaters, I strongly recommend that you wait till the very end, cause there are two amazing post-credit scenes, one in particular which sets up another highly anticipated Marvel film slated for next November;)There are so many things to touch on, but they are so minor it can be overlooked. I really like this movie, although as much as I wanted to, I couldn't fall in love with it. All that being said, 'Doctor Strange' is still one of the better comic-book movies this year right behind 'Captain America: Civil War'.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Doctor Strange Review,"It seems this is the going to be the last Origins Story in the MCU, or at least that is the word going round. Guess they are just going to introduce the other characters from here on out. I'm fine with that. The origin stories are starting to become the exact same stories. Not saying Doctor Strange is a bad movie though. Here's why.Synopsis: After a horrible car accident, brilliant neurosurgeon Stephen Strange must find a way and a cure to healing his hands. His quest brings him to Kamar-Taj in Nepal where he studies under the Ancient One, who teaches him the ways of magic and alternate realities. With new skills of interdimensional travel and spells, Strange soon discovers that he must protect the world from a deadly enemy who is out to destroy it. Starring: Benedict Cumberbatch, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Tilda Swinton Director: Scott DerricksonReally, the reason I did give this movie an 8 is because of the origin story. It took more than half the movie to get to the main conflict. It all concentrated on how Strange got his power. I would have rather seen more of the cosmicverse. They hinted it at in Ant- Man and brought it full force here. Now, they just need to concentrate on it more.Benedict was the right choice for the role. I really can't see anyone else playing Strange. Nobody has that swagger that he has to pull off the cockiness of Strange. I can't wait to see him square off with Tony.Other than Benedict all the characters were one dimensional. Not the writers fault, most of the secondary characters in the Strange comics are one dimensional. At least from what I remember. Haven't read one of his since the turn of the century.There was nothing that stood out in this movie besides the visual effects. The movie was just on average with all the rest of the MCU. Albeit a vital part to the MCU.Final Thoughts: If it wasn't vital, this movie could have stood alone. Comparing it to the other movies it doesn't stand on its own. But still watchable.Rating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks. If you would like to continue to follow my post, go ahead and like this page.

Not so deranged,"Marvel takes another risk with making a movie with one of their relatively lesser known characters. Benedict Cumberbatch uses his Sherlock skills to make the egoist Dr Stephen Strange to be likable.He plays a cocky, brilliant neurosurgeon whose hands are shattered after a car crash. He travels to Nepal and to a secretive temple called Kamar-Taj headed by the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) where he learns mystical skills and magic when he broadens his mind and accepts his part in the multiverse.Marvel Studios gets all trippy with multicoloured Salvador Dali inspired sequences that also owes a lot to Christopher Nolan's Inception of folding cityscapes.The plot is perfunctory though. Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen made up to look like a glam rock star) is a former student of the Ancient One, who believes there can be eternal life and the Celtic Ancient One has been holding out as to her real source of her powers. He makes a pact with an entity from the dark dimension that wants to destroy the planet.There is something Harry Potter like about this film, especially as some of the scenes were filmed in London. There is a nifty sequence with the Cloak of Levitation that has chosen to be with Dr Strange.Solid support from Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo who teaches Dr Strange to fight and Benedict Wong as the protector of the ancient books. Rachel McAdams plays Christine Palmer, a fellow medic and love interest of Dr Strange.

Loved it,"Doctor Strange, the mind-bending sorcery that enchanted my cinematic senses, earns a dazzling 8/10 in my mystical movie trove-an adoration for its spellbinding visuals, Benedict Cumberbatch's charismatic portrayal of the titular sorcerer, and the kaleidoscopic wizardry that unfolds. Cumberbatch's performance, blending arrogance with vulnerability, breathes life into the enigmatic character. The film's strength lies in its innovative portrayal of the mystic arts, where reality twists and turns like a surreal painting. While the plot occasionally flirts with predictability, the film's editing maintains a rhythmic flow, seamlessly transitioning between realms. The musical score, an ethereal composition by Michael Giacchino, elevates the magical ambiance. Cinematography captures the folding cities and mirror dimensions with a breathtaking visual flair. Doctor Strange, with its underlying message of embracing the impossible, emerges not just as a superhero origin story but a mind-bending journey into the uncharted realms of cinematic wonder.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Truely Magical,"Absolutely loved the creativity of this movie. It takes the viewer on a whole other ride of something different in a wonderful way.First off, excellent cast. Benedict Cumberbatch is Dr. Strange. He plays the role with brilliance. He brings this movie to life with his smarts, humor, handsomeness and smooth acting skills. Tilda Swinton was truly the perfect mysterious great one to play the role of the Ancient One. And there was great chemistry between Cumberbatch and Ejiofor as friends.The movie brings us into a whole other world of magic. The audience gets to slowly discover whats-what just as doctor strange does. The colours in the film were so vibrant and lively. And the creativeness was something new and different.The story was fun and mysterious as you weren't sure what to expect next. The humour was perfect making a wonderful balance between seriousness, down right funny and those heartfelt moments.Another one of Marvels greats.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Phase Three is Looking Good,"If Marvel keeps this streak up, they might possibly make a superhero film on the same level as the Dark Knight. Doctor Strange is about a neurosurgeon named Stephen Strange who has it made. He's rich, famous and he even has an on again, off again girlfriend. However that all changes when he gets into an awful car accident and completely ruins his hands. It looks like he can never operate again so he does everything he can to fix his hands. His last ditch effort is to seek The Ancient One-a Celtic mystic that resides in the far East. Stephen then finds himself in a world of magic, sorcery and alternate dimensions. The rabbit hole goes deeper though as one of the Ancient One's old students has sided with an evil entity named Dormamu who wants to-you guessed it-take over the world and Stephen is the only one who can stop him. Even if this movie wasn't tied to the MCU, it would still be very interesting and a great film in and of itself. It still has many of the previous entries' quirks such as goofy humor, great action but one dimensional villains. However, they balance that out with new things such as psychedelic visuals, great character development and creative action sequences. They really go all out with the possibility of magic and many of the best parts of the film revolve simply around the idea of these people being able to bend reality to their will. The actors all do a spectacular job as well bringing life to these performances. But of course this would all be for nothing if it weren't for the great writing and characters. Even though this villain is nothing to brag home about, we might get another new villain in the future that's just even more menacing and interesting. I would not only suggest Doctor Strange for fans of the MCU but also for anyone who just wants to see a cool film. You can watch this film without having seen any of the other entries",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Another solid brick on the MCU's ever-expanding wall,"DOCTOR STRANGE, this latest MCU addition, officially takes audience to a more cerebral plane of brainy Sci-Fi concepts such as spiritual dimensions, astral world, immortality, eye of Agamotto, time-bending superpower, infinite time loop, etc. through the induction of the esoteric Oriental mystics, passed by The Ancient One (Swinton) in Nepal onto the elite New York neurosurgeon Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), whose hands have been fatally injured in a car crash, and initially he seeks for a magic cure to grant him a way back to the operation table, before soon he will be saddled with a more challenging responsibility (the Siamese twin of power), to save humanity from ruination. So a resultant reaction from a non-comic reader, there is simply too much to ingest at a clip.Hubris is Dr. Strange's fault-line, he has earned himself a God-like competency to save patients under critical conditions and (both inwardly and outwardly) gloats about it. Subtextually, that could be the reason why the goddess of fate and destiny decides to mete out punishment by taking away his ability. Humility is the ultimate salvation he need to foster along with his sorcerous training, it always takes some time for our hero to realize that.As the introduction piece of Dr. Strange, the movie adopts a common-or-garden narrative arc to detail Stephen's transformative journey, his romantic tangles with co-worker Christine Palmer (McAdams) serves only as a side dish, but one must give credit to Palmer's ""don't explain to me what is happening"" precept, that is a life-saver, the less she knows, the more likely she will survive in the sequels.The most enthralling nugget from this 14th entry of MCU is its paradigm-shifting, kaleidoscopic vista (although risking of being a deja-vu from Christopher Nolan's INCEPTION 2010) juggling with horizontal-vertical landscape mirror shifting, gravity-flouting kung-fu fighting, eye-opening out-of- body experience and stellar astral dimension, where dwells the super-villain Dormammu, who in fact, is devised with a bathetic exit strategy which foregrounds this ever-so-frustrating superhero genre's ingrained villain quandary, they all must appear too-big-to-fail with their omnipotence and doomsday menace, although no one in the audience would give a second thought about their invariably pre-designed defeat, to a degree it is impossible for deus-ex-machina to be plausibly brought to save the day.The cast accomplishes a solid job, Cumberbatch is an accent-wizard, and pleasurable enough to keep his Cloak of Levitation in his benevolent mien with a touch of egotism still needs to shed. Ejiofor is underused as Stephen's mentor-degraded-to-sidekick Karl Mordo, whose loyalty turns sour in the aftermath to anticipate the next chapter (we should never break the law of nature!). Mikkelsen's Kaecilius is a very Shakespearean villain, excels in his own narcissistic soliloquy (Hannibal style), while his acolytes are not allowed to deliver even one line besides fighting and running. However, it is Swinton's ageless incarnation as The Ancient One raises the roof, she is a guru, a mystic, a leader, a warrior and an enigma all in the same time, one can only beef why her character should be so unceremoniously dispatched after her indomitable entrance piece, just because her mission is fulfilled after Stephen assumes the mantle? That is a disgrace.Another brick on the MCU's ever-expanding wall, DOCTOR STRANGE is visually inventive, but story-wise unambitious, yet, his idiosyncratic sorcerer background could be welled mapped out onto a more heterogeneous cinematic scope, to elicit something substantially reinvigorating from an over-familiar, one-dimension confined THE AVENGERS' assembly.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doesn't this stuff ever get stale to you people?,"A beat-for-beat remake of the first Iron Man crossed with a Windows 95 screensaver, Doctor Strange is the fourteenth Marvel movie in eight years and one that really reveals the gears of their assembly-line productions. A shame, because it's been directed by Scott Derrickson with an eye-popping pizazz largely missing from these prosaic-looking pictures. This past summer's Captain America: Civil War may have been content to stage its epic battles in dimly-lit stairwells and cruddy office parks, but Doctor Strange traverses entire dimensions while bending space and time with hallucinogenic gusto. (I actually didn't feel ripped-off after shelling out for the IMAX 3D.) In fact, the movie probably wouldn't be as frustrating were it not so wondrous to watch — the visual delights end up underlining a sorry screenplay's slavish adherence to exhausted formulas.Stop me if you've heard this one, but a filthy rich, arrogant hotshot is forced to reassess his life after a traumatic injury. He's supported by a vaguely Eastern mentor who gets killed off early and a black guy who doesn't get to do much even though he's spent years training for what our protagonist just took up last week. There's also a tremendously overqualified actress hanging around in an insultingly thin girlfriend role, just so our hero will have someone to apologize to later in the movie after he learns a few important lessons and becomes a better person.Honestly, Iron Man wasn't exactly a masterpiece the first time around but that one at least had the benefit of Robert Downey Jr. snarking up a storm in hungry comeback mode. As narcissistic neurosurgeon Stephen Strange, Benedict Cumberbatch pushes at the outer limits of his charisma but isn't nearly magnetic enough to bring off the role. (But then what do I know? Women on the internet fawn all over this guy. I think he's an okay actor who kinda looks like a foot.) Stephen flips his Lamborghini and shatters his hands, eventually journeying to Katmandu in search of experimental treatments.The filmmakers try to dodge the source material's queasy stereotypes by casting Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, a wizened immortal training Dr. Strange in the ways of astral projection and kung fu fighting. She's sensational at selling all this silliness, but her presence has saddled the movie with charges of ""whitewashing,"" even though the alternative would've been a pretty offensive role to offer an old Asian guy. Frankly, I feel like the only way around these kinds of conundrums would be to just not make a Doctor Strange movie at all. However you try to spin it, in the end this is still an antiquated Tarzan fantasy of a gifted and superior white guy discovering an exotic culture and taking no time at all to become way better at it than the indigenous people he ends up rescuing.Anyway, the fighting was fun. In the ""mirror dimension"" our characters can fold skylines into origami, running up the sides of buildings and dancing down stairwells out of your favorite dorm room M.C. Escher poster. (It looks a lot like that cool demo reel at the beginning of Inception when Leonardo DiCaprio showed off all the awesome powers they weren't allowed to use again for the rest of the film.) Truth be told, I had no idea how any of this was supposed to work, as Doctor Strange is the kind of movie where people dart around during action scenes yelling arbitrary rules for what you're watching. Picture someone jogging a few paces behind the hero, gasping for air and shouting: ""Now he can only be stopped if you say ten words that begin with the letter Q!"" Okay maybe not that arbitrary, but close. There's also some disappointingly flat work by Mads Mikkelsen as yet another boring, barely-written Marvel villain and Chiwetel Ejiofor gives what might be his first bad performance as a sidekick whose main purpose seems to be getting shown up by the star. Rachel McAdams is on hand as Pepper Potts – I mean, Christine Palmer – dutifully waiting around for our callow hero to become decent enough to deserve her. (Meanwhile, I'm still waiting for a movie that deserves Rachel McAdams.) Credit should be given to the filmmakers finding a clever way around the numbing, third-act demolition derby that makes the endings of Marvel movies such crashing bores. A friend of mine thinks the climax is a wry commentary on the inherent repetitions of this franchise, but that's a little more self-awareness than I'm willing to grant these guys at the moment.Because again, if they're smart enough to subvert that particular cliché then why are we still stuck with so many others? It's moments like this when Doctor Strange is just good enough to make you mad that it isn't better.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Good, but not great entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe","What's really great about Doctor Strange is that it allows itself to go into some mind-boggling territory, like the trippy visuals when The Ancient One shows Doctor Strange the vastness of the cosmos. It's a really well- made and engaging film but they could have dared to go a bit further instead of relying too much on the standard Marvel plot devices.The cloak was pretty cringe worthy and some of the dialogue was hamfisted.

The themes do move along very fine though and Doctor Strange is great entertainment.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A Well Made Superhero Film--But an Overused Formula,"I was happy to get to go see ""Doctor Strange"" this week, after hearing good things about it both from comic book enthusiasts and several friends with kids who are not as much of a geek as I am. That said, I went into the movie with high expectations. And while the movie was good overall, I walked away not having my expectations quite met.Let's start with the good. There is indeed much to like about ""Doctor Strange"". The film gives a healthy helping of back story, fleshing out a character that I myself didn't know too much about, despite having read some of his earliest appearances from the Stan Lee silver age era in the 1960's. By and large the film is pretty solid in the storytelling department, and the actors all turn out strong performances.That said, the downside to this movie is that it uses a banal superhero movie formula that at this point has come to feel quite trite. Super-rich, super-smart white guy gets some super-powers, there's a bad guy, the bad guy is hellbent on destroying the universe (the dimension?) and, golly gee, in the end the superhero saves the day.OK, so it's a little more nuanced than that. Still, it just felt like it was a movie that was made on a cookie cutter formula. It's far from a bad movie, but there are others quite like it--and perhaps others that do what it does, only better.All that said, I have to go with 7/10 stars for this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Better Than Inception,"Why compare this movie to Inception? Well the city-bending special effects are way more prolific in this movie than Inception, which sold itself on such effects being in the trailers. That's a good thing, but it also made as little sense. Who cares though as this film is pure fantasy and it's SO packed with effects you won't care about its flaws; like why are they bending cities around to almost no effect. You can bend a city but you can't trap anyone? Are you doing all this just to show off what you can do? Who are you showing off to?Overall an enjoyable movie packed full of these things but I don't think it makes it great. The imagery works for the film blending ancient magic and current times, but it's not Cumberbatch's best role and there are a lot of standardised movie comedy lines given to him which disrespect his great acting ability. Well placed being released before bonfire night here in the UK as a lot of sparkler sort of effects and such.So should you see this movie? Of course, it's Doctor Strange! Will you love it? Probably. Did I like it? Yes. Was I astounded? No. Am I making any worth while point? Not really. Just go see it, enjoy it as much as you want to.

Meddling with time and all those mystical energetic forces that we know so little of. It is a movie with excellent jokes, but that also knows how to set a serious mood, perfect special effects to go with it as well. In terms of coherence with the original story, it pretty much tells you the beginning, or rather, the rise of this superhero, little to no alterations made.

In a film about mystic dimensions, this works in the films favour. Your lack of engagement kind of backs the premise, and the relaxed pace draws you into a stupor. But unlike the overly silly Guardians of the Galaxy, this takes itself seriously enough.Even the fact that the film is copying Batman Begins, Big Trouble in Little China, the Matrix and to a lesser extent Inception just let you relax into it even more.

"Visually Refreshing, Fundamentally Stale","After the success of Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, Marvel Studios started looking at all of those comic book characters previously thought to be too niche to be made into movies through a different lens. Now not just the Iron Men and Batmans get their own movies but also the little guys as well. This means we are bound to get come good copy cat movies and some bad ones. I am here to tell you where Doctor Strange falls on this spectrum.Benedict Cumberbatch at first seemed like a strange(no pun intended) choice to me when it was first announced. Not that Ben would not be able to handle the role but he seems to me like the kind of guy who would feel above such roles. Cumberbatch brings a sort of legitimacy to the table that other than Robert Downey Jr. I don't think we have seen in a Marvel movie. This guy brings it and never feels out of place. He is funny and charming which seems like a must for a Marvel movie at this point but Cumberbatch elevates the playing field here. The rest of the cast is also filled out with studs such as Chiwetel Ejiofor, Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton and Rachel McAdams. I can't say a bad thing about one of them and this movie is no different. I can appreciate the diversity of the cast, even though Tilda Swintons' character may be a bit white washed.As shown in trailers and other countless promotional material, director Scott Derrickson uses some pretty impressive visual effects to morph the world of the movie. I originally thought this would become intrusive and headache inducing but it is used well. It seemed that just before I would start getting dizzy the world would snap back to normal. I can also appreciate that even when the world is spinning and the background turns into something out of a Spirograph, that all the action is clearly visible. So many action scenes are ruined by shaking the camera all over the place and I am very much in the camp that likes to see what the hell is going on.As far as the story goes no new ground is being broken here. It follows the formula that has been cemented into the super hero movie genre. The hero's journey where two thirds into the movie the hero discovered that the villain he has been fighting pales in comparison to the power of the real evil that has been controlling our secondary villain the whole movie. Then it seems like the way to defeat the main villain is solved much quicker than the semi-villain. I know writers were brought in to try to punch up the script pretty late in the project but they were not able to save the ending from being somewhat underwhelming.With all of the enjoyable things that Doctor Strange does and the small list of thing is does wrong you would think Doctor Strange would be getting a better score from me. My problem lies in the fact that these super hero movies are starting to feel very cookie cutter to me. There are not many risks being taken in these movies and they just want to find a way to keep giving people the same things with different utility belt wrappings. To be fair the other side of the spectrum is DC who can't seem to figure out not only how to make a good movie but just a movie that does not seem to spit in the face of the source material. Doctor Strange is not as good as the Guardians of the Galaxy's and Ant-Mans of the world but it is certainly better than Suicide Squad and Batman Vs. Superman which is good enough for at least some of my approval.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
DR STRANGE,"""DR Strange"" is the one of the most powerful character in MRVEL Comics. The master of magic's who save the world from the accidents, enemy of the multiverse as per comics. Who can control one of the most precious infinity stone i.e. Time Stone. For these reason he became more powerful super hero.
We all know that marvel comics and Marvel Cinematic Universe is occupy a large number of fanbase. Doctor Strange is a 2016 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics character of the same name. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 14th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe . The film was directed by Scott Derrickson from a screenplay he wrote with Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill, and stars Benedict Cumberbatch as surgeon Stephen Strange along with Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, Michael Stuhlbarg, Benjamin Bratt, Scott Adkins, Mads Mikkelsen, and Tilda Swinton. In the film, Strange learns the mystic arts after a career-ending car crash.
If we see the plot of movie , In New York City, Stephen Strange, a wealthy, acclaimed, and arrogant
Neurosurgeon, severely injures his hands in a car crash, leaving him unable to operate. Fellow surgeon Christine Palmer tries to help him move on, but strange vainly pursues experimental surgeries to heal his hands. Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a paraplegic who Mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by Mordo, a sorcerer under the Ancient One. The Ancient One demonstrates her power to Strange,
Revealing the astral plane and other dimensions such as the Mirror Dimension. The actual movie starts from here; in between this plot we all notice that Dr strange is the owner of a well sharp mind. So he quickly learns the mystic arts. As we concentrate in the dialog of the movie each and every dialogs are very powerful and meaningful also. The ancient one's dialog on the Dr strange give up the ego and saw the entire world how world is actual in nature. One of the best dialog in movie in my view is- ""who are you in this vast multiverse, Mr. Strange?"" by the ancient one. And another most precious dialog is ""We never lose our demons, Mordo we only learn to live above them."" To Mordo who is master of mystic art and martial art also and trained it to Dr strange.
In graphics quality and screenplay and CGI effect is top class. And movie is ending by MCU in it's own style. We get two mid credits scenes where, Strange decides to help Thor, who has brought his brother Loki to Earth to search for their father, Odin.In a post credits scene, Mordo confronts Pangborn and steals the mystical energy he uses to walk, telling him that Earth has ""too many sorcerers"".

Sherlock is Back- With Witchcraft! And Superpowers!,"Meet neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange. He is as egocentric as any politician, yet as clever at his job as any detective. The well- acclaimed British actor Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation Game, Sherlock) takes the stage in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to depict one of the cleverest caped crusaders within the franchise. He is certainly a delight as always, but it's the unusual approach to Doctor Strange that may either paralyze you with amazement or scare you away.His life at this point is pretty normal: go to work, save a life, have a fight with his nagging coworker/girlfriend played by Academy Award nominee Rachel McAdams (Midnight in Paris, Spotlight), cherry pick the patients he wishes to save, and gloat about the spectacular perfection that is his life. That is, until an uncalled for car crash leaves his hands paralyzed with severe nerve damage.Which leads him to Nepal, where an Ancient One is said to be there with knowledge of spiritual healing. It's not in his comfort zone but hey? What has he got to lose?So he goes under spiritual training by a cult, receiving far more than he bargained for. Next thing he knows, he is dawned with the abilities to remove his spirit from his material body, create portals in midair, and fly with the powers of a levitating cape, and all in an effort to save the world from an outer demon.My biggest problem with this highly entertaining (and funny) addition to the MCU is its swaying away from the familiar gadgets and aliens of the previous films and more into an out-of-place exploration of man's relationship with the occult. It's not odd to say, especially considering that they do not do a very good job at portraying it.Normally, if there was a cult such as this one who depend on old spiritual tradition, why are they of all different races around the world? We have one White woman, one Black man, and one Asian, and several others who are from places I cannot possibly pinpoint. It may not matter to you, but this really hurts the film's believability.Although I do give director Scott Derrickson (The Exorcism of Emily Rose) credit for telling the story as if it were a real Buddhist or Hindu legend, while at the same time a part of our own modern culture. He does this best through the most obvious yet brilliantly executed way of combining the two: colorful trips through the spiritual universe that wows you off guard, especially when viewed behind 3-D glasses. While not in the infinite realms of the non-materialistic universe, Dr. Strange and his comrades fight against the assassins of time and space through showcases of city environments spinning and losing form within itself, as if you're watching Inception though a kaleidoscope.Older traditions of Hindu training are also exploited here in the same fashion done by The Matrix: Dr. Strange is thrown to the top of Mt. Everest to test how quickly he can form a portal back to base. It would generate shrieks of joy from all anime fans, but it later turns out to be a missed chance of character development, which leads into this film's biggest problemWith something as controversial and delicate as occult practices driving the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I doubt there could be a reasonable way to do something like this under Marvel's wing perfectly. I do appreciate the risks that they have been taking to be different with each of their films (just compare and contrast Guardians of the Galaxy with Captain America: Civil War for a minute). But frankly, some risks are not worth taking. It was worth it to create the mind- bending kaleidoscopic fight sequences, but when Marvel's name is attached, I do not believe that it would help with their branding.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Spectacular effects, bland plot, recycled Marvel formula","My background knowledge going in: I was first introduced to Doctor Strange in the 90s Spider-Man cartoon. Mary Jane joined a cult, so Spiderman had to get assistance from Doctor Strange in order to save her. Those were some of my favorite episodes. Good stuff. I've also seen Marvel's 2007 animated Doctor Strange movie, which was very good.The good: This movie's visual effects are amazing. Warping space, time, and reality has never looked so trippy. Watch it in 3D - it's worth the ticket price.The bad: This movie sticks so close to Marvel's tired formula that it also suffers from the same shortcomings as Marvel's other movies (bland villains, jokes per minute that often feel forced, unnecessary girlfriend character, world-ending plot that somehow never feels like much of a threat, underwhelming climax) and ultimately unfortunately feels kinda bland. I hate to admit this as a fan of the Marvel movies, but this felt overly predictable and full of recycled elements in a few too many ways.Characters: Isn't Doctor Strange himself essentially the same character as Tony Stark/Iron Man? From his personality (talented but arrogant), to his backstory (rich showoff whose injury leads to humility), to his penchant for making sarcastic jokes and pop culture references, they're almost the same guy.The villain and world-ending plot of this movie, you've seen already in numerous other Marvel movies. How's the underdeveloped bad guy and his world-ending plot of this movie different from the bland bad guys and world-ending plots of Thor the Dark World, or Guardians of the Galaxy, or so on?Dr Strange himself feels like the only character with a fully fleshed out personality in the movie. No one else seems to have enough of a personality to be understandable. The villains, in particular, had no personality whatsoever. And Dr. Strange's allies were a bit too baffling to make much sense. I understand they're supposed to be mysterious people, but as soon as we learn a little bit about them, the movie moves on, so we never quite get to know them or their motivations. This becomes a problem when they start to play bigger roles in the main plot, even though we still don't really know them and who they are as characters. And the romantic interest was weak. She was oddly played for laughs more than as a serious part of the movie. The joke was she's unusually underwhelmed and unimpressed by all the magic. It's amusing, but if the movie won't even take her seriously, it's hard to seriously believe that these two are in love at all.Music: Michael Giacchino is usually a talented composer, but I have to call him out here; he may be getting a little lazy. His theme for Doctor Strange sounds way too much like he simply copied and only slightly modified his own Star Trek theme. They sound very similar. Who let him get away with this?Inconsistencies: Lots of apparent inconsistencies with the rest of the Marvel movies here. Maybe the Marvel Cinematic Universe is getting too big for its own writers to keep up. The timeline of events in this movie don't quite match up with the other movies, notably the Doctor Strange reference in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), which was an exciting easter egg back when we first saw it, but now makes little sense.Final thoughts: This is a movie that's generally fun, enjoyable, effects-filled, and action-packed, but it's a movie that plays it very safe and ends up rather formulaic, instead of daring to do much of anything to surprise you. Marvel has a formula that works for them and the success of their movies can't be denied, so you might ask why fix what's broken? But this is the 14th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie so far, and the old Marvel formula's getting a little repetitive. I'd like to see them take bolder risks and go in more unexpected directions than what we got here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Very generic story with amazing visuals and one good character.,"Benedict Cumberbatch is near perfect as Strange. The visuals are amazing. The rest of the characters are there for exposition and sequel set up. The story was very run of the mill in terms of Marvel. They have a money-making algorithm that they have used to churn out a couple amazing movies (all of this is in my opinion, of course), and many mediocre movies. The villains are my second biggest issue with Marvel. I have never found Loki to be a good villain, he's more of a meddler, who I believed has been stretched too far. Marvel seems to pour all of there effort into him, and create poorly written villains. The villains in this movie have amazing, rich, deep comic backgrounds, but in this movie they are explained through a throw away line. The movie is fine.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
When a science person was the chosen one in the spiritual world!,"You would have not expected it from this director if you had seen his previous films. This was based on the Marvel comics that I haven't touched. So basically I had high expectation to witness another side of Marvel universe with another set of (super)heroes. And surprisingly, it was very entertaining, nothing like other Marvel's heroes/story, except the possession of superpower to fight evil forces.Firstly, Benedict Cumberbatch in the lead in a Marvel film, I did not think it would work. All I knew is he was a great sidekick, but that image has changed here. He was wonderful, definitely I'll be looking forward to its sequel as they had confirmed at the end. The theme wise, it is similar to most of the superhero tales, but some new concepts were added to it, I mean the superpower and that's what made it so unique.Just like 'Thor', this film as well had taken the spiritual believes only for the basic platform. The rest of the developments are the clear mix of fantasy (illusion) and science. So it means the film is for theists and atheists. I am one of those who did not like 'Inception', which I think an ordinary action film with multiple layers. But this one was so awesome and it is for the people like me who think 'Inception' failed.Visually spectacular. I regret missing it out in digital 3D. Its Academy Awards nominee in the category of Best VFX tells the story. There will be a tough contest, even I'm up for 'Jungle Book', but I won't be sad if this wins. The success story of Marvel continues. Not everybody reads comic books, but film goers are the majority. So adaptations like this are people like me. Let them keep coming, I love this format better. This film is not just for the youngsters, but old, families, as well as kids can enjoy, so I hope you won't miss it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Doctor Strange made superhero movies fun again,"I read a lot of Marvel comics and possess good to excellent knowledge in all the characters in the MCU except two - Howard the Duck and Doctor Strange. The former is self-explanatory, the latter I know uses mystic powers to fight villains. That doesn't interest me. Magic, IMHO, is a cheat code and with that the dude can conjure anything out of his imagination to win any bout. Boooooooooring. However, great word of mouth brought me to the cinema and I must say this is the best Marvel movie I have seen this year.From an archetypal megalomaniac for a villain to a flawed hero to a Defcon One destruction-of-yet-another-city climax (poor New York City again?!), superhero movies adhere to an overused template. Doctor Strange doesn't do it differently in a broader sense but it made the journey through the tropes suddenly feel refreshing, and that is one mark of an excellent film. The visual and sonic effects are absolutely marvellous. The opening action sequence which featured a kaleidoscope of turning and tilting buildings is simply jaw-dropping. The world building is so interesting and exhilarating. In a lesser film, the lengthy exposition would have kill it beyond the point of resurrection, but here it feels so rollickingly fun. I didn't even need to park my head outside the door, I willingly put it in my lap and devoured all the excesses like a sponge.Benedict Cumberbatch (I read in a friend's FB post that a couple of girls called him Benson Cucumber :)) anchors the movie superbly and it is difficult to see another actor in the role of Stephen Strange, an egotistical narcissist turned superhero. But it is especially hard to despise him even when he is at his most selfish. Cumberbatch is heroic in the way he allows his character to joyfully take over any situation and call out anyone who doesn't serve his purpose. When he fights, it is not with the zeal of a focused Avenger who is hellbent on saving the world. It is with the constant one-upmanships of a cunning jokester. He doesn't plummet the villain till he is a pulp, he makes the baddie give up wanting to fight him.My wifey never likes movies with high concepts like time travel and time paradoxes, but surprisingly she never complained about this one bit. It totally succeeded in making the big concepts bite-sized and they served the story well. That is another mark of a good film. The movie also never takes itself seriously and pokes fun at the ridiculousness of it all. We live it cathartically through Strange as he constantly wants to sieve through the bullshite to find the scientific explanation behind it. Other than Cumberbatch, all the supporting roles came out aces. Yes, some of them do feel under-developed but the film got the measure between fun and pathos just right.This is one Marvel-ous movie and just like that, it made superhero movies fun again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Formulaic with special guest star Casper,Love Mads Mikkelson and Benedict Cumberbatch. Benedict makes a great Dr Strange. The interaction of these two characters and Dr Strange's good sense of humour is what scored most of the points.Unfortunately the movie and story itself were lackluster. The visuals were Inception copies. But the manipulation of buildings and roads is only magical when used sparingly and in the right setting. In this case the Inception-like visuals were relied on too much and the action and story were secondary.At one stage I thought they have remade Casper. I was a bit put off by this to be honest.The Marvel movies follow a formulaic approach to story writing that is cumbersome unless you're a 10-year old. It is a pity that there isn't more meat on the bone for the mature audience that loves a good fantasy or sci-fi flick.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Dr. Strange is visually stunning with great acting. It is also void of spirit and lacks coherence.,"Dr. Strange: Be the Empty VesselDr. Strange, the newest Marvel superhero to hit the large screen is fabulous to look at. The acting is high quality, especially Tilda Swinton, and it's a departure from the standard shoot 'em up entertainment of the Avengers and other Marvel films. That said, it's a vacuous, trite, self- important piece, much like the character of Dr. Strange himself.It's not overly sentimental; I will give it that. But its fantastical plot leaves the audience cold. If I had seen this film ten years ago, it would have been fabulous. Today, it bores me with its mysticism. And despite the attempt by the writers to get us to buy into the world through the character of ""The Ancient One,"" I'm not buying.Mads Mikkelsen is great as the villain Kaecilius, but still, I don't care. There are no fast and easy romances in the film, and that's another plus. However, I found no love for any of the characters. Cumberbatch embodies the character of Dr. Strange well, even his smarminess, which is annoying at times. And he looks just like what I imagine Dr. Strange would. His ""cape of levitation"" skirts the edge of being a mascot akin to R2D2. I think they held back on the cuteness, and that was a good choice.However, Wong, played by Benedict Wong, is too much of a stereotype of the stoic Asian man. That WAS annoying. Chiwetel Ejiofor was excellent as Mordo, even with some of the understandably silly mystic lines. Swinton's ability to make the mystic talk credible was worth the price of entry.In all, it's a decent origin story with a haphazard structure and chaotic action scenes. Rating: MatinéeThe film looks great and has great acting. The mysticism and actual story were a great excuse for entertaining action. However, for all the talk of 'spirit' in the film, the movie contains little.Peace, Tex Shelters",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Pure sci-fi fun,"Doctor Strange is an excellent film with an interesting script and very good performances.Benedict Cumberbatch did an excellent job playing Dr. Stephen Strange and I could not imagine anyone else being able to play the role to the level that he did. His personality, wit, stubbornness and ambition were portrayed very well on screen. Rachel McAdams also played her role perfectly and I really hope she gets more screen-time in future movies.The story is also a little different from what we've seen in previous Marvel movies and some of the visuals reminded of other great sci-fi films, such as Inception and The Matrix, but Doctor Strange sets itself apart with a wonderful introductory story to the character within the Marvel Cinematic Universe.The action sequences were pretty cool but I feel they could have been a lot more intense and breathtaking in a world where the perception of reality are limitless. Visually, it was still nice to look at but the potential to be much more thrilling was definitely there after watching the movie.Overall, this was a fun film to see and I highly recommend it if you've enjoyed Marvel's previous films.

"Could be better, but - never mind","A good movie, though a bit overloaded with acid-colored special effects.

Getting Some Strange,"Doctor Strange: I hate going to the movie theater nowadays. It isn't that the experience is so much worse than it was back in the good old days when men were men, children were well behaved and people dressed for going out in public. It simply is that my home theater experience is gotten so much better. Surround sound, my own snacks, my own choice of company and a decent 4k OLED screen make for a mighty fine home viewing experience.Sometimes though a movie comes out that makes we wish I had seen it in the theater. Doctor Strange is one such movie. The special effects and design are so wonderfully trippy. The story is your standard origin story with the put-upon love interest (an underused Rachel McAdams), A cocky self-assured millionaire learning a life lesson, and even a touch of ye olde chosen one.It's all the other wonderful stuff that makes the movie.

Heroic Mysticism: Hollywood's New Esthetic,"Hollywood's new aesthetic is mystical heroism, or heroic mysticism.

Wooden acting, they sound as if they were reciting their lines, specially Tilda Swinton. Every character is very one dimensional.It's just dull and plain unengaging. Movies like this should go all the way, but it feels they only do the bare minimum. I didn't care for any character, and the movie also looks boring.

Another quality addition to the never-ending list of films from the Marvel universe.,"Anyone who knows me knows that I'm far from being a comic book expert, but I recognize that Marvel, in addition to creating a huge range of characters, extremely complex and with a biography full of nuances, created a multitude of magazines and graphic albums where it gave almost each one the space to shine. They were often short-lived editions, but they established the ""canonical"" vision of each of the characters: heroes who become villains and then, again, heroes, who save Humanity or destroy it in petty rivalries. What Marvel is doing now in cinema, and with great financial results, is the same thing: creating films, sequels, spin-offs and variations where each character has time to show value and raise money from fans for the company's coffers.Without rushing, I have watched several of these films, trying to understand the bizarre stories and characters they bring to us. It's not the kind of film that I would actually pay to see, but it has entertainment value and merits that I recognize, and that make it gold for the company. This film is not even close to one of the most notable or successful, but it was still able to be nominated for an Oscar for Best Visual Effects in 2017. It was directed and written by Scott Derrickson (""Sinister"", ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"" etc.), and has a pleasant narrative that is easy to follow and understand, even for a layman in the Marvel world. The character is one of the obscurest in this universe, an arrogant doctor who becomes a powerful wizard from an important sect based in Nepal. This is how he obtains his powers, through effort and study, and not through chance or some tragic incident. The pace of the film is good, and the entertainment is one of the strongest points of this work.On a technical level, what stands out the most is the mastery of the effects and CGI team, which takes advantage of the studio's budget to give us a true visual spectacle at the level of what Marvel has accustomed us to. And contrary to what sometimes happens, we never feel like the film was an excuse for the effects. Cinematography is an essential part of the film's visual beauty, with magnificent colors and clarity, intelligent framing and a creative touch. There are some truly remarkable scenes, and the space and time bending effects are surprisingly good. The sets, costumes and props follow the general quality of the work and attest to the attentive look of the production. And the action scenes? Superbly performed and choreographed.The cast, another strong point of this film, was confidently headed by Benedict Cumberbatch, who gives us work at the level of the best he has ever done in his career. Tilda Swinton, in yet another androgynous character, gives us yet another impactful work that will be difficult to forget. Chitewel Ejiofor and Benedict Wong also do excellent work and substantially enrich the film with strong performances. Despite the centrality of his character, Mads Mikkelsen had bad luck in this project: the material he was given is substantially shallow, and forces the actor to perform the miracle of multiplication, giving us his best with very little. Rachel McAdams was also another victim of the superficial treatment given to most of the secondary characters, but she didn't have the Nordic actor's ability to make omelets without eggs. She's just a shallow cliché: the hero's girlfriend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Distracting, with impressive effects; but no more than just an okay film","Another Marvel film. It doesn't matter how many well regarded subtitled films I have in my queue, or how much I suspect that any given Marvel movie will have the same strengthens and weaknesses as the others I've seen, I will watch these quite quickly when they are available to watch at home. That includes characters I have never heard of before, such as Ant-Man, and this one. The plot here sees a talented surgeon get in an accident, lose full control of his once talented hands, and seek out some power that may be able to cure him. That power turns out to be much more than this, and soon he is fighting pan dimensional forces to protect Earth from destruction.There is plenty here that reminds you that you are part of a massive franchise of films, although to be fair Doctor Strange bares that weight pretty well, and mostly it just focuses on what it is doing and not so much on having a lot of connections to these other characters. Watching it as its own film, there is quite a lot to enjoy. The high-profile cast for instance; they bring a lot of quality even if some of them have little to do, and/or caused controversy by their casting. The special effects are probably the big thing though. Not only are they technically impressive (like almost all big blockbusters) but the nature of them is quite pleasing in the way it twists the world around. They are not enough to carry the film, but they do make a mark. Finally, the light humor works well, and helps it not take itself too seriously.Sadly, outside of the cast and effects, what we have is an origin story for a character I have no reason to be interested in. The effects may be impressive, but they also limit how I could connect to the action. It all plays out with noise and movement, but the familiarity of the content meant I never really got into it. On one hand this is what I come to the marvel films for – so on that front the effects, humor, and noisy action all were present; however, as a total package Strange was only an 'okay' film that could have been much more.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Unfulfilling for the most part,"Doctor Strange is a textbook definition of a Marvel film. A generic story, good action sequences, a healthy dose of comedy, and an underwhelming portrayal of an amazing superhero. One thing that sets this film apart for all of its Marvel predecessors is its superb psychedelic visuals. Dr. Strange's introduction to the world of ""magic"" by the Ancient One was some of the most visually appeasing sequences I have seen in film, which is also why I regret not witnessing it in 3-D. Besides the visuals and smart casting of Benedict Cumberbatch for the role of Dr. Strange, this film is very unfulfilling. I was hoping for this film to break the mold and delve away from the formulaic nature of Marvel films, similar to what Deadpool did, but that simply just doesn't happen in this one.

Good entry into unknown territory for Marvel,"'Doctor Strange' is the 13th (14th? 15th? Even I'm losing count!) Marvel film, and continues the trend of 'Guardians of the Galaxy', 'Ant-Man' and 'Deadpool' - not the most well-known comic book characters, but they've given chance to breathe and create their own energy separate to the Avengers, and are more fun because of it. Simple premise here - Dr Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch) is a famous, conceited, surgeon who has a car accident and can no longer fully use his hands. In search of radical treatments, he visits Nepal and encounters Mordo (Ejiofor) and The Ancient One (Swinton).He - like us - has to surrender everything he thinks he knows and enter the world of mysticism, spells and magic. There's some funny scenes and remarks as he comes to grips with these new possibilities in the world. The film is actually funnier than I thought it was going to be, since Dr Strange is no Spider-Man or Deadpool in terms of quips, but it's handled well. The director, Derrickson, is coming off a patchy output at best - 'Deliver Us From Evil', 'Sinister', 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' - but does a decent job of keeping the pace up and not having too long between scenes with action. Some of the ""city/room-bending"" scenes are great to watch.While the tone is sometimes dark and ""we're all just a speck in this world, which is only part of one universe, let alone the multiverse"", it's generally upbeat and handled more with awe and fun than seriousness and fanaticism. Christine (McAdams) serves as the real-world foil and Kaecilius (Mikkelsen) is an adequate bad-guy. Cumberbatch carries the film and is a douche when needed, and a strong presence at other times. The end-credits scene has a nice quick Thor appearance. I look forward to seeing more of Dr Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Imaginative spectacular trip,"I watched this 3D-Bluray in the Meta Quest 3 headset for maximum immersion...it really pays off! While I appreciate some regular CGI-fest viewers may be jaded by the time they get to Doctor Strange I suspect they might be referring to the 2D version on a regular sized TV screen. At that size: the action & fancy graphics may not totally convince. But in 3D, with as big a screen as possible, you get to appreciate the imaginative spectacle as intended.'Pleasingly dizzying' is how I'd describe the action. I sometimes wished for a bit of slow-motion or longer lingering so we get to appreciate the image more. Pausing it is one way, but obviously disrupts the flow. Suffice to say Doctor Strange may be the most impressive visual feast of the MCU so far (I'm watching them in order), as crucially the spectacle has a narrative point rather than just a series of hectic mindless battles.Outside of the FX are the engaging story, well-played characters, decent dialogue and watchable villain (his Bigger Bad was a little cliché but with quite a unique final battle). Doctor Strange himself - like Tony Stark - is unlikeable at first but wins you over by the end. Shame Benedict couldn't use his natural accent, tho'...would've suited that character.Deserves the push to a rare 9/10 for Interstellar Overdrive! A very exciting surprise to hear a cult instrumental track from the early Pink Floyd in a mainstream superhero movie...Only Guardians of the Galaxy had a 9/10 so far, tho' there's been a bunch of 7's & 8's in this long Infinity Saga, so been well worth my time finally getting round to them. And all super immersive in the giant virtual 3D screen of the Quest 3 headset.Next: Guardians 2.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Strange (2016),"Its no secret that Marvel is a money making machine. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has grossed billions of dollars and remains a force every year. Overall, I think the franchise has been very successful in bringing comic book heroes to life through origin stories and combining the heroes for action epics. Marvel's latest installment was introducing the masses to Doctor Strange. I wasn't very familiar with the character so I was cautiously optimistic going into this one.The films stars Benedict Cumberbatch in the titular role. Benedict is a great performer and I think he's always remarkable in what he is in. Doctor Strange is about a arrogant but precisely successful neurosurgeon who gets in a life changing car crash that messes up hi hands. Strange searches far and wide for a way to get his hands working again. he travels to Nepal and is introduced to a fantastically magical world of sorcery where he can do more with his mind and alter reality, time, and the world from harnessing the power within.First off, the effects in this film are great. Its immensely psychedelic and extremely graphically busy. The skyline is constantly shifting and worlds are bending and all of it looks up to par. It was reminiscent of some of the sequences seen in Inception. The fight scenes in the film also do not disappoint. Its got what it needs to keep thrill seekers engaged. Marvel also gathers a very talented cast to add to its never ending list of A-listers involved in the MCU. Mads Mikkelsen is a brilliant performer, although he's a bit of a shallow villain in this.The film has too much going on in concepts. A person's soul? can come out of their body, there is a giant demon thing that's trying to destroy the world, there are shortcuts that lead to major cities, buildings can be moved, there is a mirror reality, a moving cape, fireballs, time can be put on a loop its insane how many things happen in this film. Its not that its hard to follow, its just that the film becomes conceptually ugly the longer it goes. It doesn't feel like other Marvel films as the world that is created isn't very interesting and feels bland despite all the visuals involved.Cumberbatch plays a great Doctor Strange. He's an egotistical guy who becomes humbled and is yet witty and remains flawed. He's a welcome addition to the Marvel Universe, I assume he will be a part of the next Avengers film. Its just that this origin film doesn't really stand out as you are just thrown into the world of sorcery and just have to accept what is going on. Its an admirable effort but pales in comparison to some of the other heroes in the MCU. There is still room for improvement and I'm curious to see where this goes.6.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Spectacular!,The quest for self and truth is heavily built into this movie and that's one thing that's innately relatable for all of us.

"Potentially better, bogged down by ""The Marvel Formula""","Visually, this might be the best MCU movie (with Guardians), But the story is another ""Marvel Superhero Origin"" and it barely works. The villain is underused and bit weak. You can find things easily improved from start to finish and it feels way too generic.Having said that, the action is fun and different because of the kind of powers Strange has. Some of the themes discussed are interesting (mostly related to ""The Ancient One"", related to the ""Chosen one"" cliché and the lead of a faith based institution), although always a bit watered down by Disney.If you count all that with a really good third act and particularly original and great ending, it ends up being above average for the genre.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Seriously nothing holds this movie together from beginning to end.

Better after every rewatch,"This is one film that gets better every time I rewatch it. It is absolutely incredible. The CGI is probably some of, if not, the best I've seen in a Marvel movie. The acting is also great, with Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange, and Benedict Wong as Wong. I feel like this film takes a while to get going, and then it pulls you in until the end.

Not too good not too bad,"But it keeps you entertained all the time you keep yourself watching it through a lot of suspense and frightful visual effects that make you to forget its several goofs and factual errors usual in this kind of movies. It is the story of a great neurosurgeon that has a car accident which ruins his hands preventing him of perform surgery anymore. He is a kind of stubborn guy with a powerful ego and since he cannot be cured by traditional medicine he goes to Nepal to meet a magic master (a strange lady)hoping that maybe she can cure him through the learning of mystic arts. From then on, however the story complicates itself a lot turning itself into a struggle between forces of Good and black forces of Evil that are trying to destroy our world. Besides its several adventurous scenes this movie has also some metaphysical ambitions and tries to deal with things like Life, Death and Eternity which are too complicated themes to be successfully treated in a movie of this kind. Anyway I have seen better of this kind but much worse also.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Doctor Marvel...,"""Doctor Strange"" is an action fantasy movie of Marvel in which we watch a neurosurgeon who had a tragic car accident and lost his ability to pursue surgeries. Devastated by it he starts a journey of physical and spiritual healing. In this journey, he discovers a new world of mystic arts and soon his life goals change from just be a neurosurgeon to protect the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I liked this movie because of the plot and of course the good interpretations of the cast. At this point, it has to be mentioned that the interpretations of Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Dr. Stephen Strange, Chiwetel Ejiofor who played as Mordo and Mads Mikkelsen who played as Kaecilius. I have to admit that I expected more from Tilda Swinton who played as The Ancient One. The direction which was made from Scott Derrickson was simply amazing. The visual effects of this Marvel movie were once more outstanding as the cinematography too.Finally, I have to say that ""Doctor Strange"" is a very good movie for its kind and I believe that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I strongly recommend for everyone to see it because I am sure that you are going to have a great time watching it since it's very interesting and you are going to enjoy it very much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Has all the right ingredients, but fails to cook a tasty recipe","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningIn this latest Marvel adaptation, brilliant but arrogant surgeon Dr Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is involved in a car crash, and loses the senses in his hands. In order to find out the secret behind his recovery, he travels to Kathmandu, Nepal, where he meets The Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and Mordo (Chiwetel Ejiofor.) Whereas the Avengers fight their enemies with force, this is a group that harnesses their inner power beyond the mortal world, in order to defeat Kaerilius (Mads Mikkelson) and stop his plan to destroy the natural world and its order.The latest origin story in the Marvel juggernaut stands alone, and marks a shift in approach to the traditional superhero persona. While it's as laden with dazzling visual effects and set pieces as the usual fare, DS seems to revolve around a more cerebral bend than the smash and bash antics of Spider-Man, Iron Man and the like. Strange is a character in his own right, on his own mission, and who better than current man of the moment Cumberbatch to play him, which he does very well, embodying the lead character in every inch as, reliably, do co stars Swinton and Ejiofor.As entertaining as they are, too many of these superhero films nowadays get weighed down in endless back story, dragging proceedings on for longer than they really need to, especially the 'origin' stories. So it's to the films credit that it's nice and short, delivering the goods without over-whelming the audience. Like the best of them, it also has a neat sense of humour and keeps its tongue firmly in its cheek. The special effects and action sequences are also amazing, dazzling and colourful. The problem is, the story just isn't interesting or compelling enough, and it's impossible to care about the characters or their motivations enough to get engaged with it. And that, sadly, is a big problem.The end impression you take away from the film is one of pity. It has everything fundamentally going right for it, it's just what's on the surface that lets it down. Maybe they'll get it right with the next film. **",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

A decent intro in the shape of an origin film - more to come next time?,"This film is Marvel's cinematic introduction (or reintroduction if you believe that the 1978 film should be counted as the first outing - although that was before Marvel Studies was a thing) to a long-time favourite character of comic nerds everywhere, Doctor Strange. Doctor Strange is the master of mystical arts and one of the Marvel Universes most powerful people. More than just a magician or a wizard, he controls powers that affect time and space as in this existence and others.Like other movies, this is an origin story to introduce him. It accounts his story from being one of the world's finest surgical physicians who loses his skills in a freak car accident, to becoming a master of mystical arts and protector of Earth.Being a superhero film you'd already expect a lot of CGI, throw in the magical element and you know that nearly every scene will be CGI'd. Threat not though, for the most part it's actually tastefully done. There are some beautiful scenes in the city reminiscent of ""Inception"", there are some wonderfully choreographed fight scenes too, and wit and humour is never far away from the screen. Some film's feel like they need the central character to grow up and become an adult with responsibilities in order for the film to advance. This feels the opposite, while Strange is a responsible adult at the start of the film he needs to relax and let go in order to be victorious. Perfect for what doubters and Marvel haters need to go through to watch something like this unreservedly without pre-judgements. If a man of science and medicine had to believe in magic in order to accept what his eyes and ears were telling him, then I'm sure cinema goers will be okay to sit and watch this for the joy of cinema rather than ulterior motives. Benedict Cumberbatch plays the Doctor and his portrayal, while a little wooden and void of emotional attachment at times, it was exactly how I'd image Strange being on screen when being plucked from the pages of a comic. I'm a fan of Mads Mikkelsen in general, I think his demeanour is very powerful, he is believable as the villain Kaecilius and I only wish there was potential to be in future films. Oops, nearly a spoiler. OK, so the story is a little formulaic, but it has to be, it's an origin story. The central character was X, then Y happens, now he has to cope with Y if he wants to be Z. It's simple sure, but at least this film had the manners not to pretend it was something it was not. It's a simple and fun film with visual treats that won't offend. I couldn't rate this as highly as other Marvel film's I've watched, but I'm not worried about that either. I know that this is an origin, we'll see Doctor Strange in other things soon, the next film, I'm sure will be better than this - but for now, I say decent introduction, 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Loved it,"Visually stunning and mind-bending.Benedict Cumberbatch's portrayal of Doctor Stephen Strange is nothing short of phenomenal. He brings charisma, intelligence, and a touch of humor to the character, making him a captivating and relatable hero.The film's visual effects are a true standout, creating mesmerizing and psychedelic sequences that transport audiences into the mystical world of sorcery and alternate realities. The mind-bending action sequences are unlike anything seen before in the superhero genre.Doctor Strange explores the concept of magic and spirituality in a way that feels fresh and inventive, adding an intriguing layer to the broader Marvel universe. The film's exploration of Eastern philosophies and mystical teachings adds depth and complexity to the narrative.The supporting cast, including Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo, complements Cumberbatch's performance and adds richness to the film's ensemble of characters.Director Scott Derrickson's visionary direction brings a unique style and tone to Doctor Strange, setting it apart from other superhero films and adding a touch of mystique to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.While some may argue that the film's plot follows familiar superhero origin story tropes, Doctor Strange's captivating visuals and exceptional performances more than compensate for any perceived predictability.In conclusion, Doctor Strange is a breathtaking and visually dazzling addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. With Benedict Cumberbatch's stellar performance, mind-bending visuals, and unique approach to the concept of magic, it's a film that keeps you spellbound from start to finish.If you're a fan of superhero films that push the boundaries of reality and explore the mystical realms, Doctor Strange is an absolute must-watch. So, embrace the mysticism and prepare to be enchanted by the magic and wonder of this exceptional superhero journey.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

An extremely flawed exercise in visual overindulgence...,"I'll preface this by saying I have seen and enjoyed almost all of the MCU films so far. I saw Doctor Strange in 3D in Coventry UK. I have not written a film review before but I felt compelled to do so as I didn't feel my experience was in line with any of the other reviews that have been posted. This was my first experience of the character of Doctor Strange.The good:All of the performances were decent as expected. Tilda Swinton was the highlight.The tone through most of the film had a unique feel which distinguished it from the other MCU films. If I hadn't known before hand I wouldn't have guessed it was part of the MCU at all. This was mostly a good thing, however there were two off-hand references to The Avengers which felt slightly out of place when spoken by a matter-manipulating wizard.The first half hour showing the character pre-superhero was genuinely moving. It wasn't anything particularly new, but it was played out very effectively.The climax of the film, whilst absurd, was definitely a breath of fresh air in the superhero genre. No portal in the sky, no expendable alien army, and no extended emotionally-charged 1v1 showdown.The bad:The comedy. There were two scenes that made me laugh, and a handful of others that seemed like they were supposed to. However, other people in the cinema were laughing when I wasn't so take this with a pinch of salt.Strange becomes a super-wizard too quickly. There isn't even a montage or other indication that time has passed. In one scene he is struggling with very basic space magic, and then next scene he is a bad-ass who can suddenly fight multiple fully-trained evil space wizards.As soon as the science meets the fiction it becomes extremely jarring. There is a scene in the film where Strange, now able to manipulate time and space, visits an old neurosurgeon colleague to get himself patched up. What follows is a scene involving a character performing physical surgery in the real world interacting with two astral projections having a zero gravity fist fight. This sounds cool, and indeed it did look cool, but it made no sense. Why are astral projections able to physically fight each other? If they can move through walls then why are they able to throw each other into things? Why is the neurosurgeon not questioning any of this? This dissonance peaks when the climax of that fight scene tried to blend science with magic in a physical way which didn't make any sense.There is a part of the film where Strange uses a particular type of magic to save the day, which we are told is ""forbidden"". We aren't shown why it is forbidden. There are no consequences for him using this particular power. We are told that it is ""against the natural order"", with no explanation as to why all the other destructive magic is allowed, but this isn't.My biggest complaint was with the depiction of superpowers in the film. There was no consistency, minimal explanation, and multiple logic gaps as a result of this. If you have seen the trailers or the film, you will no doubt have been drawing similarities to Nolan's Inception. I will not claim that the films are similar beyond the visual, but the best way I can explain how poorly the superpowers were explored in Doctor Strange is to directly compare it to Inception.In Inception, we have a bunch of characters who are able to manipulate the world around them. The film spends about an hour and a half meticulously explaining what is and is not possible. It has it's own set of rules and logic. We as an audience understand who can do what and why. When the proverbial sh*t hits the fan in the second half of the film, there is tension and a grounded sense of reality as a result of this.Doctor Strange also features a bunch of characters who can similarly manipulate the world around them, both the ""real"" world and various alternate dimensions. The difference here is that the film spends 5-10 minutes explaining a portion of the superpowers, and then every fight sequence from then on was totally devoid of any tension or sense of realism because none of the characters have any established limitations to their powers. It was like watching fights take part in a vacuum where physics and logic don't apply. There is no tension in these scenes because we don't understand what each character is capable of.Most non-fantasy action films don't have these problems because the characters are using weapons we are inherently familiar with, such as guns or knives. When Hans Gruber points his gun at Takagi in Die Hard, the audience understands the consequences of this action. When Voldemort points his wand at Harry Potter, we understand what he can and can't do because the films established this fact. When Kaecilius threatens Doctor Strange, we feel no tension because the film hasn't explained anything. Both characters could potentially do any number of fantastical things. As a result the confrontations do not work. In Inception, the ""superpowers"" were an integral part of the plot. In Doctor Strange, the superpowers were seemingly made up on the spot by the animators to make a visually entertaining sequence.Let me close by saying that I did not hate the film, but I was disappointed with it. I paid to see this in 3D soon after release because it looked very enjoyable. I felt compelled to write a review of this film because I don't understand the praise it is receiving. It isn't terrible, and a lot of it was enjoyable. However, in my view it is an extremely flawed exercise in visual overindulgence which unfortunately tarnishes the better aspects of the film. 5/10.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Lights Are Definitely On ...,"... but unfortunately no-one's home.By which I mean to say: Plenty of things are happening, but there is no evocative core, character building, or genuine emotion.It's a film for people that need things to happen, without any feels involved.It's full of bombast, exposition, left field cuts and platitudinous axioms that essentially do not amount to much. This leaves very little space for performance or subtlety from the leads.That being said there is good space (made) for comedy, and it's very well done. Ultimately, though, it's a shame that those short moments (which gave more character than any other in the film) are few and far between. Even the physical comedy is good. It's by no means a dark and broody affair, it's just that the pace is far too fast, and the cuts are far too frequent for any personal narrative to build over all the stuff that is happening.This is a shame, because the film is gorgeous, and I was genuinely blown away a few times. Visually it's stunning, however that really translates poorly to any drama for the characters involved.I believe that there is a film in there, somewhere, perhaps on the cutting room floor, I do not know. Perhaps I needed a bit more time with him as a person before and after before we were thrown in to scene after scene of (quite, quite, awesome) action.Ultimately, I think they've struggled to tame the language, and have perhaps gone a bit too respectful of the source material, which is unweildy at the best of times. Dumbing it down really could have helped the performances sell this a little more, and since we are at the start of the good Doctor's journey, that might not have been too bad a thing.It's fine, but there is more film in there somewhere, begging to get out of the mirror that this is.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Slow start, overly long dialogue sequences and CG overkill","To date, I will say this is the first real miss in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I rate the movie a 6.5. Some movies will get rounded down from 6.5 to a 6 when I have to rate it on IMDb, other's get rounded up. Doctor Strange get's the benefit of the round up. It wasn't bad, but it does have some substantial flaws. Some of the flaws are in the story, but this review won't go over those.Initially I was put off a bit by Benedict Cumberbatch's generic American accent. He did a fine job, it was just a bit distracting. I don't know if comic book fans would have cared about a transplanted Englishman in America being Doctor Strange or not, but having the quintessential English actor work his mouth around Americanized English kept pulling me out of the story. It was as if this thought kept occurring: ""He sounds really American right now. But he isn't.""The good doctor's background is slow to develop. We spend a bit too long finding out how great a neurosurgeon he is and how awesome his own intellect is and how shallow he is and how obsessed he is with his own health. Iron Man did it better and kept the story moving at a good pace.There were also long sections of expositional dialogue that could have been shortened. During these long sequences in the theater I would find myself no longer engaged and wishing for the FFWD button on the remote.The CG effects were a 3D animator's dream and a movie watcher's nightmare. Realizing the comic was based on the interest in mysticism and drug use one has to expect some *interesting* sequences.This movie put too much emphasis on the psychedelic ""kaleidoscope"" effect, especially considering the movie only mentions drugs in passing. As seen in movie previews we get hand-to-hand combat in the middle of the kaleidoscoping city, hand-to-hand again in a kaleidoscoping ""arena"", kaleidoscoping again when Kaecilius learns his new power and so on.It was almost dizzying at first, in an awesome, visually arresting way. The viewer feels pulled into this tunnel of never ending movement and we search for some sense of ""correctness"". The characters both struggle and triumph in the ever changing landscape.Other ""trippy"" sequences are also injected where they weren't needed with Doctor Strange falling through a dreamlike series of CG animated colors and kaleidoscoping shapes.As the movie progresses and these effects are constantly being used, and used to excessive length, it becomes visual overkill. It is another distraction that keeps the viewer from being fully engaged.I left the theater thinking the movie was just ""ok"". It did not live up to my hopes and Marvel expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Another delight by marvel!,"Doctor strange is, well, strangely different but at the same time, similar to other Marvel movies. It is intriguing and thrilling but at the same time it seems like it is shot in a completely different style. As I said, it is a delight to watch, but gave it a 7 because I expected more. When you have such an elaborate concept on which you can build on, adding the almost perfect star cast why does it feel like that still something is missing? The film failed to thrill me when I expected the most. I was looking for some ""wow"" moment which never came. Even if the movie is good, you need that moment which remains in your mind when you go home after watching it, i think the movie lacks that.There is no way I would ever blame the star cast for this because these are all my favorites, like McAdams, Ejiofor, Cumberbatch, Swinton etc. All played there part as smoothly as they did in Spotlight, 12 years a slave, Sherlock and (so many good ones for Swinton, but)We need to talk about Kevin, respectively.

The film is not filled with fantasy (here it is much closer to reality than hitherto and before). Attention is not scattered on the many main characters. And everything around is authentic, original, interesting and, of course, new!.. Enumerate the advantages of the film can not be short. But he deserves it!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
I personally loved this film.  And that's no small feat!,"this movie has it all. Character development, slight romance (not too heavy), action, loss and sorrow, good acting, good story, and perhaps most importantly, the potential for sequels.That is by far the thing I am looking for most of all.I knocked two stars off my rating for two reasons: anti Christian bigotry planted subtly in the movie, and because digital effects go a little too far at places.There is a scene where Mads Mikkelson's character and his two zealot henchmen are conducting an occult ritual in what is clearly a Catholic Cathedral in New York.... Whoever directed this needs a kick in the face for that scene alone! I am soooo sick of this crap!Also, the digital stuff goes a little far in places. It gets right onto the high-wire of being in bad taste, but thankfully pulls back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Suprisingly good,"I was really suprised to have liked this so much. I always expect marvel films just to be average and while it is the case for most of them I have to say that some are suprisingly good like this one. It was an enjoyable watch. The visual effects in this film are stunning and make the viewing experience really pleasant. It's a shame I didn't watch this in a cinema because I think with the big screen it
would have been amazing. The story for me was interesting and overall this film is hugely entertaing. Even for someone like me who is not a big marvel fan I found it very good so I would recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"A good first start, but what about the SECOND ACT?!","So Marvel told the basic origin story of Doctor Strange (Earth's supposed Sorcerer Supreme). But, didn't it feel a bit undeserved? Like really, what did Dr. Strange have to suffer through in order to become the master of mysticism? ABSOLUTELY NOTHING! However, Marvel does have a chance to rectify this situation and make this character one of their better franchise movies by simply following up the first movie and making the classic magnum opus Triumph and Torment. If they made this as their second movie, not only would it flesh out Dr. Strange more by showing that he actually deserved the title, but it would also introduce Marvel to the something that it has sorely lacked throughout ALL it's movies; a complex villain more worthy than all of its heroes put together: Dr. Doom. After butchering nearly all of the Thor movies and killing off Odin like some B-rate character, the fans deserve this movie! Stop being lazy Marvel and finally do your films some justice!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Dr. Strange in the Phase 3 of the MCU,"Dr. Strange is a good entry in the MCU's phase 3. It has a good start to magic in the MCU. It revolves around neurosurgeon Dr. Stephen Strange having a car accident and trying to find a way to fix his hands, in which leads him to being one of the many superheroes in the universe. I find all the visuals amazing and it does a good job at doing the magic. It is the first time that the multiverse is mentioned in the MCU. In this movie, the multiverse is compromised of dimensions rather than different universes with different variants of marvel characters Disney owned at the time. It is the project that centers around the time stone, so it talks about time a lot. The humor was ok, sometimes off putting, sometimes just fine. I find it as an alright origin story and feel like Strange has more to learn as a character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A remake of Iron Man,"A brilliant man of science gets injured and works with an individual from the east to rediscover his purpose, eventually fighting an enemy with similar powers in a city. But enough about Iron Man.I know I'm in a minority on this, but Doctor Strange tells a similar story to, but is superior to, Iron Man in just about every way.Doctor Strange is a brilliant neurosurgeon with a photographic memory who gets into a car accident due to his own negligence that robs him the use of his hands in any effective way. He goes from performing some of the most intricate surgeries modern science is called upon to accomplish to being unable to shave himself because his hands won't stop shaking. Giving up on western medical solutions, he follows rumors to Tibet where he meets the Ancient One and a monastery of monks dedicated to magic. Opening his eyes to the world beyond the physical, Strange uses his mental strength to quickly become a star pupil, going beyond the proscribed limits of his training, and meeting an evil former student out to bring about the end of the order and the current state of the world in favor of a being from the Dark Dimension.What mainly makes this movie work is the strong and simple character journey Doctor Strange finds himself on. It's beyond an arrogant man learning a bit of humility. It's the story of a man with a limited view of the world learning to expand it, while also realizing his size in the face of such enormity. He may have been the best neurosurgeon (partially because he only chose savable patients), and he may have become one of the premier masters of the magical arts, but he has come to realize how small he is. Despite the great things he does to save the planet, he knows that there are more things out there that he won't be able to face down alone. It's a strongly written emotional arc for a main character that connects from piece to piece very well.Of course, the main positive of the film is the action and special effects. Marvel movies have a tendency towards a drab color palette and shaky cam action (which is sometimes appropriate like in the Captain America sequels that imply a sense of urgency and reality to the action). However, that approach isn't always appropriate like in the Guardians of the Galaxy movies and this one. The idea behind the film is a gobbledygook idea of a multiverse, bringing in the powers of other universes using magical spells, and then shattering reality in certain ways with that. That very idea lends itself to trippy visuals that the movie embraces fully.From the spectral form of Doctor Strange helping with a surgery on his own body to the show stopping chase through New York's mirror dimension, the movie embraces an inventive mode of special effects that lends itself well to the material. Watching New York's skyscrapers fold in on themselves, creating different axes of dimensionality, is just fun to take in, and the action that runs through it is inventive and fun.Another note needs to be given to the resolution to the film's climax. The giant cloud monster from the Dark Dimension has entered our realm through a portal in Hong Kong. Dr. Strange uses some time magic to draw things backwards and then launch himself directly into the Dark Dimension to face the monster. Instead of some special effects knock out, drag out fight, we get Dr. Strange attacking the problem with intelligence and wit. He can't beat this giant monster. In fact, we watch the monster kill Dr. Strange repeatedly as the good doctor puts time into a loop that neither he nor the monster can escape. Dr. Strange is happy to maintain this status quo as long as it keeps Earth safe, but the monster needs to escape, leaving an implied agreement that we see the end of.The movie's a strong entertainment and fun. A good, mid-cycle addition to the whole universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Doctor Strange,"Marvel came out on top with the thrilling ensemble epic ""Captain America: Civil War."" But while ""Doctor Strange"" could have been the company's victory lap while introducing movie audiences to a cosmic new branch of the MCU, instead, this tale of magic and world-threatening mayhem is Marvel at it's most mediocre.The story itself makes sense only in broad strokes. Try to pick out the particulars of Kaecilius's plan, and you'll be left with far more questions than answers. Though Mads is riveting in his creepy make-up and confident glowers, his villain goes the way of too many MCU baddies by being too vaguely realized in his emotions and backstory to have a powerful emotional impact. However, Mikkelsen's wry humor honed over seasons of ""Hannibal"" comes in handy to deliver one of the film's funniest moments, involving a nonchalant exchange that has a confused Kaecilius calling the titular hero ""Mister Doctor.""Unfortunately, this is one of the few jokes that work. Under the direction of Scott Derrickson (""Sinister""), ""Doctor Strange"" rejects the broader comedic moments of quips and pratfalls that the MCU has made part of its signature in favor of a dryer wit. Which would have been great, if it worked. As it was, joke after joke from Strange — including a run about people with solo names like Adele, Aristotle and Eminem — fell flat, leaving a cavernous silence in a theater where laughter was meant to be. This speaks to the central problem of ""Doctor Strange"": Benedict Cumberbatch has been wildly, woefully miscast.Now, I admire that Derrickson tried to make the MCU his own, folding in trippy and sometimes nightmarish visuals of the astral planes and Mirror Dimension. He swung for the fences, and while the CGI bodies are sometimes jarringly rubbery, it's a dizzying delight to see how these stylish sorcerers bends the streets of London, New York and Hong Kong into M.C. Escher- inspired constructs of chaos. However, while the action scenes have great settings, the fights themselves lack zing, leaving the stakes feeling weightless.All in all, ""Doctor Strange"" is fine, and sometimes fun. But I've come to expect so much more from Marvel. With ""Captain America,"" ""Thor,"" ""Iron Man"" and ""The Avengers,"" the shrewd studio casts films impeccably, bringing together an astonishing array of actors to create captivating on screen chemistry and wonderfully larger-than-life characters. Following in the footsteps of the Batman and Spider-Man movies that came before, the MCU has been raising the bar on what audiences should demand from superhero spectacle. But sometimes, even they can't clear it.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Stranger Things,"I rewatched ""Doctor Strange"" in preparation for his role in ""Avengers: Infinity War"". To be honest, I'd been putting off watching it again, as I felt going in it was my least favourite film of the MCU - this second viewing confirmed that, but did remind me that it has lots of great moments.Renowned Surgeon Stephen Strange loses the fine motor skills in his hands following a serious car accident. With all traditional medical options exhausted, he heads to Tibet following rumours of a break through cure. There he meets The Ancient One who introduced Strange to the mystical arts and the ability to tap into powers from another realm. But this power can be corrupting, and one of the Ancient One's former pupils, Kaecilius, returns with a plan to release Dormamu and ancient and powerful evil.So, what are my problems with this film? They are mostly in the first half of the film, and mostly around Benedict Cumberbatch. Shackled to an accent he never quite masters, the first glimpses of a successful Stephen Strange aren't enjoyable. His arrogance is understandable, and part of the arc that the character goes on, but the wit is missing. Jokes throughout this film feel forced and fall flat, which is really strange when you consider how successful the 2017 trilogy of ""Guardians 2"", ""Spider-man Homecoming"" and ""Thor: Ragnorok"" would be. Despite the reliable supporting cast, this humour failure extends to them too.It does look good though, the Inception (let's go with inspired, rather than rip off) folding cities in a mirror universe are really good. In fact all the visual effects are as impressive as they've been since day one. (18 movies without a bad special effect is pretty impressive). The ending is really good though and, without spoilers, it's nice to see one of these films end with the hero coming up with a plan and outwitting the villain rather than simply overpowering him, or a Deus Ex Machina finish.I like the way they left the character in this film, and the ""Thor Ragnorok"" cameo pushed towards a better written character. I have higher expectations for the good Doctor in Infinity Wars and hopefully beyond.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Strangely easy to watch,"The movie preview emphasized the kaleidoscope properties and left a dizzy impression of visual confusion, but the complete visual effects in the movie is easy to follow. Basically MC Escher and his hyperbolic geometry in play. Beautifully done, but too short.The casting choices are surprisingly close to perfect. Tilda Swinton delivers exquisite performance. Some like to say whitewashed, but the reality is there are white Asians. The important thing is she did a great job. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain is a good choice, but the makeup and fashion downplayed the character. As for Cumberbatch, the guy has the perfect image of Dr Strange, except I really missed his British accent, even though his American accent is very convincing.This looks like first of a sequel.

Outstanding Action & CGI,"When Stephen Strange, a highly skilled neurosurgeon, gets into a life-altering car wreck, his livelihood is threatened by the possibility of no longer being able to use his hands. Having to humble himself and allow his mind to be challenged, Strange seeks out the use of mystical arts to nurse him back to good health. After having mastered the arts, he comes across several cataclysmic secrets and ruthless villains that dwell in multiple dimensions.Some may say that the feature relied too heavily on CGI, but those people have unquestionably never seen a Marvel film before. That being said, the action scenes, action violence, and sci-fi visual effects were outstanding.Alongside a few other brilliant dramatic actors, Cumberbatch is great as Strange. He exudes arrogance, brilliance, hopelessness, and heroism flawlessly through his literary and literally multi-dimensional character.The script follows a strategic formula established by the geniuses from Marvel, but has enough twists and turns to leave viewers on the edge of their seats.There's nothing NOT to love about this film.

But this film seems to rob us of that movie just five minutes in. There is some great action here and there, but it happens so fast, before we can even take a breath, we're back in a hospital again. What's the point of being a wizard if you rely on your health insurance more than your magical powers?There are many redeeming moments throughout, and the good doctor could become an excellent vehicle for gorgeous visual material in future Avengers or Doctor Strange movies.

"I was relieved when the rushed, stiff and cliche Batman Begins-lite, Eat Pray Love opening of Doctor Strange...","...gave way to a joyous, refreshingly creative, kinetic visual treat with some superb flourishes of VFX and some snappy dialogue moments even if they are all lifted from the How-To Guide for Marvel Superhero Movies(tm).The (highly underrated) Scott Derrickson, director of modern horror masterpiece, Sinister, shoots confidently, and despite the palpably brisk pace hopping over lots of obvious scene trimmings; the film moves from whizz-bang locale to genuinely interesting introspective scenes with aplomb.Derrickson knows how to take and distill the influences of comic books and videogames and build something less like Inception, and more like Ninja Theory's DMC game; fight scenes take place in the mirror world; a beautiful kaleidoscope of flowers and rocks and exploding, bleeding plateaus like an Arkham City battle arena. Weapons imbued with magic and a cape to rival Aladdin's Carpet (sure to be used more in the next instalment) all of them designed straight from sub-culture inspirations like Final Fantasy. That stop-motion-esque scene with that apple is bloody fantastic.The sparse but excellent cast and the very clearly defined globetrotting locations mean that the film can look rich and uniquely designed with tremedous costume and make-up work, great lore and contained moments without inflating the budget. It's a smart move, worked on by talented collaborative team in the early stages with the freedom to create something cohesive.When Strange uses time to defeat a timeless being it's a little bit clever, a lot bit beautiful and pleasurable on the whole. Unlike recent blockbusters (I'm looking at you Ghost in the Shell) the themes are seeded well, consistent and clear and the film doesn't rely on crappy opening descriptive text for idiots or stupid generic ending voice over to cap it off because of confusion.The only disappointing beat is Chiwetel Ejiofor's unearned and misguided post-credits turn to the dark side. But that said, Doctor Strange is the little film that could; like Iron Man and Thor before it. Let's just hope the same team can build upon the foundations and expand all of the little moments and doesn't end up an Iron Man 2 or a Thor Dark World.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

There is a bad guy of course and that is Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who wants to control everything.

The Visuals Alone Sets This Film Apart!,"Kudos to the MCU, for one of the BEST introductory film for a superhero in Doctor Strange. The film is pure entertainment, hands down, as audiences are treated to facets Marvel absolutely nails! Top of mind is the solid casting. Mads Mikkelsen, Tilda Swinton & Chiwetel Ejiofor were both fitting & superb in their roles, that their every scene including expositions, simply captivates. Benedict Cumberbatch however, takes the cake. He is the perfect Stephen Strange as he portrays arrogance, misery & unrelenting desire with engrossing charm. He nails every line & scene, from those riddled with sarcastic humor, to the action-rich fight scenes which was a welcome, pleasant surprise.Apart from the cast, another remarkable win for Doctor Strange is its overall creative genius & the jaw dropping visuals born from it. As it touches on mysticism, multiverses and concepts
of time, it sets itself apart from other MCU films. It presents the bizarreness of these tenets with simplicity & ease, and even uses it as backdrop for its mind blowing visuals. These visuals boldly takes what Inception boasts of, and expands it without limits, leading to a visual experience that is truly mind blowing.As for it's weak points, it was unfortunate that the film's final showdown was underwhelming, typical for an MCU origin story. As the spectacle builds on momentum, it crashes down with a formulaic closure that is forgettable & simply meh.Despite this, Mister Doctor remains an absolute must see. The cast & humor are excellent, brimming with charisma and good ol' fun. The visualization of its credos, & the riveting action are experiences on their own. Huge props really to the MCU, for its boldness & audacity to take what is deemed unusual, and turn into something fresh & oh so satisfying. 7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Strange where the storyline went off to...,"This was definitely a comic book story long in the waiting for a transition to the big screen, and I am sure that many fans of the comic book and the Marvel universe were thrilled with this movie. I, however, am not a fan of superheroes in any shape or form, and just watched this movie because I had a chance to do so with my wife.Once the movie ended and the sparks and flashing effects left my eyes with a proper sight again, I can in all honesty say that this was a shallow and pointless movie, and there were so many plot holes that even a Swizz cheese would be jealous. But luckily enough there was so many grand and amazing effects on the screen to divert your attention from all the plot holes and the lack of a proper thought-through storyline.Personally I am not overly much a fan of Benedict Cumberbatch, and I don't really get the hype around him. He is not all that impressive. And one would think that I would be thrilled about seeing Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen in this movie, but I wasn't. He was just browsing through this as if he had seen through all the flaws and shortcomings that the script had.And with my lack of interest in superhero movies, then ""Dr. Strange"" is a movie that just came and went without leaving any impression or lasting mark, unlike ""Logan"" for example. And it is definitely not a movie that I will pick up again and sit down to watch. Why? Because the story just barely had enough contents to support the first viewing.Instead of just spewing out superhero movies by the dozen, Marvel Studios should take the time to get some proper script writers to pen out the stories for the movies they want to put on the big screen.Even though ""Dr. Strange"" was heavily loaded with special effects, it was just a shallow experience of a movie all in all. As such, my rating of this 2016 addition to the Marvel movie universe is a mere mediocre 5 out of 10 stars, based mostly on the special effects.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

So his casting in this movie was EXCELLENT in my view...So, was it good - Well, honestly - I thought this was excellent!!! It was thoroughly entertaining if a little jumbled.Tilda Swinton as the Ancient One was a controversial choice to many, but honestly I could not give a damn... Yes, it is an Asian character in the comics, but Hollywood KNOWS that it needs big names to sell seats - And her acting was fantastic!The Story, while not the greatest had some fine action scenes and though it borrowed a little too heavily from Inception - It all worked!And it is damn humorous as well... Some great Funny Moments...So why only a 7 if I enjoyed it so much?Well, yeah there are bad points - To Quote Rossatron, a popular YouTuber and Movie Making Critic, The 'Geography in the fight scenes gets a little convoluted and can be quite hard to follow at times.The fight scenes are all epic but it can be difficult following the various characters.And there must have been some kind of 'Behind the Scenes' discussion... As they made a TERRIBLE CHOICE asking Cumberbatch to try and do an American accent!!! OH BOY IT IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH SOME OF THE WORST ACCENTS IN MOVIES EVER!!!Only slightly behind Sean Connery trying to do Irish in The Untouchables...Benedict tries really hard to maintain the American Drawl, but it sounds so fake... and far too often he ends up reverting to British!I know that in the comics Strange is an American Doctor, but GOD DAMN IT its an Adaption!!!! Play to the strengths of your leads!!!Would it have been that hard to believe that Strange was a British Doctor who had migrated to the US for better opportunities to test his skills? NO! It wouldn't... And it would have saved us from the TERRIBLE Accent that Cumberbatch delivered!And its the accent that makes the film unintentionally hilarious too often... It slips in and out so much you wonder if Strange has a Split Personality!No, It has to be said - Its an enjoyable movie... Not perfect but to launch Doctor Strange into the Marvel Universe, it works!Now lets just hope they do NOT ask Cumberbatch to try and be American again and try and get a little more focus behind the action next time instead of relying on the effects to sell the film.Far better than I actually thought it was going to be...

A visually dazzling stepping stone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.,"See if you can guess this movie: goatee'd egomaniac finds himself in a life-changing situation in a foreign land that makes him question everything he's ever stood for and become a superhero in the process. If you guessed Iron Man (2008), you'd certainly be close. No, this familiar plot is none other than the visually extreme Doctor Strange. I understand Marvel has a bigger plot in mind when they do these lesser-known heroes; but lately, it almost seems like they're just phoning it in. Doctor Strange merely feels like filler to get to Thor: Ragnarok (2017) and Avengers: Infinity War (2018).I will give Marvel this much: they do know how to cast a film. Benedict Cumberbatch does a superb job at portraying the eponymous Dr. Strange, fused with enough gravitas and humor to make watching him a joy. And while many will question Tilda Swinton's role as The Ancient One, especially considering the amount of Eastern mysticism included in the film's theology, she certainly makes the role work in her own way. Even the sentient cape he wears has a personality I haven't seen since the flying carpet in Aladdin (1992).What Doctor Strange lacks in plot, it makes up for in special effects. I'm almost glad I didn't see this in 3-D, as I'm sure I would have vomited from all the swirling kaleidoscope effects seen throughout. Clearly, even though it's six years later, Christopher Nolan's Inception (2010) made an impression on the film world when it comes to these reality-distorting effects. There were even moments where I could catch the influence of The Matrix (1999) on the special effects of this film, especially when the characters decided that gravity wasn't good enough for them. Despite all this, even though I wasn't high enough to fully enjoy some of the sequences, Doctor Strange was still an entertaining film.A visually dazzling stepping stone in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, I give Doctor Strange 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"No issues here, just a solid enjoyable movie!","First of there is a lot more comedy in this movie than I ever remembered and it's pretty good, sometimes it's a bit misplaced but for the most part it works. The story is actually really strong and it flows really nicely, my only problem may be the villains real motive as it's a bit hazy but nothing that is so glaringly obvious. The characters actual aren't to strong besides doctor strange. The rest have meaning for being there but don't really add much. Doctor Strange does however have a clear and linear progression, clearly showing his development throughout the story which is excellent to watch. There is a lot of foreshadowing that I never noticed before, which is nice to notice. The main viewing experience however is the special effects. The scenes are trippy as hell and are just baffling to look at, it honestly looks incredible and with magic powers really comes no limitations with fight sequences as shown in the movie. This leads to never before seen fights and a crazy ending battle. The movie never drags either, it has a constant rhythm (with a dash of repetition) that allows for an easy watch. I give it an 8, really good but still not the absolute greatest superhero movie.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Failed to Measure Up to Its Considerable Potential,"""Dr. Steven Strange"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a highly competent neurosurgeon who has an ego that is only matched by his arrogance and basic lack of charm. But that all changes one day after a car accident causes massive damage to his hands which essentially destroys his ability to function effectively in his chosen career. So having limited success with everything that Western medicine has to offer, he travels to India in a desperate search for a holistic remedy. But when he gets there and meets with an elderly woman known as ""the Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton) he discovers more than he ever thought imaginable. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that I had looked forward to watching this movie for a long time and now that I have finally gotten around to it I must confess that I was somewhat disappointed. To be sure, this film was better in some ways than the 1978 version--if for no other reason than the improved CGI. Unfortunately, rather than concentrating on creating a film with any measure of depth, the director (Scott Derrickson) chose to take the rather lazy and uninspired route by providing--yet another--superhero film consisting of nothing but action and CGI. Make no mistake, a film of this type definitely needs CGI and action. But it shouldn't be at the expense of everything else.

True to the Dr. Strange comics,"I am going to put this in as a last minute thought, the Dr. Strange animated movie that came out awhile back is a much better scripted and thought out movie than this, so if U find this movie frustrating in its lack of sense and incompleteness, watch the animated movie.Having read a few Strange comics growing up i can attest that this movie was true to the strange world, where nothing is really explained very well, Dr. Strange seems to have powers equal to a God, and his movements are basically rabbits pulled from a hat--I never really found the strange comics to have much depth, so the movie was pretty true to the original strange vision--Currently this movie is overrated, and probably will remain so for quite awhile, the script simply isn't in the same class as the other marvel super hero movies that have come out in the past few years, a discerning viewer can see the hand of Disney raise its ugly head in this.--Its obvious that some of actors portraying main characters were not required to audition or 'win' their parts, I give the overall acting about a B- to B range",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Very good, full of magic with amazing CGI and storytelling","This is the first marvel movie to feature magic, or the first to feature it very heavily. The story of Doctor Strange having the accident he had and getting where he is now is certainly breathtaking, although the magic is too much to be considered science fiction. Nevertheless, it is certainly a message to never give up on anything and that anything is possible given enough practice. The CGI of Marvel as always never ceases to give goosebumps and in my opinion Doctor Strange is one of the top 7 marvel movies (or through 2023), mainly because of the unique story and origin of the character which is fascinating and very intriguing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Great film,"The film has a very well-written story. It never slips, it is very dynamic, and it does not slip into a race against time. Action is not that much, but the one that is amazing. Remember Nolan's 'Inception'? Now multiply this game by 149 and get the unimaginable action that takes place on the screen when watching 'Doctor Strange'. The action is incredibly creative and beautiful, it's just a must see. I also can't help but highlight the great video game scene near the end.And there is a lot of great humor here, over which you can really laugh heartily. The doctor's cloak deserves a separate applause. Groot, you have a competitor.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Sherlock in the comics or a clone of himself,"The appearance of a new character on the screen from Marvel promised to be hot. It was necessary to take into account that he is played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who has long become famous, and therefore the project attracted even more interest from the audience.In addition, ""Doctor Strange"" as if by magic appeared in the schedule of the Marvel company's premieres at the moment when it was needed. No. The previous films weren't bad. Just the opposite. But the team of superheroes, their joint adventures and solo projects managed to get a little tired. It was felt that it was necessary to inject fresh blood, an extraordinary plot and a new story in general. And the company had such a move. As it turned out, quite successful.The picture tells about the confrontation of good and evil. However, now this is happening in other dimensions, where different rules, concepts and laws of being apply. Many references to Eastern culture gave the film a certain identity.The role of Cumberbatch was interesting, the actor is beautiful on the screen. He's charismatic, as always. But there is one significant ""BUT"" for me. Stephen Strange, by chance or not, is quite an egocentric character who considers himself superior to others, pompous and even rude. And very similar is Sherlock Holmes performed by the same Cumberbatch in the famous series. Perhaps the creators wanted to see their Strange exactly like Holmes from Bakerstreet, which the actor shows us, or maybe it's just a coincidence. The matter is different. In my opinion, this detracts from the performance of the actor himself. His image of Strange does not have something special, as if Benedict plays the same role as in Holmes, only called differently. But he can be a different actor. But not here.The picture in the movie is simply mind-blowing. Especially on the big screen and in 3D. You seem to be sucked into these different worlds that the authors of the project demonstrate. A powerful soundtrack complements this adventure. Amazing ideas of the creators, beautiful implementation - all this brings the Marvel cinematic universe to a new level of colorfulness. The truth still does not leave the feeling that some visual solutions are very similar to those in the movie ""The Beginning"", but this absolutely does not spoil the film. Today, cinema is replete with many examples of beautiful pictures, but there is an absolutely non-standard flight of thought and imagination of the creators. There are a lot of fundamentally new things that have not been anywhere else. The worlds are colorful and saturated, real and at the same time fantastic.The enemy of the main character was a villain, played by one of my favorite actors Mads Mickelson. However, there was a strange feeling that his character was not revealed. He doesn't even have much dialogue, which does not allow him to reveal the full potential of this wonderful actor.Tilda Swinton is good. Almost emotionless in this movie, but good. Her character is very lively, despite the fact that he is so meager on emotions. She feels knowledge, experience behind her shoulders, power and strength. And she acts as a smart mentor.The film is interesting and beautiful, extraordinary and memorable. It ""smells"" of novelty, which was very timely served to the audience and Marvel fans. And the audience will definitely appreciate both the new superhero magician and the whole tape.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Sorcerer Supremacy,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe charts a path into realms unknown with this fantasy adventure, the 14th (!) film in the ever-expanding canon. Our hero is Dr. Stephen Strange (Cumberbatch), a gifted but self-absorbed neurosurgeon whose life is upended following a car crash. His hands irreparably damaged, Strange is unable to find satisfactory treatment through western medicine, and heads east to Kathmandu. In a sanctuary called Kamar-Taj, the Ancient One (Swinton) holds court, opening Strange's eyes to unexplainable wonders. Strange sets about mastering the mystic arts, guided along by the Ancient One's disciple Karl Mordo (Ejiofor) and Wong (Wong), the keeper of Kamar-Taj's sacred relics. The Ancient One's students and humanity at large is threatened by Kaecilius (Mikkelsen), a former pupil who went rogue and is meddling in dark powers that could doom humanity. As Strange's colleague and ex-girlfriend Dr. Christine Palmer (McAdams) comes to terms with his transformation, Strange must use his newfound abilities to defeat Kaecilius and his followers.For all of the MCU's strengths and its branching into various subgenres, things have been feeling samey-samey. Audiences crave something all-new, all-different, and Doctor Strange is different enough. Director Scott Derrickson, known for horror films like Sinister and The Exorcism of Emily Rose, takes on his biggest, most ambitious project yet, emerging out the other side victorious. This is a film that's packed with eye-popping invention. Production designer Charles Wood and visual effects supervisor Stephane Ceretti, among the legions of artists and technicians involved, are worthy of commendation.The trailer, with its origami folding cities, had me worried that the imagery would be too similar to that of Inception. It turns out that the trippiest stuff has been saved for the film itself, with kaleidoscopic vistas, Doctor Who-style tunnels through space-time, buildings morphing and shifting like Dark City on steroids, and ghostly Astral projections floating between this plane and the next among the tricks up its sleeves. The mind-bending geometry gives the action sequences a delightfully unpredictable landscape in which to play out. The results resemble weaponised Escher artwork.Doctor Strange may serve up eye candy unlike anything we've seen from the MCU so far, but for the most part, this is a straightforward hero's journey origin story. The haughty doctor must be brought to his lowest point, accept that there are things in this world and others beyond his understanding, and come into his own as a superhero. Things move along nicely and the screenplay by Jon Spaihts, C. Robert Cargill and Derrickson is witty without being smug. Just as Deadpool was a standard-issue origin story dressed with self-referential irreverence and attitude, Doctor Strange is a standard-issue origin story spiced up with logic-defying dazzlement. This reviewer will admit to thinking Benedict Cumberbatch wasn't the best man for the job, and that Cumberbatch was cast in an effort on Marvel's part to ride the Sherlock wave. This reviewer was wrong. It is gratifying to see a performer take the material as seriously as one would treat Shakespeare. Cumberbatch's commitment to the part is yet another indicator that the days of ""this is based on a comic book so it must be mere frivolity"" are behind us. Cumberbatch rocks one of the most convincing American accents we've heard an English actor affect, and looks quite dashing in those robes and that cape. While we do already have an arrogant, brilliant MCU hero in the form of Robert Downey Jr.'s Tony Stark, Cumberbatch's portrayal of Strange doesn't feel like a repeat of that. Having an actor of Cumberbatch's calibre in the MCU roster is something we're grateful for.Ejiofor's Mordo is by-the-book and serious, but the actor's charm does shine through. Comic book fans know what becomes of the character, and that's hinted at here. While Swinton is fine as the knowing mentor figure with a glint in her eye, the movie doesn't make as a solid a case for its whitewashing as it promised. In the source material, The Ancient One is an elderly Tibetan man – your stock ""Asian mystic"" archetype. Co-screenwriter Cargill compared the dilemma to Star Trek's no-win scenario, the Kobayashi Maru. Adhering to the comics and depicted an elderly Asian man as the wise mentor would have been one kind of racist, but it can be argued that substituting said Asian man with a white woman is just another kind of racist. The implication is that a white person has bested the locals at their own game and is now running the show. What I'm really saying is: wouldn't Michelle Yeoh have made an awesome Ancient One?McAdams doesn't get a whole lot of screen time, but it's great to see a lead female who isn't merely the designated girlfriend. She's also shown to be so skilled a surgeon, that even Dr. Strange acknowledges her prowess. Wong has been reinvented from the subservient tea- pouring butler of the original to a stern librarian who refuses to laugh at Strange's jokes. Strange, Wong and Mordo end up working well together as an unlikely team.By now, you've read the phrase ""MCU villain problem"" in countless think-pieces. Alas, as far as villains go, Kaecilius is quite generic, but Mikkelsen does give the character a sinister, authoritative presence. The design flourish of burned-out crater- like scars around his eyes creepy. Keep a lookout for martial artist/actor Scott Adkins as one of Kaecilius' goons.The levity exhibited throughout most of the MCU movies is present here as well, with Strange making some smart-alecky quips and the sentient Cloak of Levitation behaving akin to the Magic Carpet in Disney's Aladdin. Just as elsewhere in the MCU though, the jokes sometimes diminish the stakes.Doctor Strange may not bend the established rules of the MCU completely beyond all recognition, but it reinvigorates the formula with a satisfyingly unique aesthetic. Stick around for a mid-credits scene and a post-credits stinger.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Weirdly formulaic but entertaining nonetheless,"Potentially the most surreal and supernatural addition to the Marvel film franchise disappointingly turns out to be the most formulaic. Cumberbatch is great as the gruff, egotistical Doctor Strange, almost playing him as an anti-hero as well as adding moments of his trademark acerbic wit. Other than some kaleidoscopic SFX the rest plays out pretty predictably. Even Swinton seemed to be coasting adding little uniqueness to a stereotypical mystic; which is strange considering her unorthodox casting. So nothing terrible to see here, but nothing especially new or exciting either. Shame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Near perfect interpretation but with minor problems,"This is as near to being a match to how I imagined the film should be as it's ever going to get. It isn't perfect but then nothing ever is, given that it's someone's interpretation of a work of art from a different medium. In the canon of Marvel films I rank this as number one but it's probably because Doctor Strange was always my favourite Marvel comic back in the sixties and the film captures the psychedelic aspects of the original perfectly even down to using Interstellar Overdrive on the soundtrack.My first minor dislike is that the Ancient One is played by a white woman. Actually I think that changing the Ancient One's gender is inspired and Tilda Swinton is brilliant in the role. But it's hard to see why an Asian actor wasn't chosen for the role. My other dislike was the opening sequence. It seems all films have to start with some big action sequence these days but when you don't yet know its connection to the main story it has little impact except to impress you with the CGI. I would far rather this opening sequence was left on the cutting room floor and the film started with the next scene with Stephen Strange in the hospital.Opening sequence apart, I felt that for once the CGI earned its place in Doctor Strange and was perfectly integrated into the story. The visuals often reflected Steve Ditko's style, further adding to my enjoyment of the film. I hope Marvel make some more standalone Doctor Strange movies because I can't help but feel he will be ill-served as a mere team member in one of their ensemble efforts.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Visual Trip,"As the MCU rapidly expands, various projects have explored different corners of the growing universe. Guardians and Thor have explored the cosmic side, the Netflix shows explored the street level, and now, Doctor Strange opens the door to the mystic side. In the comics, Doctor Strange is one of the heavy hitters in the Marvel Universe, capable of incredible feats and always involved in world-changing events. Though he had been adapted once previously, the mainstream viewing audience was mostly unaware of the Sorcerer Supreme and his extensive mythology. No stranger to making their characters into a household name, the MCU asks viewers to question reality in Doctor Strange.Though arrogant and egocentric, Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is one of the best neurosurgeons in the world. After a careless mistake, Strange finds himself in a catastrophic accident which renders him permanently unable to perform surgery. Distraught and desperate for a cure, he travels the world in search of aid. Stumbling upon the secret of the mystic arts, Strange encounters the Ancient One (Tilda Swinton) and begins training under her. When a previous student arises to summon a dark force, Doctor Strange finds himself on an unexpected journey through a new side of the world.Exploring the mystic corners of the MCU, Doctor Strange introduces new characters, concepts, and rules in a captivating and creative manner. Though it has a lot to show off, there are no moments where viewers should feel lost or confused and the marvelous ideas are cleverly established. Strange's story is compelling, easily allowing audiences to connect to his flawed, but noble character. The journey he endures is riveting and unique, which keeps the long-running MCU saga fresh and exciting. Conquering the common superhero climax of similarly powered duels, Doctor Strange utilizes a very eccentric finale.Mastering the role of a snarky and charismatic leader, Cumberbatch captures one of the MCU's most charming roles since Phase One. Though not heavily featured in this adventure, Wong (Benedict Wong) steals the show when he pops up. His dry humor and amusing intellect made him one of the most memorable side characters in the MCU. As a druidical duo, the two sorcerers form a delightful and investable relationship.Focusing on its main character, the film weakly develops most of its side characters. Heavily underutilized, Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen) ends up as one of the MCU's most forgettable villains, which is quite a long list. Lacking any real romantic entanglements, Dr. Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) acts as Doctor Strange's closest friend, but is barely given screentime and fails to make an impact. Unfortunately, the supporting cast isn't given enough usage to fully develop or feel utilized to their full potential.Producing a visual experience, Doctor Strange leads audiences into an awe-inspiring world. Developing one of the most visually dynamic comic book movies, the studio passionately designed the world, abilities, and characters. In a genre that often gets stereotyped as 'two guys punching' Doctor Strange creatively introduces one of the most astounding aspects of the MCU.Opening up to a new corner of its ever-growing universe, the MCU creates magic with Doctor Strange. The film crafts an enjoyable origin story, on par with its fellow in-universe partners. Forgetting about its side characters, Doctor Strange succeeds in developing its titular role and utilizes incredible visuals while crafting his spellbinding journey.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Yet Another Marvel Mess,"Even though Disney bought Marvel you should not attribute this rubbish to them! I can not remember when the last decent Marvel film was out in the cinemas but this should definitely be on the 'do not watch' list along with Avengers Age Of Ultron, and Guardians Of The Galaxy. There are at least one or two more but I can't think of the names of them right now! The characters are all exceedingly bland, I felt nothing for any of them. Not one is really all that memorable. The all-powerful The Ancient One wasn't powerful enough to stop pages from a spell book being stolen at the start of the film so not quite so all-powerful. Strange, after a car accident/crash joins a mystical retreat to learn how to use his hands again because he supposedly can't use them. Before going and finding the retreat he tries shaving but can't do that yet he can use his hands for everything else! The other characters are all secondary and lesser to Doctor strange and because the character, like the plot and the story(line) has so little to it, the film is padded out with stupidly long interdimensional fight scenes that make the film really confusing as there is no reason and no explanation for them. They just happen.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
This is not just a movie. This is an experience.,"Do you remember the scene when Ariadne folds the Paris city in 2010 'Inception'? If yes, and you think that scene was breathtaking, watch 'Doctor Strange'. You'll find plenty more of such effects and these scenes are super-breathtaking.Some major parts of the movie were shot in my hometown (Kathmandu, Nepal). Except for the scenes of Swayambhunath, Pashupatinath and some places, even I could not recognize the locations. Maybe because they were recreated with special effects and the result was superb. It is a matter of pride for us, when a big budget Hollywood movie chooses Nepali Architecture for their set. I am glad, I got to see it and experience it. Thanks for the whole movie team.Story-wise, the movie seems average. The movies with the similar story are in abundance. But I know, those similar movies may never have special effects as good as this. How often do you get to see the whole street rotate? How often do you get to see the elements of the building constantly moving during the fight scene? How often do you get to see the city split, travel in fourth dimension? How often do fantasy and sci-fi blend so well that we have to find a new word for it?The effects are executed very well. One might not enjoy it in small screen but while it's still playing in the theatres, 'Doctor Strange' is a must watch. Don't miss the chance to experience it.

I'm so glad they changed the generic Ancient One in to something unique by casting her; she was spectacular!The dialogues were brilliant! The perfect balance of wisdom, darkness and humour which reflects the overall tone of the movie. Honestly, I can't get over how well written and delivered they were; the Ancient One's lines specifically were the highlights of the movie!And last but certainly not the least, I really have to applaud Marvel for exploring themes such as those of coping with injury and dealing with loss & grief. They addressed similar themes in Civil War as well as the Iron Man trilogy. It's so refreshing to have something like that happening simultaneously with the usual moral themes of hero movies.

dumbed down safe for 8 year olds,"Ah what a shame, this had the makings of a great film, perhaps the best of the Marvel Universe. The acting is superb, absolutely first class, special mention to Benedict Cumberbatch, who created a believable Dr. Strange. All the actors on top form, in fact without the acting this film would have been a flop. So what's the problem? it missed opportunities in the script to add depth to the story, it felt edited to hell, dumbed down safe for 8 year olds to watch. If the script writer reads this, then why was there not a shot for a few minutes of Dr. Strange being tempted to return to his old life, back to normal or continue and be a superhero. Why was a few minutes not spent emphasizing he was a playboy hot shot surgeon, a flash car and apartment does not cut it, why was a few minutes flashing out the bad guy played by a very underused brilliant actor Mads Mikkelsen why a few minutes not showing avenger(s) in the big boss fight scene being helpless but needing Dr.Strange. It just needed a bit more work, an extra 10 mins would have given much more depth to the characters. There is one HUGE plot hole, just suffice to say someone takes a lot of effort to get something when another person just walks in and gets it. Too much special effects, copy from inception, loses then the action whats going on.

Exactly What You'd Expect - Unfortunately,"Doctor Strange is THE quintessentially generic Marvel comic-book film. It executes the established formula with mechanical precision. The origin. The early training. The villain. The gratuitous quips. The evolution of The Costume. The Earth-shattering finale. It's all there.This makes for a fun film, but not a great one. What Doctor Strange really lacks is *strangeness.* The truly original vision that Steve Ditko brought to comics in the 1960s (and which numerous other creators have built on, over the years). The early plots were hokey, maybe, but they were original. The look and feel and concept of the comics was unusual, bizarre, like nothing that had gone before. It was that unique sense of style that set Doctor Strange comics apart.Doctor Strange, the film, is devoid of any style of its own. As the trailers correctly intimated, the visuals are largely swiped from Inception, and do absolutely nothing to capture the Ditko world of demented alternate dimensions. The look of the film is glossy and modern, where it should be bizarre and scary.The often-annoying Cumberbatch is actually not bad as Stephen Strange - but he's also not particularly good. He's really the same guy as Robert Downey's Tony Stark. Both of whom could easily be older Peter Parkers. He's yet another Generic Action Guy, laughing nervously in the face of cosmic dangers. Even though Doctor Strange was the one Marvel hero who was truly devoid of humor. His was a grim world of sorcery, not of levity, but of endless study and utter devotion to forbidden arts. There's none of that in this film.Doctor Strange is certainly worth seeing as two hours of light diversion. It's well-made and satisfying in its own terms. But coming after a decade of Marvel adaptations, it's also utterly forgettable. And a cosmic let-down to anyone who had any love for the original material. It's probably just about what Steve Ditko would have feared Hollywood would do to his work.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Doctor is in...real in,"Doctor Strange is another Marvel superhero I've heard of, but am largely unfamiliar. However, given the studios recent track record, the intriguing trailers, and Benedict Cumberbatch in the starring role, I've been salivating in anticipation of seeing this film.WARNING: Anyone prone to or sensitive to motion sickness may want to forgo seeing this in 3D (especially IMAX 3D) or at least pop a Dramamine prior to viewing.First things, first. The visual effects in this movie are simply amazing and lend themselves to IMAX 3D if you can handle it. I'll say they're along the lines of Inception although I haven't actually watched that movie. I admit, the opening sequence gave me a little tummy trouble, but fortunately I soon adapted and was able to submerge myself and enjoy the film. The idea of a new twist on reality takes new meaning and boggles the mind.Secondly, the cast is perfect.Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One? What a badass and a delight to watch. She's one of those actors I normally don't think of until I happen to see her in something, then can't be more thrilled with her performance.Mads Mikkelsen, still gives me chills from his take as Hannibal Lecter from the defunct NBC series Hannibal and again delivers as our baddie Kaecilius. Brilliant, talented, but oh so misguided. Looking forward to seeing him in Rogue One.Ahhh, Benedict Cumberbatch. I count myself among the Cumber...well I'll go with Collective for the sake of this review and my fandom just went up another notch with his portrayal of the title character, Dr. Stephen Strange. Brilliant, egotistical, talented, and let's face it a bit of an a-hole, Cumberbatch's journey from the top of the world/his profession to the lowest depths of the gutter is a roller coaster of emotion and a pure joy to watch unfold. The man was born to play this part.Third, the writing. Once again the folks at Marvel have created a dramatic, engaging, action packed, funny three dimensional story that just also happens to have the fantastical elements of magic and superheroes. This is one of those films if you lose the fantasy elements actually still works as a story. So, even if you aren't a fanboy/fangirl of comics and superheroes the story resonates and you will enjoy. And if you are a fanboy/girl you'll enjoy the ride even more.I've got to go all in on this M.C. Escheresque thrill ride and give this one an around the world and back snap. A ten in my book. Don't wait, definitely see this one on the big screen, IMAX 3D if you can.One last word of CAUTION: STAY until the very end of the credits. As is Marvel's modus operandi there are not one, but two additional scenes in the closing credits. Don't gyp yourself by missing them.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doesn't quite reach that Marvel brilliance,"The fourteenth film of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and the one where they most unambiguously try to bring magic into their existing universe. In this movie Benedict Cumberbatch plays Dr. Stephen Strange, a renowned neurosurgeon who must set out on a journey after a car crash ruins his hands. This will eventually end up with him discovering the existence of the mystic arts, or magic if you prefer.The movie contains pretty much everything we've come to expect from Marvel films. Absolutely, phenomenally gorgeous visuals, which in this particular case are especially noteworthy, because they take the reality bending aspect of magic and really play with it. Think Inception, only even more kaleidoscopic. Granted, sometimes the visuals are a tad busy, but most of the time they're simply gorgeous.We also get great actors, good humour and a villain that could have been better. Exactly what most of the Marvel movies have been all about. But in this case I found myself noticing the story formula a bit too much. It felt like the movie was simply going through motions, giving us the old, trusted, tested and patented Marvel story. I felt myself missing something new, something exciting, a twist on the old pattern. But it never came.The second big problem I have with the movie is that the magic is actually pretty boring. What I mean by that, is that it makes sense that Stephen Strange only has a few tricks and spells in his repertoire. He's only starting out. But the villain, one of the most powerful magic users on Earth, uses the exact same tricks, with very little variation. Sure there's the dark power he's drawing, and some of the magic users have different magical artefacts, but it still felt stale, unimaginative. Elemental attacks, summoning creatures, mind control, invisibility, transmuting the terrain to your advantage, the list goes on. None of this is seen in the film. It's just blasting coloured lights and teleporting most of the time. Allows for some good kung fu fighting, certainly, but does not come close to being what it should be.That being said, the ending is a huge exception to the issue above. It's creative, set up well in advance, makes sense for Strange's character and is simply entertaining as well as visually interesting.All in all, for me Doctor Strange falls on the lower end of the scale when it comes to MCU movies. It is certainly a good film in its own right, but doesn't quite match the splendour of its predecessors.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The story,while a bit lacking in spots,was intriguing.Kaecilius was a passable villain.I had a problem with the runtime,a mere 115 minutes.Benedict Cumberbatch was the perfect actor for the role of the arrogant Stephen Strange.There was some great humor.The action scenes,supported by the effects,did not fail to thrill.The supporting characters were good as well.This movie,while not without its problems,was thoroughly entertaining.Congratulations to the team behind Doctor Strange for this amazing effort.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Doctor Strange: Marvel's Greatest Film Yet! Bring The Whole Family!,"It's not everyday that a film is released that will bend the will of visual effects with a blend of an amazing story line. From the moment the film started, I knew that I was in for a once in a lifetime experience. It's not hard to understand that Marvel can take any property and make it into gold, but Doctor Strange seemed to be the one that I was skeptical for.I'm a big fan for the character, but I disregarded my love for the character when it was time to critique. Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect representation of the character. Reading comics after watching the film, I truly heard his voice in my head. He gives the character the needed love from an actor. Many felt the casting choice for Tilda Swinton was morally wrong due to her not being Asian. I didn't felt that she took away from the movie at all.This film sets up the future of the MCU in new ways that will absolutely blow your mind away. If your family doesn't have anything to do, do yourself a favor and see this movie. My biggest problem with the film is the Inception like scenes as seen in the trailer because I know many cannot handle that magnitude visuals. This does not take away from the film which I absolutely enjoyed. It wasn't overused, and that is the magic that Marvel put into Doctor Strange. The high rating is real. This film is absolute gold. I find that this is the best Marvel film since Spiderman 2.The villain, Kaecilius, was a wonder to watch. He is a perfect blended character. You will totally disregard this character from the comics if you follow with the Doctor Strange comics. This is the best villain yet! You will understand while watching the film, but please do yourself a favor and get the prequel comic. I know it's become a way for Marvel and DC to make more money, but this comic will make you think after the movie.This is Marvel showcasing that they have plenty of more options to play with after the next Avengers movie, and it's spectacular. Marvel is something special, but now it's more than special: it's genius. Many theorize the downfall or the over-saturation of superhero films, but this proves that Marvel is staying fresh. I repeat this: Take your family! The kids will be in awe. Doctor Strange will become the next big thing for Marvel, and it's not a joke!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Its outstanding special effects can't elevate the picture past its poor storytelling and inconsistent tone.,"The visuals are undoubtably fantastic, leading to some very unique action set-pieces that have enough style to set them apart from other superhero films, and its outstanding soundtrack is one of the best of the MCU. It's a shame, then, that the story and tone of 'Doctor Strange' drag it down to be one of the worst films of the Marvel cinematic universe. Stephen Strange is an unlikeable protagonist, one who we can never root for, and this means that the audience doesn't really have any reason to care about the story. Also, the narrative is very predictable and the film doesn't have a proper grasp on time; the 'training montage' is over very quickly and because there is no indication of how much time has passed, it seems as if Strange has gone from a nobody to the sorcerer supreme in mere days. Therefore, it feels entirely unbelievable that Strange can masterfully use his powers and save the world by the end of this film. Throughout the picture, Strange should have been struggling to use his powers, indicating to the audience that he is still learning and developing over time. Another big issue with the movie is its ham-fisted attempts at comedy. It is never funny, yet its 'humour' is always prevalent, even undermining serious moments on several occasions, and this becomes extremely annoying. Sure, a few comedic moments wouldn't have gone amiss, but since the character of 'Doctor Strange' isn't a funny one, this film should have had more of a focus on its serious elements and getting them to be successful. Without its superb visual elements and soundtrack, this could have been a disaster. 6/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Strange,"""Stephen Strange"" (Benedict Cumberbatch) is a brilliant neurosurgeon who is involved in a terrible car accident. Frustrated by his new-found limitations he travels to the Himalayas where he is schooled in the mystic arts by Tilda Swinton. Together with her associate ""Mordo"" (Chiwetel Ejiofor) they must learn to work to thwart the ambitions of ""Kaecilius"" and his henchmen who are serving the powerful ""Dormammu"" who wishes to destroy the three Sanctums on the Earth that protect humanity from his dominance. It does take a while to get going this, and Cumberbatch's accent takes some getting used to, but once the period of initiation and learning is underway, we are presented with a well paced, magical adventure film that marries a decent script with some gorgeous visual effects, a slightly more cerebral storyline and leaves us in no doubt that this is just the first instalment for this developing super-hero. Cumberbatch grows into the role, and Swinton is effective as his slightly ethereal mentor. It comes in at the slightly shorter end of the MCU movies spectrum, and that's a good thing too.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Feels like it was written by an algorithm,"Watching Doctor Strange is a strange experience indeed, as all the pieces plugged in to tell the story feel borrowed by some Marvel scripting AI from other Marvel movies but are never quite brought to life in their own right. It's an origin story void of joy and not emotionally moving in the least, as Cumberbatch's conceited surgeon gets knocked off his high horse, only to be hoisted right back onto it for little discernible reason other than a forgettable side character sputtering that ""he's special."" The character growth is not believable or engrossing in the least. I was literally able to predict dialogue before it came out of the characters' mouths.The Big Baddie is about as generic as they come, and Rachel McAdams and Michael Stuhlbarg are wasted as two other characters with no inner life of their own. Instead they exist solely to prop up a protagonist while still somehow managing not to add value to his ""hero's journey"" in the least.I saw this film nearly two years into the pandemic and long after its release. Maybe hype around its release weekend buoyed its reception? Hard to tell. It does not stand up well.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

The Infinite Possibility,"In ""Doctor Strange"" The Ancient One played by Tilda Swinton implores Stephen Strange played by Benedict Cumberbatch, who suffers to save his very soul, ""Surrender, Stephen."" Stephen must surrender to not knowing anything. Only then, can he begin to reclaim his power and his life. This is an awesome surprise. Director Scott Derrickson's ""Doctor Strange"" is about transformation in the guise of an action movie, done with a sense of humor. Cumberbatch's Strange invents himself when the old definition of himself no longer works, and in fact is killing him. This invention is perhaps, the most noble of human pursuits. Capturing the poignancy with a sense of humor and ""Beyonce'"" jokes possesses an enlightened sensibility. ""Doctor Strange"" aspires for the heavens and never takes itself too seriously.Acknowledge Derrickson, Jon Spaihts and C. Robert Cargill for writing the brilliant story based on the comic book by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko. Signatures of the 1960's comic book materialize in the mind-bending psychedelic visuals. The ""Doctor Strange"" comics debuted during the time of Timothy Leary and the consciousness expansion movement. This ""Doctor Strange"" is visually masterful. With the folding metropolis visuals, and M.C. Escher generated mazes, Derrickson one ups Christopher Nolan's ""Inception"". His story is homage to the hero origin of Nolan's ""Batman Begins"". The exquisite martial arts sequences remind of the grace of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and the fluidity of ""The Matrix"". ""Doctor Strange"" is still uniquely its own about powerful sorcerers defending the world from mystical threats on infinite planes of existence. Here this is done sans drugs, happily.Cumberbatch and Swinton have profound magic together. Marvel is astounding in choosing amazing actors, who transcend the medium with grace and humanity. Even with spectacular showcase battles of good and evil, the best scene occurs in the New York emergency room with Strange and The Ancient One. The Ancient One touchingly tells Strange what she sees beyond his arrogance and fear. I was in tears with the resolve. Noble ideas and powerful actors truly make ""Doctor Strange"" special.Much has been discussed about casting Swinton as The Ancient One, originally written as an Asian character. I am Japanese American, aware of the sensitivity of the issue. I think Swinton is the best actor cast, and she delivers the message of nobility in all of us.""Doctor Strange"" has somewhat of a trite beginning. Trite in the sense that we see the possibility of the world class jerk becoming the selfless hero. Dr. Stephen Strange is the brilliant egotistical neurosurgeon caught up in his own celebrity. He is handsome, rich, and virtually immortal. His arrogance alienated his true love Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams), a courageous ER doctor. McAdams is amazing; her Christine allows us to see the good man in Strange beneath it all. Unfortunately, she isn't leveraged more. She has a heartbreaking scene with Strange, whose self pity destroys all.Strange suffers a devastating car accident resulting in irreparable nerve damage to his hands. His career is over. His definition of himself is no longer. Having exhausted all surgical and rehabilitation avenues, Strange seeks out Jonathan Pangborn (solid Benjamin Bratt). Pangborn was a paraplegic, who miraculously cured himself. He instructs Strange to learn from The Ancient One in Kamar-Taj in Nepal. Strange travels to Kathmandu. He befriends Mordo (charismatic and calm Chiwetel Ejiofor), a powerful sorcerer warrior. He accompanies Stephen to The Ancient One, who is Sorcerer Supreme—protector of our realm from dimensional evil. The Ancient One sees possibility in Stephen, but his biggest obstacle is himself.The Ancient One's best disciple Kaecilius (dangerous Mads Mikkelsen) has gone rogue, murdering his own and stealing a page from the magic book of Elders. The spells empower him to control time and serve the omnipotent Dormammu. Kaecilius is ruthless; however, he is a compelling villain in that his motives are laced with worthy intentions. The Ancient One may have also compromised herself in the battle of good and evil. ""Doctor Strange"" is about the Yin and Yang of the universes. Strange accepts the greater good and the consequences. His dear friend and protector Mordo can only see the dark and light. Balance lies in compassion and acceptance. There is no Yin and Yang in the extremes which is prophetic.""Doctor Strange"" is a great movie. Michio Kaku said that there may be infinite number of universes, much like the Multiverse of ""Doctor Strange"". There is both wonder and comfort in this. The Ancient One saw infinite possibility in Stephen Strange. Perhaps ""Doctor Strange"" asks us see the infinite possibility within ourselves.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Best Movie Of This Year So Far,"Generally I am not the kind of person that gets really excited for heroes movie (yet I have watched each heroes movie of this year) and it is sort of weird to me getting excited as I used to in my childhood for a movie like this. The last comic/heroes movie that I really loved was Wacthmen back in 2009, so you can trust me, this is a really good one.GOOD THINGS:-This movie explains clearly how this part of the MCU works (the magic and stuff).-It shows us the complete profile so far of the Dr. Stephen Strange. So far, because certain things need to happen that will turn the Doctor into a real guardian of the magic world.-The effects are awesome.BAD THINGS:-The time-line of the MCU is having problems, since Dr. Strange was mentioned in other movies when wasn't magician yet.-There is not good villain for this movie, but I think this is not totally wrong since it would be a lot for one movie.-Too much jokes, and I am not saying that jokes are bad or something. I just believe MARVEL needs a joke filter for his movies because in this one some jokes weren't adequate.In general is a really awesome movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Good (but can be better),"Nice film, original concept and out of the box kind of thinking.I personally like these eastern medicine/philosophy kind of stories where you see there is an ""other"" way not necessarily familiar and known to all.I like Mr. Benedict Cumberbatch as an actor and I've seen him in far better roles. I'm not sure this film managed to develop his full potential (both as actor and as character). Maybe there was not enough time for this.However enough with this, speaking of time... I lost the time perspective of the story. W/o telling more about what has happened in the film - I'd like simply to say - I have no bloody idea how long he was mastering his skills. At some point he just... became really good. My understanding is it happened rather quickly. Targeting the 17 or lower age they made a huge focus on the potentially attractive 3D scenes (fights, chasing and city-building concept type the Matrix...). In a nutshell - not bad to kill time, but nothing special and definitely below my expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
my opinion of doctor Stephen strange.,"the movie is the best movie i ever have seen, everything fits (the right move on the right cue) and the overlap from medical drama to ancient Asian to inception was for me the right move. the actors Benedict cumberbatch as doctor strange was a excellent choice, I see him perhaps join the avengers for infinity war and get all credit for (spoiler alert for avengers infinity war) defeat thanos. the bad guy portrayed by Mads Mikkelsen, sometimes cheesy but in the last moments of the movie he reaches his highest point. (remember this is my opinion, could be different for anyone else) now the special effects: to get all out of it you have to see the movie in the cinema in 3D. but they are all perfect edited into the movie. one more thing: be on the look out for Stan lee's cameo.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel Film with a difference,"First off I'm going to start by saying I'm not a huge fan of magic & mysticism but wanted to see the origin of Doctor strange after watching Avengers etc. So with that in mind I thought it was better than I expected. Cumberbatch is literally Dr Strange , don't think they could of casted it any better there.As for the film itself , I thought it was weird and wonderful in the right ways.

"Excellent acting, story and special effects !","I think this one of the best ( or probably the best ) marvel movie I have ever watched until now.The story is about a gifted doctor (with a huge ego) that tries to find a cure for himself after a terrible accident. While he tries to find the cure, he is actually finding himself and the mysteries of the universe.I like this movie because it has great special effects ( in fact, this effects reminded me a little bit about matrix and inception, but only better!) also all the cast worked amazing with their acting. The story is also different from other marvel stories, since it digs a little bit about the true meaning of life and why we are here in this world, in this universe ( which I liked) and also it has great fights !...PS.

Never in the course of movie did I feel or make out an Visual effect mistake...it was perfect. After Nolans Inception this one made me satisfied with CGI. Nice editing and direction. Great casting, every actor made justice to the movie. I would watch it again to find if any flaws in graphics. But you never know they may surprise me. Definitely its in my top 100 list.Though I am a DC fan, Marvel is surprising me with the movie making part.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"""Doctor Strange""-  Just a ton of fun.  It may not be the best of Marvel's filmography, but it's still an undeniably great time.","Though fundamentally a standard superhero origin story, Marvel's latest offering is another winning entry in the ever-growing saga thanks to its awe-inspiring visuals and direction, fantastic performances and an all- encompassing sense of pure fun that simply cannot be denied. Director Scott Derrickson's ""Doctor Strange"" is pure magic on- screen. While it may occasionally succumb to the old clichés and tropes, this cannot stop the fact that i'ts just a great time at the movies, and another example of Marvel doing what it does best- giving us good, fun films.Co-written with former Spill.com alum C. Robert Cargill and John Spaihts, Derrickson successfully translates one of Marvel's more colorful and ""out-there"" characters in a very solid and admirable way, grounding the story in the same sort-of tonal aesthetic that ties all of the other films together while simultaneously injecting new elements into the franchise. The result is one of the most wonderfully mind- bending films of the season, and I cannot recommend it enough to audiences looking for a great times at the movies.We follow Dr. Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), a brilliant surgeon but also an arrogant and deliciously egotistical jerk, who is unfortunately maimed in a terrible car accident one night. With extensive nerve- damage that robs him of his ability to work, he becomes a depressed wreck, eventually seeking out the aid of mystical Eastern healing when all other hope seems lost. He eventually comes across ""The Ancient One"" (Tilda Swinton), an ages-old spiritual leader, who offers to help him learn how to harness the power of mind and spirit to become a real- life sorcerer. However, soon enough, his training will be put to the test, as he must align himself with allies (including Mordo, as played by Chiwetel Ejiofor and former flame Christine, as played by Rachel McAdams) to battle a devious force known as Kaecilius (Mads Mikkelsen), who seeks to bring about an apocalyptic evil force from the dark dimensions beyond our own.Cumberbatch is just perfect as the good doctor, injecting a wonderful dry wit and a highly entertaining sense of sarcasm while also still being able to ground Strange in a minor sense of tragedy. In a sense, he may initially remind you of Tony Stark back in the original ""Iron Man"" from 2008, but Cumberbatch makes sure to make the role his own without simply delivering a retread of what's come before- this is very much the ""arrogant man learns humility"" story... but it's fresh and unique and Cumberbatch is a joy. Swinton and Ejiofor are fantastic as the teachers who train strange in the art of sorcery and magic, and both add a great sense of class and gravitas to the proceedings. Especially Swinton, who as always plays her role to perfection. Despite having limited screen time, McAdams is great fun as a riff on the idea of the love interest, but with a clever twist- this isn't a story about her and Strange falling in love, but a story about a former couple who slowly learn to forgive each other for their shortcomings. Mads Mikkelsen is an adequately threatening villain, and his presence adds a lot of threat to his sequences, though I cannot comment too much on his role, as, well... much like the other Marvel movies, the villain here is more of an afterthought. Still, Mikkelsen is a good adversary, under-developed though he may be.The big thing that really sets the film apart is the beautiful visual work and the good sense of pacing and structure. Derrickson, mostly known for his lower-budget work in horror, really pushes the film to (and sometimes beyond) the limit in the best of ways. Along with his co-writers, he crafts a tale that twists boundaries of how we perceive the world and the idea of ""magic."" There's some incredible work done that plays with the idea of multiple dimensions and astral projection that was just incredible to witness, and the well-advertises sequences where the very fabric of the world is bent were mind-blowing. A prolonged chase sequence in the film's second act might have been the single most creative and breathtaking scene of action I've seen since last year's wonderful ""Mad Max: Fury Road"", and shows how digital effects can be properly utilized to show us things we've never seen before. I honestly cannot wait to see it again.The script is also a blast and it has a great kinetic movement and build. There's never a dull moment, and it keeps the laughs and thrills coming at a mile-a-minute while also giving just enough time to deliver the appropriate beats of character and story development. Though it does start to just hit the standard beats at times, it has such a good sense of personality that made me all the more forgiving for the occasional cliché they had to throw in. There's some good, solid writing here and I hope the team stays on the inevitable sequel.All in all, I'm exceptionally pleased by how well ""Doctor Strange"" turned out. It may not be Marvel's best release and it does occasionally falter with predictable twists and turns, but the good humor, fantastic performances, solid writing and stunning direction more than make up for it. And I can't wait to see more of this character in future films.I give ""Doctor Strange"" a very good 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"Very well done, immensely enjoyable","The big difference between Marvel Studio productions of Marvel characters, and the other studios that do Marvel characters, is that Marvel Studios get it and do a really great job.Benedict Cumberbatch initiates his role with a superb presentation of the egotistical, narcissistic and arrogant Stephen Strange. Rather than the evolution of the character being, as so many are, instant transformation, Cumberbatch's Strange demonstrates the ongoing battle with his inner unlikeable self and the person he will become.While there was much uproar with the casting of Tilda Swinton as The Ancient One, if you can drop the default from canon argument, she does her usual high quality work.The story remains interesting and moves along at a good pace. While there is no dearth of kaleidoscopic CGI effects, the effects do not dominate the film. It is also filled with a number of truly funny moments. For Marvel fans, who know the Marvel pantheon, there are plenty of Easter eggs, but unlike some films they do not splatter into your face, one needs to be on the game to catch them all.I really enjoyed the movie, as did my spouse who is not a superhero movie person at all. She doesn't care for Cumberbatch generally but gave him high marks for his acting. The Mordo character was well played, but more could have been done with him to increase the overall dimensionality of the film. The Mads Mikkelsen character well played well was a bit flat, and that was a bit sad, as Mikkelsen has much more capability than was leveraged in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

"The Mystical Side of Comic Book Lore Brought To Life, Right Before Our Very Eyes","I'll be honest with you. Never, even in my wildest dreams, did I ever expect to see a character like Doctor Strange in the MCU. Just thinking about the scope of the worlds he inhabits, made me believe that this was a character that just wasn't feasible for a live action adaptation. I thought that even if they did introduce Strange into the MCU, he'd be a grounded character and confined to this universe alone, reduced to only doing Scarlet Witch 'hand wavy' magic (which tbh, looks pretty good).Boy, was I wrong.This movie is a game changer. Casual fans, or the general movie going audience might not realize the implication this film has on the entire landscape of the MCU. We now know that a Multiverse exist. Beings that are too 'spoilerific' to be mentioned here, have been watching over this universe. A vast plethora of villains and heroes of insurmountable strengths are, now suddenly, a possibility. Even crossovers from characters outside the MCU, can now be fit into the existing universe without any break or discrepancy in the continuity of the MCU. (I wouldn't hold my breath for that, but then again, Spider-Man happened)OK, now that that's out of the way, let's talk about the movie itself. First off, what a cast. Give the casting guy a freaking medal, because EVERYBODY'S performance was so on point. Benedict is Doctor Strange. Period. Tilda Swanson, Mads Mikkelsen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benadict Wong and McAdams were all great.The story was a classic redemption, self discovery story, peppered with the trademark Marvel humor and quips, we've come to love and expect from each film the studio releases. One of my favorite characters in the film was actually The Cloak of Levitation. It's the JARVIS to Strange's Tony Stark. But the real high point in the story was in the third act. It diverged from the usual stock 'Blue beam shooting up into the sky' block buster ending. Instead, it offered something innovative, fresh and pretty damn imaginative.Speaking of imagination, I think now's the appropriate time to mention the real star of the film. THE VISUALS. OH MY GOD. Watching Strange drift, whiz and fly through the Multiverse was like watching a painting in motion. The movie was full of breathtaking, sensory overloading, majestic and highly impacting scenes, that just left you dangling off of the edge of your seat. Really, the only way to watch this film is in IMAX 3D. No other way about it. The fight scenes were well choreographed and the film itself was beautifully shot. Scott Derrickson, take a bow, sir. You deserve all the praise you've been getting.In closing, I'd like to say this. Doctor Strange was my most anticipated film of this year. Yes, even more that Civil War (This is coming from the biggest Spidey fan ever), or BvS, or even Deadpool for that matter. Simply because of the cast, director and the world building opportunity this film could provide to the MCU. And I'm ecstatic to say, that it did not disappoint. This is my favorite comic book movie of the year, and one of my favorite comic book movies of all time. Thank you, to everyone involved.Ratings:As a regular movie goer: 9/10As a fan: 1,000,000/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

I'm not sure what the young people see in these movies. The special effects weren't even special because they were not possible to begin with. The first ten minutes was the best ten minutes of the movie. Please folks don't waste your time on this movie. If you're like me you'll come away and say what was that mess I just watched. Go rent or buy Hacksaw Ridge and enjoy a great two hours.,4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Magnificently absurd,"A magnificent movie brimming with beautiful absurdity. This marvel movie succeeds in such a spectacular way by not being a marvel movie. The careful, delicate and different direction and cinematography blend so well with what is the most unique marvel stories brought to film. The concepts are brilliant and brilliantly executed, both creatively and atmospherically. Cumberbatch plays his character so well and helps to guide this plot forward in a way only Benidict can do. All and all the strange and the weird become so wonderful and beautiful in this movie that one could almost forget the over-arching plot line, if it weren't that this also was well- executed and had a fun twist. My verdict is watch it. Watch it now.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A Black Comedy on Superhero films!,"Doctor Strange is the same superhero movie that we've seen a thousand times, but different. The sense of humour in it makes it a little bit different and something new.I have not enjoyed a superhero movie in a long time so much that I didn't liked it, but this one I loved watching it. It was an easy going movie and not tiring at all. Like a 20-minute comedy episode.I've noticed that Benedict couldn't shake Sherlock off. If it wouldn't have been for the suit, hair and beard and the costume with an American accent, you'd see Sherlock all over it. Which is not necessarily a bad thing cause I enjoyed it, but if I see it in his next movies enough I might stop following his filmography.The script is the same but is a satirical black comedy making fun of superhero movies and all those great moments that the superhero realizes his power and the music starts, the wind is blowing and his pilgrim is flying.... and then it's ruined (haha). It was a refreshing thing to see the fun side of being a superhero.But if we take it as a serious one then it has gone in a completely different direction. I would have liked it had the movie been darker, but I don't really know if that could have worked.Also the romance is out here, only a light touch (not too much), just enough so the audience can see a soft side of the man with the pressure of the world in his arms. Rachel McAdams, no Notebook for you here.The modern-now-day cultural references to Eminem, Beyonce, Drake and what not show the fun side of the movie and keeping in track with ''present'' time as in other superhero films the character looks like he's not in touch with today and looks like he's a thousand years old. Shows that they're not savages.Overall it is worth it, if you wanna relax and have a drink, take your mind off a hard day's work ... this is a good recommendation.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Amazing introduction to the magical side of the MCU,"Doctor Strange was on my must-see list of 2016 movies. It lived up to the hype and my expectations of the newest MCU movie. I have to say that it's one of my favorite entries in the MCU. Everything about the movie was amazing. As always, Benedict Cumberbatch didn't disappoint me with his performance. He was perfect as the arrogant neurosurgeon turn magic user, Doctor Stephen Strange. The supporting cast was excellent as well. I liked Rachel McAdams, Benedict Wong, and Chiwetel Ejiofor were great as their respective characters. The main villain, Kaecillius, felt underused which is disappointing since they got a great actor like Mads Mikkelsen to play him. The best part of Doctor Strange was the visuals. They were beautiful. It was worth paying the extra money just to see the movie in 3-D. Doctor Strange is one of the few movies that wearing 3-D glasses actually enhanced my enjoyment of the movie besides The Avengers, Ant-Man, and of course, Avatar. Doctor Strange is now one of my favorite movies of 2016. I really loved seeing the character join the MCU. Can't wait to see more of the master of the mystic artes in the future. This movie is a must-see in 3-D.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Different in a good way,"As far as it goes for the marvel cinematic universe, I am pretty easily impressed. I have seen all of the movies and have thought that they were all really good (except for Thor: The Dark World, that one was not good at all to me). I walked into the theater for this movie knowing that I would probably be impressed once again, but when I walked out, I was going crazy about how good this really was. I will admit that it does follow the basic formula for the story that was made but it goes beyond that by providing amazing visuals and a really good performances from Benedict Cumberbatch. I knew he was an awesome pick for the part in the first place, but I did not expect him to play a character that could be more arrogant yet funny in the movie. The visuals were also astounding. Whenever there was an action scene in the movie, it was really cool to watch them fight using magic. Overall, while Doctor Strange may follow the basic MCU formula we have come to expect, it goes beyond that by having moments of humor, cool visuals, and good performances from Cumberbatch and the rest of the cast. In the end, it was different, but I mean that in the best of ways.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The Doctor Is In...,"The MCU's 14th film is quite a marvel...see what I did there? In what is undoubtedly their most visually engrossing film to date, Doctor Strange is a most welcome entry into Marvel's well established superhero stable.The Pros:The visual effects, while not perfect, are definitely the movie's strongest selling point. I've seen a lot of comparisons to Inception and yes, there are a few shots and moments that are reminiscent of that particular film's mind bending effects. However, trust me when I say this movie has enough visual flair to stand on its own. It's bright, colorful and overestimulating...but not in a bad way. The acting is pretty strong all around. Cumberbatch's American accent is solid enough and everyone else plays their roles earnestly. The action set pieces are mostly interesting. While some of the fight choreography leaves a bit to be desired, their overall execution definitely departs from the usual superhero beatdowns we're offered. There's a scene near the end that flips the climax on its ear and I think it was a great use of the film's main Macguffin.The Cons:While I can't fault Doctor Strange too much for following a tried and true hero formula, the movie does become a bit generic as it goes on. We've seen this story a million times. Granted, the visual storytelling in between the human moments is refreshing, but it isn't compelling enough to elevate the plot. The MCU's signature humor falls a bit flat this time around. There are a few genuine laughs, but the rest seems forced. There's also a problem here that's been consistent throughout the MCU's existence...weak villains. There's a big deal made about both Mads Mikkelsen's character and the real big bad in the movie and by the end, it's child's play. Granted, Mads gets to look cool and do some awesome things, but he's essentially reduced to a henchmen when the climax rolls around and doesn't pose much of a challenge. I will give kudos to the fact the main villain gets defeated in a clever manner, but it's a bit anticlimactic.So, what's the overall consensus? Definitely go see the movie. While it's nothing new and the effects aren't truly groundbreaking or breathtaking, it plays its cards well enough. There's enough cinematic magic to keep viewers interested and with a few tricks up its sleeve, it sprinkles in just enough flavor to separate itself from some of the pack.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel's New Movie is Pretty Strange,"""Death is what makes life worth living—knowing your days are numbered,"" said the Ancient One—oh and speaking of numbers, how about this one, $192 million Doctor Strange brought in over its first weekend released. Now Marvel has a knack for great casting, universe integration, special effects, and (of course) Stan Lee's cameo. As far as casting, Wowza, Benedict Cumberbatch once again nails it in a starring role; from a doctor with a 100% success rate to a lost cause with ever shaking hands—Benedict, like RDJ or (either) Chris, was Marvel's perfect choice. Integration is a necessity when it comes to the string of Marvel movies, and while the movie tells Dr. Strange's own story of growth into the hero everyone loves, and at the end: it introduces another infinity stone; gives a peak about where Dr. Strange will appear next; and essentially develops another villain Dr. Strange must come to terms with. As far as special effects go, well it wasn't quite what I expected, it was better! If mystical spells and a cape with a mind of its own weren't enough, how about rooms converging on themselves and entire cities becoming 20 drifting islands in the sky! And last but not least, Stan Lee, the man who made it all possible, had his own cameo (maybe not the same caliber as the Deadpool cameo) which was funny. All in all, Doctor Strange was another great movie to come from Marvel and let's all appreciate the universe they are trying to create beyond the comics.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

It's fun and entertainment is only skin deep.,"One wonders why Marvel, of all franchises, is in a rush?Super surgeon Doctor Stephen Strange has his towering ego dashed to the ground when he is in a terrible car accident that ruins both of his hands. Seeking any medical aid to restore his fame and fortune, Strange is directed to the mystical Ancient One, and from there his life is never the same again.Oh Marvel You really have audiences around your little finger now, don't you? You can make anything and people will come in droves. I am starting to wonder if the Marvel bubble won't so much burst as it will shrivel up in a slow, sad demise, if this latest installment is anything to go by.I had very high hopes for Doctor Strange. Marvel movies are starting to get formulaic, it is possibly the most famous criticism now, and what could be more of a gear change and shake up than removing all the techno-babble, shrinking suits and super serums and have magic instead. Mystical, spiritual energies, other dimensions; a melting pot of possibilities and quite likely the glue to a much bigger Cinematic Universe that can finally leap from our own world. With a strong actor playing a character who is the antithesis of all those things, how can it go wrong?They found a way.Director Scott Derrickson is more synonymous with horror films: The Exorcism of Emily Rose, Sinister and Deliver Us from Evil making for three of the five films he has directed. The film starting off with a near-silent scene in a mystical library, only to have a man beheaded by our film's stock villain Kaecilius (who is sure to join the ranks of forgotten Marvel villains) you might think that this is going to be a Marvel film with a different tone. Progress further still and we have some surprisingly drawn out and sober hospital surgery scenes, the first act climaxing with the doctor's accident.But then things take a turn for the Thor: Dark World. While Benedict Cumberbatch fits the role, as do the other actors (including Tilda Swinton, her character's Celtic origins literally explained in the script) the script is wooden and utterly forgettable. So much exposition and meaningless explanations was quite possibly the worst angle to approach this new dimension of the MCU. Even the humour seems forced at times.Surely the action is good? Sometimes. Remember the fight scenes in Batman Begins? The ones that are all elbows and mid-sections, without giving the audience a clue to what is happening? Yeah. Imagine that, only with energy weapons that dazzle lights everywhere. And the action is taking place on a Transformer. A Transformer the size of Manhattan.Don't get me wrong, the kaleidoscopic warping effects that dazzled in the trailer is great. For the first ten minutes. Inception pulled off rotating corridors and endless stairwells in two ways that Doctor Strange does not: by conserving the 'wow' moments, not splurging them all over the place constantly, and by using practical effects. Am I just getting old, or are people blind to shoddy CGI now? Both this and Civil War have had glaring problems with CGI. What takes me out of an experience? A bendy Benedict Computerbatch bouncing around harmlessly in rotating corridors and over floating platforms that do not exist.I felt really put out by Doctor Strange. Marvel's track record for ""origin stories"" is really high, but this feels more like the wayward and overconfident sequel. Elements are good, Cumberbatch is good; the first act is solid setup and gives old Sherlock a lot to work with. The costumes and set designs are decent. I can see these elements being used better in future Marvel films. The final reality-bending trick was cool too, despite being desensitized to it all by that point, and the gratefully small amount of tethering to the MCU was welcome too. Some nice little nods (like seeing the Avenger tower in the city skyline) that make it feel connected without needless cameos.But the pacing is a frightful mess. I didn't feel like the characters went through sensible transitions of development; the plot just took leaps when it needed to and the characters just accept things when they need to.It's fun and entertainment is only skin deep, and the future quality of Marvel Studios productions can be called into question.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Strangely Hypnotic,"Dr. Strange (RATING: ☆☆☆☆½ out of 5)  THIS FILM IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.   IN BRIEF: Stunning visuals elevate a good film to an excellent one.   GRADE: B+  SYNOPSIS: After a serious accident, an arrogant surgeon discovers a  much greater power on his road to recovery.  JIM'S REVIEW: Trippy! Far-out! Rad! Cool, dude! These dated expressions  of awe serve a purpose in describing the latest heady concoction known  from the Marvel factory, Dr. Strange.  Fate creates the man...the man being Dr. Stephen Strange (played to the  hilt by Benjamin Cumberbatch). Strange is an egotistical gifted surgeon  who befalls a serious car accident and seeks help on a more mystical  bent. Traveling to Nepal he meets Mordo, a trusty guide on his road to  find out. (Chiwetel Ejiofor, another talented actor who deserves a more  challenging role but still offers much class to his role.) Our hero  eventually connects with The Ancient One (a racially miscast but quite  enjoyable Tilda Swinton) for enlightenment of the mystic kind. This  oracle shows him the ins and outs of magic and healing while imparting  him superpowers and mind-game control (plus a nifty Cloak of  Levitation) to fight evil forces (with the help of terrific  state-of-the-art CGI).  Our superhero's journey to self-discovery takes over the majority of  the screen time before he does fly into kung-fu combat, as most Marvel  heroes do, following the formula of most action fantasies. His nemesis  is a worthy villain, Kaecilius (nicely played by Mads Mikkelsen), a  convert of The Ancient One who has conveniently gone off to the dark  side. The screenplay by C. Robert Cargill, Jon Spaihts, and the  director tries to keep predictability at a minimum and doesn't always  succeed, but he does develop his characters well with enough depth  without sacrificing the adrenaline rush that we has been accustomed to  expect from this genre.  While the film is continually creative and imaginative, it lacks some  originality in its story and visuals, owing other sci-fi predecessors,  specifically The Matrix Trilogy and Inception, big time, but director  Scott Derrickson masters his film's visuals astutely. There is much  eye-candy to behold and the action is non-stop thrilling. Probably no  more spectacular than a memorable soon-to-be-classic set piece  involving mirror images and buildings that effortlessly folding under  each other. This phantasmagorical origami lesson is a kaleidoscopic  marvel of CGI inventiveness. (M.C. Escher would be proud of this visual  op art of suspended architecture and other worldly structures on the  move. Even Hieronymus Bosch would smile wryly at the surrealism hinted  at elsewhere on display. The look of the film is truly a thing of  beauty. (See this movie in the IMAX 3-D format, if possible, for total  immersion.)  Benedict Wong and Rachel MacAdams offer fine support in minor roles.  But it is the strong production values that had this moviegoer  transfixed throughout this blockbuster pop entertainment spectacle. The  film is a remarkable technological achievement, a instant classic and  one of the best comic book superhero films ever. It wisely allows  strong character development, a clever narrative, and stunning action  sequences to merge effortlessly.  Marvel Studio's Dr. Strange does live up to its moniker. It is just  that...strangely hypnotic and a visceral marvel. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Strange a Cinematic Triumph,"I just returned from seeing Doctor Strange, staring Benedict Cumberbatch as a third- tier Marvel superhero who specializes in magical power. I have to say that these Marvel superhero movies seem to keep getting better and better. Who would have thought that someone could take a character virtually unknown beyond comic book fans and turn him into a cinematic triumph?Casting Cumberbatch to play the gifted but initially arrogant Strange was a masterstroke. Cumberbatch brought the same brilliance (but not the same personality) to the character of Doctor Strange that he's brought to Sherlock Holmes. With the help of his outstanding performance, the movie managed to achieve just the right balance of humor, action and personal drama—and yet, not the same balance as in, say, Avengers, Thor, Deadpool, or Guardians of the Galaxy. I both laughed and exclaimed in excitement repeatedly, and even got choked up once or twice.The movie made the best use of Industrial Light and Magic's (and other companies') special effects, giving us a heady and trippy brew of CGI and practical effects. I don't usually comment on movie special effects, except for, as in Iron Man 3, when the producers seem to forget that movies aren't about special effects, but the special effects in Doctor Strange really conveyed a perfect sense of the otherworldliness—or other dimensionality—of Doctor Strange's magical world that really enhanced to the movie, setting it apart from the other Avengers-related movies, despite occupying the same physical world.I have give kudos too to composer Michael Giacchino, who also wrote the scores for the three recent Star Trek films, Jurassic World, Mission: Impossible—Ghost Protocol, Fringe, and the upcoming Star Wars: Rogue One. Giacchino gave us what I think might possibly be the single best score for a Kevin Feige Marvel movie to date.I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great performances by Chiwetel Ejiofor as Mordo, Strange's mentor, and Tilda Swinton as the enigmatic Ancient One. Despite limited time, Rachel McAdams put in a sympathetic, appealing performance as Strange's one-time romantic partner and fellow surgeon, Christine Palmer. Benedict Wong contributed a nuanced if brief performance as, well, Wong, the stoic librarian of the library of magic. Benjamin Bratt, who's done wonderful and varied performances on TV in Private Practice, 24, and Modern Family, and as the voice of an alternate Superman in Justice League: Gods and Monsters, did yeoman's service as Jonathan Pangborn, a character with almost no screen time who the filmmakers added secretly at the last minute and who plays an important role to the future of the film franchise.The film contains one more brief but brilliant performance, but I won't spoil it for you except to say that you should definitely stick around for all of the film's closing credits. Doctor Strange was so good, in fact, that I'd recommend sticking around for the all of the film's closing credits at least twice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Doctor Sherlock Strange),"This movie is fast. First time I watched it - it looked like half an hour, maybe there is really some ""time trick"" in Doctor's Strange fashion)Well, essentially it is Ben's show. Nothing wrong with it. Benedict Cumberbatch is very charismatic, to watch him on screen is always fun. His witty remarks, Dr. House style) his irony and sarcasm, and still - probably to attract audience - his Sherlock persona put right into the character of Stephen Strange, all of this is magic)Yes this movie looks like a stand-alone show of Benedict Cumberbatch. But it is somehow justified by the plot - Stephen Strange was always sort of a diva, egocentric genius, who lived like all the universe was moving around his sun. And he never changed.Rachel McAdams was very nice in her role of a protective girlfriend and the only ally Strange had in his life. Her role of the only satellite in the lonely galaxy of Strange's life should not be underrated and she's very likable in this movie.So, good things are, to sum it up. First - Benedict Cumberbatch, going on with his Sherlock persona - I think everyone who watched the Sherlock show were laughing watching the scene with the collar)) and some others scenes as well)) Second - Rachel McAdams as a loyal,trusting and beautiful character, supporting Doctor Strange in a way like Cameron tried to help Doctor House.Third - Very witty script, and good directing.And still let us be honest. What would this movie be without Ben, his sparkling witty sarcastic remarks and good job of directing? Well... it would be essentially a B-movie. Special effects are impressive and yet a bit boring with the same ""wrap'em buildings"" style. First time watching it looks impressive, second time - not so. All attempts on bringing some ""ancient wisdom"" and rebirth of a man into a perfect character are not convincing. Personnaly. for me it was a very harsh treatment of a desperate man.Stiil , I like this movie) Not for special effects, not for some Eastern philosophy but for the character Ben's so wonderfully played) As a fan of Marvel's movies, I have this movie in my list of favourites with the Avengers and first three X-Men) There is magic there, Marvel's magic)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Action/Philosophy/Sci-Fi in one package! Wow!,"Without spoiling anything the movie challenges materialism in a way which I didn't think a film could achieve. It was neither nihilistic nor religious and that takes a good deal of creativity. What indeed lies beyond ""The Doors of Perception"" as Huxley wrote? The film is philosophical at times and pulls back from the seriousness with a lot of artistic action or wit. As one who sighs at the superstitious the introduction of the surreal in the film was more convincing than anything I've yet to see or read. Perhaps it was the film's artistic representation of a world being created fluidly, much like those ever shifting visuals one gets right before falling in a deep sleep. The only reason I would refrain from giving this movie a 10 was the good/evil story line was, for me, too simplistic. Strange was certainly interesting but the lesser characters seemed a bit too thrown together. Overall, superb.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
A deeper Marvel story...who knew.,"Some guy steals a book and tears some pages from it after killing some guys. It's Hannibal. As he makes his escape, the architect, I mean, a bald monk arrives and start flipping space horizontally and vertically, still, Hannibal escapes through some wormhole.Then we meet Dr. Strange a brilliant and supremely arrogant neurosurgeon who thinks he's brighter than he really is. While recklessly driving his Lambo he crashes and barely survives. His hands are trashed. A therapist tells him the story of a guy who was paralyzed but now is walking. The Dr. finds him and this guy tells him about Nanda Parbat, I mean, Kamar-Taj where he can undergo spiritual and physical healing.The Dr. travels to Nepal and starts asking about the place. He's trailed by some monk who eventually takes him there and right away introduces him to the Ancient One, a laughably miscast Tilda Swinton, who was the bald monk from the intro. The other monk, Mordo, is all for supporting the Dr. while Baldy realizes that his massive ego is in the way. She gives the Dr. some Eastern metaphysics lessons to no avail. When he's left no choice but to surrender, he finally develops the power to control energy. She also tells him about the order of things, namely, there are multiverses most of which are under the control of Parallax, I mean, Dormammu. Our multiverse is the last free one so there are temples in NY, London, and Honk Kong to protect the planet. And that is where Hannibal is heading.The pages Hannibal took give him the power to control time. The brilliant Dr. learns everything he can from the ashram's library, including things he shouldn't and with the eye of so-and-so he too controls time and envisions the missing pages. He also learns something interesting about Baldy. At one of the temples, a floating cape attaches to him and he he fights with Hannibal and his minions. Now a fully empowered Dr. and Mordo and the librarian head to the last temple where Dormammu is about to swallow the universe.Why has it taken so long for the Marvel/Disney mafia to release this story instead of cranking out the other ridiculous dressed-up goof movies by the dozen who knows. According to Baldy while the avengers fight in the physical plane, these monks fight in the astral plane, which is of course baloney because here too the fights are physical. The confrontation between Dr. and the colorful kaleidoscope of Dormammu is a bit more cerebral. At least this movie goes a bit deeper with the Eastern thinking. The problem is, it also tries to be irreverent. In fact, this movie doesn't know when to get serious and when to go for laughs. The backstory of the Dr. is also interesting. Competent professionals always make for good characters. Also strong is the philosophy of time, mixed with a bit of ethics. It seems to be getting fashionable as it also was the theme of Arrival. There's a bit of an ethical twist which is very good. The bad guys here do have the stronger argument. But the movie for no good reason flip-flops on the issue.I'm going to give this movie a higher score than it deserves mainly for exposing moviegoers to some deeper thoughts even if it does it tongue-in-cheek unfortunately.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Doctor Strange has put a spell on us with a fun hero, amazing visuals, and a new door to the Marvel Cinematic Universe","I was at Disneyland the other day and saw that the line to meet Spider-Man and Captain America had stretched to over an hour at the busiest of times. If someone were to tell me that before Disney bought Marvel Comics, I would have honestly laughed in their faces. But who would have thought that the mouse house working with the capes ended up being the best thing for each other? Had it not been for Disney, we would have not gotten some of the recent output of films like The Avengers, Captain America: Civil War, Ant-Man, and my favorite, Guardians of the Galaxy.For the Marvel cinematic universe to continue, they have to keep going into areas not yet explored. Most mainstream people are not going to read the comics, which details not just a universe, but a vast multiverse that makes the movies seem ant sized. Ant-Man gave us our first glimpse into the multiverse when the title hero shrunk himself smaller then molecules. What we're not shown is the dimensional side of the Marvel Universe, which contains elements of magic, fantasy, and even existentialism. That bridge is finally crossed when we're given our newest hero, Doctor Strange.Stephen Strange (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) is a successful neurosurgeon, but a very arrogant and egotistical person with little compassion for those around him, including coworker and former lover Christine (played by Rachel McAdams). He gets in a car accident that severs both of his hands. When experimental surgeries and rehab don't seem to be working, he's lead to a paraplegic who somehow regained his ability to walk. Strange is told by this guy to go find Kamar- Taj. In Nepal, Strange finds his way to a monastery where another sorcerer Mordo (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) takes him to see his teacher.The Ancient One (played by Tilda Swinton) reveals her power to Strange, showing him an infinite cosmos of other dimensions and of the astral plane. Despite his arrogance, she agrees to teach him. He reads several books about the mythic arts and practices daily, hoping that he will regains the full use of his hands. Strange's abilities are advancing at a quick pace, giving question to the Ancient One on how he might have what it takes to become a sorcerer supreme. A former student of the Ancient One, Kaecilius (played by Mads Mikkelsen) summons an entity from the Dark Dimension called the Dormammu to destroy the planet, leading Strange into battle.Where was this during the summertime? Doctor Strange feels like that blockbuster that everyone had been waiting for in the summer but never got. As a Marvel movie, not only does this stand alone (I didn't see that many references to the other heroes), but it has a very different feel from the others. I'd say that's on the hands of director Scott Derrickson (Sinister, The Exorcism of Emily Rose), who manages to create some of the craziest visuals for a super hero story. Some might compare a lot of the imagery to Inception, but this does enough to make it it's own.Everyone's been saying, so yea, Benedict Cumberbatch is the perfect person for this role who reminded me of Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man; he has a similar ego and sense of humor. I can't wait to see this guy join in with the Avengers. The majority of the cast is great too, especially Chiwetel Ejiofor, who is being set up for something bigger. Like a lot of the other Marvel movies, the villain again isn't that memorable (why do they keep having this problem!) and we can only hope that we'll eventually get a good one besides Loki from Thor, Kingpin from Daredevil, and Killgrave from Jessica Jones.I'll give this nine levitating cloaks out of ten. Doctor Strange is a fun door into Marvel territory that is probably the best adaptation of the character. I haven't read his comic stories, but seeing this movie made me want to go down to see what other adventures the Doctor has been on.Note- This was spectacular in 3D and I highly recommend you catch it in this format, though you'll still get a fun experience in 2D.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Here we go,When I first started watching this film it was slightly enjoyable at first good characters good plot but then issues started coming through for instance in the book Doctor Strange becomes a doctor in order to help save his sister during the surgery she dies. After this strange focuses more on getting things and pushes himself what's the point that no one likes him he's considered too legalistic and too much of an old man even you know he's Young the death of his sister affected him. This aspect of humanity could have been used in Doctor Strange but it didn't instead they tried to push the girlfriend narrative which they could have done. But the way they did it in my opinion wasn't the greatest then we have the sorcerer Supreme you would think it would have been played by an Asian person but instead it was a woman that in real life looks like a boy I know why they chose her for a bit of an otherworldly look I guess. But I really wish they would have went with an Asian man for that role it would have made more sense. On top of that there are aspects of humour littered throughout the film. Some good some bad the ending of the film is pretty good but when you look at the film as a whole and understand the source material in my opinion I would watch the animated version of Doctor Strange this one seems to have all of the Hollywood boxes checked and that seems to be what is holding it back,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Not enough Mastery,"Where is the mastery?The story is simple to understand, a good start for great intrigue and action. However, after you understand the story, I was really disappointed that there was not enough mastery, and smart strategy, it's too simplistic (I know underneath it's still Disney!..). They would ALWAYS fight but ""traditionally"", there were effects, but I didn't see their real mastery. It was like they would win only by luck with a few tricks sometimes. Do you really need to fight body to body - even when you are out of your body (lol!) -, when you control energy and matter? Bizarre, right ! Especially, I think Tilda Swinton died way too easily. I mean, she is very ""ancient"" with great longevity, so she must have won a lot of big fights to have survived during all those years or centuries, and yet she just dies from a frontal stab after a 5sec fight?! Come on ! The doctor fights during 20mn we never see the end of it and bonus: he doesn't die ! She is supposed to be the ""Sorcerer Supreme""... she should have saved the situation more times and fought more. She should have pulled off a magic trick that only her owns for example, like a true big master. I think it's definitely a scripting mistake. Anyway, she delivered a great performance, even if I don't understand what really motivated her to help the doctor. He never proved himself or argued his case. He just showed arrogance, and yet she taught him and told him all those big secrets, WHY? The guy is not even remotely interesting or likable. And he just drops in and takes over? Hmmm, that is just weird. I don't understand his real motivation.Another hero based story (of course, I know, I know)I know it's Marvel. But I'm still going to say it :) What does everybody else is doing while he is saving everybody on his own?! Why does he have to do it on his own, all the time? I wish I saw the other characters developed more. I think hero based stories where a sole person saves it all just really don't make any sense anymore in today's world. Not only does it means that everybody is weak and actually needs a hero, but also that power is concentrated in a few privileged ""gifted"" ones, not very positive and motivating in my sense. But that's Marvel's viewpoint. OK.Excellent visual effectsThe movie is beautiful though for the cracking power imagery. I don't get over such beautiful effects, with the city turned upside down and everything. Bravo !!!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Bland backstory,"Not sure how this is well reviewed. Sure, it's well made movie, high production value but come on, this is weak for a marvel movie.As of right now, Dr Strange, better develop into something stronger... He could of had a small role in an avenger movie. Being a monk is not enough for me, sorry.Acting, I didn't think Benedick did a great job for this role, be-it the script or just him. Wasn't blown away.I was definitely entertained, and felt I got my moneys worth. I support marvel and their universe, but this was lacking.All in my opinion!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Super hero fluff,Sorry to say but this is lots of effects for fluff. It is getting too facile. It is funny enough and fun enough to watch the last half. Watchable.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Better than some...,"...but well short of great.Good first:I thought the pacing was decent as was the directing.The plot and story, while uninspired, did a decent job of introducing a not especially well known character as well as magic into the Marvelverse.Impressive visual effects.Always like Cumberbatch and this one was no exception. Overall the acting was well done.The not so good:Verged on too long with some slow spots.While the effects were well done, personally think they should have edited themselves a bit more.The origin story is relatively close to the original comic book version, which is good and bad. Overall its a bit tired, but much better done than some of its recent roll-outs(cough...Ironfist...cough).Overall, an okay watch and worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
An entertaining paint-by-numbers superhero movie,"Doctor Strange is a paint-by-numbers superhero movie, but it still manages to be an entertaining ride. The visual effects are what set this film apart. There is plenty of eye candy to enjoy as the story rolls along - and no, I'm not referring to Benedict Cumberbatch. If you've liked the previous 13 movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, then you'll probably like this one, too. If you're wanting something different, though, you may be disappointed to find that they've stuck to the formula.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Marvel addresses non-western spirituality,"At the outset of the movie, Dr. Stephen Strange is a bit of an arrogant jerk. When he is faced with difficult circumstances, he turns to sources of help that are more spiritual and metaphysical than he would have in the past.I find it interesting that Marvel addresses so many different worldviews and religious ideas in their characters. Dr. Strange is no exception. He comes to accept a traditional far eastern type of spirituality that is different than the views of Marvel's other characters. It is a clearly non-western spirituality that contrasts the traditionally Judeo-Christian worldviews of the western world. It seems as though they are trying to be more inclusive of other worldviews, which may or may not be a good thing.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Warrior of the astral plane in search of a plotline,"An American fantasy adventure; A story about a surgeon who seeks help from mystics after his hands are damaged in a car crash but winds up becoming a warrior in an inter-dimensional battle. This is an exotic, mind-bending, and absorbing film. Among the terra firma Marvel characters, we've had playboy technologists, soldiers, and a scientist, so this film provides a good contrast with a character of genius. Cumberbatch is well cast, smoothly encapsulating a determined man. He has good support from Tilda Swinton, the mysterious Ancient One, played with charismatic blankness. On the downside, the plot is quite straightforward once the rules of perspective are established. We see little of the thought process of a character forced to rethink everything he knows and the nature of reality itself, so when he becomes emotional, it feels a bit false.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Your average superhero movie,"It felt a little different at the beginning showing him as a normal human being but then it's just all of the same. It follows the same predictable patterns as any other superhero movie so nothing new there. Looks and sounds amazing but that is expected. There were so many times these bad guys could've easily killed this Doctor guy but didn't that it started to get really annoying.A successful doctor has a car accident and gets his hands paralyzed. So he goes to magic school, becomes a superhero and saves the entire world.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
More like doctor who,"While watching this film, it kept bringing back flashbacks of growing up childhood doctor who series, rather than a superhero movie. Dr strange has definetely got a different take on super hero as it's more of a never-verse than our universe, kind of hero",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
The story is run-of-the-mill but the visuals are first-class,"Scott Derrickson's 'Doctor Strange' plays it safe most of the time by adhering to the familiar comic-book movie format (origin story, followed by training, followed by a battle with the villain). But as the saying goes: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. While the narrative side of 'Doctor Strange' doesn't offer anything new, the visuals are pretty exceptional in at least a few segments. Marvel have been outperforming their rivals for at least the last few years when it comes to cinematography and design, but in this film I'd argue that the visuals surpass even other recent films from the same studio such as 'Deadpool' and 'Captain America: Civil War'. If aesthetics rank highly on your list of qualities to look for in a film, look no further.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
mixture of known movies,"I would call this movie as a combination of some well known movies. Majority comes from ""Matrix"" and ""Inception"". Minority comes from ""Dungeons & Dragons"" and ""Harry Potter"". There is also a little bit of ""Last Samurai"". Let me mention briefly about the connections:""Last Samurai"": An irrelevant person with martial arts starts to develop extreme skills, in a short period of time. It is not really very clear how he manages to do it.""Dungeons & Dragons"" and ""Harry Potter"": The special effects and magics come mostly from these two movies.""Inception"": Multiverse and multi-dimension stories come from this movie.""Matrix"": Many concepts are taken from Matrix. But please don't get surprised. In many recent movies you can see such copies.Conclusion: I recommend watching the movie, if and only if you are NOT connected to science and your brain works below excellent.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
"Visually stunning, but lacking in story","FINALLY a movie worthy of 3D. This has been such a gimmick to me in other movies. This one takes full advantage and it really adds to the experience. The visuals are truly impressive. The story itself could have been better, though. I didn't feel connected to very many of the characters. With this not being a mainstream Marvel character, I was hoping to learn more about this world. Tilda Swinton seemed bored at times. I think she was going for stoic, but it didn't always read that way. Too many of the jokes fell flat and they came off like jokes rather than feeling natural if that makes sense. An entertaining movie overall, however.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Not completely flawless but it's very interesting and beautiful to watch.,"Doctor Strange is not only just a good film but it's also a WEIRD film.I get that the character is meant to be very strange and mystical. The clue's in the title but a lot of the movie is not really very memorable story-wise. The only thing that is memorable are the acting performances, the amazing visual effects and the musical score.Stephen Strange is a character that is essential to the Marvel universe and Marvel Studios did the best they could to make a movie about him as most of his powers and his stories are quite difficult to understand.I get that ""not everything making sense"" is the point of Doctor Strange but... it's just really bizarre!It's an okay Marvel movie and Benedict Cumberbatch really milks the role but it could have been a bit better. That's just me. It's just setting up Infinity War, right?",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
If it wasn't for the visuals...,"This would be a 5-6/10 max.First of all, I had already sworn off watching Marvel movies because I found them to be ridiculously similar. Same general plot, same structure, same pacing, same jokes, same fights (especially those get boring quite fast).
But Doctor Strange promised to be different and visually inspiring.
As far as the visuals go, 100% yes. They're really creative, interesting and next level, actually, they kinda define the film, which is why I am happy to rate the film higher than it should be, just because it was more than visually appealing to watch.In terms of being different, well, kinda. 
I really liked where things were going in the beginning (spirituality, astral projection, calming the mind, healing body through soul) because these are all real phenomena, even though wildly different from how they're portrayed in the movie, obviously.
But Cumberbatch, who is a very fitting Doctor Strange, hardly changes during the entire film. I would have loved to see a more dramatic character arch. It was said that he should connect with his soul and let go of his huge ego in order to gain these powers. Well, he gained all sorts of powers but didn't seem to connect to his soul or let go of his huge ego. He still appeared pretty awkward after what one could call his awakening.
Big negative is the villain(s). Felt no connection at all towards them. Didn't care at all about them. Marvel really needs to up their villain game.Over all it was entertaining to watch, especially because of amazing visuals and the eastern influences, but I would not watch it again.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Just okay,"If you simply must see the amazing special effects on the big screen, than by all means go. Otherwise wait till you can watch on Amazon etc. Problem 1: The film fails to make Dr. S a big enough ass prior to his epiphany. I mean the character is supposed to be really selfish and self absorbed. I thought the film was afraid to totally go all in on this character build despite some admittedly crucial scenes. Problem 2: Film fails to connect Dr. Strange and Mordo in a meaningful way. This will cause problems in the future I think. Problem 3: Humorous moments are there, but the film fails to land them with a good enough punch. Other Marvel films are really good at mixing in the humor, but this movie seems timid a bit of going landing a good joke. Problem 4: The main reason I went to see this movie is because of Cumberbatch, but his performance is really run of the mill. I could picture many actors performing the role in the way he does, its underwhelming if not convincing...THat's about it, just another okay Marvel movie, certainly not my favorite at all.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Solid marvel movie,"This is yet an other solide marvel movie entry.
the concept of how the movie starts id very different than the other superhero movies.
we are used to a quiet sluggish start where we get to know the character and how it gains its superpowers, but in this one its nice and paints a good picture about his story.
the story plot can be a bit confusing at times but the reasons behind the main hero is different than we have seen in other superhero moviesthe movie had great visuals, the color contrast works great.
subbtle but good music.all in all good movie. one of the goods",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Fun movie,"The visuals are stunning. The sidekick is good. The story, well, it's a superhero movie. But it's alright. Overall this is quite a fun movie to watch and you probably will not be disappointed.

FORMULAIC,"Though it follows the formula of 2008's ""Iron Man,"" ""Doctor Strange"" is interesting enough and visually amazing enough for fans like me to watch",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Something different but same,"I really appreciate marvel for going in such a different route whether this movie worked or not it will for sure increase excitement for the next collaborative movie cause dr strange brings such a different aspect of powers to the avengers. As for the movie it started off pretty well but gradually just became an average origin story of any superhero especially the last part with dormamu felt very forced
But definitely the best part of the movie was its visuals one can watch it just because of that and the conflict and mystery around ancient one was exciting
Overall a good movie but more excited for what's about to comeFAVOURITE CHARACTER :: Stephen strange
FAVOURITE MOMENT :: strange being frustratied with his situation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"

Let's make Black Panther an old white lady next time...,"Dr. Strange's origin story isn't cannon. He is able to defeat a master like Kaecilius and Kaecilius' students with ease despite only having been trained for a few weeks (Kaecilius kills several Sanctum masters and guardians, so Kaecilius is clearly incredibly powerful). So the plot/story isn't realistic, and the origin story isn't cannon. Ontop of that, they gender-bent the 2nd most important character in the movie, and they changed the race of the 3rd most important character in the movie from white to black... why don't we just make Black Panther white, and Iron Man black while we're at it? Why don't we change Black Widow from a sexy white woman to a 85year old man with a plastic hip? Why don't we change Wonder Woman from an amazonian goddess to a fat black man from Baltimore? Honestly, the movie should have -1 point deducted from my overall score simply because of the nonsense changes this director decided he wanted to do...Anyway, the movie is 75% plot/story, and 20% fighting, and 5% comedy. When you compare that to Thor Ragnarok or Deadpool, then you'll find that both those movies have a significantly larger amount of fighting AND comedy in them, without compromising on the story/plot. Overall, this film was let down by the director and the poor origin story. This movie only gets a 6.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
Overrated,A good film but is overrated. The story of the film is average. The screenplay is kind of slow. The direction is good. The CGI and visual effects are outstanding. The performances of the cast are good. You can either go for it or you can rewatch other spectacular mcu movies.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Fantasy"
