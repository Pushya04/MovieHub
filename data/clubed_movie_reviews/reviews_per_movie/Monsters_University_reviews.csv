Monsters University: A worthy prequel,"I adored Monsters Inc, it was one of those surprise movies you go into with no expectations and are blown away by. It took years for me to get round to this due to my endless watchlist but I'm so happy I can say that it's worth of the the franchise.Charming, well written, full of laugh out loud moments and undeniably loyal to the original movie with tie-ins around every corner.I especially liked Helen Mirrens character, part monster, part bat, part centipede? I like centipedes, I wanted to be an entomologist once upon a time, obsessed over bugs, learnt all about them then learnt about these things called university, qualifications and effort and thought against it. I'll leave entomology to those with motivation, you enjoy your bugs and I'll enjoy women, movies, video games and various other fun stuff.I digress, Monsters University is a sweet heartfelt movie and makes me hope they make a final part to make a monsters trilogy. Maybe touching upon certain events that happened in this as opposed to it's sequel.Sadly I don't see this happening, I think we have more likelihood of a Princess Bride 2, Brave 2 or a movie where Zac Efron doesn't play an arrogant douche who likes to take his shirt off.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pleasant Story of Friendship,"When Mike Wazowski is young, he visits the Monsters University in a tour of his primary school. A senior student gives his hat to Mike and he plans to become a scary monster.Years later, Mike joins the Monsters University and on the arrival, he receives a flier of the Scare Games that will take place soon in the campus. Mike also befriends his roommate Randall. When the lazy student James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan, who belongs to a family of famous ""scarers"", breaks in his room, they start a competition in class. Their dispute ends when they accidentally break the pride and of joy of Dean Abigail Hardscrabble, a cylinder with her greatest achievement – a powerful scream of a boy. They both are expelled from the scare classes by Hardscrambble that tells that Sully is lazy and Mike is not scary, and they become enemies.When Mike recalls the Scare Games, he sees his only chance to return to the scare course. He makes the application to participate, but he learns that he needs a fraternity. Mike joins the Oozma Kappa that is the only fraternity available with four losers, but he is informed that the fraternity needs to have six members. Sully offers to complete the team and Mike has no other alternative but accept Sully in his team. Then he bets with Hardscrambble that if he wins the games, she will accept them in the scare classes. Soon the game begins...""Monsters University"" is a pleasant story of friendship and a prequel of ""Monsters Inc."". The plot is based on the American college life and despite the lack of any identification with my country, with fraternities and silly parties of American college students, the plot is funny and entertaining. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Universidade Monstros"" (""Monsters University"")",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The prequel that no one asked for, but everyone will watch.","Monsters University: the prequel that no one asked for, but everyone will watch. It would appear that Pixar has recently run out of original ideas and has resorted to making sequels and prequels of older more successful movies (Cars 2, Planes, Monsters U and Finding Dory). That being said, the film was actually pretty decent and was rather watchable and enjoyable. The film had multiple unexpected twists, which avoided having an all too predictable ending. It also explained many of the features of its sequel, like Randall's rivalry with Mike and Sully and the Abominable Snowman.Reviving the voice talents of Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Steve Buscemi and adding Helen Mirren and Charlie Day, amongst others, this film stayed within the universe that the original movie had created, however in comparison failed to live up to its predecessor's greatness.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
MU is more than OK.,"The cruddy trailer hardly filled me with hope for this belated prequel to Monsters, Inc., and the relatively laugh-free first thirty minutes did little to change my mind; however, once Mike and Sully and their Oozma Kappa fraternity brothers enter the Scare Games, the film really picks up and the laughs start to come thick and fast. By the time the end credits were rolling, Monsters University had given me lots of giggles and even a few genuine belly laughs and I'd completely altered my opinion: the oft-used 'under-dogs do good' plot may not be as fresh as the original, but overall I reckon the film is well worth watching.Some of the best moments are clever one-liners and subtle fleeting visual gags which could go unseen, or over the head of younger viewers, but that gives the film repeat value; I hope to catch even more funny stuff the second time around after I proudly add the DVD to my Pixar collection.A very respectable 8/10 (If there had been more funny moments in the first half-an-hour or so, this would have been right up there with Pixar's finest).",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good but not great,"Monsters, Inc. was the first Pixar movie where I saw their genius. Such an incredible mix of themes and emotions. From the basic premise of ""humanizing"" monsters to the tiny details in Boo's behavior that I did not notice until I had a daughter of my own, it was beautiful and original.My top Pixar movies are (in no particular order) Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc., Wall-E and The Incredibles. These are movies that actually mean something to me.Monsters University is definitely better than Cars 2 and Brave, but I did not find that ""magic ingredient"" in it. If anything, it was formulaic - the same old story retold for the millionth time.It was certainly nice to see Sully and Mike again and see how they became friends, but the story was rather shallow with little character development (I would have loved to see Randall's evolution for example).",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nostalgic film for the old and young,"The first Monsters Inc. came out when i was just 7 years old and immediately became one of my all time favourites from the day I saw it. With extremely high expectations in mind and excitement especially for Pixar's close attention to relevance (as I am actually at university now myself) I went to see the new one as soon as it came out.The film is a prequel following closely to our much loved earlier Characters, Mike and later Sully as they present to us their lives prior to the first movie. As well as an adorable new cast of monsters which are equally lovable as the old ones.To my delight, the film exceeded most if not all my earlier expectations. The plot is well written, funny and most of all extremely heart warming especially to long time fans like myself as well as those younger viewers that might not have even seen the first one.The nostalgic element of the film is perhaps the most well written. Every twist and turn reveals a huge or tiny explanation to the events and habits of the characters that I previously saw in the first film. Questions I never even asked myself, like why Randall's eyes are so squinty or how Sully and Randall's rivalry originated.Although i absolutely loved the movie, perhaps its because I've waited for 12 years but at some points it left me slightly unsatisfied and I'd have loved for some parts to be explained more thoroughly.Regardless of my only criticism, the movie made me laugh, cried with tears of joy, almost actually cried and was both heart warming and action packed. What more could you ask for? I urge those fans of the first film as well as anyone that just wants to have a good time at the cinema to see it. It'll be well worth your time!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not great, but totally fun","A prequel to one of Pixar's most beloved films, Monsters Inc. In all honesty, I wasn't looking forward to this one too much. A sequel would have been a better option. Like the Toy Story movies, it should take place a long while later, and Mike and Sully should meet back up with a teenage Boo or something. Boo was the soul of that movie, and, of course, in a prequel, Boo can't exist. Instead, we get the story of how Mike and Sully met in college. The story is made up of a ton of college movie clichés in the Monsters world. And it's fine. Not great, nothing really special, but it's very enjoyable and the animation is gorgeous. The last time I revisited Monsters Inc., the animation seemed a little primitive, but Pixar has more than perfected it now, and I loved seeing the wonderful monster designs. Steve Buscemi, the villain from the first film, is prominent in the cast again. Other famous cast members include Nathan Fillion, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Aubrey Plaza and Alfred Molina. The most memorable new character is Dean Hardscrabble, played by Helen Mirren. The design, kind of a centipede dragon, is extremely cool and actually pretty creepy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
I guess that for once I was easy to please!,""" Monsters University"" is a new film from Pixar that is a prequel to their film ""Monsters Inc."". In addition to the two main characters, a whole lot of new characters are introduced at the college that Mike and Sully attended. The plot involves Mike trying to become a 'scaring major'—something quite unthinkable since he isn't the least bit scary. There's a lot more to the film than this, but I won't spoil it by saying more about the plot.My daughter was lucky enough to go to the debut of ""Monsters University"". She liked it but also felt the story was disappointing since it lacked original characters and the story reminded her of too many college films (like ""Revenge of the Nerds"" and ""Animal House""). My wife saw it with me and she said that the film put her to sleep! This is all very odd, as I am usually the most difficult to please in the family when it comes to films—yet I thoroughly enjoyed the film and nearly gave it a 9. While I would agree it lacks originality, it did make me smile. It was a nice, gentle film—one that I didn't mind just watching without picking it apart (like I usually do). Much of this is because the CGI was simply gorgeous and It was a pleasure watching such a beautiful filmas well as such a nice and enjoyable film.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Monsters U, entertaining but fails to meet","I really loved Monsters Inc, but this movie failed to meet expectations. Yes, it offers a little back story on two of the most memorable characters of all time, but I was not attached to them like I was during the first movie. The best scenes are at the end when Roz makes an appearance...Mike and Sully are great characters, but in the first one, you had some minor characters who made the movie much more charming (Roz, Boo, etc...) and I just didn't find myself growing any attachment to Mike's college nerd buddies. A good movie and maybe would be much more entertaining to someone who hasn't seen the first (little kids would giggle at the monsters I'm sure), but this movie misses the mark.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A must see prequel,"Monsters University is the prequel to Monsters inc., a wildly popular animation by Pixar. It's basically a college movie set in the monster world, but with a nice deviation from the standard.The good. Still the same incredibly interesting world with all its colors, fantastic creatures, and quirks. Interesting story, especially for the twist. Great animation, as usual. Easily enjoyable by adults.

The Unnecesscary is strong in this one,"Pixar, where has your courage gone? In this decade alone, we have been treated to two sequels, a prequel, a princess story (as if Disney doesn't have enough of those), with another sequel on the way. Pixar's Dreamworks mannerisms has been kind of unnerving, especially when we have seen the ballsy efforts like The Incredibles, Ratatouille, and especially (especially) Wall-E. The original stories are occurring less frequent, and while it's leading to guaranteed money for the company and Disney the die-hard Disney fans and film fanatics have been less than impressed.And now we have Monster's University. Surely the charm is there, the animation is the usual Pixar quality, and the production value remains the best in the animation business. But there was a constant sense of pointlessness to this prequel throughout the whole thing, and it lacks the heart and humor of the original Monster's Inc. The originality of the 2001 gem is also missing, as University dwells into familiar clichéd territory in the second half.This movie works well with the tykes and the true-blue Mike and Sully fans, but with the rest of us who really didn't care much to see how they met----well, there's not much here. It is simply about Mike and Sully's rivalry during the start of their university career and how they had to learn to accept each other if they ever wanted a chance to remain in the school.In the grand scheme of the G-rated filmmaking culture, Monster's University excels and surpasses that of the normal fare. But this is Pixar we are talking about, a company that bleeds pure quality and has created some of the greatest animated films in history. They have raised the bar too high to create something so.normal. It is odd from a Pixar movie to see failed jokes and a sense of predictability.It's not as funny, not as heartfelt, not as surprising, not as deep, and not as engaging as Pixar's best, and not even Dreamworks' best for that matter. It is simply light entertainment that will calmly entertain and not overwhelm---while at the same time not linger in your memory like Pixar's best like Toy Story, Nemo, Ratatouille and Up.Good but not great—and in Pixar standards that should never be good enough.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar does it again,"Having really enjoyed Monsters Inc when I was younger, I was pleasantly surprised when I heard that there was going to be a prequel released.It was interesting to see how all the characters had met and what their friendships were like in the earlier days. The film has a good simple plot and is perfect for the whole family to enjoy as there is also some funny parts as well as heartwarming moments. It was great that Mike and Sulley (the two main characters) had the same voice-overs as the original film, this made it feel more authentic.Overall I really enjoyed this film, but then who doesn't love a good Disney Pixar film?8/10",,Anonymous,Animation
A fun prequel,"A fun prequel to 'Monsters, Inc.'.It isn't on the same level as the preceding film, but 'Monsters University' is a pleasing film nonetheless. It takes a trip backwards in time to see Mike and Sully pre-Inc. and it comes out good, it doesn't have as much as heart but the comedy is still there at a strong level.John Goodman (Sully) and Billy Crystal (Mike) are again fantastic, while Helen Mirren comes in as a new character, Hardscrabble, and gives a pleasant performance. I don't love the other new characters, but they certainly serve a purpose and play a part.The plot is entertaining, it drops a little bit once the competition begins but everything is still enjoyable - the 104 minute run time flies by. I think I would've preferred a sequel story featuring a grown up Boo (admittedly not sure in what way), but this production is a suitable attachment to the quality 2001 original.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful animation but it's just not funny enough,"It's hard to believe that it's been 12 years since the original Monsters, Inc. graced the screens and introduced the world to a green, one-eyed motormouth named Mike Wazowski and a lovable furry giant called James P. 'Sully' Sullivan. Although it was far from Pixar's best effort, Inc was charming and a surprisingly moving little film that made a killing at the box office. So why the wait for a sequel? Cars 2 (2011) aside, Pixar have always prided themselves on putting story above all else, so perhaps the writers simply could not come up with something solid enough to warrant another outing for Mike and Sully. But now Disney are in charge, I guess that if there's money to be made, they'll make sure it's made.Before the events of Monsters, Inc., Mike (Billy Crystal) is a young monster with only one goal in his life - to become a top scarer at Monsters, Inc. The only problem is that he's not scary. Inspired by an encounter on a school trip, Mike studies and studies until he is enlisted in Monsters University, the best place for any budding scarer to learn their craft. Sully (John Goodman) enlists too, with a legendary family name and a clearly formidable appearance. Sully's lethargic approach to study annoys Mike, and a fallout between the two leads them to be kicked out of the class by the terrifying Dean Harscrabble (Helen Mirren). With seemingly no hope, Mike sees the upcoming Scare Games as the chance to prove himself to Harscrabble, who agrees to let him back in if he triumphs, only he has to team up with Sully to make up the numbers.The main problem with Pixar's output in the last few years is that they seem to be slowly moving away from making movies that please adults in equal amounts to children. Toy Story 3 was their last great movie and that was three years ago. Cars 2 and last year's Brave were mediocre efforts, certainly beautiful to behold but relatively hollow inside. Much of the same can be said for Monsters University, as although it's nice to see these characters again, it lacks that Pixar touch that led to so many of their films to now be considered classics of the genre. We are left with not much more than a collection of wonderfully constructed set-pieces based around a thin plot that we all know the result of anyway.Of the new additions, Charlie Day's Art and Helen Mirren's Dean Harscrabble steal the film, the former a truly bonkers creation and the latter given some quality thespian backing. We also get the welcome return of Steve Buscemi's Randy, who's downturn we get to witness thanks to a very clever moment. But ultimately, Monsters University's biggest problem is that it's just not that funny. The best moments are seen in the trailer (such as the snail monster trying not to be late for class on his first day), and the best aspects of college life can't be played with as they involve alcohol, drugs or boobs, a no-no even for Pixar. So we are left with a very pretty film (possibly the finest animation-wise to date) full of breathtaking set-pieces, but one that lacks that special touch I came to love from Pixar and one I am becoming reluctantly resigned to never seeing again.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Once again a pretty solid effort from Pixar. Great job.,"Pixar is the source of some of the most deep, thoughtful and meaningful CG films and have created a great name for themselves. Personally i love most of their films. I almost joined the naysayers prior to this films release before reminding myself that Pixar has never really let ME down. And as expected excellence reigned supreme. This is in my opinion a really good film. Perhaps not at the level of Up and Wall-E, but it is certainly not bad either.Animation: A+ The animation is fantastic, then again what else can be expected from Pixar. Top quality CG that is detailed and yet so brilliantly original. Sully and Mike look fantastic as do all the other characters. And if you see the detail of the university, Mike's room and many other portions such as that in the human world, you will be flabbergasted by how amazing it looks. The cuteness of the characters is an added bonus. Pixar is one of those rare studios that pay the greatest attention to surroundings as well as every other aspect, making you want to take notice of everything from posters in the dorm, headlines in newspapers and the sheer workmanship of the great environments whether they are the university, the living room, the bedroom or any other setting.Story: B+. OK i agree there were parts that had resemblance to Revenge of the Nerds and Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire and it got quite to close to situations in college movies of years past. Though the originality of the scare games and what they signify to Mike is really quite sweet and pretty original if you think about it. I like the youthful characters of Mike and Sully but the change in personality is way too drastic when comparing to how they turn out in Monsters Inc. Also they at some points feel like characters from similar movies and this tends to make the film feel tired. So it is best not to make comparisons if you want to have a good time.You don't get your usual ending and the pretty true-to-life messages elevate it from being just ordinary. The reality of their situation and the hard life lessons that are thrust upon them give a picture of the pitfalls life gives us in real life and the effect it has on character. These are just some of the major, resounding themes. And yet even through it the positivity and depth still resonates. You will no doubt smile all through and have several genuine laugh out loud moments that add to this pretty great emotional mix.Yes a college comedy does not need to be PG or R rated to be funny and this one succeeds in triumphing over other college movies. And as someone who understands and has been through what Mike's character faces in this movie, that added extra resonance and heart. A twist on the similar films, heart(as with all Pixar), depth, resounding mature themes, life as we know it, witty humor and smiles galore, what more could you ask for? There are some minor continuity errors between the prequel and the original but those are minor and the story more than makes up for it. All in all a good effort. Monsters Inc is a great film, and one of the absolute best from Pixar. Monsters U may not be at its level but it nevertheless a very good film.Music: A. The score is good, really good. Though i felt so much similarity between it and the Toy Story trilogy as well as The Princess and the Frog. Then again they too were works by Randy Newman and those scores were great too. Perhaps it is just me but i also noted similar music to Up in this awesome film.Overall: A great film that can be seen as a family, a group of friends or individually. A film that will be appreciated especially by college student. Pixar once again does a good job.As a small note, look out for great references to Monsters Inc. It will add to the smiles.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as everyone is saying,"This film continues a downward trend at Pixar, whose movies have declined measurably in quality, especially since being purchased by Disney.For a sequel, Monsters University makes an earnest effort, and is reasonably watchable. But there's not enough meat in the haphazard plot to really capture the viewer's imagination. The themes are childish and familiar.Technically, the film looks good, as expected. The voice acting from Crystal and Goodman are as good as you would expect.There's just not a lot else I can say about a sequel to a film which I always thought was a weaker entry in Pixar's catalog.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters University pleasantly defines its title with a great story,"With Animation industries overproducing computer-animated films for either sequels or prequels, expectations from critiques and longtime cartoon lovers who grew up with classic Disney movies are pretty high. For this reason, It has been a while since I get to be surrounded by parents who like to bring their kids to let them enjoy bright and comical scenes.After coming to the theater with low excitement, not only does this movie exceed my expectation but it also proves that Pixar is not a sort of company that tries to take audience's wherewithal by making a mediocre prequel based on the reputation of an original one.As usual, Pixar consistently unleashes intriguing, unique, and appealing characters with flexible movements and simplified traits that attract a wide range of audiences. Especially when it comes to presenting different breeds of monsters with extraordinary looks and abilities, followed by an absolute storytelling skill that moves everyone's emotion.As the setting takes place in the old days before Mike and Sullivan get to work together in Monsters, inc., you get to find out how they meet and grow their friendship. The story consists of both internal and external conflicts that college students can unanimously relate to. Pixar does an amazing job on capitalizing as much college-related elements as possible to emphasize the importance of corroborations, personal identity, and working hard to achieve your goal. There are also tons of humors that make you laugh periodically.In a nutshell, this is a sincere and endeavored film that sends us various messages to help us progress in many different ways. I strongly recommend this to all the students out there who are struggling with their school life. It is such an inspirational movie and Pixar still rocks!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

It Shines in a Summer of Disappointment,"First and foremost, this movie should be almost painfully relatable to the Disney Renaissance Generation. For the convenience of the meanings told in Disney and Pixar films, couldn't be more relatable to the age of those born in the mid 90's growing up. Also, for the question of a Monsters Inc. Prequel being necessary? Make that decision after the credits roll, for this was the most enjoyable movie I've seen so far in 2013. In an overwhelming blockbuster summer of over-hyped excitement followed by mild to severe disappointment, Monsters University isn't just a good sign for Pixar, it's a good sign that 2013 can be one of the best years of film.Now! On to the review! The story of the origin of the friendship between one-eyed Mike Wazowski and the blue furred James P. Sullivan in their freshman year at Monsters University.

Rather it be a long blonde haired guitar player, or the horns on the school bus. All original voice talent returns and keeps up with the track record of great performances in Pixar films. Billy Crystal, John Goodman, and Steve Buscemi grasp their characters and give them entirely different motivations compared to the original. Instead of a hardworking team, the two have a rivalry, and the supporting cast of their fraternity supply more relatability with a great variety of lovable monsters who help fill the story with even more heart.The compatibility with Mike and Sully can be a bit surprising, for one is the study hard teachers pet, and the other a natural born scare student. And just as you think your more like one, the other comes in and you realize that even monsters can be scared of the real world just like us today. Fear of what life has in store, and if we have the talent to fulfill our dreams. This is a theme a lot of critics are missing, and shines making it worthy of being a great Pixar movie and prequel to a great classic.The story isn't terribly generic as one may think, and every act is more different from the last. Starting with the clash between Mike and Sully, then onto the scare games, an intense series of games that declare supremacy of M.U. For the third and final act couldn't be more surprising though. It not only serves as a great climax, but something that we can once again commend Pixar for telling great stories in out of the box thinking that we should think paying for the $10 dollar ticket is worth it. And boy did I think this movie was worth it, for I will be definitely be seeing it a second and possibly third time. It wasn't a prequel we originally wanted, but it was a film that we and Pixar needed. And boy am I glad it happened.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters University- A Charming and Mildly Humorous Prequel Weighted Down by Unoriginal Formula and Predictable Development,"Pixar's creative soul has slowly begun to drain most likely due to its ill-advised marriage with the overbearing influential force of Disney as we're seeing their consistent quality and originality slowly disappear from existence with occasional reminders of what made them so unique. Three out of four of Pixar's last couple of films can all be categorized in the sequel department, including the excellent Toy Story 3, the annoyingly awful Cars 2, and their latest genial yet unoriginal Monsters University, with one original yet subpar effort in Brave that at least reminded us that despite weak plot they can make some awe-inspiring visual animation. Monsters University might be mildly humorous in its animated mockery of college life, whether it's the obnoxiousness of the frat culture or the awkwardness of social fits, but what it truly lacks is what Pixar is known for, which is meaningfully deep values, inventive inspiration, and original storytelling. This unnecessary prequel to Monsters Inc. simply borrows the template of Revenge of the Nerds and inserts the familiar characters of Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman) in a rather typical underdog college adventure giving us an occasionally fun but more often tedious trek through their formative years. Nothing about the film even remotely justifies its own existence since everything from the unoriginal story to the gimmicky humor to the formation of the characters never feels organic. Ironically enough at the heart of Monsters University is the message that sometimes it's alright to simply be OK, which is the best word that can describe this arguably watchable but incredibly unambitious work of animation. Pixar has gone from creating exceptional original storytelling combined with gracefully executed pristine animation with the likes of Up, The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo to now churning out basic children's entertainment which is not only disappointing, it's practically shameful. Despite this relentlessly negative perception on the unnecessary existence of Monsters University there is enough guilty charm and likable scenarios featuring two favorite characters from the Pixar universe that will undoubtedly please most audiences at the basic level. But basic was never a word that would even enter a conversation about the quality of a Pixar film and it's unfortunate that this is the third consecutive film in a row from the company to warrant that description.Read more: http://wp.me/py8op-zY; More reviews: Generationfilm.net",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"It's fun, but still hoping more from Pixar Studio","In 2001, movie fans was amazed with the appearance of Pixar's creation 'Monsters, Inc'. 'Monsters, Inc' is one of the most brilliant and original animation movie ever made. The movie wasn't only successful at box office worldwide, but also it's favored among kids and adults audience even for critics too. No wonder the studio without any doubt continuing this franchise after over 10 years. 'Monsters University tells story happened before 'Monsters, Inc'. It has a lot more focus on Mike's character, how he wanted to go to college, dreamed to be a fearless monster and joined scare competition, how he first met with Sulley and annoyed by his behavior.'Monsters University' is kind of prequel that is necessary to be made because in 'Monsters, Inc' they didn't explain much about Mike and Sulley's relationship before and how they could be best friend which is quite important. 'Monsters University' is fun, interesting and colorful movie. The relation between Mike and Sulley is well-developed in this movie, from they hate each other because of their differences to become a good team. But there is still something missing from it. Pixar used to create deep storyline and a heartwarming moment that this movie doesn't have. The storyline is quite safe and feel less emotion if compared with 'Monsters, Inc'. It's too shame because 'Monsters University' is just continuing brilliant material in 'Monsters, Inc' and should make it more right though. Also Randall's character is unnecessary here and feel to be forced in this movie, I think he should just appeared directly in 'Monsters, Inc'. Overall, 'Monsters University is acceptable, entertaining and not disappointing at all, it's also funny that audience would easily enjoy especially kids. Definitely it's not as dumb as 'Cars 2' and worth to see as a family entertainment. But I'm still hoping much more from Pixar Studio that has brought masterpiece creation like 'Toy Story, 'Up', 'Wall-E' and many more. Besides animation from Pixar only comes out once a year, so they have time to make it more serious than this.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
They're back... and its GOOOOD.,"MONSTERS UNIVERSITY is a prequel to MONSTERS INC., directed by Dan Scanlon. The characters include the voices of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Hellen Mirren.The film goes back to where Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan were before they were buddies and in Monsters Inc. It shows how the two of them were in university, showing the relationship between them which led up to the two of them becoming the best of friends.Alright, so MIKE AND SULLY ARE BAACKK!!! Well, thats what every kid or adult that was associated with the enjoyment of Monsters Inc should say. Okay, so it's been 12 years since we saw these two on-screen, providing us with animated humor, and now they're back again, to show us how they were in University. The teaser trailer was extremely funny as it showed a prank played on Mike by Sully, and it gave a short look-in into the sort of relationship we would be seeing. Soon enough, the trailer came out and boy did it get people hooked. Finally, I was able to catch a premiere screening of the film, to my advantage, and IT WAS GREAT.So let's start talking about the film, not necessarily the trailers. Who are we kidding, at first when we heard that Monsters University was coming, that a sequel was coming to the classic Monsters Inc, we gave up hope, saying that no one could make it better than the first one. But Dan Scanlon challenged that, and the first teaser proved it. And I think that the movie does it as well- kinda. So, Monsters University isn't AS good as Monsters Inc, but it does come second in line. It includes Mike and Sully in an underdog team, but throughout the film, you can't help and laugh out at the jokes, and smile at the fact that the sequel is finally out.Monsters University is GREAT. It has two parts and its all happy and fun. I, honestly, liked the way they showed the chemistry developing between Mike and Sully. You can actually feel it, and even though its animation, it feels real. This one isn't quite sad, like how Inc was. Inc ended in a sad tune, at the fact that Boo was gone, but this one ends at the beginning of Inc. I loved the way it ended. The line that Mike uses just makes you go like, 'YEAH! Thats what I'm talking about!' Honestly, I'm not gonna say any more, because I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone.In the end, Monsters University is great fun. Pixar has done it again, the director has managed to do it. I don't think that there is gonna be another part to the franchise, which kinda dulls me, but at the end of Monsters University it makes you wanna see more, which you will only get by watching Inc, since its the continuation. Go watch Monsters University, with anyone to be honest. I guarantee you an extremely fun ride that these two will give you.MONSTERS UNIVERSITY- 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still Funny After 12 Years,"Considering that the original ""Monsters Inc."" was released all the way back in 2001, I was interested to see if this long-time-coming sequel could re-capture the magic. By-and-large, it does with that patented PIXAR mix of humor and heart.For a basic plot summary, this film details the meeting of young one-eyed monster Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) at Monsters University, a monster-world school for ""scarers"". Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) also plays a role (a ""returning"" character from ""Inc.""), while a group of geeky monster freshmen discover what working together and for a better future is all about.Simply put, ""Monsters U"" is a very solid effort in the animation category. To be sure, it is not in the upper-echelon (Toy Story, Nemo, Tangled, Wall-E), but it is purely entertaining. The humor will make even adults laugh (or any of those who can relate to the college experience), while the ""heart"" moments (while not quite as emotional as ""Inc."") are present and in the right places.I had fun watching this flick with my younger sister...simple as that. It doesn't go on any of my ""best of"" lists or anything like that, but I would recommend it for family viewing to anyone. Even after 12 years away from Mike and Sullivan, director Dan Scanlon manages to keep the characters and their universe relevant.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Pixar we all fell in love with is back!,"Monsters University is the best Pixar film since Toy Story 3 in 2010, and as good as Monsters Inc.After Toy Story 3, Pixar Animation has been doing films that got short for the standards make by them. Cars 2 in 2011 didn't make it to the final round on the Academy Awards and Brave in 2012 won that year just because it was Pixar and they didn't receive the Oscar the year before, but the movie didn't have anything special. So, after the good streak of Wall-E, Up and Toy Story 3, Pixar fell way too low, buy this summer they have raise up and brought the perfect family movie of 2013 (by far).Even thou we are seeing some of the old characters like (obviously), Mike, Sully, Randall and even George Sanderson (the monsters that is shaved for the 3312 alert), this movie feels different from its predecessor/sequel. What Monsters Inc. gain in sweetness with the Boo's character, this one compensates it with laughs. Since Finding Nemo in 2003, Pixar films has lost a little laughs, and introduced sweetness, but in University the smiles are back.But it's not only about the laughs. The whole philosophy of the world is different. Inc. was about questioning the world they live in and everything they know about human kids. In University, scaring a kid is a good thing and is what give value a monster. If a monster is not scary then, what kind of monster is it? So, those two simple things gave the movie a whole new and different vibe.The story is pretty much what we have seen in the trailers, but funnier. However, there are some unexpected twists that make it a even more solid film. So, we are safe to say that you haven't seen it all, even if you have seen every single trailer and clip in the internet. The ending is great, odd coming from Pixar, it works perfectly to the story when you think about it and don't make room for any sequel to the prequel, because it closes every gap.It would be a cliché to say that the animation is amazing. This is Pixar that we're talking about. All the details on hair, scales, skin and even feathers are stunning. Even better than that is the animation on the characters expression. It is unbelievable. They don't have to say a word to send a message because with their faces they say it all. Sully could be an Academy Award winner, but what Mike does with one eye and a round body doesn't have a word to be described.Some people will say that in Monsters Inc. Mike says to Sully, ""You have been jealous of my looks since fourth grade"". However, the characters first meet in college. Well, director Dan Scalon said that they actually thought about that and get to the conclusion that Mike said that as a common expression referring to a long time period and not literally that they have meet since 4th grade. The only problem is that to sustain that excuse they should have use it at least one time in this film. However, we never hear such a phrase to be told by Mike or any other character in the film. That will make those people think that Scalon only said that excuse to safe the story.If you are human enough to ignore that stupid and insignificant expression, then you will enjoy Monsters University. You will laugh, the kids will love it and everyone will remember why they fell in love with Pixar and this particularly characters 12 years ago.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fun and heartwarming prequel,"""Monsters University"" serves as a delightful prequel to the beloved ""Monsters, Inc.,"" offering an engaging backstory for the characters Mike Wazowski and James P. ""Sulley"" Sullivan. This Pixar film takes viewers on a journey through their college years, showcasing how the iconic duo met and evolved from rivals to best friends.The animation is top-notch, filled with vibrant colors and creative character designs that bring the monster world to life. The film's setting in a bustling university campus adds a nostalgic touch, complete with all the excitement and challenges of college life.Mike's character arc, focusing on his determination and dreams of becoming a top scarer, is both inspiring and relatable. Sulley's laid-back yet naturally talented persona contrasts perfectly with Mike's hardworking nature, creating a dynamic and entertaining relationship.The storyline is filled with humor, heartwarming moments, and valuable life lessons about teamwork, perseverance, and self-acceptance. While it may not reach the emotional depth of its predecessor, ""Monsters University"" provides a fun and satisfying experience for fans of all ages, celebrating the power of friendship and the importance of following one's dreams.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Two for the Money,"The Pixar classic ""Monsters, Inc."" called out for a prequel in the same way that ""Cars"" called out for one sequel and one brand extension which is to say not at all. Anyway, the studio needs to bring in revenue while it works to recover from ""Brave"" so out comes this exploration of Mike and Sully's origin story. Even given the original already established the universe, the story still lacks originality with fairly stock characters and situations. The writing fully lacks the crackling lines of the original and is someone maudlin and overly dramatic for a kids animated comedy. Billy Crystal and the always excellent John Goodman put in a journeyman effort but their occupation of the AARP demographic while playing teenagers does raise the question of why Disney didn't just find some sound-a-like younger actors (Billy Crystal's ""Lawn Gyland"" accent invites easy imitation). The animation does present some great architectural shots and is colorful and entertaining. In short, had the original never existed ""Monster's U"" would sit as a pleasant but forgettable summer popcorn experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
studio recaptures the magic in this snappy prequel,"Pixar returns to form in this charming, laugh-out loud funny prequel to Monsters, Inc. The film focuses on Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan in their early days at MU when they were two young, ambitious, and fiercely competitive students trying to make their mark as scare majors. Eventually, circumstances force them to put aside their differences so they can try and accomplish their ultimate goal. Despite the familiarity of the characters, and an inevitable resolution, this feels like a fresh studio product with a good setup, clever and original gags, splendid animation, wonderful vocal talents, and an ingratiatingly feel-good tone. ***",,Anonymous,Animation
"""Monsters University"" proves a solid achievement while we wait for Pixars triumphant return.","It's tough to say if Pixar will ever return to the astonishing heights of their hay-day (If you count pretty much everything pre-Toy Story 3, excluding Cars). Since then they have churned out an unbelievably mediocre sequel, a well-designed, but bland original piece and I honestly felt I could be disappointed with this prequel to a wonderful film. I'm glad to say I was wrong, for the most part about Monsters University.Monsters University takes us back to the very beginning with Mike and Sulley's insertion into university. Were they the best of friends then? It's good to see that the Pixar team has tackled the story a little differently than you might expect. It opens up the possibilities for more exploration of character and truth be told, it only really finds that place during the final 20 minutes. What comes prior appears to boardline a Disney film in its cute factor and fluffy antics and the charm might not be as strong as Monsters Inc, but I felt enough laughs and wit squeezing through for to me feel welcomed back to the world.Monsters University proves a solid achievement that appeals strongly to the kids and has enough laughs and the odd thoughtful message for us adults. It shows that Pixar haven't continued down the hole that they fell into recently, but I wonder if they will ever scale their unbelievable heights again.

Entertainment on Monsters,"This is an unique idea to transform monsters to be something educated. How human can be their objective of learning and the biggest dream to award the scariest monster ever. Viewers perhaps find the different filming between Monsters University and Monsters Inc. Monsters University is more dramatic. Kids can lost the original story because of boring conversations on the middle, but the colorful screen and the humorous quotations help kids to imagine what coming next and what is the ending becoming to. The ending is simply mysterious, because some characters are mentally developed, not only Mike (the one eye). Mike is the trigger to present the genuine of each characters beside him. The good characters become vanished and the evil characters replace the main roles. The ideology that cartoon is always happy-ending perhaps can't stand in Monsters University because Monsters University delivers the new pop ideology.

Monster university review,I freaking love this movie like a lot. The animation was great. The overall plot line and storyline was great. It showed that sometimes you might not be able to do things on your own and make your dreams come true but if you work with someone else you can make both dreams come true together.

Managed to coast by because of the good will generated by Monsters Inc,"Some years ago my wife and I were honeymooning at Tokyo Disneyland. The Monsters Inc ride was one of our faves. She had a bright idea and bought the Monsters Inc popcorn container (without the popcorn). I remember asking her what she wanted that for.  She says I have to wait to find out. When she came back home, she took out the strap, carefully put in a used plastic bag and wala... It became a mini trash bin.  It now sits happily on our living room table and even has a blue helmetWe love Monsters Inc. It had an ingenious world and an inventive concept. The ending with Boo was heartrendingly poignant and sweet. Thank goodness Pixar didn't try to sequelize it because that ending can't be topped.  Instead they made a good move to pre- quelize it, essentially to tell the story of how Mike and Sulley's friendship began.The good thing about Monsters University is the familiarity with all the characters. Watching this feels like a warm fuzzy meeting with old friends. The Pixar staple visual and verbal gags are aplenty and executed with gusto. The Monsters world we all know.  The difference here is that the main story occurs in the university where monsters learn their craft. This part also feels very familiar through watching all the American TV series and movies with their education establishments as the backdrop. The plot is also formulaic and familiar, like all those losers-finally-win scenarios.  In short there is not much in MU that surprises me, unlike MI. But it's still an enjoyable movie.I think one of the main problems stopping MU from reaching stratospheric levels for me is it's lack of pathos. It was breezy enough but nothing moved me till late in the third act when Mike discovered what Sulley did to make their fraternity win. For me the real Pixar movie began there but by then it was so late in the game the idea couldn't gain a lot of traction. I also like MI's antagonist Randall who actually has his beginning here but his character arc feels very thread bare to me. The message and themes are well presented - nobody is a nobody, teamwork and friendship, but it just lacks the pathos to hit you in the heart.All in all MU is a good movie but not a great one. During supper my wife and I got talking and I asked her that since this is essentially a prequel, would watching MU without any knowledge of MI work in the movie's favour. She gave it a 5-second ponder and said nope. My thoughts exactly... MU managed to coast by because of the good will generated from the much beloved MI. Taken on its own MU is quite ordinary by Pixar's standards but IMHO Pixar has lost their cutting edge sometime back. For me their last great movie was Up.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Until interval, your eyes don't open with the usual sense of wonderment while watching Pixar movies. Post intermission, they do, oh yes they do!","A timid clownfish who travels hundreds of miles in search of his son and an amnesiac regal blue tang who guides him along. A rat who can cook teams up with a prestigious chef's illegitimate son who can't. A trash compactor robot on Earth who falls in love with an advanced robot visiting from outer space to inspect for signs of life. A grumpy old retired widower who flies along with his entire house to Paradise Falls and a tubby little sprightly boy scout who is accidentally carried along. These are some of the unique pairings that have wonderfully driven Pixar Animated Studios to Oscar glory. Now consider this : a green little monster who knows each and every way to scare but can't actually scare anybody, and his mighty college companion who can frighten one to death but is a one-trick pony. Does this Pixar pairing seem unique enough to hold up to its predecessors? No really...That's problem number one Pixar's latest venture MU has to overcome. Problem number two: the movie is a prequel. Pixar is hardly known to make prequels or sequels; its only super successful franchise is the Toy Story Series, which began in 1995 and has continued with two hugely acclaimed sequels, the third part being nominated for the prestigious Best Picture at the Oscars. The other known franchise is Cars, whose sequel Cars 2 cold barely score among critics (I adored both the films though).This seems to be the decade of sequels of Pixar; on one hand, MU comes ten years after the brilliant Monsters Inc, while on the other, Pixar classic Finding Nemo continues its legacy with Finding Dory, to be released in two years. Sequels or prequels is equal to familiarity, and we always expect Pixar to give us something new and original. Nobody bothers when rival studio Dreamworks clings to its green ogre Shrek to ask money, but we have come to expect much greater things from Pixar, so the thought of watching its memorable characters do another act disconcerts us because we've seen the best already.Problem number three: this movie is set in a college. You'd ask what's wrong about that? American Pie was set in college and it worked. But keep in mind why American Pie worked: it was an R rated comedy about the three-letter-word with a lot of four-letter- words used in their three-letter-word context. MU is G rated, and it's comedy involves watching the lunch lady serve garbage to students while freshers are given a totally positive picture during an orientation of MU conducted by a hyper-cheery girl. There are jock monsters, geek monsters, blonde monsters, prep monsters and other monsters of different shapes, sizes and colours in this university led by a staunch female dragon Dean. Oh so familiar you'd think if these were actors instead of monsters, this film would have been instantly forgotten.Some of the names are cringe-worthy too - the movie's protagonist Mike goes to 'Frighton' Elementary School as a child. Its a take on the word 'fright', get it?Uhm... not so bright. Also, you'd be surprised during this film to find sequences that remind you of other films. There's an 'initiation ceremony' that'll take you straight to the Ring of Fire sequence from Finding Nemo. The first part itself with the monster introductions feels similar to another animated film Hotel Transylvania, which albeit spent too much time showing one monster after the other. Five problems or rather challenges already, and does Pixar manage to overcome all of these? Yes, to a large extent it does.I'd probably use the word 'redeem' than overcome here; MU redeems itself by getting back its Pixar magic post interval. Until then, your eyes don't open with the usual sense of wonderment while watching Pixar movies. You want to be googly eyed like the protagonist Mike when he steps into MU for the first time, but you are unfortunately squinting instead. When you see his initial rivalry with Sullivan, you feel like you've seen all this before. Even when actress Helen Mirren unleashes her Miranda Priestley cum Sister Aloysius as Dean Hardscrabble, you still wait longing for signs of Pixar again, feeling as though you're watching a Dreamworks film that's been mistakenly marketed as Pixar's.By the interval, I'd coined the term 'Pixar's blot' for this film, because I found nothing to positively surprise me in this work. This term would not be used for this film at all, however, as the second half surprised me - in a big way.The film wakes up and becomes altogether special once Pixar's magic slowly fills in like the scare-meter used by students of MU to record scare-levels of children. Once Mike makes a wager with Dean Hardscrabble to retain him into the 'Scare Program' (he is suspended from the same for creating a chaos during their exam) if he stands the winner of a college event called 'Scare Games', he teams up with four other not-scary-in-the-slightest fraternity guys and his rival Sullivan, who's also suspended and joins their team Oozma Kappa only to get back into the program; when the team begs to understand each other's strengths and capabilities, you begin to see Pixar's flashing light that you were waiting for so long. There's an unexpected surprise I won't disclose here, and eventually the film's broader themes seem to have the depth of Pixar's earlier efforts. The only problem in the end is the first half itself, which although seems necessary after watching the whole film, has no moment of Pixar spark. That jumpy little lamp you see every time he logo appears (he's Luxor Jr., from an earlier short film) was probably on low voltage until the interval. Thank goodness everything turned out right afterwards and it burned bright. But I constantly was worrying the little bulb would blow out, and I don't want to get that that feeling again, not from Pixar.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"You might give it a passing grade, but as a comedy it fails.","Maybe because we know already from Monsters, Inc. that Mike and Sulley go on to work as a team on the scare floor of the powerful energy company, there is little drama in the conflict this prequel establishes. That would be less of a problem if the film were non-stop funny, but the humor in Monsters University is sadly lacking. In the past, when Pixar films have fallen short on the story level, they've been jam-packed with business and jokes -- like Mater's confrontation with a bidet in the underwhelming Cars 2 -- and breathtaking visual artistry. With Monsters University, it's possible that audiences may begin taking Pixar's continued state-of-the-art technical mastery for granted; people aren't as easily impressed if they don't care about what they're watching.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly fun,"When Pixar announced that they were making another Monsters Inc. I was so excited. A few months later, they said it would be a prequel telling the story of how Mike and Sulley went from enemies to friends, and my hopes fell. I mean, we see that they're friends, and have been for a long time, so can we just have a sequel where maybe they need Boo's help? We want more Boo! Then the trailers came out and my hopes were restored. ""This could actually be really good,"" I thought. I decided to give it a chance and I'm glad I did! It's funny, creepy, and has a lot of heart, and references to the original movie are abundant. (And yes, despite this being a prequel they did manage to have John Ratsenburger as The Abominable Snowman. Don't get too excited, though. He only has one line, but it's a funny line.)

I liked it but I expect a little more from Pixar films.,"'MONSTERS UNIVERSITY': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Pixar's animated prequel to their 2001 monster hit 'MONSTERS, INC.' reunites stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman as the voices of monsters Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan. The film tells of how the two met in college and sought after their dreams of becoming 'scarers', while constantly trying to outdo each other. It's a buddy film, like the first, and also Pixar's first campus college flick (in the same tradition as 'ANIMAL HOUSE'). It was directed by Dan Scanlon and written by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and Scanlon. It features supporting voice cast members like Steve Buscemi, Dave Foley, Charlie Day, Nathan Fillion, Aubrey Plaza, John Krasinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, Tyler Labine, Helen Mirren and John Ratzenberger (of course). I was not a huge fan of the original, despite the fact that I'm a big monster movie fan, and have always thought it to be one of Pixar's lesser films. I'd rank this prequel about the same, although it is quite a bit more impressive than Pixar's last animated sequel (2011's 'CARS 2').Crystal reprises his role as Mike Wazowski and Goodman once again plays James P. Sullivan. The two are best friends in the original film and work as scarers, scaring children in order to provide enough electricity to keep their city's power running. In this prequel they meet in college at 'Monsters University' (despite the fact that it's mentioned, in the original film, that they've known each other since the fourth grade). They're immediately rivals as Sullivan has always gotten by on his size and natural scary looks while Wazowski has had to work hard to be a scarer (despite the fact that he's not naturally scary at all). The film explores how they learn to overcome their differences and work together and respect one another.The movie is beautifully animated and full of great visuals (but it did reportedly cost over $270 million to make, making it one of the most expensive films ever made). It's funny in places but what I most like about it is it's creativeness with different creature characters (like the original). I hate animated films that are full of dumbed down kids humor but the Pixar films are usually better in this way (than most). This film is clever and full of good message for kids and it's creative but it's also full of college and buddy movie clichés and doesn't have a lot of new ideas to offer (other than the creative creatures). I liked it but I expect a little more from Pixar films. Having not liked the original and really disliking Pixar's last sequel I didn't have too high of expectations for this. It's a good film but not a great one I'd say.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAefz9rzS5w",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Fun, but unnecessary","I cannot say with a clear conscience that Pixar is lazy, as they are clearly productive with their output of short and feature-length films. I can only point out that they lack the ability to stay as creative as they are prolific. Their films are generally so good and beautiful-looking that the standard they set for themselves each time is quite high. ""Monsters University"" is another sequel, or in this case, prequel, to an existing hit, as opposed to an original story. Including ""Toy Story 2″ & ""3"", ""Cars 2″, as well as the upcoming ""Planes"" (a ""Cars"" spin off) and the announced ""Finding Dory"" (reaching theaters in 2016), this is the sixth project considered a continuation of their previous material. I never felt the 'Monsters, Inc' story needed to continue, or that I needed the back story of the Wazowski/Sullivan friendship, but Disney/Pixar gave it to us anyways. It's a wholly unnecessary movie, but like all Pixar films, it's better than 90% of the 'family' material given to us today.It won't take long to summarize what happens here, but I digress: Mike Wazowski (Crystal) dreams from a young age of becoming the best 'scarer' ever, and follows the path of his scaring 'hero' by attending Monsters University over other famed establishments such as Fear Tech. The first day of class, the ultimate monster jock, James P. Sullivan, (Goodman), doesn't even bring a pencil to class, and why would he? He's a Sullivan, and his father was a legendary 'scarer'. I think Pixar misses out on a huge opportunity here to introduce, at least as both characters are moving in, the parents. I, for one, would revel at the opportunity to see Mama Wazowski or the Sullivan family. What about brothers or sisters? In a movie that gives us the opportunity to see where these characters come from, and what their motivations are, it's odd to not see family, or hear any more about them other than a passing statement.The main event takes place as a result of a snafu by our main characters. Mike works hard, reads everything there is to read, and can't quite pull off 'scary' like Sully, who can scare without much of an effort. This isn't a new idea; there's always the bookworm versus jock storyline, so how do they get us to stay interested? The aforementioned 'snafu' causes both Mike and Sully to get booted from the scare program at the university (a pretty harsh punishment for first time offenders), a punishment handed down by the scary looking and inconsistent character Dean Hardscrabble (Mirren). Now we have our MacGuffin- how do the characters win back the favor of the dean? If you guessed there would be some competition involved, instead of going through a customary appeals process, as would be the norm, you got it! But wait, there's more! Of course, our 'at odds' heroes have to work together to win the 'Scare Games'. Cue an extended Pixar version of a montage, and voila! A resolution! (Every movie needs a montage .MONTAAAAAAAGE!!!)If you're detecting cynicism towards a perfectly innocent movie, you're correct. There's nothing wrong with ""Monsters University"" as an innocent, better-than-most-every-kid-movie-around movie, but as an innovative, wholly emotional, memorable film, it fails. Sure, Charlie Day's 'Art' character is quirky and fun, but doesn't get enough screen time, and Joel Murray's 'Don Carlson' is great, but since ""Fargo"", we've been inundated with the Minnesota Swede accent as a cute trait far too many times. Maybe what's missing here is a bit more heart. So, we're missing a 'Boo' type of character from the first movie, or at least more than simply an origin story of sorts to make this memorable. Or necessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing,"Just returned from seeing Monsters U. My wife and I both loved the original Monsters Inc. It was original, funny in bits, and worth the price of admission.Monsters U is not original not particularly funny. While there were some funny bits, the trailers contain many of them. Both Crystal and Goodman do good jobs in the film, providing the voices of the main characters, but the script really lets them down.In case you can't figure it out, it's pretty much the story of MIke and Sully attending Monsters U, one of the universities of the monster world (other universities are alluded to but not seen).In reality, you have seen this movie. Two mis-matched people (read monsters) are thrown together (in college) and they try to succeed (or graduate in this case). Crystal is the hard- working brainiac, who studies constantly, while Sully is the 'natural', the one that does not have to work. At times, things are rough for them, then they come together, events pull them apart, and eventually ... well, you know the rest.But the problem is that it's just not that funny. It has some poignant moments, some serious moments, some joyous moments, some sad moments, some very creative moments, but really, what you really want are more funny moments, and they are just not there.Crystal still has genius timing and delivery, but the lines and situations are just too predictable. Sully can let loose some chilling roars when he needs to, and is a better actor than I would have thought in the tender moments, but his lines are not that great either.IMO, if you liked the Original Monsters, Inc, watch that again, and don't bother with this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not among Pixar's greatest animations,"""You don't study scaring, you just do it.""I wasn't a huge fan of the original animated film, but I still enjoyed it enough to want to go check out this prequel, Monsters University. I have to admit that Pixar rarely makes a bad film (with the exception of Cars 2) so obviously expectations are always really high for these kind of films. I wasn't blown away by their latest effort, Brave, and I kind of felt the same way about Monsters University. It was a charming film with some funny moments and some heart, but it wasn't up to par with Pixar's greatest films. It had a pretty simple message for kids: fight for your dreams and even if you don't accomplish them you will still find what you are good at along the way and everything will work out. Billy Crystal and John Goodman do some great voice work once again here for their memorable characters, Sullivan and Mike. The animation was also excellent, and Pixar is probably the best at this department with some great art work. I had a fun time at the theaters, but wasn't blown away this time and felt a bit disappointed. It was very formulaic and the character development was pretty weak for a Pixar film, but I still laughed during several scenes so I still have to give this film a passing grade.The story works as a sequel as it focuses on Mike's (Billy Crystal) early years. In a school visit to Monsters Inc. Mike discovers he wants to become a scarer and so the film jumps in time to when he enrolls at Monsters University and begins to major as a scarer. Here he meets Sully (John Goodman) who he really dislikes. They seem to always be competing with each other until a series of unfortunate events makes the pair team up with each other to overcome their odds. Mike and Sully cause a disturbance and Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) expels them from the program. This forces Mike and Sully to team together for the school's scare games once the Dean acknowledges the possibility of them reentering the program if they win. The problem is that they have some fierce competition and they have to team up with the sorority group of Oozma Kappa, a bunch of outcasts who have no experience at being scarers. Thus the film turns into a classic underdog competition (Revenge of the nerds style). Randy (Steve Buscemi) is also in this prequel, who surprisingly was Mike's friendly roommate. Something happens during the film which will make him turn into the classic villain we saw in Monster Inc.The film is pretty formulaic, but I found it entertaining to see how the friendship between Mike and Sully began after being such fierce rivals. I also was surprised to discover Randy wasn't your typical villain, he was friendly once and something happens to him that causes him to change his behavior. Overall this is probably one of Pixar's weakest efforts, but it is still a charming fun film and one kids will enjoy. These are all likable characters and the only person who he really miss from Monsters Inc. is the lovable Boo. Despite not being a great film, I still would recommend it for kids, and I think adults will have a lot of fun if they don't go see it with high expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Welcome to College... Monster Style,"Hello all and welcome to another review by Robbie K. This weekend we start our reviews off with the latest creation from Pixar animation studios, a company that has made many adventures for both young and old to enjoy. Like most animation studios, Pixar has had its ups and downs, but one thing that continues to shine through is the incredible animation their team puts together. Yet lately it seems that the design team has been running out of options, resulting in sequels, spin offs, or as we are seeing this weekendprequels. So gear up and grab something to drink as I share my thoughts on Monsters University.Many fell in love with the colorful universe that is Monster's Inc. and many more fell in love with the big fluff ball Sully and his lovable little human pet Boo. Yet from many of my friends and some reviewers, there was doubt that this movie would fail, since it's the dynamic duo of scaring, only this time going to school. So what did this reviewer think of the movie? I had fun watching this movie and had quite a few laughs with all the comedic punches it threw. For one thing the college world created by Pixar was very fun, colorful, and for me quite relevant that added that emotional link that can make or break a movie. The designers took great care in designing the various buildings, quads, and other campus qualities that decorate the numerous brochures and commercials. Yet the more impressive thing to this reviewer is the student lifestyle captured within the hallowed halls of MU. Hopeful geeks who want to be cool, jocks and frat bros who are stereotypical jerks, and those overzealous studiers who spend every waking moment learning the information provided in books. Yet the personalities aren't the only thing about these characters that made me laugh. Ridiculous voices, off the wall antics and hilarious faces are all in this movie. Combine this with a fun and kid friendly dialog and the fantastic voice acting, and you get a recipe for a fun summer movieNow if you think this is just going to be a cute movie that only kids will laugh at, then you've got some surprises in store. MU is filled with those stereotypical college situations that will have many laughing their heads off at the ridiculousness that arises. Don't flip out, this doesn't mean, for once, experimenting with drugs, getting liquored up, or going all the way with a female monster, this is after all a G movie. Instead Monster's University focuses on a Revenge of the Nerd motive, taking oddballs who work hard, or naturally gifted, and placing them in a world that ostracizes them for not fitting the scary cloth. Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sully's (John Goodman) group are kid friendly version of the 80's group, having very unique personalities and talents that make you pity, love, and laugh at them all at the same time. Older generations will enjoy the jabs at the culture they may have experienced, while kids of all ages, and kids at heart, will giggle and scream in laughter at the embarrassing and ridiculous accidents that happen to them. When the scare games begin, the laughs get better as the montage training, accident prone competitions, and geek vs. jock rumbles begin. Perhaps the funniest factor for me though, had to be how I matched up the characters to my friends and their mannerisms. With this connection in made the movie even better for this reviewer.It wouldn't be a Disney movie though without those moments that make your heart melt, women say ooooooh, or somehow inspire you to do great things. Monsters University is filled to the brim with these moments, and like the comedy there is some relevance to the lessons they try to teach. While some may be cheesy, Pixar and Disney did a nice job building these moments into the movie to help add the dramatic effect in the silly universe. While the younger audience members will not get as much out of this, older ones will find the problems the protagonists experience, dare I say it relevant, that helps add more emotion to the film that doesn't involve a goofy face. Regardless the other reason for these moments is probably to help develop these characters further; helping to show how our lovable pals grew into the personalities we saw years earlier. As for fans of the series who have watched Monster's Inc. multiple times, you get to see some nice tie ins and references to the first movie that will make many scream with excitement.Of course there are some weaknesses in this movie that take away from the movie for me. One is, this movie is very predictable, most likely because we have already seen the fate of our heroes. Two, there are some very kiddy moments that, I know are meant to entertain the kids, but get a little overdone after the fifth time we have seen them. Three some of the other monsters we liked in the original movie get a little short sighted in this movie, including the protagonists. Finally, I was hoping to see a few other college aspects that I have experienced, though I guess we have movies like Pitch Perfect and Old School to cover those bases. With the exception of the predictability though, these weaknesses didn't hurt my score for this movie too much.Monster's University is a very fun prequel, and will be a definite for those with young family members or friends. Don't think though that this movie isn't for adults as well, because there is enough fun adventure that entertained most of the older audience members in my showing. With fun characters, stupid comedic antics, and some decent character development, I call this another victory for Pixar. My scores for this movie are:Animation/Comedy: 9.0 Movie Overall: 8.5",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as good as the first but still decent.,"Monsters University is a pretty decent movie but it lacks a lot of the charm the first film had. I think a lot of that has to do with how original the story was initially and how that unique element is lost a bit in further iterations. I think Boo provided a lot of the charm in the first movie as well. It wasn't so obvious until watching a movie without her. Obviously Mike and Sully were both great but the competition with which the film is built upon feels a little weak. I know, it's a children's movie, but that's kind of the problem. While Monsters, Inc. was a film that the adults could appreciate, this one is more of a pure kiddy flick. It's still entertaining to a certain extent but without a lot of the depth from the first one, it's ultimately just a fun kids movie and not much more.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best looking animated films on Blu-Ray,"Explores the origins of the Monsters Inc. universe when Sully and Mike weren't always the best of friends. Central to the experience, is the atmosphere. Pixar picked the perfect art style, with meticulous life- like attention to detail but also lots of color and personality. The animation is top-notch and it looks fantastic. It's thrilling, full of personality and entertaining the whole way through.It doesn't have the same innovation that the original had, so I'm less interested in rewatching it. It does follow the bandwagon of tropes in college frat movies: jocks vs nerds, book smarts vs. innate talent, underdog vs. groomed successor and so on. But it promotes good morals of friendship and honesty for children.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will Pixar ever let go of my childhood?,"The first Monsters Inc film came out when I was 10 having this film come out in 2013 with me going to University feels so right and is proof that these films are made for adults as well as kids. The film itself is a great story of the friendship between the impeccable duo Mike and Sully when they weren't on good terms with each other although we know what the outcome is, the journey throughout the movie of these 2 characters is great to witness. Although the film never really captures what University life is like and never really relying on funny material from that scenario it instead creates a funny cast of memorable monsters. Although it isn't as good as the first film Monsters University is a great nostalgic throwback to my childhood. Just like Toy Story 3 and most likely the eagerly anticipated Finding Dory.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not that bad, better than the original","I'm not a big fan of the Pixar movies - I've not seen them all (and don't plan to) and I outright hate The Incredibles, for examples. Having said that, I liked this one. It is definitely an OK movie for a ""one-time watch"" and is more interesting and well animated than the original one. To be honest, I never got the appeal of Monsters Inc. and why it was considered one, if not the, best Pixar films... What more could be said about ""University"" ? It is very pretty and beautifully animated, but for Pixar is not an achievement . It complements the universe of monsters with new parts of the world , but not beyond anything outlined in ""Inc."". Sometimes it is a desperately short flight of imagination and poetry, but sometimes it takes the original most banal clichés.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just look at the title and move along. You've seen it all,"I don't even need to write spoilers in this review: the title IS the spoiler. Everything that you could expect from a college flick is here, only in lightweight, kid-friendly fashion. Everything that is utterly abominable and predictable about that kind of film is included here, which reveals that the writers are very good at following checklists.Of course, everything is transplanted into the stupid concept of a monster world generating energy from kids screaming. Maybe I was wrong, but the idea of the first film was to show something fantastic and scary in this world as something boringly institutional in a fantasy world. Creepy as it is (not in the good sense, but in the ""child molester"" sense), at least there's an inch of creativity in that concept. In this prequel, the employees are turned into superstar heroes. That is, the only thing that's marginally interesting about the original movie is discarded here in the name of an utterly dull and irritating college flick. Honestly, you can't write something like that before killing off a good portion of your brain cells.Of course there is forced pathos. Of course there's the awkward attempt at creating tension and emotion. After all, Pixar still has to please the sycophants. But make no mistake: if you have the lowest expectations about this movie just looking at the title and the premise, you'll just confirm it if you watch it. Now if you're really anxious because you're such a massive Pixar fan, you'll love it before you even see anything.But do keep in mind that my opinion is a wee bit biased. After all, when the movie started, I was already trying to go into a self-induced coma because of the atrocious short the preceded the film, ""The Blue Umbrella"". Hey, did you see that Internet meme about things with faces? Let's rip-off that idea and make an ""artistic"" little film on that! The sycophants will be on their knees!",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
MU,"Just as fun as Inc, but lacking the heart. Is this necessarily a bad thing? Not really, but I do think the heart in Inc made it a more engaged viewing for older viewers.Don't get me wrong, I really liked this movie, it's pacing is great. But it is a ''oddball freshman going to college'' type of movie, and if you kind of know the formula of those types of movies, this does not stray from it. It's got all the stereotypes, the jocks, nerds, girls, goths. But this movie has the bonus of being fantastically voiced, animated, and designed. That is what saves it, being a Pixar movie, saved it.Going from 2001 to 2013, man the visuals. This movie looks STUNNING and I was already saying that about Inc at times. There's just a satisfaction in watching it.The music I didn't find as memorable, it's good, as expected with Newman, but I feel like the movie could've been used in other college movies. So it's appropriate to the theme of the movie, but just not that memorable. That said, I really enjoyed my time. It's even more of a ''just plain fun'' movie than Inc.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Prequel not up to par to original film, but good enough","Monsters Inc. was a very innovative movie with a very original premise. Ah the golden days of Pixar! The story, the characters, everything was new and surprising.Obviously with this prequel the newness is not there anymore; we already know the world of the monsters and some of the characters. The new ones don't really add anything to this universe but are just new variations on the old theme.The story is relatively cliché, although things turn out a little differently than we would expect for Mike and Sully by the end of the movie. We all know what college/university movies are going to show us, and what's the story line in underdogs movies. But in this movie, I must say there's an undercurrent or realism that's pretty interesting, in the way the story deals with the transformation of its main protagonists.The characters of Mike and Sully start off as big stereotypes, but they get more subtle as the story progresses. I also liked the way the character of the ""mean teacher"" was approached. There was a most welcome balance in the portrayal of a tough teacher that has ultimately good motives, if not a lot of compassion or flexibility.All in all this movie is not a bad way to spend an evening, although I must say I much preferred the first one. But it's definitely not as bad as Cars 2 was.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A prequel that is every bit as good as the original,"This prequel to the highly successful and popular 2001 film ""Monsters Inc."" came out of nowhere in 2013. The film charts the origins of Mike and Sully before their scarer days at Monsters Inc. I remembering going to see this and not expecting much, in fact I was just hoping that it didn't end up being an embarrassment to the original. But I was pleasantly surprised and having watched it again last night, I can safely say that it is every bit as good, if not better, than ""Monsters Inc."" Monster's University (MU) is a vibrant place and the script writers did a commendable job in utilising all of it's possibilities. There are fraternities, house-parties and everything else associated with university life, allowing the film to be just as much accessible to adults aswell as children. There are euphemisms and jokes for the grown-ups aplenty. The cast of monsters are very enjoyable and unique in their own right, and the film also charts the origins of Randal (voiced by Steve Buscemi), Sully and Mike's arch-rival in ""Monsters Inc.""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lacks the trademark 'Pixar' touch!,"I thought this sequel (or prequel, if you want to call it that) would improve upon its predecessor, but I was wrong. Not only was this bleaker in terms of the narrative, the little bit of soul the previous one had is now gone, and we are left with a generic redemption arc about a band of misfits that had been done to death already.Yes, the visuals and the overall animation quality have improved, but that was a given, especially when you consider that these two movies have a long twelve years of gap between them, and the technology has evolved greatly. Although the same cannot be worded about the writing, it seemed like it went backwards!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters University Delivers,"Pixar's ""Monsters University"" is hysterical and unexpectedly touching. Finally, saw it a couple weeks ago. MU is predictable, given that it is a prequel to Pixar's animated classic ""Monsters Inc."" Billy Crystal and John Goodman wonderfully return as the voices of Mike, basically a walking eyeball, and Sulley, the towering blue and purple hairy monster. I saw ""Monsters University"" in 2D not 3D, and still the picture had amazing visual depth. First time Director Dan Scanlon creates a natural warmth and testiness among this ensemble mash-up. He along with writers Daniel Greson and Robert L. Baird upholds the lineage of all the great Pixar movies: they have amazing stories. Randy Newman's score is on point with whimsy and wacky sentimentality. Yes, the animation is robust and vibrant down to the detail of Sulley's shedding hair.""Monsters University"" is almost as good as ""Monsters Inc."", though what it loses in originality is balanced by Mike and Sulley's transformed friendship. The polarized future buddies meet in the Scare Program at MU. Mike (Billy Crystal) is the text book scare nerd. Sulley (John Goodman) is the Big Monster on Campus knowing he can get by on the Sullivan name. The rivals meet their true nemesis and mentor in Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren), the staid multi-legged insect-like creature. The almost indistinguishable Mirren has an omniscient presence that gravitates. She eloquently states the obvious to Mike, ""You are just not scary."" She knows that Sulley is skating on raw talent without character. Consequently, Mike and Sulley are forced into alliance with not so scary Oozma Kappa Fraternity, one of whose members is Squishy—very telling. They must overcome implausible odds and win the MU Scare Games, their last gasp at redemption.At the story arc during the Scare Games, in Rocky-like fashion Sulley tells Mike, ""You can't change who you are!"" Rather you have to get who you are. Crystal and Goodman are brilliant as Mike and Sulley discover that their partnership is way greater than its individual parts. That may be the beauty of ""Monsters University"". Friendship, respect and love foster greatness in Monsters and people. Director Scanlon refreshingly and wryly reminds us of this in ""Monsters University"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will adults enjoy this?,"Let's face it... that's an important question every parent asks, because, at the end of the day, we know it'll be us who have to sit through this film as well as our kids. Children tend to be able to sit through most films/TV as long as it has cute characters and lots of primary colours. But us adults' eyes tend to start to glaze over as we pray for the end credits to roll.That was why films like 'Toy Story' and 'Shrek' were so popular - because they were just as enjoyable for adults as kids. Luckily, 'Monsters University' tends to lean towards those. It's probably not technically as good and/or funny as either, but it will definitely entertain the kids while not annoying the adults who have to watch it with them.Obviously, if you liked the humour/characters in the first film (Monsters Inc) then you'll probably love this, too. However, even if you haven't seen it, you and your kids will easily pick up the plot. Of course there are the usual moral messages which go over the youngsters' heads and us oldies roll our eyes at.But, at the end of the day, it's a fun film which the kids will probably want to watch again and again. And, even better still, we won't be that bothered to sit through it with them.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Disappointing! 4/10,"Review: Like many other Pixar movies, you can't fault the look and feel of the movie, but it was a bit too kiddie for me. Usually that mix it up with adult and children humour, but this is just a straight out kids movie. It does look amazing through and you can see the hard work that the animation team went through, but it doesn't touch the first movie which was original and much more funnier. The new characters in this sequel, wasn't that great, and the storyline was a bit corny. I liked the twist near the end, which was unpredictable, but not enough to save the movie. It's definitely one for the kids, who will really enjoy it, and judging by the money that it made, they surely did. Watchable!Round-Up: Billy Crystal's voice as Mike, was pretty annoying after a while but John Goodman's voice really does suit Sulley. The attention to detail on each of the characters was brilliant along with the colours that were used by the Pixar studio. The race with the pink spiky balls made me laugh, but it does seem like Pixar are missing the magic that they had with movies like a Toy Story and the original Monster Inc. Maybe it's because they have moved Disney? Anyway, if you want the kids to sit in front of the TV whilst your cleaning the house, then this is the movie for you, but for adult entertainment, it's just average.Budget: $200million Worldwide Gross: $744million (WOW!)I recommend this movie to people who were fans of the original Monsters Inc. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent movie with no flaws.,"I feared Pixar had finally spoiled their creative touch and had come down with a terrible case of sequelitis... but then I actual saw ""Monsters University."" This film is a joy to experience from beginning to end. It's utterly gorgeous on a technical level sure, but it also transcends the various clichés that could have been with such a touched- on premise. The result is a special film that more than does the terrific ""Monsters Inc"" justice. A really thrilling prequel, always funny and exciting, that takes the clichéd premise of overcoming our own limits and turns it into endless fun - and it will leave you sure that Pixar is finally back on track after its two previous weak, forgettable entries.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Solid Comedy and Family Film,"People can be very reactionary. After lukewarm reviews of Brave, a few were already talking about the death of Pixar. I give companies more room than that to screw up, but I was growing apprehensive, to be honest. If Monsters University wasn't good, it would be the fourth film in a row to underwhelm me. (Toy Story 3's ending was great, but the rest was just alright)Monster's University is a prequel, so we're lounging around already explored territory. We also have a good idea how the film will end as soon as we begin. It also borrows heavily from every college movie ever made, without a lot of parody.I still had fun. :VIts a bright, colorful, and funny film, with some of the best laughs I had that year. Mike and Sully are still good characters - they are mean to each other at first, but you do see them gradually form their friendship.But my favorite part about the movie is its message. The whole ""believe in yourself"" shtick, although a noble idea, is often the last resort for movies trying to find something to teach. Just look at Shrek 3 and Foodfight! Monsters University slaps those movies in the face, showing that sometimes, you will fail, even if you try hard. But life goes on, and with hard effort, you'll eventually find your place. Considering the poorly-reviewed Turbo and Planes also came out in Summer 2013, Monsters University sticks out as intelligent, not falling for the clichés of cash-ins.My biggest complaint is that Randall's role is one step above cameo. He could have been removed entirely, and we wouldn't have noticed. Ah well. Its still a fine movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The best animated movie of 2013 yet by far,"Monster university is simply put an amazing film why? Because it has a little something for every one . I will be soon going to an graduate school so i could relate to the majority of the references and gags.But most important it does not have a traditional animated ending . This is one of the times where there truly is an adult life lesson.After endless generic fantasy endings I could say one of the best end segments in the history of Pixar.If you try hard , success is not always assured But you can enjoy these small moments and make the most of it . Eventually you will achieve Success by thinking in the right direction positively.I could watch over and over and still laugh especially at the O K ""Initiation"" Part .

Delightful,"This movie brings back the characters we loved from the previous one and gives us a nice throwback to their beginnings. Typical college-laughs and situations that can be extremely related to reality makes both kids and adults enjoy and laugh from the very first minute to the end. A very G rated approach to college life sytle with the bully-juggies, the studying guy, pretty girls, outcasts, goths amongst many others. Pixar really never fails to amaze me. Like in their previous movies, every little detail is thought and applied form the main characters to the background settings of the movie. An absolute go-see. Oh, and parents, don't go and throw your children to the movies, you might as well enjoy it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Refreshing movie of college.....Pixar style,"Although I may not be the public's view or the best critic in the world. My opinion as a movie loving person, regardless of movie type (or social age expectation), has to be that Pixar has outdone itself in Monsters University (MU). The movie is a great way to show how playful and serious college can be, but with a twist and childhood fun that many of us believe college can be. This movie, albeit mainly propaganda towards kids and families, does have a charm for those attending college/universities, as they can relate to some of the actions in the movie (as is the case for me).The movie starts out with a short animation film of the Blue Umbrella, quite entertaining and with a wonderful storyline.The movie by itself, is a great work of animated cinematographic work. Although it is mostly CGI, with the use of realistic sounds and background art, makes the movie appear to come to life, as you were right there in the film (3-D or no 3-D). It keeps you laughing, entertained and happy all at the same time. Monsters University in my humble opinion, will be set apart as one of the great sequels Pixar has made in the past few years; with expectation to the hugely awaited Toy Story 3, as a great family movie as well as one that has a good chance of creating a series for the Monsters Inc. brand.I do greatly hope that Pixar could create this into a Trilogy or expand it into something great. Doing so however, without losing it's charm and playful nature that has attracted us to it from the beginning will be a challenge. A challenge that I hope Pixar will gladly make it into a future success.Kudos to Pixar for creating a great movie once again!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Safe and Familiar but Generally Inessential,"Cute, inoffensive family fare; it's nice to get back in touch with two of my favorite Pixar characters, but this film is so light, airy and spacious I couldn't help wondering if we all might have been better served by a short featurette. Most of the returning secondary cast is relegated to brief cameos - particularly Steve Buscemi's serpentine villain Randall, who pops in and out in a set of very brief flashes - and their replacements generally play one note at best. In its heart, Monsters U is dying to mimic the kind of campus-friendly formula perfected by Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds, but it's kneecapped by a much younger target audience and the cast feels almost universally shoehorned into unfamiliar terrain. It enjoys some lively moments and a few solid laughs, plus the banter between Goodman and Crystal is as sharp as ever, but the scope feels much, much smaller than the preceding Monsters Inc. and the story never really shifts out of first gear.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the original,"I loved it! I didn't even like the original because it was too slow and emotional. This had big laughs, fast pace and emotion without feeling boring.

Still, I had a good enough time watching this and also hearing Steve Buscemi again as one of the college students was a hoot to listen to. Oh, and I recognized another of the voices as that of a Murray brother but I thought it was Brian Doyle-Murray and not Joel! And, yes, Billy Crystal and John Goodman are once again charming enough as the lead voices here.

"Certainly not pixar's best, but still an enjoyable film","I love Pixar, and one of my favorite movies is Monsters Inc. So i was really looking forward to it. It didn't quite measure up to the original, but it is still an enjoyable film. The only thing i didn't like was that it was an unoriginal story, it was, essentially, revenge of the nerds with monsters. That kind of disappointed me. Pixar has succeeded because of their fantastic storytelling, and that definitely was the worst part. Other than that, it was funny, and heartwarming, things that normally see from pixar. Billy Crystal and John Goodman were great with the voice work. I certainly find it better that Brave, and Cars 2, so its a step in the right direction for pixar, after 2 decent attempts.

An Unimpressive Letdown,"What happened to the Pixar studios of Disney? Back then, they were churning out all the hits with the ""Toys Story"" series (and all three movies were terrific and never let us down), ""Finding Nemo,"" ""The Incredibles,"" ""Ratatouille,"" and ""Up,"" to name a few. There has also been Pixar movies which were also hits, but disappointed me, such as ""A Bug's Life,"" the two ""Cars"" movies, and ""Wall-E."" And I would like to advise that between ""Monsters, Inc."" and ""Monsters University,"" please save your hard-earned cash in this recession, and continue to watch the former. The latter is a tedious example which cannot properly explain how Mike and Sully met, just a series of throwaway pieces and recycling of other college movies. This is supposed to be a prequel, but it is still nothing.What made ""Monsters, Inc."" special is the budding friendship of Mike and Sully, and the message was that despite their monstrous exteriors, the guys have good hearts. But here in ""Monsters University,"" Mike (Billy Crystal) is depicted as a twerpy nerd from his school days, and Sully (John Goodman) ignores Mike until they meet again at college. The two have to contend with the conniving Randall (Steve Buscemi), who in both movies, manipulates his way to the top. He gets to fit with the ""cool"" guys before becoming the top scarer at the Monsters factory, which Buscemi played better in the first film. They also have to contend with the usual stereotypes. Helen Mirren is perfectly cast as the crusty flying dragon Dean Hardscrabble, who, if the boys are not scary enough, they get thrown out of the university. This allows Mirren to parody her upper-crust, ever-so-proper, British stuffed- shirt that she plays so well over the years. Mirren does the best acting in the movie and tops both Crystal and Goodman. Then there are all the big guys on campus, the giggling, snooty sorority girls, the prim librarian, and no fraternity will accept them except for an underdog ""nerd"" fraternity called Oozma Kappa, aka OK, because they are the least intimidating.Does this sound familiar? Yes, it does, if you grew up on watching the 1984 college comedy ""Revenge of the Nerds"", as I did. But today's children will not get the R-rated ""Revenge of the Nerds,"" which played so hilariously the nice outsiders getting even with the mean athletes. There are also parodies of ""Animal House"" , including the opening collegiate music and the frat house parties. That can also be over a young child's head. Note that in ""Monsters University,"" there are improper plays on fraternity alphabets such as ROR - Roar Omega Roar (which Randall is a part of because they roar nastily, not to mention that the Omegas were the antagonistic fraternity to the Deltas in ""Animal House""), and OK (the most benign fraternity on the campus that is hated by the rest of the school until they find a way to win the Greek games). Also, the Greek games were integral in ""Nerds,"" and three-quarters of ""Monsters University"" dominates the Greek games. Surely enough, OK wins the admiration of the whole school except Hardscrabble, still nobody's fool, and she eventually expels the Mike and Sully for cheating their way to the top and breaking and entering into a monster factory, as the guys continue to establish themselves. At least Mike is honest with himself and tries to help everyone, but Sully looks to cheat to win.This movie wavers from recycling of raunchy classic college comedies, which is sensationally inappropriate for young audiences, to overcooked sentiment that tries to bleed our tears, but there were no laughs in the theater we saw it in and everyone walked out with dry eyes. I can remember sniffling out of ""Toy Story 3"" because the message was so well done in which as we get older, we have to give away our valuable possessions of toys.I am definitely looking forward to seeing ""Despicable Me 2."" I really cannot wait to see this. Steve Carell has done everything to promote it, and whether he is a good movie, and occasionally, a bad movie, such as 2008's highly promoted but disappointing ""Get Smart,"" Carell has the ability to overcome poor material with his strong performances. I recently watched ""Despicable Me"" on movies on demand, and my husband and I were ""howling"" when as Gru steals the moon, a werewolf stops howling and turns back into a man. That's funny stuff. ""Monsters University"" has turned out to be a warm-up for the supposedly greater creation, which I think will be ""Despicable Me 2."" This is not the first time a lousy animated movie precedes the greater one. I waited quite briefly for ""Monsters University"" today. However, with ""Despicable Me 2,"" you shall be waiting on a long line for a long time this Fourth of July.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Here's hoping future Pixar sequels are at the very least as good as ""Monsters University""","With last years near-unbearable Brave, the just-for-kids Cars 2 and news of the prequel to Monsters Inc. and a sequel to Finding Nemo, it seemed like Pixar had fully converted into a money printing factory. Where had the heart gone? Toy Story 3 had their best and warmest heart yet, is that the best it's gonna get? Perhaps it'll be impossible for Pixar to reach that level of emotion again given that the Toy Story franchise had 15 years of emotional investment behind it all. So much time for the idea of Andy growing up to play in our imaginations. It's hard to believe that Monsters Inc. was almost that long ago now and it probably played with our imaginations more than Toy Story did with its incredibly ambitious concept.Actually, it's mind-boggling how the Pixar team even managed to narrow the idea down to the characters, the culture of the world and the story they ended up going with. It's impressive that the timeless team of Sulley and Mike really, really worked. But that's why the idea of Monsters University is really disappointing. The world at the end of Monsters Inc. changed forever, how can a prequel inform us any more about the characters or the world? Instead, it ends up a giant dramatic irony that the characters obsess over something the audience knows is redundant, especially that Mike wants to be something we know he won't become.But rather than feeling like their goals are useless, it does actually end up quite entertaining to watch the characters become the ones we know and love today even if the film immediately slumps to a bar that could never touch the original. Trading Mike for Sulley as the protagonist this time around, Monsters University starts off adorably as we watch little Mike see the Scare Floor for the first time. It's wonderful as we feel the magic and wonder of seeing that concept for the first time again. It's no surprise that the film's best early merits are in the nostalgia it can easily stir.When it finally gets into the swing of things at the University itself, it does feel quite disappointing as it gets into a by-the-numbers plot as it moves onto episodic structure of classes then crisis, then games then crisis and so on with scattered hijinks throughout. I heard the film was more funny than emotional but I found that the gags were only okay. I saw it in a theater packed with kids and the laughs were few and far between. Obviously, one of the things that played with our imagination the most as kids was creating new monsters which, obviously, Monsters University delights in doing so.Thankfully, the new characters are quite charming and although they don't necessarily have satisfying individual arcs, their use in the finals of the Scare Games was great fun.However, with the film's easygoing nature, it really didn't prepare me for its surprise third act. When you think it's all over at the hour and a half mark, it takes a turn and then it steps into the extremes you didn't think the film was capable of where we really see Mike and Sulley become a team. With that third act, it milks the emotional investment in the characters and gives a great satisfying finale to an otherwise average film where we thought nothing could possibly happen. I guess the magic and heart wasn't lost after all, it was just buried deep in the running time and left me with a big smile on my face. Here's hoping the future Pixar sequels go the way of Monsters University at the very least.6/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nostalgia Trip!,"From the moment Billy Crystal steps off the bus as an adult Mike Wasowski, there were chills and tears. Because that's Disney (although in this instance working in conjunction with Pixar) for you: they know exactly what strings to pull to stir up the right emotions. It's not enough to just bring thee characters back; you have to justify their existence. And this film does.It's not an essential entry in the Pixar cannon at all. It really doesn't expand upon the plot of the original, nor does it give a whole lot that makes re-watching the original any more meaningful. What it does do, however, is give you an hour and a half to spend time with old friends. And, if you're someone like me, it's been way too long since I sat down to Billy Crystal as Mike Wazowski and John Goodman as James P. Sullivan. Heck, even Steve Buscemi's Randall's appearance brought up a fresh little wave of nostalgia.One of the best things about Pixar that this film demonstrates is that they're not afraid to let their characters breathe. They went back in time with this one, and the progression of the story flows so organically that you can really appreciate the fact that this could very well be how things went down in the earlier years before the gang was employed by Monsters, Incorporated. It doesn't hold up quite as well as the original - which is to be expected, really - but it's a pretty solid movie. It had two distinct laugh-out-loud moments for me, which is rare, and it was just designed to be a really fun film to watch. Mission accomplished.Favorite line was when the monsters leave their mother in the car and she said, very sweetly, ""I'll just be here listening to my tunes...."" and begins blaring out death metal music. Out of absolute nowhere, but I appreciated it so much.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Probably the best sequel of Pixar 8/10,"""Monsters University"" is the perfect sequel to ""Monsters, inc."" that could have been made by Pixar. It is funny, original and creative in so many ways. To make a sequel to Monsters inc. That happens in the past before the event of the first movie, in which this movie happens in university is great and amusing. I had a blast watching this movie and it was so much fun just like the first film. Mike Wazowski (Crystal) and Jimi Sullivan (Goodman) and fantastic characters as always and give a lot of emotion towards the film. Seeing them in their College years was funny because you see how different they are from the first movie. The other characters a.k.a Oozma Kappa are funny as hell and creative monsters. I enjoyed every moment of them on screen. I don't see anything wrong with this film, I guess it was so entertaining and good that I had no problems with it. I recommend all Pixar fans to rewatch it for fun.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Monsters University, A Surprisingly Good Movie","12 years after the first was released into theaters and was a great kids movie all around, comes 'Monsters University', prequel to 'Monsters Inc.' It follows the story of Mike and Sully's days in college before they became monsters who scared kids. I thought that since it's been 12 years, and Disney might have lost it, and that the plot was kind of stupid (Monsters University?) I didn't think it would be that good of a movie. It surprised me, though.After the title sequence of this movie, it just builds up for a little bit, which is okay, but it just continues to build up. After it's been ""building up"" for a while, you think... This is just slow! Eventually it does pick up, though. There were some things that happened in this movie that I didn't expect at all, but some things were very predictable. Overall, it's a kids movie, and it was hard to keep that in mind.As you've seen from the trailers, Mike and Sully are not friends at the beginning of this movie, and one of the plot points in this movie is them slowly becoming friends. I didn't just give you a spoiler, don't freak out. So, I thought that was a good idea because of how they were just friends in 'Monster's Inc.' without explanation. They didn't know each other until college, and they didn't start out as friends. We've kind of seen that before, though. Anyway, even though I thought was a good idea, I didn't think they executed it very well. They're not friends for a while, and when they become friends, it just kind of... Happens really fast. There was a little time building up to them becoming friends, and I could see them becoming friends coming up, but it just happened really fast and you're like ""Okay... So... They're, friends now?"" So, they could have done that better, but there was a buildup to it.This movie takes several twists and turns in it. I'll think, ""Alright, this is the goal they're going for and this is our story."" but it changes like three times until we finally do have our real story. I guess they changed it so much to keep the audience from being bored, but they didn't really succeed. I didn't like that about this movie. It did stop being boring and started being very entertaining when we got to the real story, and one of those reasons is because there's a clear goal Mike is trying to reach, and Sully's on board with him. You want them to win and meet that goal, and when a movie has you rooting for the main characters, I think that's a good thing about it. Also, Mike and Sully having to work together is a good idea, because this was before they became friends. It also started being funny when it got to it's main story line in this movie, because it introduced other characters that carried the laughter, and kind of the story.This movie is about 1 hour 45 minutes long, which is an almost perfect running time for this type of movie, but almost like, the real story and everything happens in a 1 hour 15 minutes running time. Really, at one point you think it's over, them it twists and something else happens that is a very good idea. I thought it was the best part of the movie.I rated this 7/10, which means that I thought it was good. Was it as good as the first? No, the first is basically always the best, in my opinion. 'Monsters Inc.' was better and funnier, but 'Monsters University' was a good movie, surprisingly. I thought it was going to be bad, so why did I see it? I have no idea, but I'm glad I did. I recommend 'Monsters University'.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

The perfect prequel,"Monsters University is almost as good as monsters Inc which is pretty high praise considering the former is one of the best all-around Pixar movies and honestly one of the best animated films in general. Monsters Inc has special place in my heart and I can confidently say it's not just nostalgia. Revisiting the film years later I have even more of an appreciation of the plot, voice acting, humor, an animation that they pulled off in this entirely original movie.
That being said, it would be very easy for a prequal movie to not live up to its predecessor, but against all odds this movie pulls it off. MU is creative, funny, heart warming, and just overall brilliant. It's everything that you would want in a monsters prequel. It opens up the lore of the monster world while not resting on lazy tropes at an attempt at a cash grab like most sequels these days. This movie does what all prequels should do and gives you even more of an appreciation for the original while adding its own unique flair. I'm glad I did this may be a chance, and only wish that I done so sooner.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A minor Pixar film,Monsters University is a minor entry for Pixar. It pretty much a college comedy and inspiring sports story that happened to star various monsters. Like any Pixar film the animation was second-to-none and there were quite a few jokes that made me smile. There was an attempt at a heart-felt message about Mike realising his dreams might not come true and find out he has other talents. But this was a film made during the sequel phase and outside of the Toy Story Pixar's sequels aren't as strong as the original.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A solid instalment in Pixar's 'Monster's Universe',"This film, like any Pixar film, was very joyful. It captured the spirit of the original Monster's Inc wonderfully, bringing me back to my childhood and adding some interesting elements to the Monster's Inc world.The world that Monster's Inc takes place in is wonderfully creative and engaging, and to revisit it for the prequel was lots of fun. The characters that we know and love from Monsters Inc were lovingly recreated here, staying true to how we knew them from the original but supplementing them with additional levels and enhancing the depth of character.As with any Pixar film there was a strong level of emotional resonance, as the characters learned more about themselves, teamwork and friendship along the way. All very cliche and typically Pixar, but its a winning formula that hasn't really failed them in the past.There is nothing too wrong with the plot. It doesn't have the same draw as the original, but it kept me engaged enough and ticked along at a good pace, with a few twists and turns along the way.I don't have too much to dissect here, a thoroughly enjoyable film which isn't as good as its predecessor but does a good job of continuing the legacy of Monster's Inc.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not Classic Pixar, But Good for Kids","""Monsters University"" won't go down as a Pixar classic, but it's cute and diverting enough. Actually, I wasn't that big a fan of ""Monsters, Inc.,"" so maybe I wasn't the target audience for this in the first place.Billy Crystal and John Goodman return as the voices of Mike and Sully, and this origins story explains how they meet, first hate each other, and then end up as the scaring duo at the center of the earlier film. Of the new characters, Helen Mirren makes the biggest impression as the dragon lady dean of the college, though I couldn't place her voice and had to wait until the end credits to see who it was.My one complaint with the film is that it goes on too long, long past the point where it feels like the story should be resolving itself.

"Monsters University fails to capture its predecessor's magic, however is scarily watchable.","The question you have to ask yourself is ""did we need a prequel to 'Monsters Inc'?"". In my opinion no, but here we are anyway. Detailing how Mike and Sully met at university, they participate in the ""Scare Games"" in order to be taken forward in the ""Scare Program"". Not all is plain sailing though, Mike wishes to be a ""Scarer"" but ultimately is too cute for the job. It's a story about proving people wrong, proving yourself right and coming to terms with the realisation that dreams may not be necessarily fulfilled. Let's start with the good. John Goodman and Billy Crystal reprise their unique voice acting roles again, they are simply irreplaceable. The animation was vibrant, colourful and included a glossy aftereffect to enhance the youth of our characters. The story was engaging, although slightly unfocused, and moves along at a consistent pace. The inclusion of past characters will put a smile on faces albeit felt occasionally forced for the sake of fan service to the original. There is one scene that blew me away and that was the conversation between Mike and Sully in the human world by the lake. Monochrome filter, moody atmosphere, tense discussion...I felt it. The overwhelming realisation that Mike isn't scary, the script could've milked that scene into melodrama but instead it was kept light yet powerful. Maybe it's just me, I like me a good dark scene in a child-friendly animation. The problem with this film lies with its characters. What made 'Monsters Inc' so captivating was the dialogue between just two characters. In this we have far too many supporting monsters thrown into the fray which blurs the focus from Mike and Sully, the latter being sidelined to a supporting role. This story is purely focused on Mike, personally I think that was the wrong decision. It should've been balanced. There really was no antagonist, any threat or danger levels were completely omitted. It's a fine prequel, just feels unnecessary.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

They scare... but do we care?,"Monstres Academy (2013)
 The first ""Monsters Inc."" had an exciting premise both on a visual and story level, it created a parallel universe with monsters of various forms, designs, sizes and bodies: Mike Wazowsky (Billy Crystal) looked like an alien, James Sullivan (John Goodman) was a conventional grizzly-looking monster and then there were animal-like creatures like Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi). The most 'fun' aspect of these monsters was less their differences than their similarities with us humans. So we had to see it to believe they were monsters and then came the whole plot centers on the Monsters, Inc., the door system and the encounter with a little girl named Boo. You know the story.The plot was simple although not devoid of a few contrivances here and there, but the charm lied in the simple things, in the sweet relationship between Sulley and Boo, something that felt like an early version of ""Masha and the Bear"" and the friendship between Sulley and Mike, served by great vocal performances from Goodman and Crystal. The ending where they realized they could obtain the same energy power by making kids laugh instead of screaming was a nice resolution that only left as a cliffhanger the slight possibility or visiting Boo again, but that's not the approach the sequel took. ""Monster University"" as its title indicates is a prequel to all the aforementioned events and answering to the questions that kept our mouth salivating for 16 years: how did the two monsters get their jobs? How did they become friends?There's a bit of sarcasm in my introduction but it's not mean to diminish the merit of the film, which can be summed up as great entertainment with a wonderful gallery of colorful and colored characters once again, driven by a plot so rich it's a real credit to the intellectual dedication of the screenwriters. This is perhaps its greatest blessing and its greatest curse. At first, I was just thrilled to see little Mike being too funny-looking and enthusiastic for his own good, we all know Disney movies have always been about believing in your dreams, but when our little green Cyclopes says ""I want to be a scarer"", not only we don't take him seriously but we know he won't succeed, because we saw the first film.So we know it's not exactly the destination that will matter but the journey. I liked the journey but I didn't expect it to be so technical?So we follow Mike as a first-year student in the university, discovering his roommate Randall Boggs, following the scare program, having his first course in the amphitheater and undergoing the mockeries of more credible monsters and the popularity of Sullivan who belongs to a prestigious family of scarers, not to mention the no-nonsense authority of Dean Handscrabble, voiced by Helen Mirren. I could relate to Mike and the film is perhaps the first animated feature to realistically portray the universe of universities. It also had its share of action and it carries that ""underdog""' team aspect with the Oozma Kappa misfits and Mike being perfect in theory but not scary enough while Sulley relying on his looks like the hare on his fast legs. Still, I was surprised by the attention given to the contest, the graduation, being expelled or admitted. I liked the film but I wonder whether the script shouldn't have taken a much simpler and less convoluted path.The plot is well-written but a tad over-written, even if we accept that this is a universe that is exactly like ours (though it doesn't play with the same rules), it's just too grounded on a bureaucratic and institutional reality, too real for its own good. And it just takes for granted that because it's monsters, we'll get more excited by its series of twists and revelations. There are some great moments but they're lost in a double-character's arc that doesn't inspire much escapism or dream-like animation, something that really wows you at the end, it's fun, it's a nice buddy movie but maybe we got too blasé when it comes to animated pictures and it takes some really inventive material to blow you away. Grade 7, I guess it passes the test but it's one of these Pixar movies I wouldn't want to see again and again.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""Monsters U"" doesn't make the grade","Rating: 1 out of Fordyce Hollywood loves sequels, and so do the fans, it seems, but in the case of Monsters University I think even die-hard fans of the first film will be a little disappointed. Regular readers know I am not a big fan of animated movies, so I took someone with who loved the original, Monsters, Inc., and in general likes animated films. This movie is a flashback look at how the relationship between Mike and Sulley began during their days at Monsters University. Billy Crystal and John Goodman are back as the voices of the pair, and several other good celebrity voices are there, including Helen Mirren.One big problem is that the script is lame and predictable. The other problem is that while Monsters, Inc. has some very funny moments, neither of us laughed during this film. Not once, nada, nope. There were a few giggles from the kids in the audience, but I think most of us were glad this was over after a tedious one hour and 50 minutes that was preceded by a mediocre animated short about two umbrellas and coming attractions for every animated film in production for the next century.Again, I am not a fan of animated films; some good ones have gotten high marks from me over the years, but not this one. I only give MU a poor one out of Fordyce. My date/mate who likes animated movies said on his FB page ""Saw Monsters University last night. Sorry to say was not as fun as the first. Kind of Monsters, Inc. meets Revenge of the Nerds. Some parts were so slow I almost drifted off, and my mate actually DID fall asleep. No really funny moments, either. I'd save your money or wait until Redbox has it for a buck. It gets a two out of four."" Certainly not a ringing endorsement from a fan of the franchise and the genre. And, yes, I am the one he is referring to. I did nod off.Credit Check: There is a cute scene at the end of the movie that was set up earlier in the film, so hang around for that.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Yes, there is a paddling scene!","I infamously hadn't seen ""Monsters Inc."" until earlier this year. And even after I did, I was lukewarm about it. I mean, it was a creative concept and all, but aside from the visuals, the overall likability of Mike Wazowski and the cuteness factor of Boo, for me it didn't seem to sustain the heightened entertainment value I deemed fit in order to have secured a spot in the upper echelon of the Pixar power rankings. So, going into ""Monster University"", I was highly skeptical that past the ""college"" gimmick, this was going to be more of the same, just with more monsters and Mike in a retainer. Suffice to say, I was wrong. In only the second college themed movie to receive a G rating, this prequel to 2001's ""Monster's Inc."" takes a look back at the relationship between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman), and their first meeting as college students at Monsters University (the rival of Scare Tech. as you all know). Mike is introduced as the monster who seems to have the least ""scare potential"" but the most heart and Sulley comes in as a jock/legacy, who has it in his mind that he is going to cruise his way through the illustrious Scare program on name and intimidation alone. You can see where this is going. Thematic circumstances dictate that the two must hate each other at first, but eventually work together to take down the jock fraternity, the Alpha Betas (or whatever they are called in this movie) in order to prove that they belong. But while this underdog storyline may sound predictable, it is a combination of the well written comedic dialogue and situations (sans the final act) and insightful commentary on college life, as well as the introduction of more than a few quirky monsters (my favorite being Don, a forty-something student who went back to school ""to learn the computers"" ) which allows ""Monsters University"" to be a quite enjoyable experience for all ages. But, let's get to the bigger issue at hand. Which is the question: Does ""Monsters University"" work without the beloved human character of Boo? The answer is YES. In fact ""Monsters University"" begins with elementary school Mike, who is pretty damn adorable, and is seemingly meant to take the place of Boo. And even if young Mike is only on screen for about ten minutes, it works. Well, that's kind of a lie because ""Monsters University"" really begins with a Pixar short that isn't so much amazing as it is alarming; but anyway With very family friendly references to ""Animal House"", ""Revenge of the Nerds"", ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" and even ""Carrie"", director Dan Scanlon (making his feature length Pixar debut) immerses audiences into this collegiate atmosphere, while the writing team of Robert L. Baird, Daniel Gerson, and the director himself put forth a script which proves that G-rated movies can also be funny for adults as well. As always Crystal as the wide-eyed (literally) underdog Mike Wazowski and Goodman as the larger than life Sulley are the stars of the show. But I must make mention of Helen Mirren, who lends her voice to this picture, playing Dean Hardscrabble, the most menacing looking villainess since Ursula. Seriously, she is something out of a Franz Kafka novel. Timely reference, I know.Final Thought: While ""Monsters Inc."" was an interesting concept, ""Monsters University"" is clearly the more entertaining film; even if only by the slightest bit. Sure, children under a certain age may not get all of the college references and there is sort of a second ending here where Mike and Sully have a bonding moment, which does make this movie seem overlong (clearly overstaying its welcome for more than a few small children at my screening) and yes, a PG-rated ""Monsters University"" would have left the door open for at least one panty raid. But what can I say? The rather hilarious college themed atmosphere, from the spot on orientation sequences, to the college aged monsters in flip flops playing hacky sack on the lawn, to the singing of the Monsters University school song, all had me enjoying this movie maybe more than I should have.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

"Effectively Monsters, Inc. meets Animal House","Monsters University saw Pixar return to familiar territory after the disappointing Cars 2 and Brave, becoming the first prequel to come from the studio. The idea of showing how Mike and Sulley first meet was one that held a lot of potential, and the success of the film depends on what you are expecting. The film isn't a fast-paced adventure with a lot at stake like the first film, but more of an amusing origin story that's just good fun. It focuses on Mike going to Monsters University with the intention of being the best scarer ever and he clashes with the overconfident Sulley as a result. When they are kicked off the course they are forced to enter the Scaring Games to get their places back and guide a team of misfits to success along the way.The story is as simple as its sounds, it's just Mike and Sulley trying to win the competition and gradually realising that they're both after the same thing. It is nice that they weren't originally friends and had to work together to fully understand each other. The real strength of the story lies with its moral. The idea that someone's abilities can always surprise you is on that the film uses very effectively, seeing as Mike is constantly told that he is scary enough and no amount of hard work will change that. Of course by the climax he proves that by mixing his knowledge with Sulley's look anything can be achieved. Away from that is does follow the formula of a typical university movie and the hijinks of the fraternities, but it does it well and offers a lot of enjoyment. The only issue people may have with the story is that there feels like there is less at stake. There is conflict, especially in the climax, but there is no big adventure you come to expect from Pixar.As always the characters are crucial to this story and they are great. Mike is portrayed as bookish and relying on his quick wit, but he is a lot of fun. You get a real sense of how much he wants to be successful and it's difficult not to like him simply because of the passion he shows. Sulley is much more self-assured and lackadaisical towards his career than he would go on to be, though he does go through an arch as he becomes more attentive and reliable as the film progresses. The geeky frat group they join all have distinct personalities. Squishy is a pleasant innocent, Don is an enjoyable fatherly figure and Art provides some good laughs because of how odd he is. The frightening Dean (voiced well by Helen Mirren) makes a good adversary to the group and has a great design, even if she is underdeveloped. The rival frat groups suffer from the same problem.The animation is brilliant and extremely detailed. It's very colourful and bright, giving a lot of life to the university setting and allowing the characters to leap off the screen. The character designs are excellent and creative, no two monsters look the same and it's clear that a lot of thought went into their looks. The score by Randy Newman is very good. It has the light feel of the original film yet involves less jazzy elements and more infectious melodies, the songs used throughout the film also fit well. The scare games were inventive and provided a great deal of excitement that the film needed, with the final game allowing a lot of tension. The jokes themselves are somewhat hit and miss. In fairness to the film there is a wide variety of comedy and so many comedic styles are tried that it was bound to be the case, though when the jokes are good they are usually very funny thanks to some great visuals and wordplay.So while it isn't up there with Pixar's greats, Monsters University is an extremely enjoyable and always entertaining effort. It does lack the big feel of other Pixar films and is a little by the book in some areas, but the film succeeds at what it attempts to do and that is tell a fun buddy college film. The two main characters are very likable and that remains the case throughout, they carry the film with relative ease. The other characters are entertaining, the animation is some of the studios most colourful and the message is a very genuine one that's handled well. Even for the often patchy comedy, when the comedic moments work they work very well. It's a film that is easy to appreciate and get a lot of enjoyment out of.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I'm guess the ""4th Grade"" line is gonna be ignored?....OK","THE GOOD This is one of the Pixar films that didn't need another film and yet somehow it got one! Still that doesn't mean it's bad. The favourite characters are back and I got a warm feeling seeing them and the factory again, same as seeing the Shire in the Hobbit film. The plot ends up pretty standard ""jock and nerd team up"" college film until the middle where the personas are switched, and the climax and ending of the film is very fun and thought provoking. The Scare Games scenes are all great fun and can be really tense sometimes. The main monsters, Mike and Sulley are good, Helen Mirren as the dean is a good character with a cool design. I love the score, the college brass band brought a great feel in the film. And of course, the animation is awesome, I like the little touches and tributes to real universities, like the huge clock tower, an obvious reference the Birmingham University tower.THE BAD The story itself, aside from the ending is very simple, kind of standard college movie. There's recycled characters like the jock, the nerds, the bullies, etc. The dean herself tho I like the performance and design is a bit too unrealistic character-wise. Why would a dean accept a bet from a student and add a stipulation that threatens his place in the school even though she believes that student will flat out fail? Isn't it her job to help the students? And it's just missing that Pixar spark that's been missing since Cars 2.THE VERDICT Overall, I like this film but it doesn't feel like that classic Pixar that I grew up with. I just hope that they'll get it back soon. But judging by this film, it may be the first step on the road to recovery.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A good and fun movie, but not great","It's a bit strange that Pixar would take Monster's Inc., a film wildly successful because it was so unique and memorable, and create a prequel as safe and predictable as possible. It felt like they wanted to keep working with the Monsters world (which is understandable), but they were so daunted with the task of creating a movie worthy of continuing the franchise that they decided the absolute safest option: A prequel, grounded in overplayed university frat awkwardness clichés and well worn plot lines.But on the bright side of playing it safe, it's strange, fun, and funny with its messed up monster characters just as you would expect. One of the most stand out features is the quality animation with beautiful color as colorful as the characters.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Well, not many match up to their predecessors anymore...","It seems that the feel of the Disney Pixar movies that we all used to know and love have somewhat diminished.The uniqueness that excelled previous Disney Pixar movies were not shown at all in this and proves to be an overall a pretty average prequel which makes for an OK family experience with you're kids.Basically, the comedic slapstick and humor from Monsters Inc. could not be seen and this can be justified by the minimal amount of laughter coming from the more mature audiences. Don't get me wrong, there is still enjoyable moments and the site of Mike and the whole cast such as Randall bring back some great moments from Monsters Inc. The plot line gives answers to fans from the previous movie as well as provides a well animated enjoyable time.You may say that Pixar has taken a hole notch down from where they were a few years ago but this can't be said for all the sequels and newer movies such as Toy Story 3, Cars, Brave and Up. By no means is Monsters University comparable to the golden age of Pixar but it seems to be a mildly disappointing prequel to a movie such as Monsters Inc.In the end if you are looking for a family night out and look forward to witnessing the rise of Mike and Sullivan then this is a worthwhile watch.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A solid prequel that shows character development,"Monsters University is a good prequel to Monsters Inc and shows great character development from Sully and Mike. Monsters university does a good job of introducing new characters with a purpose and not just introducing a random character that doesn't have an impact in the plot.

"A fun and touching prequel to Monsters, Inc!","Pixar may be a brand name, but it is one that is built on some solid, creative storytelling skills and savvy digital wizadry. You don't need me to tell you it's hard to be disappointed with a Pixar film. So let's just say you are reading this review to affirm your own belief that Monsters University did not and could not suck.The film, as with all Pixar's full-length features, starts with a cute little short entitled ""The Blue Umbrella"". I've always been fond of Pixar's strong range of shorts and an unabashed fan of its witty, charming and even succinctly moving films. The Pixar Short serve as a great platform for Pixar's tech newbies to have a taste of the game, and is also a teaser of the creative giant's knack for finding, or rather, inventing a heart and soul in inanimate, everyday objects we too often pass by but take nary a look.However, ""The Blue Umbrella"" which had a very promising trailer, smacks more of a Turn Left Turn Right (2003)-type, sentimental Jimmy-esque cartoon that is more passingly cute than genuinely affecting; a little flat, to say the least, and made one wonder if the novelty of digital anthropomorphisationis getting old; if Pixar is losing its touch as it gravitates towards formulae rather than focusing on the heartwarming stories it has always magically told. I don't think I speak just for adults when I say it is simply not possible to feel for every creaking tin, can, or manhole that has some semblance of eyebrows or a smile on it. A part of me wants to root for Pixar, and yet another part, having witnessed over the years, a sampling of the company's creative possibilities, cannotshrug off the feeling that often, Pixar could have done so much more.The actual characters of Monsters University, however, are a real show- stopper. Some of these creatures do not seem very monster-like at all. In fact, many designs appear to be mere spins on a regular garden snail, scorpion or furry animal. They do, however, come in a multitude of shapes, sizes and colours. Just observing their different appearances and quirks is an eyeful, and a whole lot more interesting than with the rather characterless ""cast"" of Cars (2006). This makes Monsters University a film worth re-watching just to catch all those intricate details that one might have missed on first viewing.The story itself is a charmer, and the Pixar producers milk all your typical high school stereotypes in setting up the tiny, geeky green creature, Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) against his behemoth anti-thesis, the towering resident jock Sulley Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman). A big part of the film revolves around how the ability to be ""scary"" forms the very bedrock of a monster's identity, and the crushing disappointment of discovering the limits of one's ""scariness."" Thankfully, these salient, universal and meaningful themes are not explored in a didactic manner and prove equally entertaining as they are educational.The beauty of a Pixar film is also the promise of ever-tasteful endings that are innocently fairy-tale like, and this comes at the coda of Monsters University, where the film gradually, lovingly segues into a bridging finish, cementing its position as a prequel to Monsters, Inc. (2011).When I'm often too preoccupied with scribbling away reviewer's notes in the theatre, and gloating with the pleasure of having mastered the art of writing in pitch darkness, it's films like Monsters University which transports me so seamlessly into its world and jams the cogs of an analytical brain. There are few films that are able to make us forget that we are watching one, let alone make us feel like kids again, but Pixar does this so well.Now we only have to re-watch Monsters, Inc. to ride on that wave of nostalgia, and await with bated breath for the release of Finding Dory.www.moviexclusive.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cheated,"There was a time when whichever film Pixar made, it never failed to impress me. That time has sadly passed. Cars was the first disappointment. Cars 2 just sucked. Luckily these were the exceptions. Toy Story 3, WALL-E & Brave were all excellent! The problem with Monster U is that it's just a plain and simple highschool movie, but with monsters (duh!). So a real cookie cutter story. The animation is gorgeous but it has gotten to a point where cartoon-like characters look as good as they are ever going to look if you don't want them to look photo-realistic. Great for kids I guess, but adults do make up a large part of the Pixar audience and story wise I feel a bit cheated...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar Continue to Roar the Loudest,"The Incredible, Brave and universally Monstrous animation studio Pixar have undeniably been heard roaring the loudest with their 14 feature films amounting to their reputation at the forefront of motion picture animation, and film in general. The studio's small in number yet great in quality features make it unsurprising that there is a particular expectation for the animators to deliver more masterful art in the present and future. However, most recently Pixar have delved into the past with their first and very highly anticipated prequel, Monsters University.Monsters, Inc. (2001) brought Pixar into the 21st century by opening doors into an entirely unique universe for audiences of all ages to enter. 12 years later, and the children who grew up with Sully, Mike and the rest of Monstropolis have been invited back to experience a stage in these great characters' lives that many of us also find ourselves in: university.Monsters University sees Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan meet for the first time as they both desire to attain their major from the Scare Program but both have different views on how to pass the class. While Mike operates as the educated, hardworking, fearless yet physically unintimidating scarer, Sully excels fearsomely well at the scaring, but lacks the motivation, courage and book smarts Mike possesses, causing the pair to become rivals.The writers constructively use the beloved on screen relationship between Mike and Sully to explore their differences in Monsters University, which are ironically everything they need to complete each other as a pair, as classmates, as colleagues and as who knows what if Pixar decide to expand the Monsters franchise further. This prequel justifies itself solely in the exploration of Mike and Sully's match as the perfect scare team; yin and yang embodied on screen.As if Pixar were not punctual enough with the timely release of Monsters University (MU) for those who grew up with the original, but its setting also plays host to the film's central storyline which follows the MU Scare Games. With the release of this monster movie coinciding with the one year anniversary of the hugely successful London Olympics, Pixar manages to capture a marginal fictionalised element of magic that the 2012 Games accumulated, but a fraction alone is enough to captivate audiences, which Monsters University does indeed.The parallels between the challenges that the MU fraternities must face and those accomplished last summer are certainly not forced in this prequel, and so make for delightfully relevant entertainment as we see Mike and Sully reluctantly join the same fraternity to fight for their survival in the university's Scare Program, overcoming numerous, humorous obstacles along the way.Monsters University has a mix of fun features, all contained within a single, fun feature film. Whether you're a toy, bug, monster, fish, superhero, car, rat, robot or most likely just an everyday human, Monsters University will almost definitely delight and satisfy with enough laughs to energise the whole of Monstropolis. Pixar really unhooked the leash in 2013, having changed the tone from Monsters, Inc. whilst still managing to keep the collar on this prequel to ensure it belongs to the 2001 animation. While it lacks the heart and depth of the original, Monsters University surpasses its predecessor with a blend of humour, visual vibrancy and enough universityisms to keep any student mentally reaching out to the screen in relation, as the film reaches out to us in so many ways.Monsters University has many welcome throwbacks (or throw forwards chronologically speaking if you prefer) to Monsters, Inc. that are only supplementary magical moments to the energetic, Monstrously good, nonstop party of animated fun. Monsters University proves that Pixar can graduate to prequels and still remain successful. The studio has just about every metaphorical studious qualification imaginable, and yet their fantastic writers, directors, animators and actors continue to imagine and conceive new, unique artwork. This provides us with excellent family fun, heart-warming stories and allegories, with Monsters University as the latest, and certainly one of the greatest. In all fairness however, most of Pixar's features sit atop their greatest offerings as it is difficult to favour one over the other.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I have an extra toe! Not with me, of course","The college days of the central characters, where they went to learn Scaring.I'm not going to lie; I was kind of nervous about watching this one. This is the first time that a Pixar movie seemed like a cash grab. No, not even either of the unnecessary Toy Story sequels that had come out by this point - seriously did we need the same plot 3 times in a row in the same series?Monsters Inc ranks as one of my favorite movies ever made, not just of its subgenres. I get that it would be difficult to make a sequel, and one certainly wasn't necessary - but a prequel didn't feel like that sensible of a choice, either. So I am very relieved that it's amazing.This tells us some of how things ended up the way they are in the first one. Mike Wazowski was getting overlooked from childhood. Sulley was an overconfident jock. Randall used to be really nice and people pleasing. The message at the end is good, but it's nowhere near as important as the one in the original.This does follow the logic of the first one. We're witnessing a world full of monsters who like nasty stuff, and seeing how things look different because of this. The animation is great, with an incredibly high level of detail and independent number of elements in some sequences. The action is exciting, it's funny and emotionally engaging. At times it does actually dip into horror territory. The acting is excellent. Helen Mirren's Dean could sneeze or cough and a cutting remark would come out. Every line spoken by Art is hilarious.I recommend this to any fan of its predecessor. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Decent effort but not up to the level that Pixar has done before!!,"Monsters University is the prequel to the 2001 movie Monsters, Inc. This is the first instance of a prequel being made in Pixar history. Even though the quality of movies has dropped in recent years, Monsters University has done enough to satisfy its core audience of kids.The animation as well as the voice acting is done superbly. All the surroundings are well detailed and are comparable to the work done by Miyazaki.Most of the animated movies follow a formula and this movie is no exception. It describes how Mike and Sullivan team up to be scare partners. Mike has always been an odd monster who has been constantly disparaged by his peers as well as his teachers. On the other hand, Sullivan comes from a reputed family and is widely admired by everyone even if his technique is one-dimensional.Over the course of the story, both of them manage to get expelled. To make up for this disappointment, Mike decides to form a team which includes amongst others Sullivan as well. Despite being the most mediocre team, they manage to overcome the odds and prove the others wrong.Monsters University is a feel-good movie that must be seen at face value. The story is not an entirely original one but the movie is good enough for a one-time watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't waste your time.,"I would first like to say that I liked the original Monster's Inc. I would give it a 7.5. This one is a 2. There is no plot. They go back to when they are in school together and have scare competitions. Mike Wazowski is not scary, and is trying so ""find himself"" and the Goodman's character is from a long line of stuck up ""my s#@$ don't stink"" monsters. Big surprise, they team up, and learn some stuff along the way. You can fill in the predictable blanks yourself. Geniuses must've sat up all night dreaming this one up. Monster's University is to Monster's Inc as American Pie:Band Camp is to American Pie. A cheap knockoff of the original. The only thing that saves it from being a 1 is the voice acting. Goodman and Crystal are good at what they do. But, I don't know how they signed up for this. Not that your kids will hate it for sure. But, you will.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A very well done sequel, albeit without so much originality.","After the success of the first film (although it was a success heavily amputated by competing films), it was predictable that Pixar would bet, sooner or later, on a film that continued with the same revenue as the first. The follow-up, however, had to wait more than ten years in the drawer, and ended up not being a sequel, but rather a prequel that shows us how the main characters met and their journey.The script is not original, and the story is very similar to a thousand other films in an American high school or university environment, but the fact is that it works well. It begins with Mike and Sullivan's arrival at Monsters University, where they must attend a degree in Scare, the most prestigious degree the university has to offer. However, the highly respected college headmistress is extremely demanding and will not like them at all, taking advantage of an unfortunate incident they cause to expel them, based on Mike's inability to instill fear and Sullivan's total neglect of studies. However, Mike is determined to graduate and prove his worth, and will take advantage of a college scare competition to challenge the headmistress.The film proved to be a very honorable continuation of the first film: the prequel works well and the characters we liked in the first film are almost all present (of course the human girl is not). Thanks to a very well written script, we see how they get to know each other, and how their friendships and enmities are forged. There are many intentional similarities between the University of Monsters and Harvard University, and the US academic environment is well reproduced here (being totally different from the Portuguese or European university environment). The digital animation is exquisite, the drawings were very well executed, there is excellent color and brightness throughout the film and the soundtrack seems to me to have been better and better chosen this time around. For the voices of the characters, the film once again summons John Goodman, Billy Crystal and Steve Buscemi, to which well-known actors such as Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina or Joel Murray will be joined.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

new and known stuff,"The new stuff contains: New soundtracks New setting New characters New villain Known stuff from monsters inc: Same actors for Mike and sully Few known characters Most known soundtracks Now for the review: Story: the movie was about Mike went to monster university to become the most feared monster of all the monsters. But there's one big furry monster trying to beat him out. Sully got jealous of Mike because Mike has a better less violent roar then sully and mike has learn different types of roars. Because of that, Mike passed all the lessons taught to him. Mike is also jealous of sully because sully is more scarier then mike but only knows 1 type of roar. But they soon become best friends. Now is the story any good? Pretty much. Cast: pretty well matched with the characters. Graphics: Same as monsters inc. But improved. Villain: unlike the sequel where the manager was the villain, hard scrabble the headmaster of monster university is not a villain. She acts like one. But isn't. Who's the villain? The leader of ror team. The team that bullies oozma kappa team. Characters: oozma kappa team seems goofy and weak as a scare team. But Mike and sully helps them. And there's one guy with many eyes( I don't know his name) that's act like a kid. Even so this is a family film. Film for all ages. Not just for kids. How old are the characters? Pretty much over 18. Because if they are under 18, they can't be in the university. So yeah. It's college. And they cut out one scene that was from the trailer. Why they do that?

A Fun and Heartwarming Prequel,"Monsters University is a delightful prequel to the beloved Pixar film Monsters, Inc. The movie takes us back in time to when Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) first met in college and follows their journey as they strive to become professional ""scarers.""The animation is top-notch, as expected from a Pixar film, with stunning attention to detail and vibrant colors. The plot is engaging and enjoyable, with plenty of laughs and heartwarming moments that will have both kids and adults entertained.One of the strengths of Monsters University is its exploration of themes such as friendship, teamwork, and the importance of embracing your individuality. The characters are well-developed and relatable, with Mike and Sulley both undergoing personal growth and learning important life lessons throughout the film.The voice acting is superb, with Crystal and Goodman reprising their roles as Mike and Sulley and delivering excellent performances.

Not in the same league as the first,"It really does feel like some form of sacrilege to not like a Pixar movie with the company producing grand movie after grand movie for so long it makes one feel uneasy when a product of theirs lacks heart and lacks the soul that made their early outputs so amazing. Sacrilege officially committed then, for Monsters University is an average film and a reaffirming that the mojo at Pixar is waning.After mediocre efforts Cars, Brave and the nothing short of a cheap cash grab Cars 2 (which I have avoided seeing at all costs to try preserve some Pixar love) it's not exactly a secret that Pixar have seemingly lost their way, whether due to Disney's takeover or not. Monsters Inc was a fantastic movie filled with charm, humor, heart and a story that seemed wholly original. Monsters University is anything but, a movie that again seems to exist solely to produce a range of toys that can be sold in conjunction with its release, and while not terrible by any means is not even in the same ball park as it's predecessor.Setting this prequel story in a college setting seems to be an excuse for Pixar to play up every college movie stereotype available. From outcasts, jocks, mean headmasters and sororities everything in the film feels somewhat cheapened by it appearing to be some form of homage or in joke, something early Pixar movies never had to contend with. It must be said also that the iconic characters of Mike and Sully seem diminished in this film, banter between them that sparkled in Monsters Inc fizzles here which makes audience investment a lot harder.Monsters University has some laughs and travels along at a fast enough pace so you never feel bored with proceedings. It's a movie though that's story feels pointless with the usual follow your dreams message the only real element to be taken from it. No doubt this colorful movie will appeal to those under the age of ten but for all of us ten year olds that have now grown up, Monsters University is a forgettable and regrettable entry in the once untarnished Pixar canon.2 and a half angry librarians out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Hilarity: An adult affair,"Having been a massive fan of the original Monsters' Inc. I must say this prequel worried me slightly. Even though i have a lot of love for Pixar and the joy they bring with their brilliant and ground breaking original stories (Cars and Cars 2 aside). Prequels and sequels in cinema generally worry me. This is due to the common trend within the movie industry, especially at the moment, to play it safe and take an already popular movie and exploit our love of the characters and story-line with second-rate sequels and prequels. Ensuring the masses relinquish their cash due to these nostalgic/fan emotions instead of relying on great actors and clever, well-thought out story lines. This has lead to movies being churned out which are undeniably not terrible but at the same time would not grace my home collection.However I found this movie to be extremely entertaining and thankfully Pixar achieved here what they did with the Toy Story series. I will admit I thought the start was slow but once it picked up pace it continued with it and kept my sides warmed throughout. If you are a fan of the Spongebob/Family guy humour you would not be disappointed with this movie, at the same time you will probably not be disappointed if you are not also.Nevertheless I would have to point out that though I thought this movie was very funny i could not recommend it to younger viewers. I thought the combination of the setting, the type of humour and the characters (there are a lot of university archetypes thrown around) meant that it was wholly a more young adult experience. In fact i would consider it more like Spongebob Squarepants where kids watch it but do not quite fully understand all the jokes. This is reflected within my score for the movie. I understand that children's movies do have to strike a balance to keep all ages entertained, but i would argue that this movie was definitely for an older audience. Although Pixar has created something extremely enjoyable once again I think it masquerades too much as a child friendly movie and you would definitely be better off taking your children to a different movie.All in all Monsters' University is a must see if, like me, you watched the first one as a child and are at university or are going sometime soon. For the family of all ages I think you may want to consider an alternative in order to ensure your little ones aren't too bored.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not as scary as it sounds,"While the name may sound like a horror movie, this is the exact opposite. I went into this movie thinking it was a scary movie about monsters attacking kids at a university. Turns out it wasn't. Monsters ""university"" is a cartoon comedy about monsters who attend a college. Billy crystal plays mike the green monster with one eye. While watching this I knew was the beginning it was billy crystal and I thought It was kinda a step down for his acting career. I really liked when Harry met Sally....so this seemed like a step in the wrong direction for Mr crystal. Maybe he'll host another Oscar who knows. Mikes best friend is Sully who is voiced by John Goodman. Again, it feels like career killer for Mr Goodman. He's such a great actor, performances like the Flintstones, this seems like the wrong movie for the great John Goodman to star in. Maybe another Flintstones. Steve Buscemi voices Randall. I really liked Buscemi in this movie and think he did a great job. All in all, it was a good cartoon, but deffenetly no shrek 2. I give it 4 stars. What do you think? Should John Goodman and billy crystal retire? Send me a message and we can discuss ;).",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A nearly great prequel... and another great movie for Pixar,"I always loved MONSTERS INC. It's funny, well animated and voice acted and with a great message about accepting who is different from us. When the prequel came out I was already 14 and felt I was a bit too old for this sort of movies. Well, in 10 years I have seen more than 1500 movies give or take, last July I finally re-watched MONSTERS INC and my tastes are now incredibly varied. So last September I finally saw it and, I had a fine time.The movie is a prequel of what the characters of MONSTERS INC did before the events of that movie. Mike Wazowsky (voice by Billy Crystal) went to Monsters University and meets fellow students Randall Boggs (voice by Steve Buscemi) and James P Sullivan (voice by John Goodman). Dean Abigail Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) warns all the students that if a monster doesn't pass the final exam at the end of the first semester has to leave the scaring program. They fail, then they enter a fraternity and only after various misadventures they'll finally become the scarers we knew in the 2001 movie.The plot was great as it gives a nice insight on our characters before we met them 12 years before, and the voice acting (by Crystal, Buscemi, Goodman, Helen Mirren, Alfred Molina, John Krasinski and Bill Hader) was good with the stars giving their soul to their characters. There are also lots of funny moments as well as a nice feel-good ending.Overall, a great animated movie that can be enjoyed and loved also by adults without children (like me) that have fond memories of the original. And as for the adults that want to show this to their kids, it's safe and with clean humour. As almost usual, Pixar never fails.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not ""laugh out loud"" funny and really slow.","I was really hoping this one would be good. Not necessarily as good as the first, but still good. But we were a little disappointed. We went the day it opened and the theater was packed with lots of kids (and some teens and adults). My kids (and many of the other kids in the theater) were getting quite bored by halfway through and asking when it was going to be over. It was weird because as an adult, I enjoyed it OK, (even though it was painfully slow at times) but it just seemed like it wasn't something that little ones could really appreciate. I liked the story and the animation was really colorful and well-done. But, a lot of the college humor was lost on them and the things that were actually funny and on their level, weren't until the last half of the film. But by that time, they'd already lost all of the kids in the theater to boredom.Another thing is, that there is absolutely nothing to be gained by seeing this in 3D. If you feel that you MUST see it in the theater, don't waste your money on the 3D ticket. After seeing The Croods (twice) and being completely blown away by the 3D (and everything else about the movie), this was a huge let down. Hopefully Despicable Me 2 will help us rebound next week.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"No satire, and less imagination than one expects from Pixar","Pixar's computer-powered animations have earned justified plaudits over the years for their gorgeous aesthetics, their imaginative humour, and a perspective on life that is heartwarming in places but also perceptive, and, on occasion, even bleak – for example, the original 'Toy Story' struck me, more than anything else, as a remarkably frank film about mortality. But 'Monsters University' is a one of the more ordinary efforts in their mostly remarkable canon. A sequel of one of the less adult-oriented of their original films, it lacks the freshness of a typical Pixar effort, and the moral of the story is pure Disney. And in this story of university life, a gentle play with the idea of fraternities is preferred to any true satire (you won't hear anyone suggest that universities exist to cement the advantages of rich kids or to provide cushy jobs for their teachers, although the setting is the sort of college that only exists because some people are willing and able to pay big money for it). This is probably the harshest review this children's film will get; but 'WALL-E', perhaps the most ambitious Pixar movie, was an incredibly poignant film about the damage that man is doing to the planet – and that didn't mean that it forewent comedy, action scenes or even the hint of a happy ending either. 'Monsters University' will doubtless be enjoyed by its intended audience; but unusually for Pixar, that's as far as it goes.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not Pixar's Best, But Surprisingly Great","I had pretty low expectations for Monsters University. This is the third sequel Pixar's made out of their last four films, and after seeing the terrible reviews for Cars 2, I assumed this would be another safe way to cash in on old characters and rake in the merchandising money for Disney. Thankfully, this movie isn't just an easy cash grab – there is a solid story here, and while this isn't as amazing as Monsters Inc. or Pixar's other masterpieces, it's undeniably Pixar. The first half is a lot of light action and typical kids-movie goofiness – you'll become acquainted with many new monsters, none of which I found particularly interesting or funny. But after the silliness of the ""Scare Games"" are over, the movie takes a dramatic shift and delves into the motivations of Mike and Sulley along with their interesting, turbulent relationship. The final third of the movie features multiple surprising plot twists, and since most movies seem to get worse as they progress, I must applaud this one for doing the opposite. Throw in quite a few funny and interesting references/connections to Monsters Inc. and a strong ending that connects the two stories very nicely, and you have a very solid movie.Not all sequels/prequels are amazing as Toy Story 2. If you're something of that caliber, you're going to be disappointed. But if you'll be satisfied with yet another funny, clever, and engaging Pixar film, I highly recommend Monsters U. It's great to see that Pixar still knows how to make a great movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Monster house,"In the prequel to Monsters Inc Mike and Sully are students at Monster University but are unlikely to graduate and both cannot stand each other. Sully is too much of a jock whose talent is one scary facial expression and a family name and Mike is not scary enough.Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) expels them from the scaring course. That is until Mike comes up with a plan to win the Greek Council Scare Games and thereby his fraternity will be accepted into the College of Scaring.The plot is a mixture of the failing student needing to pass their tests in order to graduate. Think Billy Madison, Back to school, Revenge of the Nerds and Animal House as Mike and Sully's fraternity are full of nerds and outcasts.Mike and Sully learn to value each other and recognise the importance of teamwork but the film's message is an uneasy one. Are Pixar saying talent is something you are born with and cannot be acquired?In various studies it has been show that the US Marines have consistently turned people from a lower working class background, involved in petty crime, having minor drug problems into leaders of men in the battlefield.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Nice and amusing prequel! 7,1.","I love most animated movies from Disney. I also like the ones from other companies. I even like some cartoon TV-series like ""Johny Bravo"", ""Scooby-Doo"", ""Tom and Jerry"", etc. I must recognize my favorite cartoon movies are the ones I first saw as a child: ""Aladdin"", ""Peter Pan"", ""Pocahontas"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Atlantis""... Most of the ones that are released are worse than the ones released years ago, but there are still good ones. ""Monster university"" is in my opinion a bit worse than ""Monster, Inc"", but it is pretty good anyway. It is a prequel, so it begins telling the university life of the two main characters. The director could have done a better job with the pace and duration, but I think they are right enough. What I missed is some particular songs typical in this type of movies. The visuals are beautiful and so is the design of every character. They are very funny and children surely enjoy them. The voices are good because they come from good actors, like John Goodman, Helen Mirren and Steve Buscemi. This is a relevant element in every movie, specially in cartoons. The dialogues and the script as a whole are very correct and full of gags that will make both children and parents laugh and have a good time. There is some message, but not as profound as in other animated movies. It is nice to notice the difficulty of Wachowski to scare and the relationship between the two main characters and how Wachowski want to be a very scary monster. In conclusion, this is another rather watchable movie (specially for the little ones, but also for adults). The strenghtes are the visuals, voices and design of the characters while the weaknesses are the soundtrack and the lack of innovation and a deeper message. I recommend this to all those who like cartoon movies and liked the other in the saga. 7,1.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Back To The Past,"Unlike most Pixar films, Monsters Inc. is never really famous by its idea. Everyone mostly recalls the film by the love of the characters. They are the biggest deal of the story, and for that this prequel, Monsters University, keeps them the same perfectly. Although it didn't go with the same heights of its predecessor, the film gets it right for laying low from today's excessive gimmickry and simply tells the story by getting to know more of the characters and what's going on. The basic charm and heart remains, thus Monsters University is one of those prequels that will be appreciated by its fans.This might be the second Disney animated film that depicts college life. How the film portrays it is quite sugarcoated, since this is definitely a family movie. There are still some amusing mockeries to be felt in the exteriors. Though, the whole movie is just a typical fight between a band of misfits versus a too competent group. The thing is the titular university is barely fascinating, compared to the incorporated. But the best feat lies on the characters. Since they are always the heart of the pictures, they serve better effect to this story. Mike and Sully's friendship is the idea here, and it could have been a clichéd growth of friendship, but the film surprisingly gives it an unpredictable fate which leads to a better message in the end.John Goodman and Billy Crystal once again brought Mike and Sulley to life and the charm they gave to them stays intact, while the new cast also made their characters quite memorable. The direction is remarkably basic to this era of animation. As you would notice, our most recent ones are too busy on trying to make bigger animation tricks and endless swift action, Monsters University just stays simple. Not saying creating groundbreaking visuals is bad, but we just hardly see any absorbing storytelling nowadays. We still get to see something wonderful here, like how everything looks colorfully eye candy without adding any exaggerated whimsiness. Randy Newman returns at the score which brings some nostalgia from the original.Based on the themes, Monsters University is pretty much like An Extremely Goofy Movie. It's never really into portraying the means of college life, but it instead aims to developing the central relationship and heart. The overall film is thankfully more than a joke filled, nonstop set pieced, mainstream blockbuster gimmickry. It has the elements which made the first film so good. We can live without the satires or pros and cons about college, but the university could have been as intriguing as the world we saw twelve years ago, but again, it's all about characters, because the studio truly understands that they are one of the best developed characters of this genre. Monsters University is not yet the superior mode of Pixar, but it's not their mediocre mode either. All in all, it's undeniably good.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable sequel that doesn't fulfil,"Recently Pixar has been choosing to forgo original stories in favour of sequels of past hits. Pixar I think needs to go back to original stories. Not that Monsters University was not great in its own right, but when Pixar makes such great films, sequels only seem to harm (see Cars 2).As Monsters Inc. is my favourite Pixar movie I had to see to see it as soon as possible.Monsters University is a prequel that shows us the bumpy road of Mike and Sully while at university where they met. They are both attending MU in the scare program to become scarers. Mike is the studious one without the raw talent, and Sully is the prodigy with raw talent but no work ethic.MU is full of laughs enjoyable for children but lacked the edge of adult content that usually makes a great Pixar movie entertaining for all age groups. It is definitely one of Pixar's more childish movies and they choose to play it safe. Most of the laughs from me were from nostalgia. As a former leader in university a lot of the aspects about university life made me laugh including the over happy orientation helpers.There was some heart as can be expected but I found both Mike and Sully unlikable in comparison to MI. The smug over confidence of both characters in different aspects was off putting.In the end, the laughs were there and it is very enjoyable for kids and fans of Pixar The animation was great but nothing groundbreaking, the 3D was well used thankfully. I would recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Revenge of the Nerds"" Animated Version","Pixar's latest offering ""Monsters University"" is a prequel to their 2000 smash hit ""Monsters Inc."" In this installment, we are brought back in time, when our favorite monster heroes: Mike (the green walking ball with one Cyclops eye, voiced by Billy Crystal) and Sully (the blue shaggy giant with the polka dotted arms, voiced by John Goodman) were just freshmen students at Monsters U, where they were enrolled in the ""Scaring"" program. We see how they first met, their classes, their professors, Randy the lizard, their fraternity. As a bonus, we also see Monsters Inc., linking this with the first film.Mainly, the film will showcase the ""Greek Scare Games"", an annual scaring competition where Greek societies battle to be the ""most fearsome monsters on campus"". This competition will forge as well as challenge Mike and Sully's friendship, as our heroes discover more about each other and about themselves while going through the various events.Beautiful may not really be the correct word to describe the artwork here, but let's just say that the artists were given their free hand to make the most imaginative and colorful monsters they can come up with. All the scenes in the monster world were bursting with bright colors and wacky designs, it was just lively to behold. The sprawling University campus itself looked like it was inspired by Harvard and its hallowed halls. In contrast, the scenes in the human world were drab and harsh, emphasizing the danger faced by the monsters in our world.The story of ""Monsters University"" though is very reminiscent of so many other films chronicling the battle of the ""losers"" versus the ""cool kids"" in college. Oozma Kappa, their fraternity of odd geeks and outsiders, reminded me of Lambda Lambda from ""Revenge of the Nerds"". The two emcees of the Scare Games reminded me of ""Pitch Perfect"" and its acapella singing competition. Their terrifying dragon-formed Dean Hardscrabble reminded me a lot about Harry Potter's Professor Snape. However, what this film did keep intact is the heart that the original ""Monsters Inc."" was known for, extolling friendship, cooperation, loyalty and fair play.Overall, this is another solid animated feature by Pixar. Like other Pixar films, this was funny, with just the right amount of emotion and moral lesson in it. The movie is very entertaining for the whole family, but maybe more for the kids and the kids at heart. However, the story line is too familiar and derivative to be really distinct, much unlike the innovative first film, which had a very original and mature story. You will definitely have a good time while watching the monsters and their shenanigans, but you may not even really remember it too well anymore after a while.After the lackluster ""Cars 2,"" I was a bit disappointed that ""Monsters University"" turned out to be another rather lightweight entry, relative to all the other illustrious Pixar films, that is. With reports of a ""Finding Nemo"" sequel in the works, I do hope Pixar can soon come up with another ground-breaking ORIGINAL story to bring back them back to their glory days. 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Its Not As Good As Monsters Inc but it is a Terrific Origin Story,","Monsters University is a fantastic movie with a terrific storyline,a very impressive voice cast and such lovable characters.I was kind of worried about this movie since I heard of it,I have such a fond memory of Monsters Inc from my childhood,and I was afraid Pixar were going to mess it up.It wasn't perfect and wasn't better than Monsters Inc (but I didn't expect it to be) but I was very pleased and their was nothing about the origin of Mike,Sully or Randall that I wasn't impressed with,although I do feel that Randall's story could have been a bit more dramatic,because he is much too evil in Monsters Inc but his back story to be that plain,but the whole story of how Sully and Mike meet and finally become friends is perfect,I love these two characters very much and I was very pleased.Its not Pixars best movie,but its just as heartwarming and funny as some of their best and has humor for the whole family to enjoy.I would definitely like to see another prequel from the studio another Monsters Inc would be great,Pixar know how to make prequels.Story of Mike Wazowski and James P.

"Decent, but not as good as the best Pixar films","The sequel to 2001's Monster's Inc. is definitely a feast for the eyes. The animation is great and there's some excellent use of color. There are dozens, if not hundreds of creative monster designs, sure to delight children. The attention to detail is amazing, as usual for Pixar. The movie doesn't talk down to kids and there are plenty of gags throughout to be enjoyed by adults as well.The voice acting is also top-notch in the story of how Sullivan (John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski(Billy Crystal) meet in college. Goodman and Crystal easily get back into their roles; their rapport is the crux of Monsters University. The somewhat predictable plot involves them getting kicked out of the School of Scaring and having to get first place at the ""Scare Games"" in order to get back in. The film utilizes many college movie clichés including the arrogant fraternity member, voiced by Nathan Fillion. Helen Mirren also stands out as the fittingly named Dean Hardscrabble.The tropes seem straight out of 80s college flicks like Revenge of the Nerds. Many have claimed that Pixar needed a critical hit after disappointing films such as Cars 2 and Brave. Monsters University mostly succeeds on that level, but doesn't quite reach the heights of the best Pixar movies. There were a few parts that were a bit slow or bland, and you definitely get the feeling that they were playing it safe with this one. There are some good moments, but it doesn't quite have the heart as some of their other releases. Don't go into it expecting the creativity of the first film, but Monsters University is a solidly entertaining movie for all ages.RATING: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's Alright,"A look at the relationship between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) during their days at Monsters University -- when they were not necessarily the best of friends.Although I enjoyed ""Monsters Inc"", I probably did not enjoy it as much as other people did. This, in turn, taints my outlook on this prequel, because in many ways the success of this film relies on the enjoyment of the first one (these are, after all, the same characters and voice talent).Not to say this is a bad film. In fact, it was quite fun and a touching tribute to the world of monsters. I enjoyed it far more than ""The Croods"" and would rather have seen this nominated for an Oscar than ""Croods"", even though neither has much chance of winning.

"It is a remincense of my childhood,","When I was six,I remember watching Monsters Inc many times,I've been watching that film and it is so good that I have no criticisms of it and today watching Monsters University,its as equally as good as the sequel.It brought me a lot of childhood memories of watching these shows and I felt awaken by those times when I watched the first movie and it was surprisingly very good which is dang,should'nt had listen to the critics.Anyway for those whom had grew up with the glory of Pixar Animation you should watch this movie.Its a remincense of Pixar's victorious days before they went slump with Wall.e which i felt they did.Some of the scenes I did cried,and some of the scenes i did laughed,just like how i felt when I watched the first movie.Anyway Monsters University is a really good show and like Monsters Inc,it is a generation of a company glory times,also with this movie in my own opinion,Pixar has made a stunning comeback compared to last year and all the years.Finally at least after the slump for 5 years(Toy Story 3 is counted out) Monsters University has shown that that is really Pixar,that is really their originally crafted film,that is actually the film that they had shown well much like where they were before.I am never impressed with a Pixar film in the current era until now,like most of their past films like the Toy Story franchises,Finding Nemo,The Incredibles,A Bugs Life ,the 1st Cars movie and Ratatouille,they have a really crafted storyline,a really crafted theme,some gorgeous background and also there is a lot of chemistry and charisma with and in the characters even the most minor ones.The scope of how the picture wanted to be seen is so deep and also it enlarge a bigger picture unlike Brave which felt less and horrible(its the worst Pixar movie I've ever seen since Up) Monsters University finally rises of of the slump and out of the Pixar dark era which they were now having today.Anyway thats all i can say,no negative words and by the way I'm supporting this film to win for the Oscar though I'm eyeing on Frozen too fingers cross but yet this movie (Monsters University) deserves it",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Charming College Comedy for the Kiddie Set,"Ten years ago Pixar's Monster's Inc introduced us to James P. Sullivan and Mike Wazowski, the top scaring team at the titular corporation. Now Monster's University takes us back to their college days to see how it all started. And surprise of surprises, they weren't always best buddies. Mike is the determined, hardworking underdog; Sully the gifted slacker who counts on family name and natural talent to carry him through as he parties the semester away. They're natural rivals from the moment they meet, but when their respective shortcomings threaten to derail their academic careers, their one chance to get back in the prestigious scaring program is to work together and shape up an unlikely band of misfits into the best scarers on campus.If any of that sounds familiar it should. It's the basic plot of every college slapstick and buddy comedy ever made, from the Marx Brothers to Animal House to the Simpsons. There's even the requisite rich boy frat house and the strict dean of students, though oddly enough no romantic interest for either star. Owing to its highly formulaic nature Monster's U is fairly predictable, with very little that will surprise experienced viewers. But the funny thing is that for the most part that really doesn't matter. Because while it may use a generations old formula, it uses it very well.And it's not like the target audience will have seen many college movies before, because this is a children's movie after all, and on that level it works quite well. There are plenty of likable oddball characters and a good number of hilarious hi-jinks. I particularly the delightfully hokey secret initiation and the other awkward situations that arise from the fraternity's unique housing conditions. And I challenge any viewer not to crack up at the sight of Mr. Waternoose in an afro.I also appreciated the ending, which forgoes the obvious and easy conclusion to create a more powerful crisis and show us what real scaring looks like. Monster's University may not be as grand, as deep, or as original as Pixar's best films, but it's still fun and funny, and a delight for the kids.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, amusing & with exquisite animation, but not a classic for the Pixar canon.","Before Pixar upped the ante with WALL.E, their offering that found it's way into the DVD player most often was Monsters Inc. Beautiful, beautifully original, funny, fantastic vocal talent, characters the entire audience could engage with fully (whether hissing at them or wanting to hug them) and animation to drool over: ""Wow, Scully's fur is sooo realistic. Look how it moves""I'll admit it, bar the odd blip (Cars, Up – Yeah, I know but they just didn't work for me), I'm a sucker for Pixar. Cautiously, but with high hopes, I packed up nieces & nephews and headed out for the Sunday morning sermon of the cinema with fingers crossed that this sequel would match the quality of Toy Story 2 & 3.Clearly, Monsters University is a prequel. A young, largely ignored and belittled Mike (Billy Crystal) is inspired by a school trip to Monsters Inc. and dreams of becoming a respected scarer. Fast-forward eleven years and Mike enrolls at Monsters University in the hope of achieving his life-long ambition. The trouble is, Mike just isn't scary as egotistical oaf, Sully (John Goodman), points out. Mike impresses Professor Knight (Alfred Molina) with his studious attitude but Professor Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) is a far greater challenge and his future at the university is in jeopardy unless he can prove he is fearsome.I did enjoy Monsters University, as my star rating attests, but it lacks the magic and originality of the original. For a start, it feels like a slip backwards; we know that screams will be replaced by laughter, we know how Mike's and Sully's friendship blossoms and so there is no room for surprise, or at least no opportunity for surprise is seized upon by writer/director Dan Scanlon.Instead of originality, Scanlon falls back on familiar devices to propel the story and it feels as though his mission was to make a Monsters sequel that swells the coffers rather than giving the audience a thrilling, warm, laugh-out-loud journey through the mind of Pixar again. Essentially, what we are served up is a group of misfits, failures and underdogs that must overcome their own issues and prejudices and to work together to overturn the odds and come out on top. Queue frat parties, student jealousy, initiation ceremonies and a villainess, Hardscrabble, who must be put in her place.However, the familiarity (or lack of originality) also allows for some enjoyable nods and twists on what we know. A few characters from the future wander through Monsters University in supporting roles and cameos that allow us a knowing chuckle, chief amongst these being the welcome, albeit brief, return of Randi (Steve Buscemi).The animation is exquisite. Post-viewing, we put the original on for the youngest who didn't come to the cinema and, compared to the blend of colours and movement of Monsters University, it looked dull and clunky. That's how far Pixar has evolved in the past decade.Monsters University is a fun film. It's a good addition to the Pixar canon and the children will love it. My little companions all claimed they enjoyed it more than the original. However, that was two minutes after the credits had finished rolling. My wife, however, echoed my view that, fun though it is, it's no classic and when both DVDs stand side by side on the shelf, it will be Monsters Inc. that will continue to be alternated with WALL.E.For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining and Visually Stunning,"Everyone who watched and enjoyed Pixar Animation Studios' fourth and highly successful production MONSTERS, INC. (2001) are in for a treat with MONSTERS UNIVERSITY – an equally entertaining, visually stunning production that is as whimsical and engaging as the former. Given the growing trend in origin stories, this prequel works by keeping the story in tune with the times but suggestively aimed at a vast yet specific demographic: young minds who are about to experience all the highs and lows of college life.Preceded by THE BLUE UMBRELLA, a short film that flexes Pixar's photorealistic prowess, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY begins by introducing us to Mike Wazowski, a green eyeball who dreams of being employed at Monsters Inc – a factory that powers the city of Monstropilis by sending monsters to gather energy generated by terrifying human children. Knowing that he doesn't have what it takes to be an effective 'scarer', Mike joins the titular university and on day one, forms a rivalry with James ""Sully"" Sullivan, an intimidating and overconfident behemoth of a monster. What follows is a fun filled farce where Mike and Sully must lead Oozma Kappa, a fraternity of monster misfits through a series of challenges, but not before learning to appreciate each other's redeeming qualities first.One of the biggest challenges for director and co-scripter Dan Scanlon (Storyboard artist for Pixar's CARS) was to make this second installment interesting as everyone knows how the film is going to end. This then becomes highly predictable for returning viewers who already know Mike and Sully to be inseparable friends. Another problem is the fact that children are easily bored with repetition and that is probably why CARS 2 threw Pixar into a nose dive. Against all these odds, Scanlon's nuance is in keeping this film fresh with loads of gags and witty one-liners aimed at both children and grownups. Not forgetting the college going populous, there are also satirical pokes at various frat movies like REVENGE OF THE NERDS (1984) and CARRIE (1976) and even references to recent films like OCEANS 13. The film also benefits from Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprising their roles as Mike and Sully, in addition to Steve Buscemi, Charlie Day and Helen Mirren lending their voices to some of the most vibrant characters ever created in an animation. Watch out for Terry Perry (Sean Hayes and Dave Foley), a two-headed monster with one body and two notorious brains!MONSTERS UNIVERSITY works as a perfect prequel even if you have not seen the 2001 original. Yes, there are moments that could have done with an extra dollop of the Crystal-Goodman chemistry from the original, but this is more than compensated with the inclusion of fresh new 'monsters' made possible by an impressive list of fantastic voice talents. The story not only brings back some of our favorite characters from the original, but also fits snugly within parent company Disney's tradition of imparting moral messages for the whole family.

"Stuck the Landing, Which Redeems is Slightly","Oh, Pixar, where have you gone? The best of Pixar films represent some of the best children's and family films of the last twenty years, films that will be cherished for generations to come, and will join or replace the classic Disney pantheon of Snow White, Bambi and others as the standard for family fare in the future. At it's best Pixar was creative, innovative, found a unique way to tell a clever story, and always managed to infuse the movies with characters with great heart and a story that causes them to learn much about themselves along the way.Monsters University, while enjoyable enough, fails to find these attributes of Pixar's modern classics. Instead, Pixar has here produced a familiar story with familiar characters that fails to do anything original which really captures the imagination.Here, we meet Mike and Sully much as we would have imagined them in their youth - Mike as a nerd and Sully as a popular party animal. Since there would be no story if Mike and Sully were instant friends, they begin the movie as rivals and then embark on a plot line straight out of Animal House or Revenge of the Nerds, trying to stave off expulsion from the menacing Dean while hopefully leading a group of underdogs to victory in a university competition.Through this first three-quarters of the film, all we get is this generic story. Of course, the visuals are wonderful - the Monster world explodes with color and variety. Of course there are laughs (but fewer and less potent than in most Pixar comedies). But the only lasting characters are Mike and Sully - the ones we already knew. The other students at the University make little impression, and will not make any lists of favorite Pixar characters. Only the college dean (a very creepy combination of a dragon and a centipede) in memorable, and here more for her appearance than her character or voice work.Fortunately, Pixar still knows how to stick the landings. Despite being presented with two or three opportunities to end the film in shallow and conventional ways, they keep going, keep probing Mike's quest to be a scarer, the reality that he will ultimately become a sidekick to Sully in the future, and the ways in which he and Sully need each other to be successful, and how their partnership is essential to their enduring friendship. Relationships - whether good, bad, strained, temporary, or lasting - is what Pixar does best, and in the last act here, they develop the relationship that we knew from Monsters Inc. must inevitably result.The kids will enjoy it. There are some laughs. The last 20 minutes after the ""Scaring Games"" end spared this movie from a harsher review. But instead of Pixar genius, this is Pixar mediocrity, ultimately making a movie not much better than any number of family films out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
They're back... and its GOOOOD.,"MONSTERS UNIVERSITY is a prequel to MONSTERS INC., directed by Dan Scanlon. The characters include the voices of Billy Crystal, John Goodman, Hellen Mirren.The film goes back to where Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan were before they were buddies and in Monsters Inc. It shows how the two of them were in university, showing the relationship between them which led up to the two of them becoming the best of friends.Alright, so MIKE AND SULLY ARE BAACKK!!! Well, thats what every kid or adult that was associated with the enjoyment of Monsters Inc should say. Okay, so it's been 12 years since we saw these two on-screen, providing us with animated humor, and now they're back again, to show us how they were in University. The teaser trailer was extremely funny as it showed a prank played on Mike by Sully, and it gave a short look-in into the sort of relationship we would be seeing. Soon enough, the trailer came out and boy did it get people hooked. Finally, I was able to catch a premiere screening of the film, to my advantage, and IT WAS GREAT.So let's start talking about the film, not necessarily the trailers. Who are we kidding, at first when we heard that Monsters University was coming, that a sequel was coming to the classic Monsters Inc, we gave up hope, saying that no one could make it better than the first one. But Dan Scanlon challenged that, and the first teaser proved it. And I think that the movie does it as well- kinda. So, Monsters University isn't AS good as Monsters Inc, but it does come second in line. It includes Mike and Sully in an underdog team, but throughout the film, you can't help and laugh out at the jokes, and smile at the fact that the sequel is finally out.Monsters University is GREAT. It has two parts and its all happy and fun. I, honestly, liked the way they showed the chemistry developing between Mike and Sully. You can actually feel it, and even though its animation, it feels real. This one isn't quite sad, like how Inc was. Inc ended in a sad tune, at the fact that Boo was gone, but this one ends at the beginning of Inc. I loved the way it ended. The line that Mike uses just makes you go like, 'YEAH! Thats what I'm talking about!' Honestly, I'm not gonna say any more, because I don't wanna spoil anything for anyone.In the end, Monsters University is great fun. Pixar has done it again, the director has managed to do it. I don't think that there is gonna be another part to the franchise, which kinda dulls me, but at the end of Monsters University it makes you wanna see more, which you will only get by watching Inc, since its the continuation. Go watch Monsters University, with anyone to be honest. I guarantee you an extremely fun ride that these two will give you.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It Passes Its Classes,"""Monsters University"" is Pixar's animated prequel to ""Monsters Inc"" released 12 years after the fact. Admittedly, setting the movie as a prequel, is its biggest problem to overcome. With the way ""Monsters Inc"" ended, there was potential for an interesting sequel. There isn't much you can do with the prequel, following the story of how Mike and Sully met in college.It follows all the typical college movie clichés, but with it having a ""G"" rating, this will likely be the first exposure most kids get to those story beats.For me, most of this movie is salvaged by the ending. I won't give it away here, but let's just say it is a clever twist on the formula. I respect the fact that movie does not speak down to its audience. Despite its ""Kids' Movie"" visual, it is tackling issues that goes well above their target demographic. And I don't mean that throw out references or innuendos, they are just tackling issues that the kids won't relate to. They're characters going to college and wanting to get a job. Kids can relate in the broad strokes, but it is the adults that truly have empathy with the protagonists.The movie may not get an ""A+"", but it does receive a passing grade.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very enjoyable and worth the time,"Monsters University is the sequel i.e. prequel to the first movie Monsters Inc.It is a very good and funny movie for children, and for adults also. I recommend to watch the first Monsters movie first, because this one will be so much funnier when you connect the dots. I don't think anyone can dislike this movie and you definitely won't regret watching it. It has humor, funny scenes, a story and it gives great message about friendship. The only thing I didn't like about this movie, is that I already predicted some of the up-coming scenes. But, maybe that's just me. Any way, the ending did surprised me, in the best way. So, don't waste time reading all reviews, call a friend,make popcorn and get ready to laugh out loud.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Doesn't hold a candle,"""Monsters University"" has my vote for the most unnecessary prequel, story-wise at the very least. If Mike Wazowski is working at Monsters Inc. in the original movie, then this movie's ending is a foregone conclusion; he'll either triumph over adversity or find a loophole.It's got a pretty good cast, but Charlie Day steals the movie easily (and it's not the first time). But it lacks the heart and soul of the original. Even Ratzenberger feels shoehorned in, and he's the studio's quirky Easter egg. It's not a weak effort because a lot of work went into this. But the story's deeply lacking.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Misses the point of Monster Inc.,"Since he was a little monster, Mike wanted to go to MU (Monsters University) in order to become a top scarer for his kind. His only problem was that he wasn't scary at all. Despite this ""minor"" issue, he's determined to work hard in order to achieve his dream, although his only hope apparently lies in winning the famous Scare Games. Together with a team a misfits and a self-centred enemy, he must do everything in his power to succeed or face expulsion.It's a movie which bases its story way before the events from Monsters Inc, presenting the beginnings of Mike and Sully, how they got along in college, how they managed to overcome their condition and differences and ultimately become the best friends we saw in the first instalment. It's also funny as its predecessor, but unfortunately, it misses the idea of the first movie, one that made it really good. It lacks the thrill, the emotion and the soul. It feels unpolished, made to be a laugh, much more superficial I might say, fact which lowers the overall quality quite significant.It focuses way too much on those games but doesn't manage to involve the viewer as well, to somehow make him care about what's happening, especially when considering that the two compete together although they are bitter rivals and are ""helped"" by the only fraternity that was left in the campus. And, not to say that the finale is more or less known, having seen the first one. It redeems itself a bit towards the end with a couple of twists but it simply falls into mediocrity, without anything to make it stand out.Overall, it feels like a sequel (although it's a prequel) which was made just to profit from the name the first instalment made for itself, ditching key aspects which made it great, inexplicably choosing another path, ending up an average movie. You can watch it out of curiosity but don't expect the same quality, or you'll be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A vastly entertaining story about how Mike Wazowski meets Sully. Why does this film get so much hate? It's super fun, has a pretty good villain, and is a truly great underdog story. Not to mention the usual Pixar happy ending that always sticks the landing. Still, I can definitely tell that this doesn't capture the Pixar vibe that they are so very well known for. In fact, the last 3 Pixar movies (Cars 2, Brave, Monsters University) haven't really felt like Pixar movies, aside from having the usual characters. Doesn't mean they're bad movies, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not a movie for kids - in a good way!,"This movie was great! I haven't enjoyed an animation in quite a while the way I enjoyed this. It's not a film for kids and I mean that in the best way possible. It is not simple and superficial, rather it is unexpected, new, and deeper than you think. Kids will enjoy it, but adults will enjoy, understand, and appreciate it the most.The film is unpredictable and furthers the plot in ways that you wouldn't expect. The characters grow on you and you already establish a great connection with them from the very start. I liked that the message was conveyed fully rather than conveniently - the ending wasn't conveniently happy with easy-won success for everyone as if in a fantasy world of happy endings, the ending was realistic.The film itself spoke of universal concepts; hope, desires, dreams, belonging, rejection, failure, and friendship.

It is hard to live up to the rep of the first movie,"In this prequel to Monsters inc, we get to see how Mike and Sulley become friends and a team of sorts at the end, because in the beginning they are not exactly that.This film has much to offer and as many other animation films it has a lot for both kids and grownups, We get to meet a whole bunch of new characters and some of the ""old"" ones but in their youth. It was very entertaining for the entire family and filled with joy and pranks and much more, a very nice film and a very good introduction to the monsters world and their way of education :)It is hard to live up to the rep of the first movie and in general my expectations are very high for films from Pixar and Disney, so it gets a little lower rating then the first one.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Monsters University,"Monsters University was directed & written by Dan Scanlon, produced by Kori Rae, Andrew Stanton, & John Lasseter who had their hands all over most of the Pixar classics! Pixar has had a little run with okay movies between 2011 & 2013, like Brave & Cars 2, but Mosters University was superior to both. After waiting eleven and a half years for the sequel, we finally got it, but as a surprising prequel. During the first two acts, it was fine, due to the okay pace & premise, but come the last act, and more or less the extended half hour, it was the best part of the film! If the director and writers kept that pace the whole movie, and maybe condensed it a little bit, this film would've been a great prequel, and a better overall outing.The characters had a great look, with charming voice overs, bringing back Billy Crystal as Mike, John Goodman as Sulley & Steve Buscemi as Randall Boggs. It was fun to see their characters, younger, while still capturing the same charisma as everyone knows and loves. The side characters all had their interesting aspects, but as a whole, they weren't anything that stood out. Dan Scanlon, Daniel Gerson & Robert L. Baird added a creative touch, capturing the college student traits and actions, in a PG form. Sadly, they're developments and cliché roles killed it.The screenplay by Dan Scanlot, Daniel Gerson & Robert L. Baird had some decent emotional scenes, but cluttered with hit or miss jokes, with unnecessary one liners from the original, just to say that they brought something back.Needless to say, the cinematography and animations were brilliant! Jean-Claude Kalache, and Matt Aspbury, had great detail with every strain of hair, blade of grass, and more!Overall, this wasn't one of those prequels that was unbearable to watch, but I wouldn't go as far as watching again for fun. I'd still love to see a sequel off of the original, 2001 Monsters Inc.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

My favorite non-toy story Pixar follow-up,"Outside of the Toy Story sequels other Pixar sequels never impress me except for Monsters University. My main reason is because it is funnier and more cleverly written compared to the other Pixar follow-ups and I'm going to explain.Monsters University doesn't look as uncanny as other Pixar sequels. Sequels like TS 4, Finding Dory look very uncanny and weird but because MU was one of the earlier sequels, it's not as photorealistic as other ones.Charm and vibes from Monsters, Inc is still present to some agree because it's still a funny one, and I found it pretty enjoyable. It has great messages because it goes like ""Don't let others judge you"" ""You can do it"" etc and the climax is pretty epic as well. That one spectacular scene at the lake where Mike and Solly have a genuine heart-heart conversation of people judging theme and the final big scare is pretty epic tooBut it definitely has noticeable issues holding it back. First of all, Randal's big reveal to evil is completely off-screen, we don't get a characterization with him at all, the writers just took a short cut with his script. Speaking of which, the plot takes a lot of short-cuts plus I will never understand why Mike isn't scary. Me personally if a green eyeball monster with a single eye would terrify me but there are also a lot of monsters I thought was more ridiculous and stupid than scary but they still get to be scary. The villain was really dull. In Inc, there were 2 excellently written villains but it's so dumb here like all she does was yell at Mike and Sully. And I think the cameo of the Abominable snowman was dumb as well. It kind of ruins continuity since in Monsters, Inc Mike and Sully had no clue who he was but Abominable is casually one of the main roles of the companyIn conclusion a potentially great film but it had a lot of small problems that pile up to each other to make the final product a little bland but I really liked this!Rating: 7.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Builds up to the Screaming Genius of Monsters, Inc.","8.2 of 10. Monsters, Inc. is perfect, so I can understand why it took 12 years for a sequel (in this case, a prequel). It ties in seamlessly with the original, even helping explain and give context to parts of the original, including the characters. For those who haven't seen the first, I can understand why this would seem near genius too. For those of us who have, however, it's very satisfying, just not a masterpiece.Part of this has to do with timing. The first film was released in November just after Halloween. This would have fit better being released near that time of year too.The character voices are too old. Goodman would have been better as the father in The Croods (2013) and Crystal as maybe a teacher in this just for the sake of giving hardcore fans something to play with. They are monsters, so their is some room to play, but given they have kid monsters with kid voices, it would make more sense to give them more teen/college-like voices along with more slang.As for the animation, outside of a momentary quirk where it seemed like Sully was a human wearing a monster suit, it's as good as cartoon animation gets. Whereas the soundtrack added to the first, the soundtrack in MU is transparent, neither adding nor subtracting from the film.Maybe most importantly, this prequel will not ruin or even take away from the original.

"Not As Good As Monsters, Inc, But Still Enjoyable","In Monsters University, we join Mike & Sully again but this time it's before their Monsters, Inc days as this is a prequel that takes us through their school days and how they met. Young Mike Wazowski has a dream of becoming a Scarer at Monsters, Inc so he works his way through school to get to Monsters University and it's there he meets James P. Sullivan. Unfortunately they get along together like Tom & Jerry, but after making a deal with Dean Hardscrabble that he and his fraternity of loser friends can win the university's Scare Games he's forced to work alongside Sully when his group is short by one member. Will it be a continuance of butting heads, or Mike & Sully manage to put their differences aside to work together? This is yet another good Disney/Pixar animation, but unfortunately it's nowhere near one of the funniest. While there are slightly amusing parts dotted throughout the movie and it does have it's certain moments, there is a definite lack in the hilarity department. The animation, however, is top notch as always (and as we have come to expect), especially on Blu-ray, with the visuals being crystal clear and really well done.The voice casting is good as well with the return of John Goodman as Sully and Billy Crystal as Mike and even though I'm not a big fan of Billy Crystal as I think he's about as funny as a funeral, him and Goodman do work well together as the main characters. Steve Buscemi makes a return as Randall Boggs, and Helen Mirren is good as the hard, steely faced, and serious Dean Hardscrabble.As with Disney/Pixar as well, this movie is good for kids and adults of all ages and even though it has a G rating, there may possibly be two or three scenes that might just be a wee bit scary for the really younger children of the 4 or 5 age group, but overall it's a movie made to be enjoyed by everyone, young and old.Monsters University may not be as good as the slightly better Monsters, Inc but it's still a decent family movie to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly solid comedy,"""Monsters University"" has a thin plot that lends itself perfectly for comedy. It's basically ""Rudy"" but with becoming a professional scarer instead of being a Notre Dame football player. Except unlike Rudy, we know from the very beginning that he's going to fail. The good news is that this is a comedy, not an inspiring feel good story of how if you work hard enough you can achieve your dream. And as a comedy Monsters University delivers consistent laughs.Most of the jokes are visual so it's tough to rehash them in a written review. ""I found a nickle! Sure wish I had pockets..."" What keeps this movie going isn't witty dialogue as much as it is lots of little visual extras in the background of different shots. It's the detail that makes it good.If you don't like visual humor then Monsters University is probably not for you. It offers little else. It's not much in the way of a plot. If you think about the moral of the story, it's that no matter how hard you work you may never achieve your goals. Perhaps it teaches kids a good lesson on mediocrity and being okay with not being the best. Somehow it sounds less inspiring than the movie makes it out to be.If you enjoy other Pixar movies or enjoyed Monsters Inc. then Monsters University is definitely worth a watch. It won't go down as a classic, but it's still a very solid comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Of course, this will be the movie for those that truly enjoyed the original film.

"Disappointed, but not very surprised...","Note: This viewing took place while a middle aged crone sitting a few seats away thought it was her duty to giggle at every single whimsical moment in the film, whether it was funny or not. Either it was an unsupervised visit to the cinema for her from her place of residence, or she really needed to stay off the happy pills.Ever get the feeling that you're watching a movie where the pitch for it was done, long before they'd even started on the script? Well, that's the case here: ""HEY MONSTERS INC WAS A BIG HIT!! WE CAN'T DO A FOLLOW UP SINCE THE ENDING OF IT WAS SO FINITE... I KNOW!

So don't arrest me, Disney!! What it all adds up to is an accomplished piece of cinema that all the family will enjoy with a fair few amusing moments (but certainly not as many as the individual I was located near would suggest) and a great climax where EVERYTHING, quite literally, in on the line. But it lacks soul, there feels no need for it's existence and it pales in comparison to the enchanting original. There's no substitute here for Scully's heartrending relationship with the little girl Boo, just lots of knockabout fun and very obvious, overdone Life Lessons. For any normal company, this would be more than sufficient, but this is PIXAR we're talking about here, so you can't help but feel the bar should be set far higher (Mind you, their last two movies, Cars 2 and Brave weren't so hot, so maybe it's about time we started reevaluating our expectations...)And their next release will be a sequel to the much cherished Finding Nemo.

Slightly Disappointing But A Good Movie All The Same,"Just seen the movie and although it's very enjoyable, I don't feel it's half as good as the original (which has a very special place in my heart)Being a Disney movie there was of course a pre-movie short animation, in this case titled 'the blue umbrella' which was very similar in plot to the one that opened wreck-it Ralph. However whereas that was good looking and appeared unrealistic, this seemed almost as though it was shot on film.This high quality production continued into the film itself, which was bright and colourful with the odd dark scene used to reflect those more conflict driven parts of the plot, something we have seen Disney be effective at in most, if not all of their animations.The plot itself felt somewhat underdeveloped, sure it can't be too complex for the children in the audience but this came across as being quite predictable and that certain moral messages (such as 'it doesn't matter what you look like') where briefly brought up and brushed aside before they could be fulfilled",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A prequel that's almost as good as the original,"Monsters University tells the story of how Mike and Sully, the lovable characters from Monsters Inc, meet at university. It tells of their conflict and their struggle to get to where they are in Monsters Inc.There is only one thing wrong with Monsters University. It makes plot holes with the original. And I really hate that it does. Because in and of itself, Monsters University has a fantastic and engaging story. Although it doesn't create a world itself, the campus of the university is done to perfection. Every little detail is thought of. I can tell that the writers really looked around at a campus and thought ""how can we make this monster-ish"" and it shows.The cast of characters is amazing. They all have realised personalities and it makes for great watching. Dean Abigail Hardscrabble is simply an incredible addition. She feels like a genuine monster and I very much enjoyed the scenes she was in. Furthermore, due to the scare course they have created for the movie, it makes the last scene where they put it to action really intriguing. We see how the course mixes with their personality and limitations. Really fantastic.However, a small personal thing about characters that I would have loved to see and I'm not annoyed it didn't happen, I just wanted to see what Pixar would have done with it. I would love to have seen Celia Mae (The snake-cyclops hybrid) appear, however briefly. Perhaps in the background, revealed her major and maybe shown why Mike was so obsessed with her in Monsters Inc. Just a thought.Randall's backstory is a detail thrown in at the end and it's really clever. I wasn't expecting it to appear the way it did. I was expecting the reason to be simply just that Sully stole Mike from him. Put in true Pixar fashion my expectations were subverted and I loved what they did with it.Another detail I absolutely adored was the fact that we saw the scare floor at several different generations. And what I loved about this is that we see that the monsters become more diverse the more generations we go down. It showed that children became harder to scare and the need for stranger and creepier monsters. A touch that I thought inspired.Overall, great watching and if it weren't for those plot holes, would be a certain favourite.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Only by forming their own fraternity can they hope to survive in the ""Scare Games"" - winning them being the only way to assuage their furious professor and get back to class. Loads of enjoyable escapades follow as they have to learn to rely upon and trust one another. The mischievous ""Randall"" shows us some early signs of his duplicity and the competitive nature of the episodic narrative works well at allowing the characters to have fun as they begin that lifelong bond (or not). The writing provides for some humour as we build to a denouement that isn't exactly a surprise, but is still just a little quirkier than expected. Not so good as the first one, but as a re-invention of some amiable characters goes, this is a quickly paced adventure that's not bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar Back on Top!!!,"The Blue Umbrella review:This short proves that you don't need laughs for a film to be great. I love the fact that PIXAR isn't afraid to experiment with their shorts and this short definitely shines (in my eyes). Although this short film is very different to PIXAR's other works, and doesn't contain laugh-out loud funny moments (Monsters University makes up for that), or contain a huge array of memorable characters; it is a truly gorgeous piece of art. The music is one thing that shines yet again in the short, but what makes this short so AMAZING is the photo-realistic animation that had my mouth hanging the whole way through; it is truly astonishing. I do have to say though that it reminded me of the Disney short film PAPERMAN and it's plot was very similar. PIXAR have matured a lot with this film.Monsters University review:Monsters University is a fun, exciting film for the whole family. The visual aspect of the film is yet again, truly amazing, the animation is the best of their film's to date. The amount of thought and time that went into this film can be seen on screen. Although this film did not see me reaching for the tissues, or wiping the fog off my 3D glasses, I definitely shed a tear or two. Monsters University has a great moral and I recommend you go and see it, especially if you're a fan of the first movie. PIXAR have definitely created a Prequel that lives up to its predecessor and builds on the back story to the film that the world fell in love with back in 2001. Definitely worth going to see at the cinemas. Another PIXAR classic to add to my collection when it's released on DVD.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Through a College Student's Eyes,"12 years ago, Pixar took us into the world that lies behind our closet doors, into the world of Monsters Inc. Now, Monsters University takes us back to where one of our favorite dynamic duos began. Of course this is a movie any parent would take their children to see, but secretly Pixar made this for those small children who went to see the movie 12 years ago when they were in first or second grade. Now, these bright eye children are on their own way to college and what better way to send them off than my showing them a glimpse of college life with some of their favorite movie characters. I have just completed my freshman year of college as well as most of my friends and from what I have seen and heard, Monsters University stays close to actual college life with the idea in mind that it is appropriate for all ages and is full of Monsters.This witty, silly, and all around fun animated comedy takes us back to when Mike met Sully. The movie begin with a young Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) on a field trip to the Monsters Incorporated building where he begins his dream to become a Scarer after graduating from Monsters University. Fast forward to Mike's first day of college at MU, where he meets his roommate Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) and explores the campus. During his semester, Mike hits the books to prove himself for no one thinks he can be scary. He is constantly at odds with the naturally scary, James ""Sully"" Sullivan (John Goodman) who just has that scare factor. Mike is on his way until an incident during his end of fall exam. Sully and Mike are kicked out of the Scaring program and to get back in they must prove themselves in the Scare Games with their unlikely and adorable fraternity, Oozma Kappa. Monsters University is a movie that will touch the hearts and tickle the sides of many.Monsters University shows not only a typical college experience but dives in deeper to actual college habits and life. When Mike is walking through campus on his first day, you see various college like activities going on such as ultimate Frisbee, students playing guitar on the quad, and trying to get you to join their club or Greek organization. Monster's University does a wonderful job depicting the typical college life, but it's the little things that only a college student would notice that make it truly unique in this animated film for kids. In one scene, Sully is getting recruited for the scariest and coolest fraternity, Roar Omega Roar, and you see them telling Mike he just isn't scary enough. All the fraternity members laugh at the poor Mike and you see the crab snap his claws, to the typical person this just is something a crab would do, but to a college student this is a frat snap. A frat snap is a way to snap with your hand with the fingers extended and moving your wrist in a certain manner, this is typically done by guys in a fraternity. And this is what I love about Pixar, it is the little things that make you go ""wow."" I thought this movie would just cater to the little kids the most but it turned out to cater to us new college students as well.I had been excited to see this movie the second I heard about it, but my friends were incredibly skeptical. They were so worried that it wouldn't out do the first one that it made them unwilling to even see the movie. I knew though that it isn't the first movie, so I need to look at it in a different light. I will agree that it wasn't as good or out did the original Monsters Inc. but it defiantly pulled at my heart strings and made me want to see it again. Why was it not as good as the first one? To be honest, I have no idea. Maybe because it didn't have Boo or any little kids that we wanted to befriend. I just can't put my finger on it. But I have no doubt that if you go in with an open mind then you will enjoy this movie and all the silly things about it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Well worth a visit to cinema,"This is the latest Pixar film and as usual fairly entertaining. It played along with a short featuring umbrellas which was also fun.Monsters University follows the trails and tribulations of Mike who wants to go to scare school. It is a prequel to Monsters Inc. Sullivan is from a family of scary people and really doesn't get along with Mike when they meet at Scare school.As ever with Pixar there is a great storyline, script and characterisation. You feel like you really know a lot about many of the characters and it's totally unlike many of the real life films which is rather ironic. This will be enjoyable to all the family and is well worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar Gets an F. The Juvenile Monster's U Shows Little Effort.,"We all know how unprecedentedly great Pixar was in the late-90s and early-2000s. With classic after classic after classic, the CG animation pioneers redefined family cinema. Then, around the turn of the decade, they ran out of ideas. Monster's University is another of their subpar sequels, and what a sad reminder this film is of those past glory days.Monster's university is technically a prequel to the fabulous 2001 film, Monster's Inc., showcasing Mike and Sully (voiced again by Billy Crystal and John Goodman) as newly acquainted college freshmen at a prestigious school for scaring. And now is where I ask, Who thought this story was worthy of a feature film? There is nothing of value to the whole premise, much less to the film's trite plot. The writers do their best to spice up the obligatory prequel features (callbacks, introductions to people we already know, and the like) with a manufactured ""College Games"" that pits several fraternities against one another in a race for a school trophy, but it only serves to illuminate the lack of interest in revisiting Monster's Inc. It's also shamelessly kiddie. For a studio that made its name with storytelling strong enough for parents to enjoy, it's almost shocking to see something as trivial as a ""big game"" as the movie's centerpiece. Monster's University's story barely qualifies as a Disney Junior Original, never mind a Pixar product.The downfall of Pixar is two-fold. In one sense, they have lost the creative spark that led to Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and The Incredibles, straining to recreate their signature blend of smart storytelling, colorful characters, and creative animation. And then there's movies like Monster's University, which doesn't even try to imitate a formula that works. It's low hanging fruit to prop up a few mildly amusing gags on a paper-thin storyline about some manufactured college competition. Monster's University will distract kids, but it won't do much else. I did not hate the film, but I was thoroughly disappointed by it. At one time, you could count on the fact that Pixar would never play it safe. If Monster's U is any indication, those days are long gone.38/100",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Nostalgia-fest,"So I'm one of those people that grew up with Monsters Inc. Entering the theatre for this, I was apprehensive - I mean, it's a prequel to a classic movie. Luckily it completely exceeded my expectations.Every moment was hilarious, and there were some awesome cameo appearances from older characters :DThis movie made me feel sorry for the young generation now who have to grow up to animated movies aiming for good graphics instead of storyline. The only other animated movies to reach the heights of Monsters Inc. and Monsters University are Finding Nemo (and hopefully Finding Dory) as well as Despicable Me 1 and 2.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A worthy prequel to a modern classic,"I'll be the first to admit the utter disappointment I've had in Pixar's latest works, 'Cars 2' plunging particularly low into the bowels of mediocrity (I'd even say it was plain bad) and 'Brave' being decent yet uninspired. The real ""Pixar magic"" were nowhere to be seen since the masterful 'Toy Story 3'. Well, I'm very pleased to say that they managed to do something fresh, something zesty, something borderline magical with this prequel to their very beloved ""Monsters Inc.""Don't get me wrong, it isn't without flaws, as so many movies rarely are, and it might not be fresh in the sense of never having been done before, but the high school setting works surprisingly well with this universe. It opens up a lot of creativity when it comes to characters (most of them only appearing for seconds as a small gag). Some work, some don't, but it is quite evident that the team at Pixar had a blast coming up with every single one of them. Well-established characters from the first movie get padded out even further, and reasons for the actions in the first movie are (unnecessarily, yet cleverly) padded out as well.The most (surprisingly) noteworthy positive is the incredible soundtrack. The lively horn-instruments delivering catchy tunes and giving that campus-feel is truly great and adds a lot to every scene it graces. Trust me when I say you will not want to leave the credits because of the soundtrack alone.All in all I'm feeling positive about Pixar again. They're getting back on the right track, although I feel like they ought to put the sequels to rest. If you are a fan of the original Monsters Inc. I would definitely recommend this feature film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not essential, but worthwhile","Monster's Inc is one of the early Pixar gems. I had been worried this would be an utter mess, but thankfully it's not bad. The only complaint is that the storyline is a little underwhelming. You don't need the film to enjoy the better Monster's Inc. This feels like a corporate push into series building, much like Cars. The film lacks the heart of the first film, but it's interesting if you're a fan of the series.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
an underachiever for Pixar brand,"I haven't revisited MONSTERS, INC. (2001, 8/10) since its original release, so a decade later, forgive me for no photographic memory to scan the connections between it and its prequel (all I remember is Mike and Sullivan duo). But start afresh, MONSTERS UNIVERSITY is no less entertaining than any other Pixar-labeled ""high-art"" animations, although it doesn't reach the peak where the one-two-three punch WALL-E (2008, 9/10), UP (2009, 9/10) and TOY STORY 3 (2010, 9/10) has thrived.It is a standard college comedy, reminiscent of Harry Potter trio's adventure in Hogwarts, Mike being a male version of Hermoine the know-it-all, studious but more aggressive and pertinacious; Sullivan is the golden boy who struts and banters for popularity with his inborn stature and family prestige. So from foes to friends they have to learn their lessons in a hard way, Mike being an overachieving geek in the wrong game and Sullivan squandering his time and talent and taking a lofty goal for granted, twist number one; next step, an underdog's team work to crown the champion in the scary competition, but an indiscreet but understandable machine-rigging undermines the victory, this is twist number two; then an extravaganza into the toxic human world comes to a climax shows the pair's true potentiality and produces the twist number three; then unlike the conventional happy ending in Disney world, the twist number four heartwarmingly brings them into a niche place and avers one maxim, there isn't only one way to reach your goal.Since Mike and Sullivan aren't exactly the funny wise-crackers, all assortment of monster sidekicks not only have to arrest your glances but also elicit laughters, frankly speaking, the belly-laughing moments are not so frequent as RIO (2011, 8/10) for instance, and occasionally it loses momentum in its execution of the story, the five rounds of competition are unevenly exposed. Randy Newman's music is still uplifting and all-age friendly, but the excitement doesn't register anymore, still the brand of Pixar is aiming to a youngster-slanting demography for the sake of maximizing the profit, but the story of undergraduates and fraternity could be more nostalgic to adult audiences, its wavering standpoint may cause detriment and set a barricade to retain the golden medal as the torchbearer in the business above and beyond its unparalleled production team.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Roooar!!,"What would we do without Pixar? They always find a way to make the colors a little bit brighter, the laughter a little bit louder and the heart a little bit warmer. This movie is no exception. Monsters University delivers all those elements and more.Mike's biggest goal is to become a scarer, he works harder than anyone to make that happen. And you really feel for the little guy, he does his very best. He is bold and has no doubt that he will make it, being that goal oriented, he doesn't seem to see what others see - the fact that he is not scary at all. It sucks, and you cheer for him all the way, you really, really want him to become the greatest scarer of all time!This prequel is one of the good ones, and you don't have to see Monsters Inc. to enjoy this movie, it's fun and highly entertaining. I gave it a seven because it's hard to rank animation movies any higher, it would have to be as impressive as when Finding Nemo first came out. But I liked this movie, it had quality in many ways; script, scenes, characters etc.Get yourself a giant bucket of ice cream, put on your softest clothes, crawl under the blankets and press play... Oooor, invite friends and have a laugh together! Either way - I think you'll like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pass the Popcorn review,"It's been 12 years since Monsters, Inc. came out. It was a huge success and a great cartoon, so it's actually really strange Pixar hadn't decided to make a sequel/prequel to it earlier. Still, this year we got Monsters University. I must admit that when I saw the title I thought this was going to be an awful prequel that will simply ruin the franchise. But since it was – and still is – the second most financially successful animated movie this year, I decided to give it a try – and I was pleasantly surprised.Monsters University introduces us to a very young Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal) who, one day on a school trip visits Monsters Inc., the scaring company. Since everybody looks down on him and doesn't consider him scary, he decides to prove everyone wrong and become a scarer. Years later, we meet an older Mike, who has just got registered at Monsters University and is starting his lessons. What he lacks in talent, he makes up for in hard work. An arrogant and conceited James P. Sullivan soon becomes his rival.First of all, I liked that the movie shows that, in order to be successful, you have to work hard. But it also demonstrates that if something isn't for you, no matter how much you want it, it's much better to let it go. Mike isn't a scarer in Monsters, Inc. because he isn't scary, and he learns to live with it at the end of this prequel – even though it means to give up all of his childhood dreams. But in the end he's happy and satisfied with his life and his job. So, on one hand the movie is a bit too idealistic for grown-ups (because sometimes, no matter how much you work, you'll get nowhere), but it compensates by having this realistic ending.The story itself isn't original – college life, enemies becoming friends and overcoming obstacles by helping each other – but some twists are truly unexpected. The humour is not as childish as one may think, and even the silliest scenes, like someone falling over, provide good laughs. There are a lot of other, supporting characters, and almost everyone is funny, interesting and developed enough not to be just dead weight. In conclusion, this is a very good animated movie, but it's not perfect. It lacks 'that little something', which might have been achieved by inventing a more original story. But it's not a movie I'd suggest you avoid, and if there's ever a sequel to Monsters, Inc. I suggest right now you watch that one too.Rating: 7/10 Read more at http://passpopcorn.wordpress.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worst ending possible,"Let me just start out by saying, the beginning 5 minutes we're the only redeemable parts about this film. Because Mike was cute. That's it.Everything else was the most generic, cliche, horrible plot, and absolutely no heart to the movie. Also, can we talk about that ending??? They literally just skipped over the entire point of the movie. If this was a prequel to monsters inc, then why didn't they show their actual progression to becoming scarers??!????I understand that there's a life lesson to be learned through those pictures at the end, but it seemed glossed over and made Mike's efforts pointless. The entire movie implies that they went to school to be scarers.Overall, dreadful movie and I am very disappointed in Pixar for creating something so lackluster.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Spectacular Monster Inc prequel, Great job Pixar!","In 2001, Walt Disney and Pixar Animation Studios pleased millions of movie goers with their animated hit film Monster Inc which told the story of two friends: a blue, furry monster named Sully (voiced by John Goodman) and a green, one-eyed monster named Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal), who worked together for a corporation where monsters creep into bedrooms of little children and scare them to sustain their cities' energy and power resources with the frightened children's screams. Twelve years later, Pixar takes the audience back in time to when Mike and Sully first met during their college days with this prequel to Monster Inc. These two attend college at Monsters University, starting off on each other's not-so-good sides but are forced to work together to compete against the fraternities in the scare games. Joining Oozma Kappa, an unpopular fraternity of social misfits including Scott ""Squishy"" Squibbles, middle-aged Don Carlton, Terry Perry and Terri Perry (who are conjoined twins), Art, and Squishy's mother Sherri, Mike and Sully develop a friendships as they compete against the odds of prodigy fraternities, including the prestigious Roar Omega Roar.So this movie plays almost like a cross between college comedies such as Revenge of The Nerds (1984) and Old School (2003) with its subplots involving fraternities and mixes with family-friendly humor, and the result is a cute and clever Pixar film that will without a doubt please the whole family. While it may not feel slightly inferior to Pixar's other works, it still has the style and flair that Disney-Pixar films embrace. Featuring the talented voices of John Goodman, Billy Crystal, Steve Buscemi, Helen Mirren, Peter Sohn, Joel Murray, Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, and Charlie Day, this film boasts an entertaining, if not original, story line of how Mike and Sully became the friends that we knew from the first film. The plot follows on these characters who are kicked out the ""Scare Program"" due to their failure being ""scary"" and work together by joining a fraternity to make their way back into the program, but face the odds of an expert Roar Omega Roar who find their fun in ridiculing them for their inferiority. There definitely isn't a whole lot of emotionality like Pixar's other films, but that's okay! This film doesn't need it as it has the charm and clever hilarity to make up for it. The animation is pretty solid and the voice acting is fantastic.Monsters University is a pretty decent family movie and this is all thanks to the brilliant work of Pixar. Even if it doesn't live up to Disney-Pixar's usual fare, it is still a film that will make a good choice for children and adults of all ages.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
As good as the other one.,"A lot of people scoff at the tendency of Pixar at the time this was made to focus on things derivative of their previous works.I thought this was an enchanting return to a world of people are all kinds of shapes and species packed with neat visual gags and creatures stunningly imagined and realised with textures from feathered to glistening.The heart of the movie is a story of two individuals: one fighting to reach his dream against all odds and the other a legacy who's never had any reason to doubt their own potential. Circumstances compel them to overcome their initial dislike of each other and see eye to eye as they lead a band of losers to victory.The bulk of the plot may be trying to win that contest but it's a moving and well paced story that only touches with its depiction of long lasting friendship blossoming from a shaky start but also, rather than the usual ""follow your dreams"" spiel, they actual confront the idea that sometimes your best just isn't good enough and you have to deal with that.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"9/10 - A Genuinely Funny, Entertaining, and Original Pixar Classic","Monsters University brings everything you expect from a Pixar film: well written and lovable characters, a great sense of humor, and an original and well told story filled with great messages and morals. Where MU differs from the rest of the pack is that it brings these elements all together in such a way the proves to he irresistibly charming and incredibly funny, I couldn't help but have a smile on my face throughout the entirety of the film.With Monsters University, I can finally say that the Pixar drought is over!MU tells a prequel story, one that didn't seem necessary at first glance. I was excited, but hesitantly so. Regardless of the reception, I knew that I was going to see it. After 2 years without a Pixar film (would not see cars 2 or brave), I couldn't stand it any longer. After all, Monsters Inc. is my favorite Pixar film! Afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I need to say one thing: Monsters University is the funniest Pixar film to date. I was rolling in my seat with laughter at points, but unlike most Pixar humor it wasn't only the slapstick or the funny facial expressions that struck my funny bone, it was the way that Pixar nailed the college experience on the head. Fresh off the college train, it was equal parts amusing and wonderfully nostalgic to see Pixar's ""college movie"", which was pleasantly free of vulgar language or overt sexuality; it was simply a purely funny and charming world and story the whole way through.In some ways, MU had to have been the hardest film to make for Pixar. Since the genre relies so heavily on garbage humor, Pixar had to constantly think outside of the box to deliver both a funny and ingenious tale while avoiding everything that the genre has become known for in Hollywood, and Pixar brings its A game. Sure, a couple of jokes fall flat and are there purely for children's enjoyment, but just about every bit of humor is in here for people in college and beyond, and I applaud Monsters University for being so slyly mature and funny for an older audience.But it's just not the humor that rocks in MU, the story is true and heartfelt. Mike is going to school to learn how to become a scarer, where he meets a young, inexperienced, and egotistical Sully. It's an interesting dynamic that totally works, one that I honestly didn't see coming. The characters are all well written and have great development, neither rushed or forced.It's also relieving to see tons of brand new characters and how they develop Mike and Sully's relationship, all of whom are charming and unique. The story is filled with great messages for moviegoers of all ages, too. I also really felt for Mike and his striving towards academic success; his story resonated so much with me. My theater was cheering at points, and at others the tension was thick in the air. That's only happened in a select few other films, but not once in an animated film, which proves one thing: I wasn't the only one in love with these characters on the big screen! After an interesting and amusing series of events, Mike and Sully are forced to work together in the Scare Games to prove that they are more than just a pretty face.The third act takes an interesting and creative turn, one that was equal parts surprising and conclusive. Even if MU lacks that freight train pacing and a ""Boo"" character to keep tensions high and the plot moving progressively forward, I think having that same dynamic would've made MU too safe and too similar. And that is what I found the most delightful about MU's story: it was original. It didn't rely on Monsters Inc. for cannon; the story totally works on its own, which is the most commendable quality of MU. Prequels usually fall into the same formula and rely on its brand to sell. MU can stand alone an apart from INC, or right alongside of it, and that's my biggest compliment for MU.And once again Pixar Has utilized their beautiful RENDERMAN technology to bring the world of MU to life, with gorgeous CGI and believable characters. Presented in Sony Digital 4K, MU pops off the screen. The music by Randy Newman is quite fantastic; drum lines permeate an otherwise typical score, giving the music a unique feeling. I did miss the unique swing/jazz styles of INC, but it was good to see that some of the tunes from the original worked their way, respectively complementing the action on screen, as a nice little nod to the adventures to come within Monsters Inc.So, am I a Monsters fan? You bet. And the premise of a prequel? I was hesitant. Not any longer.Charming, hysterically funny, and most of all well told, well written and relatable, Monsters University could've been the most disappointing cash in of the summer. Thank Oozma Kappa it wasn't!Final Score: 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A prequel I didn't want, didn't need and didn't care for. I was pleasantly surprised.","MONSTERS UNIVERSITY - 2013Directed by Don ScanlonStarring Billy Crystal, John Goodman and Helen MirrenPlot Overview: ​Ever since he was a kid monster, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) has dreamed of becoming a Scarer. To make his dream a reality, he enrolls at Monsters University. During his first semester, he meets Sulley (John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. Sulley and Mike engage in a fierce rivalry that ultimately gets them both kicked out of MU's elite Scare Program. To make things right, Mike and Sulley -- along with a bunch of misfit monsters -- will have to learn to work together.Considering the greatness of 'Monsters Inc' and the the fine- mediocre track record of Pixar throughout 2011-2012, I had very low expectations for this movie. It should have been so much worse than it was. With that in mind, I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. It is pretty entertaining and I guess I would recommend it overall. It was cute filler content that was clearly made for money but I can't say it is objectively bad. The best way to summarise this movie is: It shouldn't but it does. Interpret that Chinese Proverb as you will but as a whole I cay say I recommend this movie.I like the idea of them being at a University and I love the concept of the Scare Games. The plot surrounding these two ideas, however, is pretty paper thin and it doesn't' condone the movie's existence. One thing I wish they didn't do was rush through some of The Scare Games' trials. I would have liked some more expanding of the various trials; particularly the one were they must hide because that looks really fun.I may be in the minority here, but I wish the final 20 minutes was cut. Or at least altered in some way. The last act for this movie isn't funny, emotional, creative - it is just a meaningless buildup that ultimately leads to an emotionless conclusion. Again, I am probably in the minority with this but I wont conform to the general masses' opinion if I do not share it.Both Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprise their roles as Mike and Sully respectively, and both of them do great jobs in their roles. I love the way they toy with the idea that their friendship wasn't always as close as it is and that they had to work through some issues before hand. And I definitely believe their entire friendship is 100% natural and none of it artificial or forced.Helen Mirren is a fantastic addition as Dean Hardscrabble. I personally see her as the villain(not Roar Omega Roar) and by treating her as such, she is a pretty good antagonist. She is cruel yet fair and just. She has genuine growth and it all feels genuine. She is a great example of what an animated villain can be like.​ Other new additions in the form of: Don Carlton(Joel Murray), Terry&Terry(Sean Hayes), Squishy(Peter Sohn) and Art(Charlie Day), were all good.I like how they setup Randall's character and how they depict his slow descent into villainy. The faction he is apart of(Roar Omega Roar) mostly consists of bland, forgettable characters and I don't remember any of their names. Very disappointing, to be honest. They are supposed to be part of the adversaries in this tournament.Technically speaking, this movie is excellent. I love the colour palette and actually just the animation in general. The look and feel of the movies falls perfectly in line with the tone at all points. I adore the character design, with Hardscrabble being my personal favourite monster design in the series. The university is very well made and designed. Members of Oozma Kappa all look unique and interesting and their design reflects their personality really well. The cinematography and editing were both fine.I laughed a few times in the movie; there are some genuinely good and clever jokes. Plus, there is no toilet humour(I think)! This is the evolution we need as a species and I am proud to be a part of the movement that changed cinema humour forever.There is ONE kinda emotional moment but it just feels tacked on and doesn't move me in any way.I like this film more than I dislike it, and I can definitely recommend it. It is some cute filler that will satisfy kids and adults alike. I'll rate this movie 6 'Cute Ma-Kappas' out of 10!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Not a classic, but it's pretty good","I can recognise Monster's University is far from a great Pixar film, and it's got nothing on Monster's Inc, of course. But after the train wreck that was Cars 2, and the sort of competent but uneven Brave, I think it looks good in comparison at least. At the end of the day, it's funnier and more entertaining than both of those previous films, in my opinion, but it doesn't hold a candle to the classic Pixar films of 1995-2010.As a prequel, it's pretty good. It finds just enough material to work with, in the lives of Mike and Sully before they join Monster's Inc, and the way their friendship develops is fun to watch. I also like how Mike is the main character here; he has a pretty good arc, all things considered (even if it's similar to Buzz Lightyear's arc in the first Toy Story, just not done as memorably).While most of the jokes are funny, there's also a number that don't land, and I'm a little mixed on the supporting characters, who all bleed together. Steve Buscemi's Randall is also in this, and while he's fun at the start of the movie, from the halfway point onwards, the movie seems to mostly forget about him. And the story as a whole is uneven, with a second act that's noticeably weaker than the first and third.Still, I do mostly like this Pixar movie, even if it's not particularly exciting. It's a fun watch, but it doesn't hit as hard as the studio's best... but like I said, after one mild disappointment in Brave, and one disaster with Cars 2, it feels like a very small step in the right direction.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A more than worthy prequel, Pixar's best since Toy Story 3","Monsters University as a prequel did have a fair bit to live up to, seeing as Monsters Inc is one of Pixar's best films. It is not as good as that film though, it doesn't quite have the same degrees of originality and heart(though there is still a fair bit of heart here, just that the final 10 minutes of Monsters Inc were among the most heartfelt moments of any Pixar film), but Monsters University is still more than worthy to it without being one of their best. And it is Pixar's best since Toy Story 3, Cars 2 and Brave were not as bad as often said on IMDb but compared to what Pixar had done before they fell short. As always with Pixar, the animation is amazing. The details, vibrant colours, eye-popping backgrounds and beautifully rendered characters are all here and done in a way that makes it true to the style of the original film. The uplifting and beautifully composed music score is also something to look out for, as are the witty screenplay, the interplay between Sulley and Mike is loose and recognisable and is often hilarious, the clever sight gags and affectionate nods to live action frat comedies. The humour comes by at a breakneck pace, but still gives you time to breathe at the same time. The story, while not as original as Monsters Inc, is still interesting and paced in a way that allows all the family to be entertained. It is also full of endless charm, perfectly pitched humour and great heartfelt morals that don't preach, telling a good story is one of Pixar's strongest points and it shows. The characters are still wonderful, it is easy to love Sulley and Mike still even in their younger versions, there are shades of Randall's character in the original coming through here and Dean Hardscrabble is a great addition, a literal monster's answer to Rebecca's Mrs Danvers. The lack of Boo doesn't hurt the film, despite fears that it would do. The voice acting is fantastic, John Goodman and Billy Crystal carry their lead roles splendidly and Helen Mirren is wonderfully stone-faced and menacing. Everybody gives their character a personality and one that stands out. To conclude, while not quite as good as Monsters Inc or one of Pixar's best it does compliment the original Monsters Inc really well and is a step-up from their previous two films. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Monster University"" Review","""Monsters University"" has a simple and quite predictable story, as we already know that Mike and Sully will end up as friends at the end. However, the journey is more important than the destination and along the way we tackle themes of defying expectation. While the story is predictable, the writers and directors manage to throw a little surprise here and there. From some interesting character moments to laugh out loud situations. It's sort of light on heart, but the film is engaging enough and the movie gets better as it progresses.The main characters, Mike and Sully, retain much of their charm in this prequel. Mike takes the lead in this recent outing. He's sweet, optimistic, and crazily dedicated. Sully is laid back, a slacker, and a bit insecure. However, it's great to see him develop into the master scarer he is in the original film. It's really fun to see how their relationship develops. Their constant bantering and butting of heads is fun to watch and the sweeter moments are endearing. There are some newer characters in the film as well and they add a lot of charm and humor to the film. My personal favorites are Art, a purple hairy monster with long legs, and Squishy, a awkwardly round monster, who gets some of the best laughs in the movie.Aside from story, Pixar's greatest strength is animation and this film has some of their best. The colors are vibrant and the hair effects are fluid. The one down side are the character designs. The main cast is fine, but some of the background characters just aren't unique and look similar to one another. Randy Newman's score is effective for the movie, but lacks a memorable spark. The score is just filled with generic college music, but it still weaves in some interesting emotional bits.Overall, ""Monsters University"" is a fun and enjoyable film. While it doesn't reach any emotional highs and the beginning is rocky, it has some really great laughs. The animation is top class even though some of the character designs are ""meh"" and the score is effective, but leaves more to be desired. It's a great way for Pixar to get back on track. I give it 3.5/5, great fun and an extremely enjoyable time.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters Univeristy,"Since 2011, you could say Pixar films have been a little down. Cars 2 was a poor sequel that struggled with it's story and did not the capture the heart of the original. Brave from 2012 has a solid following but you can find non-fans of it unlike most other pixar films. This would make you wonder what was left of such a powerful animation company especially when you had a prequel coming in 2013 to a very popular movie Monsters Inc.Monsters University, prequel to the 2001 movie Monsters Inc, and follows the characters of Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) during their university days where both of them have dreams of becoming scarier monsters. Their ultimate goal is to work for Monsters Inc. at a job involving scaring kids to provide energy for the city. At Monsters University, they play in some university scare game, interact with the popular monsters and groups at the school and learn how to be friends with each other.In a way, the film rehashes much of what we have seen before. The lead characters are the same and we know their in's and outs and the university games idea has been played out in other movies like Revenge of the Nerds. Of course, Mike Wazowski and Sulley are characters you can root for with one being a nerd and jock and its should be noted that the voice work solid with both of them all the way through. Mike and Sulley makes us look at what a friendship is all about and can happen regardless of people's different interests and background.The animation is solid, crisp and on par with previous Pixar films. The scares challenges and games are creative and full of adventures and provide an interesting atmosphere while bringing in new fraternity characters. Through it all, the whole university idea is new and original to the animation world and it really worked here.While this is not a ground-breaking movie nor Pixar's best, Monsters University is still quite solid. It is a sequel (but as mentioned earlier really a prequel) geared towards the whole family that has a big heart and really works.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
MY REVIEW: Good Monsters!!,"It's hard to review a pixar movie. The benchmark is set too high that you don't expect anything but the best. MU suffers from the same kind of expectations that pixar fans carry with them. No doubt, movie is nicely built college rivalry story with some funny moments, some heart rendering moments. But this is not enough for pixar fans. Movie has conventional treatment and very few funny moments in first half. Most of the fun is generated by how monsters carry themselves as if they are humans. Second half is much stronger with supporting characters providing lots of fun, movie not following the usual underdog's story pattern and lead characters getting enough screen time alone. At the end, you won't be able to say that it is The Incredibles or Up in the series of pixar movies but it is definitely Brave or Monsters Inc.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Funny and engaging,"This movie, about a look at the relationship between Mike Wazowski and James P. ""Sully"" Sullivan during their days at Monsters University, is a good prequel to Monsters, Inc. (2001)!Despite that the storyline is good, the story itself isn't that extraordinary. However, it's the small details that create a funny and engaging experience. It's obvious that the movie sometimes relies on shortcuts, but there's still a big amount of memorable scenes, especially the whole third act. The third act includes the whole package as an act because it goes through everything from failure to celebration to suspense to emotional distress. It's a perfect ending to the movie. Speaking of the humor, I think it's pretty clever because it appeals to diverse audiences. We get introduced to a lot of new characters, but most of them actually surprise with their funny personalities and appearances, which really makes the movie a worthy family experience.This movie serves as a charming prequel to Monsters, Inc., brimming with witty humor, memorable characters, and an exhilarating third act that brings everything to a satisfying end. While the storyline may not be the most original, it's the attention to detail and unforgettable scenes that make this movie a worthwhile family experience.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Maybe too much didactic (tv),"At least, it's not the dumb, silly violence of « cars 2 » which i have watched horrified with young nephews as it was about cars firing bullets ! This one is more peaceful, with cool characters and some really funny moments but it wasn't the extraordinary familial movie i expected ! First, like « harry potter and the goblet of fire », movies about contest are quickly boring because you have task 1, then task 2, then task 3,. It's very linear and not fit to twists Next, the movie is too much about an elitist education open to « fit » students : if you are not in the mold, you get out ! The problem is to define the mold and the movie is really depressive for that : are the bad students bad because of them or their teachers ! For sure, i didn't appreciate that this team of losers is too much caricatured (the old, the obese, the dingo) and that finally when you are cut from university, you become mop pushers ! So it's indeed a meritocracy and surely not a world when people are considered for what they are, able or not able ! In that context, Mike and Sulley and their fraternity speaks with other words but it's told so loudly, so many times that it lacks magic and fun ! Sure the animation is really well done, this monster universe is also original and wakes up the child inside us but at the end, the mix of friendship, university, tolerance, exams, self-confidence, norms, fun and competition wasn't really enjoyable for the adult I am now !",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
MU RULEZ sometimes,"Monsters University is a fairly made film. The story and college movie premise aren't the strongest use for it, but one thing this Movie understands is its characters. The prequel gives us a better understanding of Mike and Sulley's friendship that makes for a very entertaining repitoir between the two. (thanks to Goodman and Crystal) The film may not match up to the original but in character development it more than delivers.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
That's a brilliant old memory about Mike and Sulley,"I love Monsters, Inc. (2001). I think that's a great entertaining film where monsters supply energy from children's scream, and two funny and lovable monsters (Sulley and Mike) meet a two-year-old baby, Boo, and spend invaluable time with her while hiding her from villainous monsters who try to capture her. I liked the story and characters which not only children but adults can enjoy, so when I heard a news about Monster University coming out, I was wondering how the story goes. It's a little bit negative way, because the time will be backward when they are students. I assume that that would be just a university life that can be seen in other universities.I have to say, half of the story would not be far from your imagination; various kinds of monster students, delighted and dedicated students at the majestic monster university and terrifying teachers, study hard, parties, etc. That's kind of an image of university life. Yet, the visual effect is fantastic. You won't get bored seeing those scenes.If you watched Monsters, Inc., you remember that Mike, as an assistant of Sulley at Monsters, Inc., is a hard-working and marketing guy, and Sulley is a big and sport oriented guy. Two guys make a good team, achieving a revolution in the monster's world. You will see where their personality and their teamwork come from.One of the intriguing things in the story is that Sulley suffers setbacks as a monster even though his father is a magnificent monster and holds promise for the future, and Mike doesn't seem to be promised because he is small and not scary. The two opposite monsters happened to work together and struggling to achieve a goal. And Pixar isn't just producing a straightforward story; they trick you to turn out to be a brilliant ending.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Vidiot Reviews,"Monsters UniversityHigher education benefits all creatures so long as they don't major in Monster Anthropology, Monster Psychology or Monster Fine Arts.Luckily, neither creepy co-ed in this animated-comedy is studying the aforementioned.At M.U. for a degree in scaring children to supply energy to their world, one-eyed teenage monster Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) isn't as well received at school as his fellow scarer Sulley (John Goodman).To prove his frightfulness, Mike joins a rag-tag fraternity (Charlie Day, Joel Murray, Dave Foley, Sean Hayes) and competes in the Scare Games alongside Sulley.But their doubt in each other threatens to cost them the event - and their education.The prequel to Monsters Inc., Monster University reunites the monsters but doesn't give them much to work with in the way of narrative, substance or laughs.What's worse, these monsters will have to carry around their student loan debt until angry villagers behead them.

"Not bad, kid","The college days of Mike Wazowski and James Sullivan.This is an enjoyable prequel with plenty of fun moments to enjoy.Mike and Sully's younger days are explored to humorous effect in a decent story that slightly reboots their characterisations, but not in a bad way. Plenty of college movie tropes are in order along with funny dialogue and sight gags.As to be expected with Pixar, the animation is phenomenally good. It is not just the character designs, textures and movement, but the different shades of light and use of distorted reflections that are particularly good. Everything is edited nicely with a great musical score.Billy Crystal and John Goodman lead the voice cast perfectly with strong support from Helen Mirren and numerous others.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable film Providing Context for the Characters.,"Obviously Monsters Inc is much better than this film, but honestly a lot of the high points of this film really succeed at giving further development to these characters we already know and love. Specifically Mike's character arc is very interesting as it shows how sometimes people must compromise their wants to achieve their physical potential. It's a tough lesson for Mike to learn since we know just how much Mike wants to be a scarer, but it feels much more candid and complete then just saying ""yes everyone's dreams can come true""
The middle half of this movie is the part I like the least. It quickly turns into one of those sports films focusing on the underdog team that obviously needs to win because there is a movie being made about it. In fact it seems quite out of place in this monster world they have created.
Overall Monsters University is a great film with a powerful message, even if it doesn't hit quite where it's predecessor did.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

how to scare (or fail) 101,"A minor film from Pixar, but all the same massive fun, lots of creative monsters and exacting detailed animation, and on a more concrete level it actually does something I have never seen in a Pixar movie, almost as if they were smuggling this in under the radar in one of their franchise efforts: for the first time we have a story without a very clear antagonist.Yes there is the d***ish jock (voiced aptly by none other than Nathan Filion) and the serpentine dean (Helen Mirren, nuff said), but really there is no 'big bad' here, no Sid or super computer or bear that smells like strawberries. The enemy here in as least pretentious a way it can be put is failure. both the main characters Mike and Sully have to face this their own ways, with Mike facing the potential failure of just not being scary, and Sully as not living up to the Sullivan name (hes a bit of a legacy you see).The heart of this movie is in part in the usual way of Pixar taking a formula or just straight up another movie (Toy story 3 was a prison break out flick, bugs life seven samurai, this time its revenge of the nerds and back to school) and how the underdogs get inspired against all odds. But the other chunk of heart and where it struck a chord with me was that its about what happens when you go to college: you're faced with great possibilities and even greater challenges, based on what you put up for yourself, and it will make you (un?) prepared for the rest of your life.Some stretches of the film I wasn't sure what would happen next just due to what one characters morality would effect on another. Yes, monsters university is silly kids stuff, maybe more-so for kids than anything aside from the cars series (not to say this film doesn't have some sophisticated jokes amid the 'aw mom!' stuff with one of the frat members at O.K., you just have to listen close). And its only a little better in terms of some parts of its story than Monsters inc. At the same it also does another incredible feat I only realize now typing this: this is one of the rare prequels you can see without necessarily the original.The filmmakers set up this world from the get go, what getting a scare means (or in the real world, what you are good at.. or not) and taking it from there. hell, just writing this out I like the movie more. It's not great, but within its dimensions it sets out winningly what it wants to do, which is more than can be said for other films this summer. Its vibrant, colorful, and has something to say and, again, without the basic black-and-white good and bad guys aside from genre conventions. 8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Highly recommended,"This is nothing short of Monster Inc.; I love it through and through. Yes, the story is not fresh like the first movie but it is still great with a very good connection between the two.

There are quite a lot of funny scene and a lot of cute characters too.I love the creativity and how they connect the two movies. Plus with so many characters you will enjoy it even more (somehow they managed to give perfect screen time to each character).So that is it.

The Perfect Prequel,"Monsters University is almost as good as monsters Inc which is pretty high praise considering the former is one of the best all-around Pixar movies and honestly one of the best animated films in general.Monsters Inc has special place in my heart and I can confidently say it's not just nostalgia. Revisiting the film years later I have even more of an appreciation of the plot, voice acting, humor, an animation that they pulled off in this entirely original movie.That being said, it would be very easy for a prequal movie to not live up to its predecessor, but against all odds this movie pulls it off. MU is creative, funny, heart warming, and just overall brilliant. It's everything that you would want in a monsters prequel. It opens up the lore of the monster world while not resting on lazy tropes at an attempt at a cash grab like most sequels these days. This movie does what all prequels should do and gives you even more of an appreciation for the original while adding its own unique flair.

"Solidly enjoyable, with nice touches of heart, humor, and cleverness","I won't lie: for all the substantial, far-ranging criticism that can easily be leveled against Disney, at their best they remain a titan of animated storytelling, and there's something so enchanting and disarming about that studio logo sequence that opens all their films. Pixar, too, has had their ups and downs, but there's no denying how stellar the company is at their best. Just look at 'Monsters, Inc.,' a modern classic if ever there were one - creative character designs, imaginative yet meaningful storytelling, delightful humor and top-notch animation, not to mention great music and voice acting. Be that as it may, one common area in which both Disney and Pixar have faced issues is with creating sequels to their original works, and it's surely only reasonable to approach this 2013 picture with a measure of skepticism and tempered expectations.Thankfully, even when Disney or Pixar stumble, it's hard for them to completely go wrong. 'Monsters University' is, unsurprisingly, built on fanciful, creature-based plays on tropes of universities, ""Greek"" organizations, social life, and competition and rivalry while providing backstory for how familiar characters from the preceding movie met. Maybe this means the feature is doomed to be more ordinary while desperately reaching for that in-universe ""world-building"" that has become such a fad in much of modern cinema. No matter how jaded or cynical one may be, however, the prequel remains full of most all the same qualities that made its predecessor so terrific. The character designs continue to be superb, and there are earnest themes of working together, and discovering self-confidence and one's strengths, mixed in amidst a panoply of jokes and gags that really do earn laughs. The animation is reliably solid, the music is a capable complement, and the voice cast is just plain excellent. I don't think this flick is as inspired or inspiring as the first, but some real wit and hard work went into it all the same, and it shows.More than anything else, I'm so pleased with how clever Dan Gerson, Robert L. Baird, and filmmaker Dan Scanlon were in so many details here. From the challenges that the Greek houses face, to the particulars of how characters move and how they find themselves to be most capable, to other minutiae throughout, it's the little things that help this to stand taller than it otherwise might. On the other hand, there does also come a point where the writing is notably less sure-footed. In the last twenty minutes or so we watch Mike and Sully grow closer in a substantial moment, and put all their resources to the test in an unprecedented burst of daring-do, but this comes amidst a sequence that to me feels heavy-handed and out of character with the rest of the story. It's still clever, but it's just not the same, as if the writers were struggling to drum up something significant enough to fill the third act and determine the characters' direction.Still, maybe I'm nitpicking. At the end of the day 'Monsters University' gives us what we want, and it's firmly entertaining. It may not be as wholly stellar as some of Disney or Pixar's other projects, but it also doesn't need to be - it's certainly enough just as it is. In my book this isn't something one needs to go out of their way to see, but if you're looking for something good to watch, and at that something fairly light, these 100-odd minutes are well worth checking out.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A neat one from Pixar.,"I haven't seen the original Monsters Inc. movie when I saw Monsters University, which is a prequel to the events of Monsters Inc. This was perfect as I could follow the events in both movies chronologically.Here, monsters Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan meet in the university and become mismatched creatures that couldn't stand each other at first. Trying to work together in an university competition to see which group is deemed the scariest, this movie leads to Mike and James trying to overcome their differences and become the best team-players friends.This movie gives you a taste of college life, filled with classrooms, frat parties, bookworms and stern professors (most notable, Dean Hardscrabble, voiced by Helen Mirren). Filled with humor, adventures and funny characters, this is one of Disney's better animated films in the later years. The animation was great and I enjoyed watching the steps in how Mike, James and their group of nerdy friends try to overcome their underdog dances to beat the more popular college monsters in the competition.Overall, the story was pretty intriguing, not over-the-top or childish, just perfect for all audiences.Grade B",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bravo,"Many of the Disney efforts of the past several years have been hampered by too much filler in the story line, they have at best an 80 minute tale but they stretch it 110 instead (Nemo being a good example). This has a much tighter plot, largely focusing on the college experience of Mike and Sully. This has all been done before in one fashion or another but the story moves along pleasantly enough to a fair conclusion. Billy Crystal and John Goodman fill their roles as well as in the original and in fact this is a better story than the first one, the exception rather than the rule for sequels.

Great prequel but more for adults,"When I heard that a prequel to Monsters -one of my favorite animation movies ever- was coming to the screens, I frowned. I thought it was a matter of milking the cow for commercial purposes. I was wrong.Monsters University is a great prequel and a great animated movie. The script develops the characters in ways that make sense if you have watched the first movie, as one comes to understand why these characters become best pals despite being so different. If you haven't watched the first movie, this movie is still good on its own.I really like this movie, almost as much as the first, but for different reasons. Monsters Inc was very emotive, tender, very charming, very magical, unique, and as much for kids as for adults. Monsters University is obviously an expansion on the first, and reminds me of traditional American sophomore naughty movies (minus the sex) and the Revenge of the Nerds, films that I usually enjoy and find funny; so it is more for adults and less for children. If you don't like sophomore movies, well, MU might disappoint you.Overall, the film is very funny and entertaining, and the animation is wonderfully creative, with a great use of color and textures, great backgrounds, and lovely well-developed characters.The dubbing is great. Crystal, Goodman Buccemi, Mirren and the rest of the cast infuse their characters with life and one forgets that they are the ones speaking, something that not always happen in animation when well-known actors do the voicing and they aren't there, in the soul of the character.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of PIXAR's best,"Monsters University is where creatures go when they want to be instructed on the fine art of scaring the bejesus out of unsuspecting tykes lying all snug in their beds at night. Yet, while many aspire to such a career, few are called. And no one wants to learn to be a first-class scarer more than little Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal), a short, green, one-eyed, retainer-wearing, utterly nondescript blob-with-limbs who frankly couldn't scare a bed sheet on Halloween. And it doesn't help that his greatest competition in the school's annual scare-off is a hulking furry brute by the name of Sulley (John Goodman) who comes from a long line of scarers. But in the great opposites-attract tradition, Mike and Sulley soon learn that they can achieve more by working together than working apart. This is particularly the case after they join a fraternity made up of other wanna-be scarers who are determined to win the contest against a half-a-dozen other teams of more reliably frightening monsters.""Monsters University"" may not be as emotionally resonant or cerebral as some previous PIXAR productions, but this prequel to the 2001 mega-hit ""Monsters, Inc.,"" is one of the most purely enjoyable films ever to come out of that studio - and that is saying a great deal indeed. It has terrific fun parodying the rituals of college life - fraternities, cliques, the high-pressured stress of exams - yet still manages to relate to the younger set's concerns with the need to be accepted by the ""in"" crowd while at the same time finding the inner strength to remain an individual and to stand up for oneself and all the other misfits in society (think of this as a monster-sized riff on ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"").As this is a PIXAR release, it's practically superfluous to praise the wit and ingenuity of the script (by Daniel Gerson, Robert L. Baird and director Dan Scanlon), the beauty of the animation with its gorgeous collegiate-Gothic backgrounds, and the spot-on voice-over work that have long been the hallmarks of that studio's output. The all-star cast includes, in addition to Crystal and Goodman, Steve Buscemi, Sean Hayes, Helen Mirren, Aubrey Plaza, John Kraskinski, Bonnie Hunt, Bill Hader, and a whole lot more.So sit back, relax and enjoy the delicious treat that is ""Monsters University."" But don't forget to pull the covers up at night.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar shines once again!,"Pixar, you did it again! Like many other Pixar movies, this one was a charm to watch and it achieved to deliver some good laughs and some surprisingly heartwarming moments. But let's say that it isn't perfect. It had some very clever and funny jokes but some just felt kinda dumb and meaningless like the majority of the animated movies that have come out in these past years. Also the movie's second act felt a little empty. But at the beginning of MU I was laughing at many clever things that I notices and I was surprised at an unexpected turn that the prologue took. Speaking of surprises, the third act of this movie was my favorite part of it and maybe one of my favorite ""final part"" of any Pixar movie. It was clever, surprising and emotionally charged! Also one little thing that I want to highlight is the university man! They did an awesome job building it and creating the ambient of it. Especially at one scene at night I am gonna say, I felt in Disney Land. It was colorful and living. So in the end this movie was what I expect a good Pixar movie to be and I hope they keep in this direction and not stray into another (I'm talking to you Cars 2).",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mike is very cute,"Monsters University is a 2013 American 3D computer-animated comedy film produced by Pixar Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures.It was directed by Dan Scanlon and produced by Kori Rae, with John Lasseter, Pete Docter, Andrew Stanton and Lee Unkrich as executive producers. It is the fourteenth feature film produced by Pixar and is a prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc., marking the first time Pixar has made a prequel film.Disney, as the rights holder, had plans for a sequel to Monsters, Inc. since 2005. Following disagreements with Pixar, Disney tasked its Circle 7 Animation unit to make the film. An early draft of the film was developed; however, Disney's purchase of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7's version of the film. A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010,and in 2011, it was confirmed that the film would instead be a prequel titled Monsters University.Monsters University tells the story of two monsters, Mike and Sulley, and their time studying at college, where they start off as rivals, but slowly become best friends. I love Mike that was a child because he was so cute and innocent. However I also love Mike that is an adult. I understand how Sulley and Mike become best friends when I watch the film. I want you to watch Monsters Inc. and Mnstrs University.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Pixar's most underrated?,"Apart from Cars and Cars 2 I have seen every Pixar film and I love them. Pixar is one of those rare studios that produce consistently brilliant work that rank up against some of cinemas finest. Pixar manage to craft a film that can appeal to grown ups as much (or even more so) than its intended child audience. What I find annoying is that people keep banging on about a dip in quality from Pixar, and whilst I admit that their last effort, Brave was there worst as it took a direction away from the adult audience, and tried to appeal more to children, however it was still undeniably beautiful to look at and by no means a bad film. Also, let's remember that two of Pixar's absolute best films (Up and Toy Story 3) only came out less than five years ago! So people worrying about a dip in quality really shouldn't worry. Besides Monsters University still ranks up there with the best of them.I have no idea where these complaints for Monsters University are coming from. I know the reception hasn't been that bad, but the critics haven't been madly praising it like they do with other Pixar classics, which it deserves to be. When I was a child Monsters Inc. was my absolute favourite film. To this day I sleep in a Monsters Inc. duvet and I am now eighteen years old and totally unashamed. Monsters Inc. is one of Pixar's most creative and funniest films and to have a prequel to allow you to enter back into that hilarious and colourful world is an offer only those with the coldest hearts could refuse. The film is Pixar through and through right from the adorable opening which focuses on toddler and loner Mike dreaming of being a scarer, despite his cute looks. It's a sad, funny, engaging and cute opening which had me assured that this was going to be no flop.Almost every single shot of Monsters University is filled to the brim with colour, life and creativity. If you look in the background you'll see something different going on. The visuals are spectacular, making this a must buy on Blu-ray. As always with Pixar there is a lot of creativity going on. Pixar recognises that there are endless opportunities for animation and they use this to the absolute best that they can. There are breath taking moments such as the hazardous (and hilarious) tunnel race where monsters must run in a pitch black tunnel only lighted by glowing balls of sting. Another visual highlight, which I won't spoil, features a terrifying librarian which I found incredibly creative, funny and also very tense. The animation is as top notch as ever.What makes Monsters University the perfect prequel is that it doesn't rely on characters and ideas created from Monsters Inc. Don't get me wrong there are plenty of nods and references but not enough to detract from Monsters University. It works perfectly well as a stand alone film and a companion to the original masterpiece. Monsters University introduces a brilliant array of new and very likable characters. I was loving the film in the beginning where Mike was out of his depth in the scare academy and Sully was starting to become a rival. However, I started to enjoy things even more when Mike puts his scare team, Oozma Kappa, together. Here we meet a brilliant batch of new characters who will stay with you long after the credits roll. All of them are brilliantly funny in their own way and everyone's favourite will be different, although personally I enjoyed the mature octopus-like student.Some people moan about the thin plot, but the plot really didn't bother me. Monsters University relies more on its characters who are all strong and carry the film perfectly. Admittedly the narrative is simple, yet it's engaging and had me cheering the team on! I really didn't want Monsters University to end, and when I thought things were wrapping up, it carried on for another 15 minutes which I loved! The finale is very endearing and heart-warming. It's everything you could expect from a Pixar film. It's also hugely exciting and has you thinking ""How the heck are they gonna get out of this!?"" I also enjoyed Helen Mirren's hard-nosed Dean Hardscrabble who coldly runs the Scare Academy after beating the all-time scare record (beaten by Sully in the near future of course.) And of course Mike and Sully are as likable as ever. It's fascinating for a Monsters Inc. fan to watch two characters gradually beginning to really like each other. It also has a great moral message to kids about team work and friendship without being patronising.However, I think (like most of Pixar's productions) that Monsters University will be wasted on children. It can very much be enjoyed by adults, it's certainly no chore to sit through. Monsters University is hugely entertaining and may even leave you wanting more. all certainly be buying it on Blu-ray when it's released, whilst critics can ponder until they finally find the hilarity and genius in it. Whilst it isn't quite as good as Monsters Inc. it really isn't far off and is certainly no decline in Pixar's quality.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Great,"I never expect a lot of sequels, especially seeing I'm not a child like I was when the original was released, but this film really did over- perform in my books.The new characters they brought in were just as lovable as the old characters and this made the new story fresh and still interesting for the viewers.The variation of humour was great too from some slapstick that people from all ages could enjoy to some more serious humour that could have been lost on the kids but would impress adults with their kids and people watching the film for nostalgia purposes like myself.Lastly, I have so many compliments for the plot-line to write here, it was great for a kids film. There was real depth and twists where you did not expect them, fantastic. One of the best animated films I've seen. Must see for anyone who liked the first film or has kids.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Generic high school underdog plot,It's nice to return to the 'Monsters Inc' universe where we get some depth and backstory to the great original characters Mike and Sully. There is an interest dynamic change involving Randall and it is a fun movie for the most part with the OK campus being loveable underdogs.But that is also one of the issues. When you look at the plot it is basically a generic high school underdog story with a Monsters Inc character wrapping. It makes you appreciate how original the first film was.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great - but not as great as Monsters Inc.,"I really enjoyed this film - but - there were a few moments where it seemed like over egging a pudding - or even scraping the barrel - almost. Monsters Inc. is my favourite pixar film - like Miyazaki - there isn't a moment where you're thinking about something else - or whats going to happen.A prequel is a sequel so its never going to be as good as the original, but its still great.Get Monsters Inc in the wide screen version as well, even though all of the UK DVD's are 4:3. You can get it.Always stay till the the end of the credits with Pixar - and mostly with Disney too.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Monsters University"": A Refreshing Prequel From Pixar","Everyone's favorite monsters from ""Monsters Inc.,"" plus a few more, are back in ""Monsters University."" This time, instead of telling the story of what happened next, they've created a prequel to show us how the monsters first became friends and give us more insight into the characters. Mike, Sulley and the gang bring a ton of laughs to the screen as they learn how to become ""scarers"" and become best buddies in the process. KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Jailene A., age 13 especially loves the animation in this film, ""every character has its own personality and special features, as none of the monsters look exactly the same."" She was excited to see an advance screening of ""Monsters University"" and shares her thoughts below.""I just watched ""Monsters University"" and it is an amazing prequel to Disney Pixar's classic ""Monster Inc."" ""Monsters University"" is the back- story of how Sully and Mike Wazowski became the best friends they were in ""Monsters Inc."" It all starts in college, from day one Mike has been a perfect student ever since he decided he wanted to be a top scarer when he grows up. That is his dream and he works hard to accomplish it. Sully, on the other hand thinks everything is going to be handed to him because he's a Sullivan and his father is the ultimate top scarer. Everything changes when both of them get kicked out of the scare program. This is when Mike and Sully must work together to prove they can be worthy of scaring. There's a surprise plot twist at the end that you'd have to watch to see what happens.I like the concept of ""Monsters University"" just as the original ""Monsters Inc."" touched the hearts of many in 2001. However, no one really knew how they became best friends in the beginning. This is what makes the concept of this movie so interesting because of the fact that normally you would see the movie of how they met first and then see them continue their life in a sequel. I also like the animation in this movie. Every character has its own personality and special features, as none of the monsters look exactly the same. Some have tentacles, some have more than two eyes and some monsters are scarier than others, but everyone has something in common: they all want to be a scarer.All the characters are very amazing but my favorite character is Mike Wazowski. When Mike was little, everyone always made fun of him for being too small and no one thought he would accomplish anything in life. He works hard to get into Monsters University because he is determined to succeed and in the end, he may not get what he wants but he is still happy, and that's what is important.My favorite scene is when Mike and Sully are in the first round of the scare games and they have to race through a dark tunnel with spiky balls on the floor that make you blow up like a marshmallow. Both of them come out of the race with a puffy lip and swollen legs because they touched the spiky balls and they could barely talk. It made me laugh a lot.I recommend ""Monsters University"" for ages 6-14. It is an amazing family movie and kids will love it. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars so go check it out.""Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Jailene Aries, age 12. For more reviews go to kidsfirst.org.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the greatest movies I've ever watched,"This is definitely one of my favourite movies, with its catchy plot and extremely deep characters that can entertain anyone.We all know that the prequel was extremely successful and highly rated, so I was obviously hoping for a dignifying sequel, but more than that, I was afraid. Monsters Inc was my childhood along with Bug Life, and with this wave of making a second or third movie that is only successful because of the first one, I feared Monsters University might ruin all that Mike and Sully meant for me, because maybe it would be just a commercial film. I am so glad to have been surprised.While the idea of a movie being set in a university is no big news, the fact that these are monsters and their differences go far beyond personality makes it a whole new story. Yet, more than that, the movie shows how one's personality can affect their appearance or vice-versa. Obviously, there are the bullies and the bullied, but instead of merely portraying a reality, it brings a message: don't change to be successful or to be accepted, your uniqueness is what will lead you to happiness. Embrace what you have in you that makes you different and turn it into your strength.I admit to not remembering Monsters Inc. in detail, for I haven't watched it in a long, long time, but I still had notions of what their futures would be, so their past... Well, it was simply deduction, right? No.Characters who hated each other in the first movie were, at the beginning of Monsters University, portrayed as, if not friends, in amicable terms, but also mutatis mutandis. So we would obviously expect some big deed from them that would completely change the other's opinion, but it's not in that direct attack fashion that relationships flow. The feelings each character develops for the other is subtly incited, something I don't remember noticing in many productions; relations go smoothly and accompany each character's development.Talking about development, it is great to see that Monsters University also shows how two completely different past realities can converge in the same present or future one, because coming from success doesn't mean you'll succeed and having all the odds against you doesn't mean you will fail, it only depends on your capacity of adaptation; it makes us see beyond mere titles and believe we can overcome expectations when we least expect it. But I'm not going much more into this, otherwise I will fail in avoiding spoilers.However, what I liked best is the lack of predictability in crucial moments. While there are some typical moves such as ""rejecting the popular boys because they rejected you"", at some points the movie made you believe that it would follow a course of action that would be the only logical one considering its prequel, but then it gave you a completely different solution. (This refers mainly to the end, which was such a plot twist even though the fact that Monsters Inc had already established some facts gave it so little space to surprise the watchers.)Monsters University made me laugh and brought tears to my eyes, it made me angry and hopeful, but more than anything, it reminded me of the little tips on how to be happy that we so often forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Impression,"""Realistic"" is the last word that comes to mind when monsters are involved. Nevertheless, Monsters University does a superb job of addressing real-life conflicts by projecting them into a fantasy world. This form of information distribution is effective because at the same time that the audience is being entertained by escaping into imagination, they are also relating to the characters that face similar problems. In Monsters University, we have Mike, the underdog, who, despite his determination, can never seem to achieve his dreams. He is constantly being rejected from society, regardless of his intense efforts and countless hours of hard work. Many people share Mike's frustration with not fitting in and never being good enough, or in this case, ""scary"" enough. On the other hand, we have Sully, who appears to have everything in the palm of his furry paw. Sully is loved by all and can be terrifying without breaking a single sweat. However, he is under constant pressure of living up to his family name and puts up a tough facade due to his true feelings of confusion and helplessness. Even those who lead ""perfect"" lives face their own obstacles. Once Mike and Sully survived the human world and broke the all-time scream record, I expected the dean to let them back into the school. They had finally proved to her that they were the smartest, bravest, and scariest monsters, but they were still expelled. All of their friends got accepted, but they were still expelled. The dean told them they impressed her and wished them luck, but they were still expelled. How could acting with good intentions lead to failing miserably? I kept on thinking, if I were the director, I would most definitely put them back in school. After all, this is a Disney movie. Where is the happy ending? It was stated earlier that Monsters University is a realistic movie. It is realistic in the sense that bad things happen to good people. You cannot always win. The director chose to have the characters expelled, which caused them to figure out new solutions and move on. There is no easy path in life but if you make the most of what you have and strive for excellence, success is just around the corner.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar shines again in the end.,"Monsters University builds on the world first introduced to us in Monsters Inc. and brings to us the story of how Mike and Sully first met. Nice to see you again guys.I was a little bit unsure about how good this movie would be like as one of the reasons I love Pixar is their ability to create original stories. Sequels or prequels kind of feel like they are trying to squeeze the most out of a known lucrative fountain, even if they don't have the story to justify it. The completely forgettable Cars 2 is an example of it. But as I also felt that way about Toy Story 3 before seeing it and I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE WRONG in my life.And so we have this movie. I have to say, it was very fun seeing young Mike and Sully. The production and attention to detail in a Pixar movie is staggering, specially in the way they create their worlds. We see them as teenagers. We feel they are actually in a college and how they deal with their problems.My only problem with the script is that it feels a bit cliché. The college underdogs, the problems with the dean, and everything else felt like we had seen it before. True, it was well done, but apart from the fact that they are monsters, it is not different from what we had already seen in other movies. We even have a bit of a back story for Randy that feels unnecessary. When the shenanigans wrap up, I thought that would be the end of the movie. Had it ended there it would still be an enjoyable animation movie, albeit a generic and forgettable one, not in par with what Pixar can do.But it goes on. The last scenes, right up to the climax, are the best part. We can finally see what this movie is about and the magic of Pixar storytelling. The final act has a maturity, a bittersweet taste that is characteristic of Pixar stories that show the world can be a harsh place, but you shouldn't give up.Not when you have friends like Mike and Sully.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

On par with level 2 movies of Pixar,"Pixar has made some very well regarded animation films that will surely stand the test of time as some of the best animated stories of all time. In level 1 of these movies, and the ones I consider classics we find Toy Story (1995), Toy Story 2 (1999), Monsters Inc. (2001), Finding Nemo (2003), The Incredibles (2004), Wall-E (2008), Up! (2009) and Toy Story 3 (2010). This prequel to one of the movies above is on par with level 2 of Pixar movies with movies like Cars (2006) and Ratatouille (2007). They don't necessarily disappoint, but they lack the powerful brilliance of the other films.So the plot centers around young college freshmen and bitter enemies at first, Mike Wazowski (Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (Goodman), as they attempt to get their scaring majors at Monsters University. For little monster Mike, things are very tough to achieve and his main challenge in the movie is to work against adversity and prove to the whole school that he is scary. As for Sullivan, he seems to have it all easy and is very much admired by his fellow classmates due to his family's good name. But with the pressures of living up to the high standards he is expected to meet, he will have to find the strenght within him and believe in himself. Both these characters look to show this at the annual Scare Games, with the haunting Dean Hardscrabble watching their every move.Like I said, the unique feeling of the first one is missing. While in Monsters Inc. Boo churned most of the heart, in this one the scenes involving Mike and Sullivan's vulnerability just don't match up, despite being great on their own. The laughter is as good, if slightly different from the previous movie. In the end, I think this movie is yet another delightful movie from the studio that has become the hit maker of Hollywood. Out of the two movies I prefer to watch MI, but don't pass out on this one either. It's a real treat.Rating: 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great origins story,"This is the origins story of Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan whom we got to know in the 2001 movie. And it's a great origins story. Mike and Sulley start out as enemies. Mike has never been scary, but his goal hasn't changed since when he was a kid. He's 'Rudy'. He's the little guy with heart and drive. Then we have Sulley who's been living off on his family's reputation and his natural abilities. When they accidentally destroy Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren)'s container, they are failed out of the Scare Program. They end up working together to get back in.The story is pulled from all those college movies like 'Revenge of the Nerds'. The big thing this movie has is heart. More than the first movie, we grow to love these guys and we see how they grow to love each other. This is even better than the original.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good PIXAR film I've seen in a while.,"After 2010's Toy Story 3, I felt that PIXAR wasn't meeting its expectations for their fans with movies that both have a good story, and capture the attention of its audience. Cars 2 was mediocre, and Brave didn't feel as special as Up or even A Bug's Life. But with Monsters University I had this deep personal connection and sentimental feeling with it. I was 6 years old when Monsters Inc. came out and now as a recent High School graduate going on to college this Fall I couldn't feel more connected to as how fast my life has go so far.Now with the story we find a very young Mike Wazowski going off to college after being inspired as a young kid during a field trip by a scarer of Monsters Inc. After his experience he is determined to become a great scarer despite of peer pressure by those who think he doesn't have a chance. Upon arriving he meets Randall Boggs (before being evil) and they become friends. Later during his first class he first encounters Sulley who appears as a lazy, and slacker type who only bases his purpose of being there on sentiment as his own father was a famous scarer. He only thinks that he can get by, just roaring, but scaring is much more complex than just roaring according to the movie. While not going into great detail this leads to a bitter rivalry. But eventually they would become best friends.Overall it may not be the best PIXAR film, but a better one by far (in my opinion). The characters are funny to laugh at and there are some moments that leave you at the edge of seat. Also this film is about learning to accept fear and failure, while remaining hopeful about change and growth through our different skills.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not as Good as the Original,"In Monsters University, you would think since its at college that Mike and Sully would have more high pitched voices but they had deeper voices because its 10 years after the original which really threw me off and I don't get why they would go to college for scaring. It's very stupid and that's why I gave it 5 stars.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A stand alone prequel, and a fun family treat!""","Monster's Inc. still remains in my heart as one of Disney/Pixar's most lovable creations. The story is both heart-warming and hilarious, and Mike Wazowski and James P. Sullivan, or ""Sully"", are charming character's that most definitely share a special place in our hearts and memories of childhood.As such, when I heard that there was a sequel in the works I will admit that a lot of red flags jumped up in my brain! Disney/Pixar has made some very good sequels in the Toy Story franchise, but it's not their specialty by any means. The majority of their success as a company is built around the fact that their stories are animated beautifully, their plots are almost always seamless and original, and the worlds and characters they create are original and invite us to share an experience with them. But, when the magic is over, it's over...and we're satisfied because the story was complete. Ratatouille, Wall-E, and UP are such examples of their more recent film-making successes that follow this tactic. A sequel may not be entirely bad, and could enhance the story and expand the universe, but they aren't necessary to satisfy an audience. Sequels are only good if they have a genuinely new story to tell that enhances the already established universe, and takes the characters in an entirely new direction. Thus far, only the Toy Story franchise has been successful at achieving this. ""Cars 2"" on the other hand did not, and the upcoming Disney spin-off ""Planes"" at the moment may follow in the same fashion.But onward to the film itself. When I first saw the trailers for Monster's University, again, red flags went soaring! ""This is a prequel?"" ""They're in college?"" The main question I'm sure that was on many people's minds was ""Is this a good idea?"", specifically because of how the original Monster's Inc. ended. Everything was wrapped up for the most part, and there was a beautiful, heartwarming ""little mystery"" of the continued relationship between Sully & Boo that made a satisfying ending although it was not resolved. In all honesty, I think the typical American audience would be more interested in a sequel about what happened AFTER the events of the first film than what came before it! This further perpetuated my worries that this was going to be at best an average ""lackluster prequel"" that focused on the very generic, and way overdone, ""life of a freshman at college"" plot that just happened to include the lovable and memorable characters from Monster's Inc.But thankfully, Monster's University has restored my faith in Disney/Pixar's creativity, and my pre-judgments have proved folly. This is a fun and exciting prequel that took me completely by surprise! While it may not have the snuggly and cutesy ""Boo & Sully"" charm that the first film did, this film has it's own unique charm to it and it conveys a different, but equally powerful moral message about friendship and dedication that will keep you entertained and heart-warmed throughout. Perhaps their biggest accomplishment is the fact that one could genuinely begin watching this movie without ever seeing Monster's Inc, and still be entertained and enlightened.While I'll admit the story does have a couple tiny inconsistencies that don't entirely match up with the original film, it's still a great viewing from beginning to end, and I'm especially proud that Disney/Pixar refrained from using ""cheesy gimmicks"" more than they needed to to tell the story. Like the Disney/Pixar classics of old, everything is well thought out from beginning to end and all of the conflict is resolved seamlessly and satisfyingly!The quality of animation between the two films has also improved tremendously! Sully's fur and many other hairy characters in the film are even more lifelike than ever before, and some background, clothing, and prop textures throughout are very impressive. I swore that the Monster's University hat that Wazowski receives in the first few minutes of the film was real!Be sure to take your entire family to this brand new chapter in the lives of the monster's of the Monster's Inc. franchise. Disney/Pixar has created another fantastic story that further showcases their capabilities as animators and storytellers. What fears and red flags I may have had for another recently announced sequel of theirs: ""Finding Dory"", have been currently alleviated after seeing the level of dedication they put into making this a truly good prequel to an already great story. It just goes to show that sequels can be fantastic when they are done right, and Monster's University is living proof of that!Two thumbs way up, and 4 solid stars!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Monsters University contains enough Pixar spark to turn the unoriginal story into a fun adventure,"Let's be honest, Pixar has been in an obvious slump recently with Cars 2 and Brave. Sure Brave won an Oscar, but did it really win over your heart? Brave doesn't have the traits of being brave at all, with its typical characters, safe story, and weak title. And Cars 2 is, well, a disappointing sequel to a mediocre franchise. (John Lasseter may have made Pixar, but he is definitely not the best director that they have.) Monsters University continues with Pixar's recent safe route of storytelling. However, the film shows a glimmer of hope for the company. This prequel may not be what people expected, but it is thoroughly entertaining, innocently funny, and made for the enjoyment of all ages.Likable duo, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) and James P. Sullivan (John Goodman), are back for a lot more laughs than in the original. Monsters University shows the two monsters' background story of how they meet in a college (that looks notably similar to UC Berkeley) and eventually become best of friends. Of course, this doesn't happen without rivalry and conflict. Basically, the whole story in a nutshell is Mike and Sulley uniting together with a group of misfits (from the most unattractive fraternity) in order to win the school's Scare Games and prove their worth to join the exclusive scare program. The story is certainly formulaic – we've seen this same plot hundreds of times before. The protagonist gathers a team of nobodies, trains them despite the opposition, and the team, to everyone's amazement, ends up winning the entire tournament – becoming heroes. Even so, Monsters University contains enough Pixar spark to turn the unoriginal story into a fun adventure. Each scene is littered with careful and specific details that tell so much more about the characters and their emotions. Mike's passion of wanting to win to prove himself could not have been displayed better and Sulley's frustration to keep up his family name is clearly shown.The supporting characters in Monsters University blows the previous film away, giving a lot more variety and flavor to the monster world. The unpopular fraternity members, Squishy, Don, Terri, Terry, and Art, all bring a lot to the humorous side of the story. Every character has his moments, but I found Squishy's parts uncontrollably funny (especially the dance scene at the frat party). Of course, it's nice to see the return of supporting character Randy (Steve Buscemi) as a nerdy, self conscious kid, trying to fit in with the cool group. Randy really ties the two films together: in Monsters University, it's revealed that Randy has good reason to want revenge on Sulley, while in Monsters, Inc. Randy acts out on that vengeance.Monsters University is fast paced, fun, and has a bit of heart in the end. Unfortunately, many people can't fully appreciate the film because they view it as an average creation – (by Pixar standards, of course). It only goes to show the high expectations that Pixar has brought upon itself. But people should really view the film not as one of Pixar's moderate works, but as one of the animation genre's best. Stunning visuals, distinguished characters, and a fun plot – what more can people ask for?It's surprising how entertaining a G rated film can be. Monsters University is certainly capable of winning an Oscar. The Monster franchise has been waiting for one. And this time, it will be well deserved.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A good prequel!,"First of all Monsters Inc. is my favorite Pixar movie ever so I was nervous about watching this one.Monsters University focuses more on Mike and his dream to be a scarer and at school he meets Sully (which is weird because in the first movie it's told they knew each other in 4th grade).Although this prequel wasn't really necessary and it's not as clever as the first movie back in 2001, it was still enjoyable to watch and I would definitely want to watch it again.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar makes a prequel,"Once again, Pixar makes a summer blockbuster that both kids and adults can enjoy. The last movie Pixar made was Cars 2, which didn't impress many adults. But despite the typical and unoriginal underdog story; what's not to like in Monsters University?The story focuses on Mike and Sulley as students attending Monsters University. Viewers get to see how Mike and Sulley met and how their friendship began before making it to the big leagues. I must say that the voice acting in the movie is really good. There wasn't one particular character that bothered me.As usual, Pixar delivers with its animation and colorful characters. There is simply no other animation studio that is better with those two qualities than Pixar.Another great thing about the movie is the atmosphere. It really pulls you in and keeps your eyes on the movie. The tone matches that of Monster Inc., and that's always a good thing.The only downfall of the movie is the typical story line. The movie never surprises you, and you can always guess what's coming next.The main reason I like this movie so much is because it really touches on Mike and Sulley's expectations and personal issues. Throughout the entire movie, you root for the two to prevail and accomplish their goals.Overall, Monsters University is a worthy prequel of the classic Monsters Inc. You can recommend this movie to just about anyone, no matter what their age. I give Monsters University a final rating of 8.2 stars out of 10 stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Recycling of old college clichés,"Monsters University is a prequel to the acclaimed Pixar film, Monsters Inc. In it we meet our two main leads, Mike and Sully, during their college days and witness how they became friends in the first place.Leaving aside the fact that in the original film it was said that Mike and Sully had known each other since elementary school, this is not an awful premise for a story. Granted, I would have rather had a true sequel, where we could perhaps skip to the future and see Boo as a teenager, or even an adult. But a college comedy is fine. It's fine....Truth be told, what bothers me to most about this film is how utterly unoriginal it is. If you've seen any college comedy in your life, you've seen this film. Sure, all the characters are monsters, but aside from that they're such cardboard cutouts. We have the jocks, we have the nerdy outsiders, we have the girl group, we have the strict teacher, we have the goths, we have them all.And nothing interesting is done with them. We even have Randall Boggs, one of the villains of the original film, in his younger form. And he starts out as this geeky, awkward guy, who's super nice to everybody. That could have been so hilarious and so interesting. But nope, goes absolutely nowhere. It's like they forget to tell a joke with him.Still, the animation is nice, there are some good scenes, the character concepts have creativity to them, and even the story is merely bland rather than outright bad. Do I wish they had done something more with this idea? Yes. Do I think it's not worth a watch. Well... no, not really. It's still Pixar.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Review for Monsters University,"This was a film that I originally saw with an ex-girlfriend. We both liked the original and we were living in Parma, Ohio together were on Friday nights, we would rent movies from Family Video. This was one that we decided on for the information given here. I remember enjoying this one, but hadn't seen it in all these years. We put this on since Mackenzie seemed to enjoy the original.What we're getting here is telling the tale of how Mike (voiced by Billy Crystal) became best friends with Sully (voiced by John Goodman). This is more of Mike's story as we see him as a child. The other kids didn't seem to like him, but that didn't stop him. We see him fall in love with being a scarer during a visit to Monsters Inc. He also sees one of the top scarers who went to Monsters University and that's where he wants to go.It is there that he meets Sully. What is great there is managing expectations. We think that he'll be rooming with Sully, instead it is Randy (voiced by Steve Buscemi). This gives the origin of how this character hates Sully. We get another great cast of voice actors here like Helen Mirren as the dean, Sean Hayes, Charlie Day, Alfred Molina, Tyler Labine, Aubrey Plaza and Nathan Fillion. Everyone here brings such distinct personalities to bring their characters to life.Another thing I'll say is that even though I don't love computer animation as much as classic, this still looks amazing. Watching this on my 4K TV, you see all the details from hairs on Sully to the intricacies of Dean Hardscrabble walking. It looks great. They bring this world populated by monsters to life and it just feels normal. It is impressive.Then the last thing to say here is that the message under this works so well. There is the idea of doing well in school to get a good job. Things don't work out how you'd think for the main characters but that isn't the only route. There also was another aspect here that I brought up to Jaime, my wife, after we watched this. The whole premise here is that the monsters go through doors to scare children for electricity. They're afraid that if they touch humans, it will be hazardous to them. I love this as a way to show children that monsters don't mean us harm, even if they scare us and that they're just as afraid of us as we are of them.All and in all, if you like the first one, this is a solid prequel to fill in the backstory. It is a great companion piece for sure that is just as enjoyable.My Rating: 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Addition while Subtracting Nothing,"Wow, I was quite surprised with this prequel. It took me awhile to watch it, but glad I finally did. It's been awhile since I watched the first one, but I would say the prequel actually drew more laughs from me. And that's not taking anything away from the original because as a whole movie/story it was probably better, but also had more anxiety to it from what I remember.It was great to see these characters we as an audience are familiar with and just how they came to be as we know them. The story meshed perfectly into the original, and was cool to see how certain relationships changed or evolved, especially with Randy.Definitely a movie that you would think was not needed (and it wasn't), but after seeing how well they complement each other I'm glad they did it. A great addition to the overall 'Monsters' universe, while subtracting nothing from it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than the sequel or the story that takes place after,"Despite few criticism this film got when it comes to kid audiences. It's actually a fun and emotional movie about friendship and teamwork. The CGI is fluid and top of the line. When it comes to kid's comedy, it works for the most part. And even clever to a degree. As a matter of fact with everything combined for this prequel, I enjoyed it and had a better time with it than ""Monsters, Inc."" although both films are great. This one starts out a bit slow, but when it does kicks off, it's smooth sailing from there. It's like watching a cool Pixar flick about teen college movies and ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" but focuses in on the monsters side of things. Overall this one a more entertaining Pixar movie than I expected. Thanks to clever execution and fun comradery.8.4/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Solid B+,"It's Pixar time again.The animated wonder house that released some of my favourite films (The Incredibles, Up) has unleashed a prequel to the seminal Monsters Inc. Certainly, the effect of Pixar on my consciousness is such that I pretty much grade any animated film now as being 'the best non- Pixar animated film I've seen'.It doesn't rank up there alongside the Pixar greats, where I would place the film's predecessor Monsters. Inc, but it was great fun.I'm actually going to start out with what I felt was the reason that this film doesn't quite live up to Monsters. Inc. I feel once I get these few points out of the way, I can then concentrate on the many things that the film does right.Firstly. The originality of the first film has gone. The film realises it cannot just re-hash the same material so Monsters University is a pretty normal college comedy film, it just so happens that it contains monsters. The fraternity competition is there, the harsh dean, the supportive lecturer, all characters well known in the genre. But they're monsters. Despite this however, the film manages to circumvent this through sheer enjoyment and imagination with the monsters themselves and the world they inhabit.Secondly. No Boo! One of the main reasons that Monsters Inc. worked so well was that apart from the great characters of Mike and Sully, Boo provided so much heart, laughs and sad moments that her absence just can't fill. Monsters University never quite manages to reach the same emotional heights that Monsters Inc. had and I believe that the lack of a character like Boo is the sole reason behind this.So what does the film get right?Well, Billy Crystal (Mike) and John Goodman (Sully) are still perfect in their vocal roles. Somehow sounding younger in this film than in Monsters Inc., they both still infuse the two characters with huge amounts of charm, humour and emotion. The animators must also get their credit here too by giving both characters expressive faces, especially Mike. His smile is so sweet, earnest and optimistic, it's a joy to watch.The other characters are also really well done, all of the members of Oozma Kappa are sweet and have some really funny moments. Special mention must go to Charlie Day, who provided the vocal talent for the character Art.The film is also so bright and colourful. Pixar love their bright, vivid colours and with realism out of the way, the animators saturate the screen with bright greens, red, purples, blues. It's a lovely film to watch. The story itself really surprised me as well. It's not a complex plot by any means but at several points, I was wondering how the film was going to resolve to where Monsters Inc. started.So it's not as good as Monsters Inc. for sure. But it is still a bright, colourful, funny and really enjoyable film. And it's still as good as most non-Pixar animated film's I've seen.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
8 stars could go Higher,"I honestly can say I am so glad that I saw this the night it came out with my Friend and his girlfriend and her brother. A Pixar movie were they make the best of the best movies !! Legends such as Toy Story series / a Bugs life / Finding Nemo / The Incredibles / Cars and the movies follow up Monsters Inc. - so does Monsters University deserve a spot in the legendary films of Pixar ? well ... its complicated , After I saw it the night it came out the movie kind of threw me off a little bit I think it was because I waited a long time for the movie and I am a huge fan of Pixar and was expecting greatness , and I just did not feel the Pixar I love , so I actually thought about the movie for a few days and I was thinking maybe it was not as bad as I thought - so the only way I could know the real answer is see it again so I did yesterday with my cousin - I laughed quite a bit because of the amazing monster duo Sulley and Mike.There adventure is during college were both of there dreams is to be a scarer at monsters inc. however at first they have different opinions about how to become a scarer which causes some conflict. John Goodman and Billy Crystal return as there voices and did a great job and i like seeing Randall as well. Those three are main characters in the follow up movie. The Oozma Kappa fraternity monsters were misfit / odd / awkward / funny characters that added to the movie.The Animation was brilliant like always !! the look of every single monster was superb !!! especially sulley and mike being younger. I notice sulley had a little flippy fur / hairdo on his head to show that he was younger / try to look cool and a little bit different so you could tell he was younger. Even when Mike walks through college just take look at all the monsters from BiG / Short / Horns / multiple eyes / scales / tales / claws and much more Pixar definitely are as creative since there first movie Toy Story.I know that i could keep going on and on about the positives of the film but i have to say its not all positives - and I'm going to try not to spoil anything but - the end just was a little bit of a let down i mean Dean Hardscrabble seemed just tough and arrogant but she showed her true colors at end but never solved mike and sulley problem after she was so certain Mike and Sulley would fall apart. I guess though the end is alright because it shows how they made it to Monsters inc just not the way I thought and hoped it would end. A lot of times in movies characters can only be themselves and that was Mike and Sully not matter what. I also would say determination is important however life does not always work out perfect so just try your best but know life has a plan for you , like Mike and Sulley they tried and tried then they worked there way up a different way.So all and all - is this movie a Pixar Legend ? Possibly I am being a little tough on it just because I loved Monsters inc. So much I mean this prequel does make sense / great development of characters / funny minor monsters / sound track / plot / depth - Pixar continues being The Masters at Animated movies ( so much you kinda forget its animated) so I end this review with Two questions - will there be a monster inc 3? i do not know my opinion is there might be !!! do not say goodbye to mike and sulley just know Pixar knows what there doing. The Second question is How will Finding Dory be ? well its Pixar !! even there movies i did not mention i have respect for there just not mind blowing in my opinion.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good,"In a history of almost 30 years, Pixar produced exquisite works such as Toy Story - Um Mundo de Aventuras, Procurando Nemo. Ratatouille and many others, which established the company among the most creative and beloved companies of the seventh art. Gradually, he started to insert sequences in his production line and from there were born Toy Story 2, Toy Story 3, Cars 2 and, now, Monsters University. To the delight of moviegoers, the investment in continuations did not represent a drop in quality in Pixar films, although it is undeniable that Cars 2 is the company's worst feature.Monstros S.A. focused its attention on the new, represented in the figure of the cute Boo. The protagonists James Sullivan and Mike Wazowski were forced to face an unknown world, coming from the side of humans. Now, at Monsters University, what comes from outside matters little. They are forced to confront their inner feelings. Mike has a willpower and a dream that gives him strength, although he passes the image of deluded to the rest of the world. Sulley, on the other hand, emerges as the subject pursued by the shadow of his famous father, at the same time that he passes on the image of a convinced and very sure of himself subject.In its first scene, the film shows itself willing to do anything to captivate the cinephile, bringing in a tiny and somewhat lonely Mike Wazowski who immediately makes everyone in the cinema say ""ownnn"". It is cuter than Boo herself and makes the feature win the viewer's heart at the beginning of the work. Mike appears on a school trip to the headquarters of Monstros S.A., a company specialized in scares to human children, until then known as the main generator of energy for the world of monsters.Mike decides on that visit that he will be a scary professional and decides to study for that. After a passage of time (inserted in a fun way in the initial credits), the young man finds himself entering the university to attend a scare school. He is faced with a beautiful campus, with electives, nerds, hippies, boys and popular girls. In other words, everything we are used to seeing in a hundred films shown at universities. There, he meets Jimmy Sulley, a popular and arrogant guy who sees him as a little cap who has no future in the world of scares. After a series of events, the two are forced to compete together in an Olympics that can change their academic life forever.The quality of the animation follows the Pixar standard. The characters, the settings, everything is extremely well designed. But it's not just about drawing a character or object well. It is mainly about animating an entire world that sounds real and welcoming to the viewer.Monsters University (in the original) presents some clichés of films with sports disputes and also has references to works that highlight the student universe. But, on the other hand, it amuses (and a lot) in some situations. The team formed by Mike, Sulley and a group of exotic monsters is very curious, as well as some of the evidence they need to face.The film obviously takes advantage of the affection we already feel for the characters, which comes from Monstros S.A., but it is important to note that it does not endeavor to create references to the other. We see other characters and even understand the ""creation"" of the villain Randy, but nothing that escapes the plot of the new production.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly good,"I wasn't sure what to expect from a Monsters, Inc. prequel but Pixar have done it again. There are a lot of great moments with the characters we all know and love. It has a good storyline on its own and doesn't feel like an appendage of the main story.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Monsters University"" earns high marks","If you don't have kids or your kids are no longer young children, you are spared having to sit through an endless parade of animated entertainment with varying degrees of actual entertainment value. But sometimes, there's a so-called ""kids' movie"" that you want to see just for yourself.""Monsters University"", is a prequel to the 2001 hit ""Monsters Inc."" and shows us how Mike and Sully first met and takes us down the long and winding path to them truly becoming friends. In the original, it's immediately clear how different Mike and Sully are, but meeting them as college students accentuates those differences. In this film, Mike is studious and determined, while Sully is content to rely on his natural scariness and his family legacy to get through the training to become the scarers that we know they eventually become.Since we know how the story turns out, keeping us interested along the way is a challenge. but it's a challenge well met. As the future best friends each struggle to overcome their limitations and get through their university program, we see a fun and funny portrayal of college life, monster-style. The movie ends up becoming an animated version of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", but the climactic scene is especially well done. Add to all that the superior animation (which is enhanced by a pair of 3-D glasses) and the excellent voice work led by returning stars Billy Crystal and John Goodman and ""Monsters University"" graduates with honors. I give it an ""A-"".",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An amazing follow up!,"After a huge 12 year wait, the monsters inc follow up finally released, And I was definitely not disappointed! I love the first monsters Inc so much it's unreal and this movie is a fantastic follow up to that film. I was surprised when it ended up being a prequel and not a sequel like everyone expected but it ended up being a great way to expand the monsters universe! I love the new characters they introduce and I love the new dynamic of seeing Sully and Mike being rivals instead of best friends, it really expands them both as characters! The whole scare games is such an amazing plot and I love seeing all the characters use their own different aspects to get through each game, it's such a cool sequence. I just think this film is such a good way to expand this movies universe and develops the main characters even more. What a fantastic way to follow up on a classic! Love it!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Taking me back 12 years, one scare at a time.","It's hard to believe that it's been 12 years since we last saw our favorite monsters Mike and Sulley on the big screen since their debut in Monsters, Inc. back in 2001. I've always wanted a return to the Monsters world but a sequel always seemed unlikely. Enter Monsters University, the prequel to one of the most beloved animated films of the last 15 years.Right off the bat, MU has you laughing in delight as we visit an elementary aged Mike Wazowski, the adorable and hilarious little green one-eyed monster we all know and love. Mike takes a field trip with his class to a little place called Monsters Inc. and the nostalgia kicks right in bringing back memories of 12 years in the past, a great way to get viewers back in the mood of the monsters world. When Mike is told by pro scarer that he should attend MU, Mike decides to become a scarer as well, and after a quick flash forward, we begin our wonderful journey.In short, the script is executed brilliantly. The movie's plot takes a strong focus on the importance of friendship and even for older viewers, it puts a strong message in the back of your head. The college setting of the movie is the perfect place for all sorts of wacky and fun things to take place, and Pixar and director Dan Scanlon take full advantage of this by creating some hilarious moments right out of the average college students life. We see fraternities, parties, sporting events and just about anything else you'd see on a college campus and Pixar puts them into a family friendly context that create moments that had me laughing out loud in the theater. The dialogue is terrific to say the least. Jokes swing left and right and can be enjoyed by viewers of all ages, and even some of the simple dialogue that doesn't try to be too funny has you laughing. The script could very well be the highlight of the entire film. For pure entertainment, MU deserves all the credit in the world.Pixar has a knack for creating some of the most memorable character tandems ever. The likes of Woody and Buzz Lightyear (Toy Story), and Martin and Dory (Finding Nemo) have become pop culture hits and Mike and Sulley are right up there as one of the best animated duos ever. Billy Crystal and John Goodman reprise their roles of Mike and Sulley respectively and the chemistry between the two is as strong as ever. The two want-to-be scarers first meet at MU and at first don't get along too well. This sets the stage for some wonderful competitions and some comical moments between the two and again, Crystal and Goodman's seamless chemistry fits perfectly. Eventually they come to earn respect for the other and this makes for a rather tense and heart-felt but overall entertaining ending.While Mike and Sulley are the main points of interest, the supporting cast of characters deserves just as much recognition. Steve Buscemi returns to play Randall, who we know as the sneaky reptile, but displays some different behavior in MU. Helen Mirren also is here playing Dean Hardscrabble adding some extra talent. The best of the best however lies within Mike and Sulley's eventual fraternity, Oozma Kappa. This group of humble, little-known monsters make way for some of the best and funniest parts of the movie. Funny man Charlie Day sign on to play Art, the hilarious arc-shaped monster who isn't too bright, but is sure to get you a laugh. Squishy, Don, Terry and Terri round out the rest of the crew and they all provide the extra shot in the arm to keep the movie fresh and funny.A superbly penned script, including an involving and entertaining story, hilarious dialogue, and a fun and fresh setting, colorful, lovable, and oh so funny characters portrayed by a talented cast of voice actors and an ending that keeps you entertained throughout the end credits (including after them). Put all of this together and you get Monsters University, the movie that I thought would never happen but after 12 long years of waiting, I'm glad to say the return to the world of our favorite monsters was well worth the wait.9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pixar Will Always Be Pixar,"Monsters University is about how Mike and Sully grew from the biggest of rivals to the best of friends in college. I'm not gonna go too much into the story, because it's more fun to experience for yourself.Pixar may not have had the best of luck with their more recent films (that is starting with 2011 up till now), but I noticed something while watching Monsters University: The feeling of déjà vu that I also had when watching Brave and even Cars 2. No matter how thin the story is or how uninteresting the characters are, Pixar will always be in a league of their own.That said, how was Monsters University? Well, it's the prequel to Monsters, Inc., which was released 12 years ago. I loved that movie as a small kid, and ... well, I still do to this day. This movie was originally planned as a sequel to Monsters, Inc., but was eventually titled Monsters University and announced as a prequel instead. I was skeptical to this, but I can say without a doubt that Pixar are starting to return back to their former glory.Monsters University isn't amazing like Ratatouille, Up and the Toy Story trilogy, but it almost is. Let me explain...The movie starts off very standard. Nothing too special. Some laughs here and there, but there isn't much promise or build-up to anything intense. Then the story starts twisting and turning a little bit, and eventually builds up into one of Pixar's most exciting movies. The climax of this movie is very thrilling and you really get into it.The animation is brilliant, as always. Pixar has always been the master of textures. Every texture in this movie looks photo-realistic. However, Pixar's talent in textures and animation in general is not really shown in Monsters University itself, but rather a little short film at the start called The Blue Umbrella, which looks real, period.The character development is very good. The movie starts out with a bunch of not-so-interesting nor likable characters, that eventually grow into characters you really root for. The relationship between Mike and Sully is very impressive, as they start off completely hating each other, but their friendship grows so naturally. Seriously, there's never a sudden change of heart in any of the characters.Overall, I really enjoyed Monsters University. It's very funny, very exciting, has likable characters, beautiful animation, great fan service for fans of Monsters, Inc., and it has some touching moments during the last part. I'm certain Pixar will return back to their former greatness in just a year or two.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Back to the school....,"OMG, we waited ten long years for a sequel and they gave an astonishing movie. When 'Monster Inc' came, that was the time of the beginning of the new era in filmdom of 3 dimensional (3D) animation movies. I remember I liked it but my 'understanding of a movie' was par below then compared to now. So I feel I liked this movie more than the first and that is normal because it happens to most of the people.'Monsters University' was the prequel to the 'Monster Inc' where it exposes the college lives of Mike and Sullivan. Mike had a dream ambition from his childhood. When his school takes him for the trip to power plant called 'monsters, incorporation', he wants to join the MU to become scarier like them. In other side, James Sullivan, the son of Bill Sullivan, the scarer joins the same university. Mike and Sullivan challenge each others and when something goes wrong they have to join hands to make everything back to normal. Now they have to face a series of challenges together and overcome it to achieve their destination.Since the storyline is about the college life the movie was a perfect entertainer even for the adults. It was just like seeing the two movies 'American Pie' and '3 Idiots' together at once. But the big problem was, the plot was not fresh, it was inspired from various teen movies that deals about college lives. Other than that the movie had lots of fun as expected and also the sentiments in various stages. Wow, for the moment I felt like 'do I am watching an animation or a live action movie?'. In my opinion adults will love this movie more than children do.So far the best animation of the year, even slightly ahead of 'The Croods'. I want this movie to win the Oscar, now let wait for the nomination to announce. But I still believe this movie do lots of magic in upcoming American Academy Awards. And I wish all the best for the cast and crew. A must-must see movie if you like teen themes, college stories and animations.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"College - cartoon monster style, uniquely and well done","I have to admit something: I prefer ""prequels"" to sequels, and may have rated this a point higher than normal, but then again, I believe it fully deserved it. The one thing I like about a prequel is finding out how they became what they are now - the ""before they were famous"" story.The animation is top-notch as is usual from Pixar. But I did feel the score isn't as good as it was in the original, but that may be due to this being a ""college"" movie, and thus lots of marching-band type scoring.The story is excellent however. Sure, at times it's like a typical college movie - how the protagonists became best friends, the experiences that bonded them together, the hi-jinks and the one awesome event that defined their college experience. But it's not a typical setting (monsters, not people) and it's not a typical movie (animated effects vs real life), and that works in its favor, making this something unique and thoroughly enjoyable.Check out how the typical college experience has been adapted for monsters, see some of the other characters (who are in the original film ) when they were younger, enjoy the references to the original film.Adults will enjoy this, I believe, more than the kids (at least, I believe those with college experiences will). But the younger viewers will no doubt still enjoy the story and the action.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Pixar Prequel,"Monsters University is the 2013 prequel to the classic Monsters Inc. It follows Mike's and Sully's college years and how they came to Monsters Incorporated. It shows how they met and went from the bottom to the top. It does show more of what education looks like in the monsters world. Monsters Inc focuses more on the business side and this focuses more on the education side of things. Though it's not a sequel, it still does alright at continuing this universe.It does seem to show that computer animation has definitely evolved when comparing it to the original one. The lighting seems better and everybody's movements seem smoother. Though the original seems more of a classic and better in it comes to stuff not related to the animation (with there being more of a nostalgia factor with the Monsters Inc).It is a Pixar film for October. October is depicted as the month of Halloween. Monsters are often associated with Halloween. Also, October is College Application Month. Monsters University is literally about them in University, which goes along with college application.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Pixar college life film,"I'd seen Animal House before watching this one and it made me a little curious about college comedies. As a prequel to Monsters, Inc., it was not a typical one. Lots of color, weird and wonderful characters, a good story, and good for both kids and adults. The voices were good too. I can't think of a single bad thing in this film. At least there aren't any beer or drug jokes that might be a little much for the kiddies. It's also about the cliques and the endless wars between jocks and nerds. That makes a good college story, right? Forget the cliches, this works!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Scary good.,"Those marketing whizzes at Pixar have done it again. Making a great film- which Monsters University undeniably is- is really only half the battle these days. The studio has again showed tremendous patience and foresight to release a follow up to Monsters Inc. only when its original target market was at a stage to fully appreciate it. Think Toy Story 3, but a lot less subtle.Before they were fully-fledged scarers, Mike and Sully (Billy Crystal and John Goodman, who both slip back into their characters seamlessly) started off just like everyone else: wide-eyed freshmen at the prestigious MU. But while Mike has had to work every day of his life just to gain entry, Sully is less battle-hardened, having ridden the coattails of his family name for years. When a squabble between the pair results in the destruction of a priceless university artefact, Dean Hardscrabble (a wonderfully scathing Helen Mirren) has no choice but to kick them out of the program, and their only hope for re-entry is teaming up with a bunch of rag-taggers and winning the Scare Games.The beloved animation studio has again served up an excellent mix of child-friendly slapstick and more adult humour, facilitated by a colourful supporting cast and punchy script. Charlie Day's Art, in particular, is a brilliantly crafted character, giving the kiddies plenty of laughs while hinting, ever so deftly, at the stoner culture that comes packaged with the university experience (we all knew one). He is a perfect example of this balance Pixar has built an empire on while elsewhere, newbies John Krasinski and Joel Murray flawlessly complement welcome returnees like Steve Buscemi and John Ratzenberger.For the keen-eyed viewer, the film is a walk-in wardrobe of Easter eggs and allusions. As soon as you start to get the feeling that an opportunity to bring in an old favourite has gone begging, they pop up in the most unexpected places (wait for the reveal of crusty favourite Roz). The fluidity of the narrative is masterful, too, as MU covers a lot of ground in less than two hours, but never feels flustered, instead taking time to flesh out backstories and relationships in impeccable detail.The film misses the emotional gut-check of Toy Story 3 and doesn't quite plunder our sympathies like Up, but that isn't the intention here. Tonally, this is a more reserved and, in many ways, more affirming tale; one that assesses the weight of friendship and carries a nice message of determination and believe in oneself trumping all.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad.

"Forget everything in the world and fasten your seat belt for the exciting, enthralling ride to Monster University","When a PIXAR name is attached to any particular animation , there will be heap of expectations riding on the film. Best part is with each film , PIXAR have proved they are the best and Monster Univeristy is one perfect example.Monster University is a prequel to Monster Inc. which tells the story of Mike and Sully in their college days when they were arch rivals.From the house of powerful animation house who has given us Toy Story series , Cars , UP , Wall-E and recent adventurous BRAVE - Monster University is thoroughly enjoyable. With its immensely popular characters Mike and Sully , add together fun-filled ride and hilarious situations - Monster University is one level ahead to the entertainment. You will be completely engrossed in the film when it begins and would be wanting for more once it ends.

Excellent 4.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Is it a prequel or a sequel?,"It's both! Almost as good as ""Monsters Inc. but it defies logic, as they both go on to work for Monsters Inc. anyway. Billy Crystal as Mike and John Goodman as Sully continue to be most unlikely of friends. Helen Murren is wonderful as the scary-yet-delightful winged Headmaster, Miss Hardscrabble. Almost as good as the first film. Extremely well animated with a very nice story involving ""underdogs"" that succeed by never giving up. I absolutely love the pretty-and-vicious ""cheerleaders"" with their beautiful red hair and toothy, scary smiles. Of course they can breathe fire, like all ""divas"". Mike is the most charming monster ever, and can barely even scare a bunny rabbit. For the best experience, follow up with a viewing of ""Monsters Inc."" Both have great ""heartwarming"" endings, of course! Neither movie is really very scary! Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Loved it,"What drives the film is a story about friendship. Although we assume the ending of the film, the plot is not at all predictable. The movie is full of humor and interesting characters who easily create sympathy in the viewer, as well as numerous representations of emotions that even the relatively evil monsters make real favorites. It has a lot of references that are related to real life and the people who have the same or similar viewpoints and problems, because even the monsters are afraid of the real world. When all is summed up this is a great movie, which was not on the same level as legendary Toy Story trilogy project or Wall-E. It's funny, interesting and full of emotions. I recommend that you first watch Monster Inc. then Monster University, for a better understanding.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun for young and old alike,"Monsters Inc. was a huge hit for the newly created Pixar studio and here they dip into the back catalogue to provide a prequel, the film explains how Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sullivan (John Goodman) met.The best buddies of the earlier film were not always the closest of friends, in fact at Monsters University they disliked each other. The University prepares young Monsters to move into their chosen profession, with the very best going on to be ""Scarers"".The film is a rite of passage tale, mixing Monsters from the wrong side of tracks, lonely monsters, popular monsters all mashed together in the crucible of young life that University represents. Not so much what you learn, but what you experience.The path to greatness is of course strewn with many pitfalls and obstacles to overcome. We get old friends and enemies appearing, which adds depth to the later film and characterisations. The background for Randy's (Buscemi) hatred for the pair is detailed, despite being Mike's original room-mate. We also get to meet a new central character, Dean Hardscrabble (Mirren), which must be the best character name of 2013.Mike and Sullivan are not part of the ""in"" crowd, represented here by stereotypical ""Jock"", Johnny (Nathan Fillion) head of the ""Roar Omega Roar"" fraternity. After various incidents, one including livestock but not what you think, they are left with a challenge that could spell the end of their fledgling scarer careers. Especially tough on Sullivan who comes from a long line of distinguished scarers.Creating a new fraternity ""Oozma Kappa"" to enable them to enter the University Scare games, the group is populated by a rag tag bunch of misfit monsters. The fraternity members, ""Squishy"" and his mum, Art, Don, Terri and Terry get some great lines, they are all initially a bit hopeless and probably represent a little bit of all of us. The challenge Mike has been set makes winning the games the only option for him and hopefully will provide the motivation slacker Sullivan needs.As you would expect, the animation, characterisation and voice acting is first rate and as usual Mirren is a welcome addition to the cast, her voice and characterisation is hard to miss. The story unfolds in unexpected ways and unlike Despicable Me 2 released at a similar time, takes time to add depth and meaning to the chases, laughs and general silliness. The script also makes time for a moment or two of quiet reflection, not long but enough to add some meaning to the enterprise.There are some hard knocks for the characters and life lessons hard won, which shows that Pixar has not taken the easy route on the screenplay, these are characters people care about and they are not short changed here.Arguably, despite this being a notch above standard CGI fare, we do need to see something new from Pixar, this is another buddy movie, however well disguised and sources from older material. There is a slight danger that Pixar is turning into the very money machine it once so despised. Sure everyone expects there to be merchandising etc but we also expect to see inventiveness and the company taking risks with the material. The planned ""Finding Nemo 2"" however successful, is unlikely to break new ground.SummaryYet another solid entry into the Pixar canon of films, this lovingly creates the back-story for these much treasured characters. University is the perfect place to explore who you are and what you believe in and this translates well into the intelligently written script.Great fun for young and old alike, all we need now from Pixar is some original stories and characters and all will be well with the world",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Worthy Prequel to the Classic,"""Monsters University"" is a prequel to the beloved 2001 film ""Monsters, Inc."" and while it may not quite measure up to the original, it still packs a punch with its charming characters and comedic moments. The film follows a young Mike and Sulley as they attend college to become professional scarers. The animation is top-notch, bringing the monsters and their world to life in a visually stunning way. The movie also delves deeper into the world-building of the Monsters universe, offering a more comprehensive look at the inner workings of Monsters Inc. However, it lacks the emotional depth and heart of the first film. Overall, while it may not be as memorable as its predecessor, ""Monsters University"" is still a fun and enjoyable watch for fans of the franchise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
honorable prequel,"I loved to see the two main characters again and this prequel was for me nearly good as the original one from 2001. They captured really good the university time, so you will see as student many parallels to your own university. Sideinfo: It's just annoying that these times so many prequels are released from Hollywood.Back to the movie: I also missed many things, more relations to the main movie from 2001 and a better presentation of all secondary characters. I would like to know more about them. Anyway the story line is very good but also very fast. You are going from one point to the next one, thats not bad but u cant really come down one time and enjoy the moment and the animations. After you try you will realize that the movie is already over. :)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great prequel to a great movie,I loved this movie. John Goodman and Bill Crystal reprise their roles from the original but takes place before they know each other.I think this movie does make some assumptions that you have seen the first one and understand the physics of the monster world. Other than that I don't think you would have to have watched the original to get this one.The premise of this one is kind of based off of the original but because it takes place in the past it has a bit of a different feel to it but I would say it's along the same lines as the first movie so if you liked that movie you will most likely enjoy this one.,8.0,Anonymous,Animation
We need more American animated films about fraternities,"Monster University is probably the only animated film about fraternities if I'm not mistaken.It is a good film and It was great seeing the monsters in university and fraternities, seeing the characters as college students, encourages viewers to study and go to college.I loved a lot of characters like Sullivan, Mike and of course ArtArt is one of the funniest characters I saw, I wish there were more people in real life like Art, he is so funny both in personality and appearance and cute.It would be great to see more American animated films about fraternities, not only in 3D but also in 2D, using the American art style.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
So much college and nostalgia from the past decade!,"I shall start off by saying that this movie was in no way ""unnecessary"" as some overcritical naysayers claim. It was a magnificent prequel to a movie everyone loves. It is quite fitting too because kids that would have watched Monsters, Inc. way back in 2003 are probably of college age now and seeing some of their favorite childhood characters in the same position as they are in now is fantastic (an quite a good way for Pixar to make some money). The college references, while somewhat stereotypical and possibly too focused on Greek life, were fitting and aimed at enhancing the story and not to just highlight what many believe college to be all about. I also loved the creativity that was loaded into this film with regards to the college stuff. ""Scaring major"" is just the beginning. All the posters about competitions and dorm life were quite accurate and relatable.With respect to other aspects of the movie, I love the message about teamwork, believing in your team and your friends, acceptance of mistakes, and forgiveness amongst friends. There's a lot that the kids of today (and even the ""grown-up"" college kids) can learn from.Of course, this was a prequel to a very loved film from the past decade. There was no way references to the original film would not be present. But, the way the story harked back was what got to me; they were mostly subtle and all in some way that affected the lives of Mike and Sully in their coming years as Scarers. References to previous movies do not get better than this.My only complaint is that it was not as funny as I would have wanted it to be. They did everything well: the animation, the small details, and the distinct personalities for the plethora of characters. But, Pixar, as I have said before, just has not been able to top Finding Nemo in comedy. Maybe that will change soon.Overall, I was very pleased and am very glad Pixar made this film, whatever the reason for it. Watched 02/07-02/08/2014, written 02/08/2014.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

The origins of a timeless friendship,"Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) wants to be a scarer. Period. It's a dream of his, to be a true scarer, through and through. As he successfully enrolls into the famous and prestigious Monsters University he meets his best friend for life but incredibly egotistical and priviledged Sullivan, Sully (John Goodman). Sully also wants to be a scarer and does so without having to put in as much effort as Mike. Just letting it all out, with the help of his priviledges and charms.The duo will have to learn to work together in order to pass one obstacle that haunts the both of them: How to be okay being yourself and look at what truly matters and in the end move on to something better, even if it means letting go.A classic, still 12 years later after its release, Monsters University is a standalone but still a prequel story. It never fails to stand on its own and doesn't really depend on the first installment to shine.From the incredible and deeply emotional voice acting with also the comedic timing that is indeed on time (no pun intended), Monsters Uni can go from deeply comedic and ironic to deeply and profoundly emotional, right to tears dropping kind of emotional, which is a great thing. The emotional parts are all there to make us feel Mike and Sully's hurdles, deep struggles and desires. And we're with them, during every re-watch of the way (no pun intended, once again).A never-ending and never boring flick about true friendship, love and being there for that person or for this case, this monster, no matter what.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Monsters"" Delivers, and then some","The ingenuity of devising a misfit character who doesn't quite fit in, within a species of creatures that, at first glance, seem entirely unrelatable, is wholly brilliant. Pixar, a studio known for originality across the board, did this extremely well in 2001 with ""Monsters, Inc."" 'Well, that was over ten years ago,' some of you might say; then perhaps you haven't heard of ""Toy Story 3"". They did it once with a franchise based upon reanimated children's toys, but can they breathe life into another aged film, this time with the premise of a prequel?The summer of 2013 rolls around, and Pixar presents us with ""Monsters University."" If you ever had questions about how our green and blue monster friends got into the scaring game, or if they belonged to the most stereotypically lame fraternity house, then look no further. There are plenty of college clichés to enjoy, from the dirt bag jocks, to the over-eager orientation leaders.Billy Crystal reprises his role of Mike Wazowski, the one-eyed, not very scary, little green man. By his side, the hunk of a blue, polka-dotted, man-bear-yeti, James P. Sullivan, or Sulley (John Goodman). ""Monsters University"" shows us how the two became friends, and they didn't start out as roommates, I can promise you that. As any Pixar sequel (or prequel, for that matter) goes, we meet up with some familiar faces along the way. The dastardly Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) rears his ugly, camouflaged face, but the most fun the audience will have is through a cameo later on in the film (I won't spoil it, don't worry).Our story begins by showing us just exactly how Mike Wazowski became obsessed with the human-scaring industry. Despite being picked on by classmates as a tiny, albeit adorable, monster, Mike developed a love and admiration for upper-division scare legends as a little tyke. In this world, they swap trading cards of the elite scarers, very similar to baseball legends of yore. Ironically, Mike is given the baseball cap of his favorite and most-respected scare legend. This drives Mike to attend Monsters University so he can major in scaring and, ideally, become a legend himself one day. Over time, he meets the before-mentioned Randall and Sulley. Turns out Sulley is actually quite the bag of tools at this point in their friendship, and through an unfortunate turn of events, the two of them are kicked from the scare program, and left to major in less interesting things.The terrifying Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren) is in control of the program, and gave them the boot. Mike, being the resourceful eyeball he is, thinks up a brilliant plot: join the upcoming Scare Games competition, and if he can prove he's scary enough, Hardscrabble must let him back into the program. Sulley and Mike are actually quite at odds by this point, and are forced to work together to make the plan work. They need at least six on their team, thus enters four new monsters, who together, play off of each other quite well, and actually inspires most of the humor in the film. They are clearly inept and unable to win the competition, but over time, and with lots of training, heart-searching, and a few montages, they may be able to win the coveted trophy, and the title of ""Scariest Monsters.""This is the set-up. It is a Pixar movie after all, but being older than the vast majority of children in the audience, I may have giggled at some of the slapstick at play here, but Pixar has a way of telling deep and involving stories within the animated context. With ""Up"" we were presented with commentary on true love, and the theme of aging and loss. Here, Pixar toys around with a coming of age, or stepping into a new phase of life; change, if you will.There are multiple times in ""Monsters University"" where Mike faces a step in front of him, quite literally actually. He can either choose to turn around and ignore it, or to step forward, make a solid choice, and walk into a new phase of life. Mike is presented with this option at least four times throughout his visual journey. We see the joys of Mike wholeheartedly accepting the new trials before him, but we also see the consequences of his actions. There is indeed a time to grow up, but there is also a time to take a moment to think about what kinds of challenges the future may hold. Luckily, our hero is ready for anything in his path, despite everyone telling him that he just isn't good enough.There are enough losers in this movie that anyone who has ever been rejected (all of us) will find someone, or some THING, to relate to. If you're fat, there is a monster for you. If you have a penchant for philosophy and deeper thinking, you are somewhat in luck. Finally, if you still live in your mother's basement and one of your best friends started dating your mother, ""Monsters University"" is here for you. Outside of the deep metaphors that are presented ever so subtly, there are plenty of surface level discussions to be had.Pixar hits this one with flying colors, and it's one you are sure to be called a fool if you miss. ""Monsters University"" is just too much fun, and I'm confident you will agree with me.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Back to school,"Or the university that is. And while the movie has clichés in it like you wouldn't believe, the movie is still more than enjoyable! The voice cast is amazing as always, but it's still Pixar crafting the characters and the story that while having a morality to it, it never feels like a boring lesson (pun intended).So this works as a sort of prequel to the other movie (Monsters Inc.). That means there is no need to have watched the first movie. But even if you haven't, after watching this you will want to watch it either way. And it holds up to the first movie quite good. Like always (apart maybe from Cars) you know what you're getting with Pixar ... Quality!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Winner,"You might like this movie if you enjoyed: Toy Story (1995), Monsters, Inc.

It doesn't matter what age you are, I am sure Monsters University can put a smile on your face. The graphics haven't changed much since Monsters, Inc., but even then they seemed flawless, and the characters are equally funny or scary. Helen Mirren as the creepy principle was the perfect choice.

"Good fun, but the original magic isn't there","Let's start with the fact that in the original there's a line implying that Mike and Sully know each other from elementary school (regarding their fourth grade teacher). But by itself this fact has nothing to do with the fun one has watching this fun film. And make no mistakes, it's a fun film. The acting is as good as anyone could find in any animation film, they're all simply perfect. The story telling is smooth for most of the film, the only real fault with the script is the last five to seven minutes of the film which are not only anti-climatic but in fact a simple let down and beside the point. The film ends about five minutes before the script does but we're being kept there waiting for the script to end too, which is a real shame. The other major problem with this cute prequel is the fact that the original was so good and, well, original, while this new one lacks the freshness and the magic offered by the first movie. It does have some great jokes and it will make almost everyone laugh, but the wow factor is not there. Don't wait for it to arrive it'll just ruin the film for you, simply enjoy what you get. Good characters performed by great actors are more than you'll get in many other films and if the jokes do work, it should suffice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better Than Expected!,"Now before I start this review, I must ask did we need a prequel to 2001's Pixar hit, Monster's Inc? I didn't think so, but I was pleasantly surprised how lovely and amusing this film turned out to be. It was an interesting take to tell the story of Mike and Sully before their fame in the previously-mentioned film. This film is really appealing and colorful and this will charm newcomers and fans alike. As a Pixar film, it's a vast improvement on Cars 2 and Brave (which weren't bad, but not like Pixar.)Don Scanlon's film brings us the return of Mike and Sully in their pre-Monsters Inc. days as we see them as bitter rivals at Monsters University. Because of some complications including everyone's doubt of Mike being a scarer, Mike and Sully team up to compete in the Scare Games which would show of they are any good after all.With the return of Mike and Sully, of course we would have the return of the welcome voices, Billy Crystal and John Goodman. They didn't lose a step in the twelve years between film. Steve Buscemi also returns as Randall and does a really fine job. I also must mention Helen Mirren, because she gives her best animation work as the evil headmistress of the school.Overall, Monsters University is a really sweet and charming Pixar film. I wasn't clamoring for a new film involving these characters, but I'm glad we got one. This isn't the best Pixar movie either nor the most original one, but it's still entertaining and a really nice way to take a trip down memory's lane. The animation is excellent and a good improvement and it's nice to have Randy Newman back as composer as he contributes a fun, jazzy score. This is perfect for both kids and adults alike and in that regard, it's another success for Pixar. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

MU Passes This Critic's Grade,"Like the Energizer Bunny, the people at Pixar Animation Studios keep going and going, delivering one good animated film after another. They have never made a bad film, yet. They previously took the sequel route with ""Toy Story"" (twice) and ""Cars"". This time, they decided to take the pre-sequel route with ""Monsters University"", a backstory to the hit 2001 film, ""Monsters Inc."" In the end, taking the pre-sequel route really paid off.Set a few years before ""Monsters, Inc."", green-eyed Mike Wazowski (voiced again by Billy Crystal) enrolls in the scare program in Monsters University to fulfill his childhood dream of becoming a scarer for the energy company. But first, he begins to make enemies with his future buddy, Sulley (John Goodman, returning) and has to face the wrath of their Dean Hardscrabble (Helen Mirren). When Mike and Sulley are banned from the program after failing the Scare Exam, they both get a chance to redeem themselves by entering in the Scare Games, a competition between fraternities and sororities. They enter to joining the least competitive of the fraternities, Oozma Kappa. The group includes a two-headed Bert and Ernie like monster, a elder member, and a bat-like creature who goes by the name of ""Art"".The film begins with a lot of chuckles in its first half, but when after Mike and Sulley joins the Oozma Kappa, it becomes rip-roaringly funny. It even delivers a rousing third act with a exciting and heartwarming climax that sets the scene for the film it spawned from.Director Dan Scanlon makes a good effort on his first animated feature. He succeeds in making the spirit of this film faithful to the original Monsters, Inc. The story uses the underdog formula, but it works well. The script by Scanlon, Daniel Gerson and Robert L. Baird doesn't try too hard for laughs and doesn't rely on pop-culture references to get them. The script succeeds in it's goal: to entertain perfectly. Plus, they added the character of Randall from the first film and establishes the reason why he didn't get along with the green and purple duo in the first place. Randy Newman's score is wonderful with a mix of college band music and his usual action film style.The animation is, as in all of Pixar films, superb, whether you see it in 2D or 3D. (I saw it in 3D, by the way). Also, the animations give some homage to some classic films. The setting for the first event of the Scare Games reminded me of scenes from two films from 1987; the secret meeting hideout for the P.A.G.A.N cult in the movie version of the TV show, ""Dragnet"", and Arnold Schwarzenegger's first leg of the on-air race in the underrated action thriller, ""The Running Man"". Plus, a funny bedroom scene with Mike and Sulley reminded me of a similar one with Steve Martin and John Candy in another 1987 film, ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" (Remember, ""those aren't pillows""?)Crystal and Goodman are both sensational again as Mike and Sulley. Their chemistry together make their odd couple characters feel like an animated creature version of Felix and Oscar. Mirren is divine as Hardscrabble and the supporting voice cast, with the likes of Sean Hayes, Dave Foley, Alfred Molina and ""SNL"" alum Julia Sweeney is solid.This is a fine antidote to the big loud blockbusters and the raunchy, adult comedies populating our screens now and it's this summer's perfect family film, by far, so far. It's not a great Pixar masterpiece in the way of Toy Story or the original Monsters, Inc., but it works well. Will Pixar break its good film record or continue to score with its next film? Who knows?Plus, it's best to come early for it or otherwise, you'll gonna miss one of the best and most intelligent animated shorts ever to come from Pixar in a full moon, ""The Blue Umbrella"". It's about a blue umbrella who chases a red umbrella in the middle of a rainstorm in a New York-like city. This precious short could make you deliver a tear in your eye. I'm hoping this short win the Oscar for Best Animated Short, come next year.Rating: ""Monsters University"": ***""The Blue Umbrella"": ****Parent Advisory: ""Monsters University"" is rated G.

Disney Pixar movie,"This is the story before they work at Monsters Inc. When Mike is a little child, he visits Monsters Inc.

Then he studies much and could go to there. He meets some monsters after his key persons.I like Monsters Inc. So I waited this movie. As I though this movie is exciting so much. Truly Disney Pixar!

A fun college movie. Just don't put it up to Pixar standards.,"Okay, so Mike Wazowski was my favorite 3-d animated character as a child, so I was pumped to hear that this film was all about him! Do I think they succeed? Yes, but please don't compare this to Pixar's other works! That is just setting the bar way to high! Mike was interesting in this movie. It's odd because he's getting in trouble in this movie, but in Monsters Inc. he was constantly trying to get Sulley OUT of trouble by sticking to the rules. I guess he matured or something? Anyways, I'm reviewing this movie as a college flick, because that's what this is. And boy is it a fun one at that! I wish they could have put more character into Randall, but that doesn't matter to me that much since there are plenty of fun new characters to get to know. My favorites are Terri and Terry, the two monsters stuck together but that's just my personal taste since I'm a twin :) The humor was parodying college life which I thought was a great choice. Dean Hardscrabble being the extremely strict teacher gets some great moments. There is also an incredibly awesome third act to go with the film. That is the part most people walk away remembering. The third act, in my opinion, stands with some of PIxar's finest. Hopefully both kids and adults will have fun in this college adventure.",,Anonymous,Animation
The Wait For Pixar's Return To Form Continues!,"From the creators of animation classics like Toy Story trilogy, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, The Incredibles, Ratatouille, WALL·E & Up, Pixar Animation Studios' 14th feature film marks their first foray into prequels & although it's an enjoyable, entertaining & quite satisfying ride for the most part, it ultimately falls short of the quality of cinema we expect from Pixar.A prequel to Monsters Inc., Monsters University focuses on the relationship between Mike & Sulley during their college life, where they started off as rivals studying to be scarers. After the two are dropped from their courses for causing a fight, Mike takes part in Scary Games competition to prove his worth & reluctantly includes Sulley when his team falls short of one member.Directed by Dan Scanlon, the story does add more dimensions to our beloved characters & captures the college atmosphere in a vivid manner but it really isn't a film that was needed in the first place. Still, it's better that they made a prequel instead of a sequel. The direction is good but the story lacks originality & unlike the best of Pixar films, doesn't bring anything new to the table.The computer animation is top-level stuff, as expected from Pixar. The reprising characters have not lost any of their charm while the new ones are ingeniously envisioned, designed & rendered on the screen. The narrative follows a conventional route & is full of genre clichés yet the one aspect I liked most was what they did with the character arcs of Mike, Sulley & even Randy.Mike is presented as a monster who's told by everyone that he doesn't belong, which fuels his desire to become something important & respectable, despite his irreplaceable flaws. Sulley, however, enters the college with lots of aura & pride surrounding his family name but soon experiences the burden of living up to a legacy. While Randy is given a sad portrait of an insecure loner who later gets seduced by the dark side.There isn't much to complain in the technical categories either. Cinematography makes fine use of colour palette & camera movements are energetic. Editing paces the story nicely for its runtime is never felt, for the most part. Billy Crystal, John Goodman & Steve Buscemi do a great job in voicing their respective characters but it's Helen Mirren who surprises the most as Dean Hardscrabble. And Randy Newman is as amazing as always.Certainly not in the league of the original, Monsters University is still an absolutely hilarious, unabashedly rib-tickling & wildly entertaining laughter riot that offers loads of fun to viewers of all ages while those expecting another path-breaking cinema from Pixar are destined to be disappointed. I doubt people would be complaining as much if this film was released by some other animation studio but since it's Pixar, anything less than great is disappointing.On an overall scale, Monsters University is a wonderfully crafted tale about the beauty of friendship and provides a fascinating evolution of Mike & Sulley's relationship from hardcore rivals to inseparable friends. A roller-coaster ride of unlimited madness that will amaze the kids & take most grown-ups to a nostalgic tour of their college lives (hopefully) although I highly doubt that it will be remembered in the years to come. Worth a watch? The answer is a resounding yes.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fun Characters and Great Animation,"Monsters University (2013)*** (out of 4)Fun prequel to MONSTERS, INC. has Mike (Billy Crystal) going to Monsters University where he will learn to major in the scare department. He struggles at first but soon becomes friends with Sully (JOhn Goodman) who agrees to join a team of losers who try to overcome their odds to be frightening monsters. MONSTERS UNIVERSITY is another winner from Pixar who drops some of the more ""message"" moments of the past few films and instead goes for straight comedy. I've heard a few people call this a fluff piece, which I think is a bit unfair because while this isn't as strong as UP or TOY STORY 3, it would be hard for any film to match those. This film here at least offers up some familiar characters and perfectly blends them with some new ones. I thought both Crystal and Goodman were extremely good returning to their vocal parts and we also got fine work from the likes of Helen Mirren and Steve Buscemi. Another major plus was the animation, which just keeps getting better and better, if you can believe that. There were several shots here that almost seemed real and especially the stuff inside the classroom where the Dean Hardscrabble was flying around and closing the shades. Another amazing looking sequence comes towards the end when Mike and Sully find themselves inside a cabin with the police surrounding them. The comedy here actually works quite well and especially once the HUNGER GAMES-like challenges begin. MONSTERS UNIVERSITY will never be considered a classic but it's still quite an impressive film that's very much worth watching.",,Anonymous,Animation
"The story isn't new, but Monsters University is a fun, beautifully animated, frequently hilarious, and overall charming family film.","You've seen its premise before, and it doesn't quite reach the strong emotional depth as other Pixar outings, but regardless Monsters University is a fun, beautifully animated, frequently hilarious, and overall charming family film that will be sure to leave a smile on your face. Definitely see it.The story: This collage-based prequel takes place before the 2001 original hit Monsters Inc., about two monsters living in an alternate creature-filled world where they work in a scare factory aimed at transporting through kid's closet doors over the world and making them scream time and time again. Not as violent as it sounds. In the original they accidentally bring back a kid through one of the closets and begin to befriend her. This leads to some consequences though, and after being banished, they had to find their way back to the monster world, and reluctantly return the kid to her world as well. Monsters U takes place before that adventure and shows the history of how our one eyed and furry harried protagonists became buds. Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) a small but smart, green, one-eyed, and short legged creature who always has wanted to be the best ""scarer"" in the world. Only problem is that he isn't scary. At all. He finally is accepted to Monsters University to test his abilities and determine his true destiny. During his school year he runs into and begins a rivalry with a gigantic and fluffy monster named James Sullivan (John Goodman) who's got the scary build, but not the brains. After both have to deal with forms of rejection, they decide to band together, work with new friends, face the odds, and finally prove themselves to the rest of the college. It's probably the tamest college comedy you've seen, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have its laughs.The good: To start, Monsters University looks fantastic. The visuals and animation is bright, vividly detailed, and is simply a joy to ogle over. The characters are fantastically original and unique, and its great to see Mike and Sully back on the big screen together, especially and interestingly in their earlier forms. The scripts premise may not be new, but the screenplay is very clever, funny, and adds a nice concluding section to the film which I wasn't expecting. Back to the humor, there were many chuckle-worthy moments throughout the movie, be it zany sight gags from its multiple appended characters or witty line of dialogue, but there also were some big laughs, including one gag which has me laughing out loud for a while. The humor wasn't as edgy as some other children's fair, but many jokes were unexpectedly and ""nudged"" the envelope just the right amount. There also were many funny references and in-jokes to the first which will make any previous viewer smirk. The voice acting is great and really fit the characters body movements and idiosyncrasies to a tee. The pacing of the story is fantastic, be it montages, or exciting set pieces, it really fit together well. The score was also nice, and did the perfect job to fit the films tone and sequences. Again, if it didn't reach fully satisfying emotional highs, it still reached, and partially worked, instead being warm and touching. It also had a solid message that wasn't pounded in, but still was mentioned just enough. Really, thanks to the originality of the goofy and root-able characters plus a crafty screenplay and fluid storytelling, I found myself smiling quite a bit. I also want to commend the conclusion again for not taking the easy way out and trying something different instead.The bad: The only real flaw of the film is that the story has been done before a few times, and that I wish it dug a little deeper with the emotional elements, but still I am happy with the way it is.My take: After the two recent disappointments from the prolific and incredible Pixar team, it was time for a comeback, and I can safely say that Monsters University is a significant step in the right direction and prefect family entertainment. I was very glad that I saw it and felt satisfied walking out of the theater in an otherwise disappointing year for films.",,Anonymous,Animation
