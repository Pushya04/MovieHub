wonderful holiday film,"So it was with much trepidation and even utter fear in my heart that I went to see this movie. After all, the last time I went to see a full-length adaptation of a favorite Christmas story, what I got was Ron Howard's absolutely God-awful ""The Grinch"". Having grown up with the book ""The Polar Express"" (according to my mom, I cited it as my favorite Christmas present when I was seven), I did not want to see this story bastardized in any way. Honestly, I was prepared for ""Polar Express"" to be a complete wreck. But insteadIt soared. Completely. What makes the film such a success is not so much even the story itself, but an execution which somehow manages to inject every frame of the film with a feeling of childlike wonder and exuberance. In addition, there are so many clever touches and details added throughout that a feeling of mystery and excitement just fills the viewer. Among these are the waiters dancing and singing while serving hot chocolate to the kids on the train (a very funny scene, as well), the factory where the presents are prepared, and a ghost-like hobo who is never really explained, but is incredibly crucial to the feel of the film. At one point, three of the children wander lost through the empty streets of Santa's North Pole town. As they wander, various old Christmas recordings are heard playing on phonographs throughout the town. The music provides a pleasant and nostalgic ambiance to the scene. It's touches like this that absolutely make the film.I'll never understand why films seem to be required to be at least 90 minutes long. I would pay money to see a 40-minute film, as long as it were good. And even if it sucked, I would have at least wasted less time. What I'm getting at is I have no idea why a 32-page picture book needed to be a 99-minute movie. What this means is that the original story is VASTLY expanded upon. However, what is added in actually fits quite well with the essence and spirit of the book. Some of it is just sheer entertainment; the train track is like a roller coaster, characters ski on top of the cars, danger lurks around every step of the journey to the North Pole (but admittedly fun danger). Other aspects further illuminate and expand upon the book's basic theme of the virtue of belief in the implausible. So I have no idea why this was made into a full-length, but in the end, I'm glad it was. It didn't even feel too long (and I think everything is too long).Much criticism has fallen on the look of the characters in the movie. I can agree to a point. While there is incredible visual detail in the faces, they usually seem void of expression. In general, a lot of the motion seems rather wooden, as well. The scenery, on the other hand, is gorgeous. Overall, the minor problems in animation (which really boil down to a matter of taste anyway) are certainly not enough to diminish what is an overwhelmingly successful movie.

Just get real folks,"Come on, guys. This film was made at a time when these visuals were still groundbreaking. Don't complain now that they were not as far along then as they are today. Thanks to pioneering work like The Polar Express, filmmakers can now create even more beautiful things. A lack of historical perspective is a major shortcoming for the contemporary viewer... And yes, it is always a joy to watch Tom Hanks, whichever movie he's in. Now and back then.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Will Become A Christmas Classic,"I have to say that I adored 'The Polar Express'. It was just the sort of film I needed to truly get me into the Christmas mood. The story revolves around a young boy, who is coming to an age where he is doubting Santa Claus' existence, until the Polar Express- a magical train destined for the North Pole- takes him and a group of other young children on a journey to Santa and to reaffirm their faith in Christmas.I had reservations about the use of CGI animation since I felt it really only worked for stories about cute animals but having seen the film, the CGI was the best way to capture the spirit of the film. It really wouldn't have worked as well in live action, the sense of other-worldly magic would have been lost. And as it was, the artwork was beautiful, especially the snowy mountainous scenery that the train passes through.This film took me back to my childhood and that tingly-feeling every child gets on Christmas Eve in anticipation of Santa's visit. The story was sweet and innocent without being nauseating, and I think every one of us can empathise with the boy who wants to believe in Santa but is growing away from the innocence of early childhood and faith in magic. Much like Raymond Briggs' 'The Snowman', I predict 'The Polar Express' will go down as a Christmas classic. It certainly makes a pleasant change that this year's Christmas film was actually about Christmas and I hope they make the re-release of this film an annual Christmas event.",,Anonymous,Animation

"It is a very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable","Directed by veteran Robert Zemeckis, It is a production that unveils, throughout its 100 minutes, the story of an American boy in the late 1950s. By witnessing the polar express stop at his door, the young man will have the most fantastic experience of his life. Life, something that will mark him forever and allow his belief in Christmas, not as firm as one would expect for a child, to become even more solid. Initially reticent, the young man agrees to leave on the train that takes him on a tour full of incredible adventures. Each piece of territory crossed is a different learning experience, marked by its still incipient trajectory. He fights with Scrooge, the famous evil Christmas spirit, immortalized by the literature of Charles Dickens, passes by the famous Polar Aurora, a place with the optical phenomenon due to the brightness observed in the night skies of the polar regions, due to the impact of particles of solar wind with the high atmosphere of the earth, channeled by the magnetic field of our planet, that is, an impressive visual spectacle that leaves no one indifferent.In the face of conflicts, as it is worth mentioning, the boy no longer believes in Santa Claus, the narrative becomes an allegory for the need to believe and invest in the ""so"" Christmas spirit. We check with some resistance, because the foot in reality does not allow us to surrender too much to the utopias proposed by the American cinematographic discourse. However, one of the ""tasks"" of art is precisely to allow us to clarify reality through fictional proposals, thus, the ticket to enter the world of Zemecks film is ""bought"" by all those who indulge in the charms of art. Narrative that unfolds before our eyes, a set of scenes built using visually incredible resources.Zemeckis's filmography is known for playing with the ludic, and here it is no different. The script to be well digested by the viewer needs to be seen as a story about magic and aborted beliefs. Alan Silvestri's music helps to punctuate this feeling that life in the eyes of a child is more beautiful, even if that child no longer believes in legendary figures, as is the case with the central character. In ""The Polar Express"" we have a short, simple and objective plot. The director's intention was never to create a work of art in the plot with this film, but to prove that you can rescue barbaric feelings and emotions with the Christmas theme. Now imagine Tom Hanks facing five different roles in the same film. Imagine? Something very crazy to think about, mainly because the ""motion capture"" technique (technique used to make the character Gollum from the series ""The Lord of the Rings, for example) was used, which captured all of Hanks' movements and transferred them to the computer, mixing reality and animation, fantasy and flesh and blood beings. The actor plays a boy who does not believe in the Christmas spirit, his father, a locomotive driver, a stroller and Santa Claus himself. It is a versatility never seen in the world of movie theaters.This technique was used in a magnificent way for the sake of narrative. To get an idea of what was done, all the actors in the film acted in front of an empty screen, with motion capture sensors attached throughout their bodies. The data from these sensors were passed on to computers and served as a template for the creation of the character in the film itself. As these sensors were responsible for capturing movements and facial expressions, the actors did not necessarily have to have the same body as the character. This allowed Hanks to play five different characters. And look, it was not easy to shape all of his expressions, so much so that the work lasted almost a year. The interesting thing was to see Steven Tyler, vocalist of the band Aerosmith, as Elf singing a song at the end of the film. Very funny! They managed to capture the essence of their appearance (big mouth and ears)!The film makes use of a very new advent for its time, and at least the main character is very excited. Already adults and peripheral child characters are astonishing to look at. This is thanks to the concept of Uncanny Valley, which preaches that figures that imitate human beings when they approach what man is become strange. The dialogues and interactions are quite artificial, but not as much as the attempts to make musical numbers. The waiters who serve the wagons are so tough that they look like imitations of androids. This issue is somewhat appeased by the parties involving animals running, flying and interacting with the typical things in the scenarios. Wolves and eagles represent more than just animals typical of North American fauna, and result in representatives of the work's sense of adventure. The criticisms received at the time of the launch, stoning the flesh-and-bone characters, their lackluster movement, their rubberized look and their glazed eyes, forgot the most important component of any short story: simplicity and narrative poetry.And although the visual is the only really negative point of this technique, like ignoring the perfection of Zemeckis's camera, it went through, following in the smallest details the movement of a lost golden ticket and the travellings that lead us nimbly in and out of the train, especially during the free fall on the tracks and crossing the thin ice? The option for elegant frames also stands out, and the counter-plongée, which accompanies the little boy's belief through the frozen floor, not only dignifies the moment but anticipates the arrival of Santa Claus. Meanwhile, the photograph by Don Burgess and Robert Presley is breathtaking - as shown in the image below -, and the intense gold of the train ticket or the lighting of the bonfire on the face of a Beggar, the angel presents in the vast majority of people. Christmas stories, is enough to make a beautiful Christmas story shine.At the end of the projection, we were left with the feeling that Zemeckis achieved his goal, of combining technology and magic in the same product. He, who is admittedly one of the directors who most seek to develop and perfect techniques and technologies, ends up creating a plastically flawless film, transposing to the screen with admirable perfection the engravings from Allsburg's book. Zemeckis also creates practically unimaginable plans and sequences, in a brutal effort to want to innovate. Zemeckis also loves to make references to other films. This time, he made the children's classic ""The Fantastic Chocolate Factory"", starring Gene Wilder. The ticket that gives access to the train is golden, just like in the classic movie. In addition to similarities like the big chocolate factory, the gift factory or even the driver with the funny Willy Wonka.Assuming a metalinguistic tone on purpose - the Conductor, one of the characters voiced by Tom Hanks, refers sensibly to abandoned toys - and accidentally - Ebenzer Scrooge's puppet would serve as a mold some years later for the personification of the classic character by Jim Carey, O Polar Express culminates in the detail plan of a hand bell, which is much more than the complete proof of the fantastic journey, it is the true Christmas spirit within each one of us. The inner child who screams and cries out for the sincere remembrance of his attachment to the beautiful illusion of the good old man, of the communion of gifts and brotherly love, whose sound materializes in the tinkling of the bell at the ear of the, now adult, little boy.On the other hand, it is noticeable that the biggest problem of The Polar Express is not so much its innovative and uncomfortable aspect - something crucial for a Christmas plot - and its plot, common and obvious. The protagonist is a boy who is starting to stop believing in Santa Claus. He is growing up, and with that, forgetting the magic of childhood. The events in The Polar Express take place in a very traditional and unoriginal way. There are not many news or discoveries: everything goes very smoothly, without scares or surprises. The few moments of suspense and tension soon dissipate, and normality then dictates the course of action again. The impression is that he devoted a lot of time to the appearance of the film and very little to the development of the script.The film itself looks more like a roller coaster. You will have fun watching the ups and downs of the trip, with exciting moments and action sequences where the beauty of the most magical time of the year is paramount, while others are strange and out of place, like the setting of children singing songs. At least when the final season arrives, the home of Santa Claus, the magical character is rescued with a sequence of events that show the intimacy of the elven officials, including the architecture of miniature houses since they are small. There comes a moment in the film that is surreal to imagine that a boy can walk on top of a moving train, but it does not bother you because you are already involved in the fantasy atmosphere provided by the characters.The care with the visuals of sets and costumes of the inhabitants of the magical place breaks the skepticism of the central character of The Polar Express too much, and this is certainly a film that has a lot of audacity, being a pioneer in many points that would become quite common in children's productions. And adults later on. The movement capture technique, new at the time, brings to the film the combination of ""real images"" and animation, in one of the most surprising Christmas cinematic experiences in the history of cinema. In addition, The Polar Express is a very, very beautiful and careful film with its theme, even if the story could have denser characters and conflicts to make the experience even more unforgettable. Still, it is a beautiful production about friendship and how we should, without being too deluded, cultivate our dreams, with a view to making our existence more bearable.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What's with all the hate for this movie?,"This is one of the better Christmas movies I've ever watched. It's fantastic. I watched this again after ages and right after 'A boy called Christmas' which I didn't like at all. You could say that I watched this to cleanse my eyes because that movie is quite bad.It's an amazing fantasy Christmas movie with spectacular animation. Tom Hanks' animated character looks just like him. I didn't find the other characters as jarring as people claim them to be. The film's animation is so good that it's easy to overlook the ""creepy"" looking characters.The film has extremely breathtaking visuals, gripping scenes, a jolly atmosphere. It also has songs which is really fantastic and something that happens to be missing from Christmas films including'A boy called Christmas'. The moral that this movie has is also quite beautiful. So overall a really great movie to watch during Christmas. All this hate is just not justified.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Creepy Dead Eyes,It's the first big attempt at motion capture all CGI animation full length movie. It is commendable of director Robert Zemeckis to attempt such a feat. It is a technological step forward. But the creepy eyes.... the creepy dead eyes.A boy is doubting the reality of Santa. A mysterious train comes to his house. He boards it and finds other kids going to the North Pole. The fact is this is not a very magical voyage. The song and dance isn't that good. There is an air of hollow fake fun in this movie. And that doesn't include the creepy eyes.... The creepy dead eyes.And I didn't really see any magic in the North Pole. It felt more like an old industrial English town. I really wanted more magic for the workshop. And then there were the creepy eyes.... the creepy dead eyes.,4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Enchantment, thrills, spectacle...looks great on DVD...","On the one hand there are many delightful moments in THE POLAR EXPRESS, not the least of which is the entire look of the film--appealing in a way that great illustrations of children's books always are to young and old. Tom Hanks and the others enter into the spirit of the whole thing with gusto--and all the performances are right on target.On the other hand, much of the film is an excuse to dazzle with roller-coaster-like rides on the express train that roars across various landscapes making wild leaps and turns, all the while thrilling us with a sense of adventure and excitement. For the very young, the ride might be a scary one, especially when the daring young hero rides atop the train during a blustery snowstorm.Things barely quiet down once the destination is reached at the North Pole. Still there are dangers lurking and the thrills continue with some amazing photographic tricks that can only be done in this new process of computer generated animation.And to add a cozier touch to the proceedings, certain famous Christmas songs are interjected at intervals to give the North Pole--and the film--a warmer glow.All in all, quite an imaginative and innovative achievement--impressive enough to assure its place among future Christmas favorites with unlimited appeal for the young in heart. The message of Christmas is lightly hinted at but when Tom Hanks as the train conductor tells the little boy, ""The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,"" we can be assured that children everywhere will definitely ""get it"".Visually, it's a stunner. I didn't see it on the IMAX screen where I imagine it really knocks your socks off, but at a multiplex where picture and sound were impressive enough to convey just how advanced special effects technology has become. There is much artistry involved here, especially when the night scenes of the train's fast-moving travel through a blustery snowstorm capture some rich winter landscapes, including a frozen lake that threatens to demolish train and passengers before danger has passed. The camera-work is continually fascinating as is the artwork involved.A pity there couldn't have been more of a story in the children's book which is the source--but the artistic visuals are the main source of entertainment here and they are superb. The busy background score by Alan Silvestri is reminiscent of works by John Williams. Although none of the sprightly song tunes are particularly memorable, there is a wistful quality to one of the new Christmas ballads sung by the children.P.S. - I have just watched it on DVD, a year after writing the above review--and it's definitely a keeper--just as wonderful as you could want, an amazing technological achievement that should delight all ages who can still hear that bell! Tom Hanks, as the conductor, is my favorite character--brilliant job.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

For Goodness Sake,"Clearly the reviewers who panned this wonderful film can no longer hear the ringing of the silver bell. I am reminded of the know it all kid in the film when I read these reviews. Some said it was too dark. Too dark? It was set at 5 minuets to midnight.....As I recall its dark then. Another called it ghostly; a condition true of a Christmas Carol, the film is in good company there. While I will admit that the computer motion capture in facial expressions is not as strong as it could be it did not detract from the story. Some reviewers did not like the roller-coaster effects. One even pointed out that trains can not do what this one does.....It's a dream...physics don't count. It is a sad commentary that the meaning of Christmas and belief in it's historically documented magic is so lost on those with access to the press. My review...it's good and it is best if you make up your own mind. I could hear the bell ring and I hope you can too.",,Anonymous,Animation
"""The Polar Express"" Is A Surprisingly Good Trip","I try not to have expectations when I go to see films. Often, my problem is usually that I'm excited about a film's opening, and my expectations are usually high. In the case of ""The Polar Express"", my expectations were actually pretty low.Growing up, I would read and reread ""The Polar Express"", a book written and illustrated by Chris Van Allsburg, every Christmas. It still ranks as one of my favorite children's books. The story was great, the illustrations were amazing, and the book never lost its charm to me as I got older.Naturally, when I heard they were making a movie out of it, and an animated one at that, I could not help but dismiss it as a ploy for Hollywood to take a sweet, timeless children's fable, and exploit it for a cheap buck. Now that I've actually seen the movie, I can say that it was far better than I thought it would be.Director Robert Zemekis, who also co-produced and co-wrote the screenplay, managed not only to make the film look amazing, but still kept the heart and the main moral of the original book within the movie. There are a lot of parts here that were not in the book, like the train slipping on an icy lake, and the caboose disattaching from the train with some of the kids on it. However, the really important parts of the book were maintained here. The main boy in the story still wants a bell, Santa gives it to him, and . . . you can figure out the rest.I didn't expect to like many of the additional characters they added to the movie, but I thought they were all characterized very well. I liked how the conductor (Tom Hanks) actually had a personality, unlike in the book where the focus was solely on the boy. I also liked how the boy interacted with other kids on the train, especially an African-American girl (Nona Gaye) whom he befriends. There's also a really sweet song called ""Spirit of the Season"" that she sings along with a boy credited as ""Lonely Boy"". The way the song is sung, and the CGI-imaging of the night sky, are both truly spectacular.Some of the films excursions that I thought were going to be cheap plot devices actually served the film well. After all, a book that's roughly 30 pages long probably won't amount to a 2-hour movie. Still, these subplots were used in a way to not only cleverly characterize the main characters, but also to give a better dimension to the North Pole. You would never see the elves, how they transport themselves, and what the villages in Santa's North Pole look like if the film stuck straight to the book. Zemekis has consistently been very good at using computer animation to add not only to characters, but make their worlds far more elaborate and interesting.With all that said, I had some major reservations about the film. While the animation was really good in terms of set design, I hated how it made the humans look. They almost looked like zombies at times, and it was a little scary.Don't get me wrong. Motion capture animation is pretty amazing, and probably not as time consuming as regular animation. However, when the main characters are humans, and the conductor looks exactly like Tom Hanks, why not just film them? That would probably cut the $165 million budget down significantly, or at least I would imagine.Also, it really irked me that most of the children did not have names. The main character is labeled ""Hero Boy"" in the closing credits, the black girl is named ""Hero Girl"", a nerdy boy is credited as ""Know-It-All"", and so on. Why not give them names? What's the harm in naming Hero Boy something like Tommy or Jimmy? It's not hard.I also hated how the main characters are kids, yet the actors who do the voices for them are not kids. ""Hero Boy"" is actually voiced by Tom Hanks, although he actually sounds like a real kid. Same with Nona Gaye, Peter Scolari, and Eddie Deezen. While their child voices sound authentic, it seems like a lot of unnecessary work to digitally doctor their voices to make them sound like kids. Why not just (Gee, I don't know!) hire child actors to do the voices!?!?! It worked for ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" (1965), and it can't be difficult.Tom Hanks doing the voices of six different characters felt more gimmicky to me than cutting edge. Hanks is far from the first actor to play multiple roles in a single movie, but Peter Sellers, Lee Marvin, or Eddie Murphy he is not. In the movies those actors were in as multiple characters, they disappeared into their characters so much that their multiple roles showed their acting ranges. Here, every character Hanks voices (except the boy) sounds like Hanks. You can tell that Hanks is the voice of the conductor, the hobo, the boy's father, and Santa Claus. The gimmick is so distracting that it takes you out of the movie for a few moments.While ""The Polar Express"" has its hang ups, it can and should be considered the first Christmas classic of the CGI-age. It still gets re-released into theaters every Christmas, as it has a renewed following thanks to great 3D effects that are becoming increasingly popular amongst moviegoers. It also is one of the only adaptations of a children's book that adds to its source while also maintaining its heart. My guess is that many generations will return to it year after year, and it will keep ringing just like the bell in the story.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Phenomenal visuals, shame about the story...","Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie very much. It is nice to watch around Christmas time. The film respects the book of the same name, which I think is a great one. Actually it was one of my favourites, a timeless Christmas story about the power of belief, faith and hope. Back to the film, one thing that was a definite plus was the visuals. They were phenomenal, colourful and looked as though the animators had gone to extreme lengths to make it neat. The character animation was just as impressive. The music is very good, with sparkling motifs and haunting secondary themes. The end credits song is truly beautiful. Another plus was the voice cast, Tom Hanks stands out obviously. He voices five or six characters here, and he was great as always. However, the film does take a while to get going, and the script is rather simplistic. And while the visuals were outstanding, the story while respectfully true to the book(while adding characters and changing existing ones) just isn't compelling enough, and is made up of disconnected,unexplained and sometimes rushed scenes in terms of story telling. All in all, a nice Christmas film that is well worth watching chiefly for the visuals. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What an adventure!,"This is a huge emotional rollercoaster. My review is highly subjecitve and I loved this movie. It has its flaws. All the characters are not very attaching and there are a bunch of plot holes.
Animation is quite amazing. When it comes to landscapes and decors, I was amazed. However when it comes ti the details of the characters' faces, you can see the limits to the animation technologies of 2004. No reason to hold a grudge however.

The animation was amazingly detailed and very life-like. The musical numbers and side pieces (especially on the train roof) brought some very effective morality and life lessons to the superb computer animation, giving it that ""touch"" of humanity.We all need to hold a piece of the fragile innocence rekindled in this film near to our hearts and spread that unbridled, child-like joy in the simple things in life to remind us of the good we all carry within us.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical Christmas movie,"The Polar Express really brings the holiday season magic to life. Just the visuals alone are fantastic enough to make anyone feel in the Christmas mood. I love the story, it's every child's ultimate dream on Christmas Eve. The writing is good enough, I will say that it's not quite as good as some better animated movies, but it does the job. The songs are very festive and enjoyable too, almost all being sung by children aboard the train. The characters are interesting and each one different and unique in their own way. And Tom Hanks was a great pick to voice the conductor, Santa, Dad, and the homeless man. If that isn't the most roles ever given to one before..... lol. I will say that some of the middle part of the film does tend to drag a bit, but overall it is a good well constructed movie surrounding the holiday season dreams of millions of children across the globe. If you have younger children in your family then I definitely suggest watching around Christmas time. It comes on television a good bit around then anyways. It's fun, magical, and visually breathtaking. 7/10 for The Polar Express.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is one of the best animation features ever!,"The Polar Express delivered me all the way back to childhood and my own faith in Santa Claus at the age of five.

Chris Van Allsburg is to be commended for writing an excellent fantasy and Tom Hanks for conducting the wonder tour to beat them all. The special effects are just outstanding, the story line credible and heartwarming. The characters are believable and utterly charming. The children depicted are our own. I would recommend this film to any and all who love Christmas and remember what it is to believe. The experience of watching makes you a participant, breathless to see what comes next. I can hardly wait to view it on IMAX and am taking my entire family, including seven grandchildren to the Tulsa Cinemark this season. Let's hope we see more of this quality venue in months and years to come.",,Anonymous,Animation
Style Over Substance,"13 November 2004. A tribute to technology, sort of like what the 1968 New York World's Fair was like. There is a lot of dazzle and Disneyland like effects in this special effects/state of the art animation feature film. Most of the movie feels like a retro-animation harking back to the 1960s and the positive memories of childhood, the mom and pie images of our youth. The animation is again gorgeous (though threatening at the same time as to whether it will eventually replace live actors ten years from now). The dizzying spectacle, just like Disneyland rides, the audience is given an opportunity to go on a 3-D version of a two-dimension animation scene along with a one or two musical pieces right out of a Mary Poppins movie. Unlike ""The Incredibles,"" ""The Polar Express"" is more style than content, more flash than serious movie making - it is more an experience than entertainment. Tom Hank's voice is overextended and his familiar drawl creeps up in too many of his characters to feel comfortable and becomes distracting. As a conductor and hero boy are two of the best animated characters around - but as father and hobo, it's too obvious that he's the same character. An incredible Christmas treat, eye-popping candy experience, but just one more of a number of super animated feature films that are setting a new standard in animation for years to come. For one a singular moment, this is the must see family movie of Christmas, of years gone by, of magic and hope using the most up to date computer technology available.

IMAGINATIVE.,"It's imaginative. The characters have some personalities and interests. An unique take on Christmas with groundbreaking motion capture animation and an emotional story, but the animation on the humans hasn't aged well and the script is uninspired.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Should become a holiday classic,"A simple story . . . beautifully told . . . magnificently visualized.The IMAX experience was stunning.I did not expect to enjoy the story as much as I did. Simple but quite heartwarming.Although it started a bit slow, it continued to gain momentum (no train analogy intended) through its conclusion. I was not a great lover of the animation of the human characters, but the other animation, whether it be the train, the scenery, the reindeer, or the elves (are elves human?) was quite well done.Perhaps the best review I can provide is that after I watched the Polar Express, I just felt happier.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still a Perennial Favourite,"When this first came out in 2004, it was considered to be cutting edge, innovative technology but to a modern audience it looks rather plastic and artificial. What we now know as motion capture animation was then called performance capture. I remember seeing this for the first time and it was a wild ride of animation. Perhaps, because of Tom Hanks performance in multiple roles or the story of a young boy's restoration of belief in the magic of Christmas, it is still a perennial favourite, POLAR EXPRESS is still delighting audiences of all ages. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Seasonal Family Animation}",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Wonderful Experience,"I think this movie deserves a higher rating than a 6.6 on IMDb. I know its just an opinion to everyone else, but I just don't think it deserves to be ignored because ""The Polar Express"" is one of the greatest experience that I have ever seen, since when it first came out back in 2004 in IMAX 3D. My favorite part in IMAX 3D is where the train starts to go too fast, and we get this awesome experience that you are on a roller coaster ride. I felt like that I was part of that ride, and it was like ""WOW!"" Of course, I am only watching this in 2D which is fine but it will never be the same experience as what the IMAX 3D did. So, with that said, ""The Polar Express"" is about a boy who doesn't believe as he gets on a magical train known as the Polar Express as it leads up to the North Pole so he and the rest of the children are about to go see Santa Claus on Christmas Eve late at night. I don't know if the movie has a message but if it does, then I thought it is well done as we should know that seeing is believing as it for us on what we believe. The animation in this movie is spectacular, and I thought the animators did a great job on rendering these characters to make them look real. Of course, you can argue about on why Robert Zemeckis should have just shot this movie in live action instead of animating it. So, what do I know because I honestly don't know; maybe it is just for that kind of style as they are trying to make these characters to be more faithful to the book. Anyway, I thought Zemeckis does a great job on making this movie, and making this a whole lot of fun. Tom Hanks does a wonderful job to work with motion capture as he is playing each character that he is doing; it is also kind of hard on which actor or actress is voicing these characters or doing motion capture but I will leave that up to you. Nevertheless, Hanks was really good in it. The music by Alan Silvestri is very well scored, and the songs that he teamed up with Glen Ballard are pretty good too. I also don't mind if the filmmakers had to add new scenes that have nothing to do with the book, because folks, the book is short so that is probably why they had to expand the book into a movie that is over an hour an a half long. I was fine with it, and have nothing to complain about. So, enough talking about who or what is having problems with this movie, I just thought ""The Polar Express"" is a wonderful experience and would love if this was brought back into theaters, as well as showing it in IMAX 3D. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Best Christmas movie ever made,"It was astonishing to read the lead in review. The complaint laid forth by the critic that the director's view of the North Pole and Santa's workshop did not reflect his, too bad. Maybe the critic could do better but it's doubtful. As for the line that the Elven town looked like something out of a German city, so what? Didn't many of the concepts of Christmas begin in Germany? My family (two seniors, a twenty year old father, his 3, almost 4, year old son) loved it. The colors were brilliant. The number of elves dancing, singing, and rushing to create an entrance for Santa was outstanding. Santa, himself, proved to be exactly as he should. Intelligent, sturdy, and kind. His reindeer, just as impressive. Forgetting the North Pole and remarking on the rest of the movie, how well done! The artwork, just great. The excitement, our grandson was out of his chair and standing while holding onto the chair-back of the row in front of us. There were scenes that could have seemed somewhat scary for a youngster, he didn't find them so. He laughed several times out loud, had his eyes glued to the screen when something serious seemed to be happening, loved the entire movie. He wants the DVD for Christmas (he will have to wait a year). He also told us that he wants to see the movie once more before Christmas. Out of the mouth of a three year old, his favorite movie.How can a critic want to re-design that? All because he didn't like the city at the North Pole.? I guess he was looking for buildings made from peppermint sticks. To each his own. As for the three adults, we too were amazed. We went for our grandson. We enjoyed it so much, we applauded (as did others in the theater). It will be easy to return for a second showing. And, the DVD, this family will be buying more than one. My summary states that this was the best Christmas story ever made (put on film, actually), we think it was more than that. It surpasses other great animated films. Once purchased in a DVD format, Toy Story will be relegated to the back shelf, even during the middle of summer.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A More Recent Christmas Classic,"On Christmas Eve, a doubting boy (Tom Hanks) boards a magical train that is headed to the North Pole and Santa Claus's home.So this is based on a book that looks beautiful and people love it, but is relatively short. How do you make such a short book into a full-length feature film? Normally, you either would not try, or you would try and fail. Somehow they tried and succeeded. Robert Zemeckis, you genius.They captured the spirit, they captured the artwork... and they made it fun and even a little bit exciting. Well played, everyone. And a special congratulations to Tom Hanks for not only producing the film, but doing several voices, as well. Wow.Not sure that putting Aerosmith in the film was necessary. In fact, you know, it was not... but oh well. And there seems to be this idea that the film has metaphorical imagery for God, Jesus and the Holy Spirit. I have my doubts about that. This was certainly not present in the book, and seems unnecessary in the film...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Complete Train Wreck,"What an abysmal piece of trash. This is nothing but a lame attempt to use Hanks as a vehicle to cash in on some new 'technology'. The film is a total dud. Dumb, boring, annoying, irritating...I mean everyone looks like a freakin' mannequin, but oh wait, they MOVE realistically. So amazing. Too bad the novelty wears off in what, the first minute?The train is filled with the most annoying bunch of kids you'll ever hear. There is absolutely NO PLOT whatsoever, just a train riding around with some stupid obstacle getting in the way every 5 minutes so they can show off more of that amazing new technology. Pad this out to 90 minutes and you have TPE. The movie is so beyond hurting, I mean we're forced to sit through singing and dancing waiters for what? So things can move on screen really fast and we can be even more stunned by those amazing visuals? Its like they just threw anything and everything out there to get this to feature length.Tom Hanks is as awful as ever. I mean the guy has zero range. Every movie he's the exact same no matter how hard he tries, even his voice as a conductor is unbelievable. I'm so glad this is flopping because its not a movie, its a pathetic attempt by Hanks and some computer geeks to milk people. Next time give us a movie instead of a showcase of your computer coding.

It Just Keeps Getting Better,"""Wow!""I found myself saying this over and over as I watched this movie on DVD went it came out just before Thanksgiving of 2005. It continually amazes me how far computer animation has come in the last decade. Each time I think I've seen the most beautiful or amazing artwork, something better - like this - comes along. I couldn't believe how good this looked on my flat-screen TV. I can't imagine how good it must appear on an expensive plasma television.The visuals are just stunning, scene after scene. The sound ain't bad, either! Those not playing this on a surround system are missing an integral part of this movie and a lot of fun. The roar of train as it comes and goes, for one example, is awesome.The story is very simple but yet entertains all the way with some very adventurous scenes. There are a couple of roller coaster-type scenes which were especially fun, and actually thrilling. Normally, 100 minutes is a bit long for me to sit through an animated film but this was filled with so many amazing sights and fun action scenes that time was no problem.The only drawback I found were the kids in the story. Most of them were not anyone you could really warm up to, except for the girl and she was so overtly politically correct it was sickening and an insult to anyone's intelligence. A black girl was NOT in the book but the typically-Liberal filmmakers not only change that character but make her the only one in the film with absolutely nothing wrong with her. She's so sweet she makes Mother Teresa sound like The Grinch. None of the kids in the film, however, were brats or annoying. The only funny kid was the nerd, of course.PC baloney aside, this was fabulous entertainment. Tom Hanks did a great job voicing over five characters and I've just simply never a better-looking film than this.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Classic Christmas Film!,"Chris Van Allsburg best selling children's book is considered by many to be classic children's literature. The film version is an animated which benefits the story further. Tom Hanks plays the narrator, producer, and the train conductor. The animation is first rate, award winning, and breathtakingly realistic as well. Of course, this is a children's story and there are some dark moments like the girl who didn't have her ticket and the main character who found it and planned to return it to her so she doesn't get kicked off the train and the ending. Of course, I am surprised that there was negative criticism. If I had children, I would love a classic film like this about the true meaning of Christmas. The act of being the giver and the receiver is what the story is about. Let's not talk about the nativity, that's for another story. If It's good enough for Chris Van Allsburg, it's good enough for me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Some Uncanny Valley,"The Polar Express is a Christmas classic. From the music to the message, this film exemplifies the spirit of the season.

Such a waste.,"I'm with the Grinches on this one.I'd never heard of the book (after my time, I'd guess), so I watched the DVD without preconceptions. Okay, maybe a positive one, since Zemekis has directed some of my favorite movies.First, the technical problem: I have high hopes for CGI characters to reach truly lifelike status on screen. Unfortunately, as Polar Express shows, the technology isn't there yet. Instead, we see characters that sometimes seem lifelike, but aren't quite. It's like Pinocchio, where we think there's a real boy there, but the face is still just wood.Then there's the story, or lack of same. A boy, at the age when one teeters on the edge between belief and disbelief, takes a magical train ride to reaffirm his belief in Santa. Good for a short picture book, but far too thin for a feature film.So what we get is mostly filler. Long, boring sequences which might have been good in themselves, but here merely seem necessary to expand the length. So we watch a ticket float through several adventures in the hope that it will land somewhere and the plot will progress.I'm not sure who this film was intended to satisfy. Old timers like me will be bored. Younger children will be terrified. (You wanna see Santa? You've gotta go through pure hell first!) Somewhere in the middle, enough people liked it to bring in the big bucks.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cinemagic,"The Polar Express is a rare exercise in pure cinemagic, where everything is dreamlike and exists in a world run on the motor of whimsy. It's a beautiful looking film, with every shot so mindbogglingly detailed and every action sequence so paralyzing in its charm and excitement. I can only imagine the everlasting impact an IMAX experience would've had on me as a longtime cinema-goer.I have major sympathy for the parents of America, who year after year, are likely subjected to the lowest common denominator of family entertainment at home and at the cinema. When rating a family film, I ask the question, ""is it fun for the kids?"" and then ask, ""is it fun for the adults?"" They pay the ticket price; don't you feel they should share the enjoyment of what is being on screen and not just hope to see something resembling the beginning of a long line of end credits? Bless the fact that Pixar films have begun to take the attention of anxious kids and parents, and at least during the Christmastime in 2004, The Polar Express lurked in theaters for weeks so that the masses could be treated to the beautiful qualities imaginative cinema had to offer.I'm positive everyone knows the story to the beloved children's book, penned in 1985. On the night of Christmas Eve, a young boy, skeptical about the idea of Santa Claus, is taken on a journey after seeing an enormous train pull up to his front yard with the train conductor (one of the five characters Tom Hanks voices in the film, not including the narrator) proudly shouting, ""all abooooooard,"" before taking the young boy and several other nearby children on the ride of their life. Their destination is obviously the North Pole, where the kids can hopefully meet Santa Claus and receive a present for their good behavior this year. During the long ride, the young boy (who remains nameless, along with most of the others on board) meets a young black girl and a young boy named Billy, and the three children wind up having the ride of their life, as they not only avoid several scenes of uncertainty, but challenge the perilous conditions brought on to them by using quick and wise judgment. Not to mention, these three kids are just absolutely lovable. You're Scrooge if the children's beautiful song at the back of the train doesn't summon a tear to your eye.The film exercises our unalienable right to imagine and dream. What kind wouldn't have wanted to take a ride on The Polar Express at age eight or nine? When I was small, my town held a little ""Polar Express"" event where children go board a train and cruise through nearby towns. It was a less than memorable experience. The singing was mild, the people weren't as fun, and the rule about hot chocolate wasn't in place because it was already broken by the time we received it.If I would've seen something like The Polar Express in IMAX theaters, say, nine years ago, I would've been delighted. The kids who appreciate the most will be between seven and ten because the film gears itself to more mature children, who are still possibly clinging to that last bit of childhood innocence that is believing in Santa Claus. This picture shows that magic continues to exist long after your beliefs are over, and paints the most lavish and awe-inspiring portrait of the holidays that I have ever seen.Director Robert Zemeckis, the laudable visionary of Back to the Future, provides us with one of cinema's many landmark, this one being for the digital age. This is the first film in history to utilize the motion-capture style of animation for the entire length. Motion-capture animation is when actors are fitted for special suits and proceed to act out the motions of their character, which will be converted to digital animation using computers. In recent times, let's take for example, Mars Needs Moms, a later picture by Zemeckis that left loads to be desired, the medium was gimmicky and unnecessary. Here, it's extremely enchanting. The inherent zombification of the human characters isn't explicitly found like in other motion-capture animation films, and it provides for nothing but smoothness in the sequences when The Polar Express flies off the train tracks and on to a bed of ice. Even the scenes with Santa's sleigh, zipping and zooming past a crowd of thousands looks beautifully enhanced thanks to this medium. This is one of the most detailed and great looking films ever made.The Polar Express is a magnificent cinematic achievement in terms of look and feel. The action sequences are brilliantly staged, offering up the feeling of placement and depth instead of giving us indistinct location shots and messy editing skills. Everything is clear, broad, and vivid, and the characters are innocent and easy to love. The film has been compared to a roller coaster ride in a derogative manner, but turning that around to fit a positive connotation, the picture gives us one of the most fun cinematic rides in recent history, visually and emotionally.Voiced by: Tom Hanks. Directed by: Robert Zemeckis.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical with some flaws,"Let me start by saying this film definitely captures the magic of the book. It has all the makings of a Christmas classic. From the story to the music to (most of) the animation, the whole film will fill you with Christmas cheer. Kids and adults alike will enjoy the movie.That being said, the film does have flaws. The character animation was done with motion capture. While this is cool and innovative technology, it doesn't quite work right. Some of the characters faces are downright creepy with weird, dead eyes. However, it's somewhat easy to ignore and just focus on the story.If you've read the book by Chris Van Allsburg, it's a very short and sweet tale with beautiful drawings. For the movie, they did have to add in some more characters and plot points. Some of the characters seemed unnecessary (e.g. The hobo, some of the other kids) or looked downright weird. There was also another kid on the train who was meant to be an obnoxious nerd with a really annoying voice. Not sure why they wanted a character like that in the movie. He gave me a headache.Overall though, this is a film meant to entertain you and instill you with Christmas spirit, and at that, it succeeds.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The eyes don't have it...,"There is a fleeting moment in THE POLAR EXPRESS where the title vehicle passes a department store with an elaborate Christmas display in the window. Everyone is excited by the sight, especially the story's protagonist, ""Hero Boy,"" until he sees the mechanical gears that reveal the display's Santa Claus to be a machine. That's the problem with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it is a splendid, wildly inventive machine, but it keeps on reminding us that it, quite literally, lacks a human face.Based on Chris Van Allsburg's slight but textured children's book, the film attempts to capture that book's subtle, albeit dark, visual tone. And for the most part the filmmakers do a stunning job. The artwork and animation, done largely with computers, is rich and detailed and often about as close to lifelike as any animation that I have ever seen. Therefore it is ironic that the remarkably high standards the film sets with most of the animation and artwork only serves to highlight the other aspects of the art that do fail so jarringly. The train, the snow, the sweeping landscapes and even the animals such as wolves and reindeer are all so incredibly meticulous in detail and movement, that it only makes the failure of the artists to replicate the human characters all the more startling and disappointing. The human beings in the story seem trapped in a limbo, being neither quite cartoon and certainly not quite human.It is strange that the animators do an outstanding job of recreating skin texture and coloring and even the various subtleties of hair, but can't quite recreate the most revealing aspect of being human, the eyes. The mouth movements are disappointing too, but it is the eyes that are, well, just plain creepy. Like the characters in Japanese anime or the sad orphans painted on black velvet, these characters have eyes that have a cold, spookiness to them. They are a mild, if unrelenting, distraction in some scenes, but they quietly spoil many of the major moments where the film strives for an emotional intimacy. It is a serious problem when you literally don't want to look a character in the eye, especially if the character is a child.The film uses a technology called ""performance capture,"" wherein an actor actually gives a three-dimensional performance which is recorded digitally by a computer, to then be manipulated into animated art. Performance capture is an extension of CGI and, as used in films like THE LORD OF THE RINGS, further blurs the line between what is animation and what is special effects. The process seems to work fairly well as far as body movement goes; the animated characters move with genuine lifelike grace that is far superior to previous attempts, such as the animated action sequences in SPIDER-MAN or THE HULK. Indeed, a dance sequence involving a band of hyperkenetic waiters is a showstopper. But the process just does not work as far as detailing facial features.Cartoon humans from Elmer Fudd to Fred Flintstone are more simplistic, yet more human than the waxworks faces in THE POLAR EXPRESS. Their cartoonishness gives them a personality that is missing from the POLAR EXPRESS characters. I suppose that as the technology progresses, the ability to create totally believable human faces will be achieved to some credible degree. But the question is why? It's like making vanilla wafers with artificial flavoring; why seek a substitute for something natural and superior.The director of THE POLAR EXPRESS is Robert Zemeckis, a clever and skilled craftsman whose work includes the brilliant WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT, a film that blends real and cartoon images wonderfully. THE POLAR EXPRESS would have been so much better had they followed the lead of ROGER RABBIT and, like SKY CAPTAIN AND THE WORLD OF TOMORROW, merged high-tech trickery with the simple honesty of the human face. Repeatedly throughout THE POLAR EXPRESS, I found myself wishing certain scenes were featuring real actors; I can't think of any other time where I thought a cartoon would be better as live action.Despite its optimistic Yuletide moral about the power of believing and its child's eye view of the world, the film really isn't a kids movie. THE POLAR EXPRESS has a Twilight Zone quality to it; not unlike the many versions of A CHR1STMAS CAROL or IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE. The film is dark, and even in its most upbeat moments the story and the storytelling are strangely subdued. Not quite brooding or grim, but far from joyful. While obviously directing the film towards children, the filmmakers don't seem to understand kids. Little things are telling, like failing to give the characters names other than generic titles, like Hero Boy, Lonely Boy, Hero Girl, Know-It-All, etc. Such a lame literary device as reducing a character to a nameless symbolic entity is lost on children; they want to know people's names. Children can't relate to nameless, faceless characters. Neither can adults for that matter. Humans have names, and for that matter so do cartoon characters.Though it is seriously flawed, THE POLAR EXPRESS is still a remarkable effort, visually stunning and ultimately even emotionally rewarding. But no amount of artistic talent can capture the simple beauty or honesty of a living child's face; it may have been folly for the filmmakers to even try.",,Anonymous,Animation
The Express,"The Polar Express is a film that establishes a key theme of Christmas even if the animation isn't the best. It revolves around belief around the Christmas season. Belief is what makes the season magical, which I feel like is a common theme in Christmas films. I could see why as it could greatly improve it in real life if everyone simply believes.I could see a complaint that the animation isn't the best. The characters look flat and emotionless at times. How humans are animated could be way better. This is a film that is entirely motion capture, so it captured realistic mannerisms of real people but the animation on top of the people could be better. It looks like it is on the uncanny spectrum.I find it an alright film. The animation could be better but it's still alright,",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

What a disappointment!,"I should preface by saying that I'm a major sucker for anything Christmasy or full of magic - Miracle on 34th Street, most Disney feature cartoons, movie musicals, that sort of thing. So I expected this to be something I would really enjoy. Boy, was I wrong!First off, the movie wandered, all but plot less. I had wondered how they'd make a full-length movie out of a book as short as The Polar Express. Now I know; they stre-t-c-h-ed out the train ride itself by coming up with event after event that stopped the train or put the protagonist in danger but didn't contribute to the overall story.Secondly, there was a serious problem in the balance of sound. The sounds of the train and the music were extremely loud - one member of my group watched half the movie with her fingers in her ears - but the conversation was so quiet that we couldn't hear most of it and couldn't understand what we did hear. When we complained to the management, we found out that the movie's sound is recorded in two different ways - train and music in DTS, dialogue in mono. Older theaters don't have the capability of adjusting one without the other, which means they're stuck with extreme balance problems like the one we encountered. If you must see this film, make sure you go to a swanky new facility!Lastly, what plot there was often proved difficult to follow. I'm twenty-two and was lost a good part of the time (who's that guy? where'd he go? why is the kid climbing on top of the train?). If adults don't get it, how can small children possibly understand what's going on?Okay, the animation was excellent. I have to give it that; I was really impressed. I also must admit that my party got up and left after about forty minutes, so maybe the movie does redeem itself, provided you're not experiencing the sound problems that we were. But even if it did get better, I'd have trouble recommending any film where I suffered through the first third of it, checking my watch every five minutes.Instant Christmas classic? You've got to be kidding.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Favorite Christmas Film,"This film obviously has flaws. A lot of people say that the faces are creepy, and though I don't think this, I get their point. The rest of the animation though is some of the best I have seen, and still holds up today marvelously.The music should be pointed out as well. It can be big and pompous, but also can warm up a quiet scene with heartwarming Christmas spirit music. It has some of my favorite Christmas music.The story is like a variation of A Christmas Carol, in which one with little faith in Christmas gets thrown into a supernatural scenario where he has a change of heart. I think it was excecuted well and leaves you feeling the quiet warmth and joy of Christmas.This film is obviously not for everyone, and if you are not a fan of this film, I can totally see why, but this film is my Christmas movie that I will gush about any season. I definetely recommend that you watch it at around 10 on Christmas Eve night. By the time the film ends the main protagonist is winding down and ready to settle in for what lies next on Christmas Day, like you would.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Bored my child to sleep,"Much like Final Fantasy, if you look at a still shot - it doesn't look so bad. But when the people start moving, it's utterly horrifying. Uneven jerky motions, frightening lack of emotion, and lack of a feel of life in the face gives me the creeps. The characters do not even appear ALIVE/organic.I saw a preview screening with my daughter, who actually fell asleep! She was not at all engaged. For the record, I thought her to be easily engaged by both Pixar-esque films as well as a number of the 'bad' 2D films like Sinbad.The lighting is painful, giving the children the appearance of holding a flashlight under their chin at a campfire. The lip syncing is bad - worse actually than Final Fantasy.I also seriously question having Hanks play five characters.... this was a major distraction throughout the film. The role of the conductor is eerie - although in a way I just can't pinpoint. It reminds me of my father's fake ""phone"" voice when greeting clients.I think this is why the multiple roles are distracting - you are accutely aware that the voice is the same, but yet distinctly different. It gives each character the feel of being ACTED, as opposed to being real human characters. The illusion of reality is broken by the multiple role playing of Hanks. I've seen the technique work - a la Eddie Murphy, but Hanks just can't come close to pulling it off with a voice alone, given the horrifying animation.I would not waste my money on this - wait for the rental.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Holiday Classic,"The Polar Express is one on my favourite Christmas book out there!!! This movie is a good take one a movie. The animation is not what you see today, probably because it was made 15 years ago. The trailer pretty much says it all. I gave it a 7 because:
1. I would watch this again.
2. Good story and characters.
3. I would recommend this movie.
Things to improve for a future Polar Express Movie:
1. Better animation.
2. Go off the book a little bit more than this movie did.
3. Make it more exiting.
Also make a live action one.Watch this movie at Christmas time.",,Anonymous,Animation
Christmas won't be the same without The Polar Express.,"'The Polar Express' is listed in the Guinness Book of Records for being the first all-digital capture film. The animation is awesome, but admittedly due to live action motion capture animation, so not entirely animated. I enjoy watching this film every year around Christmas time, as this is a real feel-good, high-spirited film. I love the characters and the storyline, and there are indeed a number of lessons to be learnt here. For most grown-ups, I suppose, the Christmas bell does not ring around Christmas time anymore, as before.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Graphical movie. That's it.,"I didn't like the movie. It doesn't really make me feel Christmasy, nor does it have fantastic animation. The 3D characters have faces emulated after the main actors, probably the movements are also made by a face mesh that translates real actor facial expressions. So, the only things that remain to be appreciated are the story and the non-character graphics.The plot is one of those ""Seems dangerous, but it's marvelous, so it's OK"" stories. The things that happen don't really make any sense and everything seems not to have any purpose at all. In the end the children do get to the North Pole, but it is nothing compared with what happened in the train. So the movie is about the journey, not the end.Maybe it's me, but I was bored throughout the movie, and so was my wife. I watched the last half by myself. The musical bits with the dances couldn't have been more out of place. So, no, it's not a good movie. Even for the children.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Too Much Materialism,"I marginally liked The Polar Express. The special effects and acting were great. Tom Hanks does a great job portraying multiple characters in this film.However, I did not like the materialistic message of this film. The film repeatedly talked about Christmas being about ""presents"". The children sing a song about ""wishing on a star"" for ""presents for the children"". They talk about presents all throughout the film. When they arrive at the North Pole, they talk about the ""first gift"" of Christmas, which is a present. And, you wonder why our society is so materialistic today.In reality, Christmas is a religious holiday celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ. Santa Claus is based on Saint Nicholas, a Catholic saint who would give gifts to people in Jesus Christ's name. The ""first gift"" of Christmas is the birth of Jesus Christ, our Lord and Savior. Too bad this film missed the true reason for the season!Again, I liked this film enough to recommend it to someone. However, the materialistic message ultimately left a bad taste in my mouth.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't understand the criticism,"I grew up on this movie and it's always been a great movie. The animation is great for an old CRT TV of the time, but it does look a little creepy on modern panels.

A non-obnoxious and sober family movie.,"I'm sick of arrogant animated movies that force us into thinking they're great even though they're classless exercises in poor taste and franchise milking. Recent examples include Finding Nemo, The Incredibles and, worst of all, Shark Tale.Dreamworks seems to be the worst among all this. Their basic logic is 'Let's see what Pixar is doing and copy that'. Come on! Pixar gave us A Bugs Life so Dreamworks gave us Antz. Pixar do Finding Nemo so Dreamworks do Shark Tale. Pixar do Monsters Inc so Dreamworks do Shrek (which turned out to be quite good). But that's beside the point. There are 2 main concerns for all studios involved in making computer animated movies. The first is to make each more realistic looking than the last. I don't care about this. I don't care how fancy the computer you made the film on is. I don't care how long you spent making it.How about some actual story or dignity? None of these films have that. Sure they have some moronical done-to-death a thousand times before messages that masquerade as a stories and can easily fool a 3 year old but the one thing they all have in common is tastelessness.The second concern is the merchandising. Where the REAL money from the movie is made! I would like to say the Polar Express is different but I dread the forthcoming Polar Express toys, books, pyjamas, monopoly set, happy meal/kids club meal, rucksack, video games, legal forms, stationary sets, airships, warheads...Christ almighty in 1987 Mel Brooks was only kidding when he mentioned the Spaceballs Flamethrower (a fave with the kids) but merchandising really is going this far. Too far.If Warner can resist this temptation with The Polar Express it will give the film an everlasting integrity that immediately ranks it higher than all the other aforementioned movies.The film itself is good, if not great. It borrows heavily from Kenji Mayizawa's Night on the Galactic Railroad in regards to the constant quietness and sense of mystery (oh and the big magical train that comes out of nowhere). My only problem is with the awkward boy the story focuses on. Yes, I know he's only a computer animation but he is extremely ugly and has an inhumanly awful, constantly blank expression.He's becoming a bit of Scrooge/Grinch. He doesn't believe in Xmas anymore and is even trying to convince his little sister of the physical impossibilities of Santa being real. As he tries to sleep Xmas Eve away a massive steam trains parks outside his house. It's the Polar Express and its final destination is Santa's Workshop.The train is filled with other kids (the reasons for them being there are never defined) and led by a wise old conductor (Tom Hanks in one of many roles) who is determined to restore the boy's faith in Xmas.Robert Zemeckis' direction is mature and well-paced. There is particular attention to the sound design and narrative that no other recent animated movie has. Sound design is not all about chucking in loads of bass, a loud score and zany sound effects as a story is not just an excuse for events in the film to happen. This is something Zemeckis understands and he floods the film with warm colors, atmospheric landscapes and sense of magic that very nearly comes together but does not fully gel.There's something missing in The Polar Express that I can't put my finger on. Even Alan Silvestri's wonderful, lively and enchanting score falls a couple of notches short of brilliance. It's one of his best but it's just missing...something. Still it's far better than any other Xmas movie for the past 10 years (Bad Santa not included).Puh-lease Warner, don't sell out this film. I don't want a Polar Express toilet seat. Let this film transcend the common stock. It's already one of those special Xmas movies that you can watch every year and I'll surely buy the DVD when it comes out. But I won't buy the toilet seat.An important animated movie for sensible grown-ups and well-behaved kids. Braindead adults and hyperactive brats can go see the Incredibles.

Perfectly enjoyable little festive fantasy with impressive animation,"A young boy goes to sleep on Christmas Eve, steady in his disbelief of Christmas and determined to prove it all a hoax this year. His vigil is interrupted though by the arrival outside his door of a massive steam driven locomotive, The Polar Express. Tentatively he boards it with the friendly but gruff conductor and finds himself in a carriage full of other children heading to the north pole. With the mystery of what awaits him at the back of his mind, the boy and his new friends get into a series of adventures on the rails.This is a family film designed to be watched at Christmas in front of a warm fire with a family including young children. Some reviews have forgotten this and have made a big deal out of the weaknesses inherent in it. The fact that the animation was so cutting edge seemed to also suggest that perhaps these weaknesses were because the majority of work was put on the computers and not the writers but personally I do not believe this is the case. Lets be honest though, the plot is a simple one where a boy goes to the north pole to meet Santa (maybe), that is essentially it. On the way there are several train-based adventures and lessons learned.It is quite fun though and I enjoyed the sense of wonder and adventure that it produced. OK I'm not going to watch it with a group of my peers on a Friday night but that is not the point. The simple story fills the running time really well with the journey structured around mini-adventures to good effect. The message is a little bit sentimental but again it comes with the territory I suppose. The animation is impressive though. I think the claims that real actors will be redundant within years is nonsense but then nobody really thinks this will happen  it is just a way to get publicity through headlines. What it does do though is shore up the wonder by producing some great sequences and shots that would not be possible without computer technology. The cast is mostly solid although this is the same as saying that Hanks is good since he does most of the voices but Gaye was pretty good as well.Overall then an enjoyable little fantasy that delivers a sense of wonder across the story and animation. OK it is probably only going to work while on the home turf of Christmas but this is what it is for and I didn't have a problem with it working just as it proposes to work.",,Anonymous,Animation
A visually enchanting holiday adventure,"""The Polar Express"" is a visually stunning animated film that captures the wonder of the holiday season. The story follows a young boy who embarks on a magical train journey to the North Pole, encountering various whimsical characters and exciting adventures along the way.The film's standout feature is its groundbreaking motion capture animation, which brings an almost lifelike quality to the characters while maintaining a dreamlike atmosphere. Tom Hanks delivers a versatile performance, lending his voice to multiple key roles and adding depth to the narrative.However, while the visuals and Hanks' performances are impressive, the film sometimes struggles with pacing and emotional engagement. The storyline, though charming, can feel a bit meandering, and some moments that aim for emotional resonance may not land as effectively as intended.Overall, ""The Polar Express"" is a delightful visual experience that captures the magic of Christmas, though it may not fully connect on an emotional level. It's a solid holiday film that can be enjoyed by families looking for a festive adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

All aboard the technical express.,"This animated feature tells the story of a young boy whose scepticism about the existence of Father Christmas is magically restored when he is whisked off to the North Pole on the titular train of the title.

Using the Performance Capture technique, the characters sit somewhere in a purgatory where half human and half animation dwells, this is unusual and as amazing as it is at times, the children often look, well, kinda creepy!

Great meaning,"Let me start off by saying that I loved the book ever since I was younger.

Of course the visuals were purely amazing and just breathtaking. That was plainly obvious. And I know that additions needed to be made so that this could be made into a movie, but some of them were unnecessary, and I was waiting for those scenes to be over so that the good parts would be shown. Then again, I knew what was going to happen. But judging as a movie, it was great overall. It is not only about Christmas, but about the things in front of us that we choose not to see.

"Yes, Virginia, a sweet Christmas movie can be sinister","This is the movie for our time: In which not Believing, even in the absence of evidence, even in the presence of evidence to the contrary, is seen as a failing, as a sign of personal limitation. A movie in which thousands of male-only elves gather Nuremberg-style in the vast brick factory town in which they are enslaved and cheeringly salute their huge radiant white master as he emerges from his palace. In which the only annoying character, the only source of even the slightest conflict or disharmony, is a big-nosed glasses-wearing wiry-haired know-it-all kid--a classic and offensive representation of The Jew. In which a character actually says, without irony, that the true spirit of Christmas is what's in your heart. It's also ridiculously badly plotted and conceived. There isn't the slightest threat at any time, there isn't even the simplest reason given for why the train has to be on time -- not even an old standard like getting the gifts to the kids to the good children on the other side of the hill. So all the chutes and ladder chases, while fun at first, and gorgeous (the runaway ticket sequence is in itself a classic, exciting piece of film-making), get screamingly boring because A: nothing bad is going to happen if the heroes fall and B: nothing good is going to happen if they succeed. The first fifteen minutes are fantastic--even kind of rapturous--because for that amount of time it works like Van Allsburg's books do: the pure wondrous delight of the images. But what follows is devoid of humor, irony, authentic wonder or compelling storytelling, and also gives us the sappiest most forgettable songs imaginable. Did the filmmakers--who have done such spectacular work on other films--fail to note that Shrek didn't go for 50's greeting card melodies--that Shrek used an oddball, relatively obscure Leonard Cohen song, sung by the ironic, out-of-the-mainstream Rufus Wainright, to back up the love montage? It says something really good about our country that Shrek, with its irreverent humor and authentic sense of wonder, is going to beat the red velvet pants off the box office of Polar Express.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"beautiful images, uneven story","""Polar Express"" is an animated film version of the beloved children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. In order to give the film a true ""storybook"" look and feel, the filmmakers used real life actors, then digitally altered them to make them appear more like animated figures to help them blend in with the backgrounds. The result is a frequently dazzling, though often strangely creepy work, depending upon the individual scene.The movie tells the tale of a boy who is just beginning to question the existence of Santa. One Christmas Eve, while he is lying awake mulling over his dilemma, a mysterious train magically appears in front of his house, carrying with it an enigmatic conductor who bids him enter. Torn between his dual impulses towards both doubt and curiosity, he ultimately hops on board, only to find it filled with other specially selected children all on their way to the North Pole.On the positive side, the film features gorgeously designed and lovingly detailed backdrops that transport the viewer to a genuinely entrancing world of imagination and fantasy. Director Robert Zemeckis and his many animators and visual effects specialists bring this world to life through a dazzling combination of rich colors and uninhibited movement. Any single frame of this film could be used in an illustrated version of the original text.The glorious visuals alone help the film to overcome the somewhat episodic nature of the storyline and the built-in repetitiveness that comes along with it. However, the movie runs into its greatest trouble with the look of the human characters. Although they are leagues ahead of the people in two-dimensional animation, there is a certain dead-eyed quality to them that is often disconcerting. Moreover, Santa's elves, creepy enough in close-up, look distressingly like a massive colony of swarming red ants when the camera pulls back. Thus, the movie ends up being at its weakest where it should be at its strongest - in conveying the innocent magic of Christmas. On the other hand, the final scenes posses a subtle tenderness that conveys the spirit of the season without becoming overly mawkish or sentimental about it. And Tom Hanks does first-rate work providing the voices for virtually all the male characters in the film.""Polar Express"" may never achieve the classic status of the best holiday films, but some of its images will make it worth re-visiting every few seasons.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

Weird,"Kind of charming but also kind of creepy as a kid's Christmas movie. Tom Hanks plays multiple characters. The motion capture animation has a really unique style to it and was the first totally mocap feature film, but the CGI also aged pretty poorly and it looks really unsettling. Some of the facial expressions look really poor like I'm watching a cutscene from a PS3 video game. It didn't really have a theme like most kid's movies do except ""believe in Santa Clause"" which I guess is cute for the holiday season but part of me feels like this is a real lousy message to be sending to children.I remember this movie from when I was a kid and I honestly don't think this holds up nearly as well as some of the other Christmas mainstays. You'll probably catch it on TV during the month of December, it's more of an atmosphere movie and I guess the best compliment I can give it is the sound is really good? It was nominated for a couple of Oscars in the sound categories. Good to put on in the background at a Christmas party.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"a little creepy in some unexpected ways, though should be a delight for kids","Maybe seeing The Polar Express would benefit from seeing it again on a big IMAX screen like Robert Zemeckis intended (it's been playing steadily the past few years in limited holiday IMAX runs with good results). But this isn't, if memory serves me, really one of his best films. It does contain that cheerful, strange holiday spirit that's associated with many seminal works (and like Christmas Carol there is a level of much needed darkness, like with the side-character the hero boy runs into on the train who looks like he's been slumming it in coal). There's even some suspense thrown in for good measure at times, like when the polar express comes into the city, but meanwhile our main kid characters are going underground and trying to find another way out to get to all the excitement up above. And it's a daunting task from Zemeckis and Hanks to pull all this off anyway, so as a technical marvel of animation and innovation it stands right alongside Who Framed Roger Rabbit as a grand achievement. But I'd be lying if I thought it wasn't just a wee bit creepy too.The motion-capture technique which makes up the spine of the picture is sometimes stilted and a little, um, just weird for me, though maybe some kids will gravitate to it more than I. The songs are also a downer, as high-flying as they get in spots (the conductors' song on the train), seeing Steven Tyler was painful in this situation, and the sappy song thrown in at one point reminded me of the lesser songs I heard in animated movies as a kid. And yet, even with the problems I had with the Polar Express, it achieves what it sets out to do with enough confidence to make it a ""treat for the family"", as the cliché goes, and may attract them even more than I or repel them even more-so. It has its moments of ingenuity, and a great chase bit on the train involving lots of ice on the tracks. That it's less than the sum of its parts isn't unimaginable either.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Magical New Holiday Classic,"""The Polar Express"" is based on the classic picture book by Chris Van Allsburg, and brought to the screen through the magic of computer animation. The movie is a huge spectacle of wondrous imagery. All this surrounds the story of a skeptical young boy who takes a Christmas Eve ride on the Polar Express, in attempt to convince himself that Santa Claus is real. Tom Hanks is the star, providing the performance of several characters, including the stoic Conductor, who plays it strict in one instance, then endearing in the next. Much has been made of the liberties taken with the original story. This is just a case of having to stretch a simple story into feature length.

A journey into the uncanny valley,"It's Christmas time and I thought it was a good idea to watch a film that's considered a Christmas classic. The Polar Express does have some of that warm Christmas feeling because of the character journeys, and the wintery setting. The story was slight so the film was about the obstacles the characters face that could prevent them from visiting the North Pole and seeing Santa.The elephant in the room was the special effects. This was made when motion capture was becoming more popular and Robert Zemeckis was becoming obsessed with the technology. He tried to push the technology by going for a photo-realistic look. Unfortunately the images are dated and the film was deep in the uncanny valley. The facial and physical movements made the film seem like it was a video game cut scene. I don't know why the film didn't use live-action characters and use special effects for the set pieces like the train crossing the frozen lake.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
What an egotistical load of crap,"What a disappointment. Couldn't they afford actual actors? This was endlessly noisy, pretentious, boring. The characters are not appealing. This must be Robert Zemeckis's ego trip. Or his Jewish revenge on Christians. This is not a Christmas classic, this is not heart-warming, this is really crummy. No amount of huge orchestration can make up for a good script. It only proves that good actors (Tom Hanks) are not good without a good script. No wonder it made no money. No wonder I got it for free.

Not For Little Children!!,"I cannot comment on the entirety of the film as about twenty minutes into it, my 5-year-old son, a train maniac bar none, said loudly into the darkness, ""I don't want to watch this!I want to go home!""The scene was the one where the boy is frantically chasing after ""Hero Girl"" and the Conductor, as she is (perhaps) about to be thrown off the train for losing her ticket.We left, after I had sat through the appalling ""Hot Chocolate"" scene, and noted the obvious pregnancy of the mother figure in the house scenes -I wonderhow that aspect figured in the original story?But I digress.Fortunately the theatre refunded our tickets, and I took my son to buy a Thomas the Tank Engine DVD.Now, mea culpa, I did read a small sign stating that there were scenes possibly frightening to children in the film, but the film is rated G, where no such warning is made, nor should there be in such a rating.The film is a bloated version of the charming,quiet book, and I am disappointed that Van Allsburg, a co-producer, allowed such mishandling in the name of Hollywood glitz and $$$.Again, I didn't get to see the rest, but given the establishing tone of what I did see, I doubt that even the ""redemption"" of the cynical boy at the end was really as wondrous as the ending in the book, where the reader can share in the ""hearing"" of the magical sleigh bells that the already stone-eared parents cannot register.I am thankful that my son wasn't taken in by all this over-hyped technological wizardry, and I hope Santa brings large lumps of coal to Zemeckis, Van Allsburg, and Hanks for this non-wondrous train wreck.",,Anonymous,Animation
"The Polar Express, despite all of its technicalities, is a whimsical bland adventure.","Claimed to be the first full digitally captured motion picture, it was one of the most expensive animated features at the time. Giving such a daring project to an experienced director like Robert Zemeckis was a wise choice. Children all board a train called 'The Polar Express' which is heading to The North Pole. During this expedition, the children soon learn and experience the magic and spirit of Christmas which will make all the non-believers change their mind. It's a pretty standard plot, but one that is utterly accessible for the younger audience. However for others, there is a substantial disconnection between the characters and story that it comes across as monotonous. Although we can all agree, the animation and bold attempt for a entire digital movie was excellent. A technically sound film. No question. Despite a few jagged mouth movements and character motions, it's surprisingly fluid for the most part. Snow falling as the train ferociously powers through ice or even a herd of caribou, it all looked realistic and with a huge budget it needed to be. A whimsical tale that is not overly jolly. It doesn't force Christmas themes constantly (until the third act), there is a hauntingly magical undertone that doesn't feel glossy. I admired that, was rather mature at times. The characters themselves, well, were dull. Considering that nearly all of them are anonymous, there is a huge disconnection that prevents us from investing into the story. Therefore, Zemeckis just uses them like puppets in order to showcase the visual effects. From one situation to another, it came across as gimmicky. This easily could've been avoided by introducing some personality within the characters. Speaking of situations, some of them felt ridiculously random in order to evoke a sense of wonder. Singing about hot chocolate, a convenient man who assists the protagonist and then disappears like snow, Steven Tyler as an elf (way too weird!?), it didn't work for me. Style over substance.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great holiday film with a good message,"A wonderful film to be recommended to all who can see beyond their on small lives and maybe still see the childhood wonder that they once had as a child. The makers chose to render the film very close to the original art work in the hardcover children's book. An interesting approach. I am stunned at the amount of comments here who really did not get the point of the film. I guess you hear the bell, or even remember what it was like at one time to hear it or you don't, but the amount of ridiculous hate reviews here on this site is ridiculous. I wonder If the times we live in have started to breed the wonder and joy of the imagination out of us all. sad. what did one person write?

"Not really a Christmas classic, but still enjoyable...","Right, I think I've watched ""The Polar Express"" twice now. So I can't really claim to say that this is a recurring Christmas movie for me. I watched it once when it was initially released back in 2004 and once again 14 years later, as my son hadn't seen it.This animated movie has a very nice and enjoyable storyline to tell and a good plot to share. I must admit that this is actually a movie that can easily be watched over and over again during the Christmas season, year after year. I just don't do so myself.The CGI animation in ""The Polar Express"" is phenomenal and it all looks very realistic, yet reminding you that it is animated CGI. And that actually really adds a layer of enjoyment to the movie.Needless to say that ""The Polar Express"" enjoys having a really good cast to do the voice acting.""The Polar Express"" is fully and wholeheartedly an animated movie that the entire family can watch and enjoy together during the Christmas season. There is something for everyone to be experienced and enjoyed here, from loveable characters to action on the roof of the train, down to cheering once the train makes it to the North Pole. Yup, definitely a movie that you should watch during the Christmas season, if you haven't already seen it.Despite it being from 2004, then ""The Polar Express"" has the timeless appeal to it. It just seems to never lose its luster and charm.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Leaves you feeling cold and sort of empty,"I watched this for the first time this week and it's a film that sticks with you in an uncomfortable sort of way. I get it that these special effects were ""cutting edge"" at the time and yet, seeing how much further the technology has come with films like the Avatar franchise, this one just has a weird, unreality to it, like they hadn't quite figured it out, leaving us to watch these characters that are animated yet soulless mannequins, like something reanimated in a Lovecraftian fiction. Faces don't seem to move right, eyes don't quite track, mouths don't seem to be completely expressive. This is truly the ""uncanny valley"" on display and you never really get used to it, like these abominations could turn at any moment, spring out of the television and chase you down the street.Adding to the creepiness is that they take these inhuman characters and put them into a frigid environment of endless snow and frozen lakes, but where strangely no one ever gets cold (except for the viewer) . Perhaps these bizarre, lifeless creations are impervious to the effects of the cold? Who knows.Probably the single most troubling part of the film to me was when the three primary characters are lost wandering around the claustrophobic North Pole city, devoid of anyone except for the eerie reverb of old Christmas music echoing through the streets. Lights in windows don't reveal a warm home of elf families eating dinner or anything but rather show only abandoned record players. What sort of nightmarish landscape is this?I will give mention to the music, as Alan Silvestri did a nice job with the score and incorporating old familiar melodies, although I was left puzzled with the primary leitmotif that sounded weirdly similar to the Buddy the Elf motif from Elf (2003) a year earlier. Listen to those first 4 notes and compare them and see if you hear it as well.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing,"I watched this movie as a kid probably 100+ times, I will never forget this movie, it is an elegant masterpiece filled with an amazing story.

I could go on and on about how ahead of its time this movie was in almost every way, the animation was absurdly well done, besides some scenes where the characters eyes look a bit lifeless, the ups of the movie are way ahead of the downs, and there are barely any downs in the first place, perfect movie 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Bit Underwhelming (Dang it!),"Well, the website hooked me...I could hardly wait to take my kids (13,11,8) to see what I was sure would be a definitive Christmas classic. But it didn't live up to my high expectations.Phenomenal Visuals....and how...But the movie was too dark in a few places, notably when the old toy's seemed to envelope the boy in the passenger car. My youngest covered his eyes at this point, and did so again during at least one of the 'roller coaster' segments to follow.The North Pole 'payoff' wasn't enough either...Santa's 'workshops' looked like industrial scenes from a Batman movie, the elves seemed like they were given a personality by someone not that familiar with Christmas, and Santa himself was a bit benign, and certainly didn't have ANY twinkle in his eye...(The fluorescent whip was a little over the top as well).Aerosmith playing at the end, and the whole sock-hop atmosphere of celebration just wasn't that fulfilling...and seemed really out of place..I dunno....I'm hoping some talented director someday takes a peek at the George Hinke artwork in the old ""IDEALS"" magazines of the '50s....and see what Jolly Old Santa Claus was 'really' like without any camp values force-fed...That being said, the theater did break into applause twice, and my youngest two indicated they really enjoyed the movie. There has been no request to see it again, like the Grinch...rather, as the Holiday season starts, they want to go see the 'Incredibles'......pity...I think this was, to a certain extent, a missed opportunity.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Creepy,"Just had to write to say that my 4-year-old daughter, who LIKES scary movies, started whimpering 20 minutes into this one and asked to go home... This is a 4 year old film buff who watches Wizard of Oz, Black Stallion, Secret of Roan Inish, Castle in the Sky, etc, all the way through without batting an eye. But this one really freaked her out.Why? It's an assault on the senses. It's as fast, vertiginous and noisy as a roller-coaster ride. The story and idea themselves are creepy- it's a peculiarly adult fantasy, not a child's -- and the fact that the characters are so realistically rendered only makes it creepier... the kids seem more like the ""not quite right"" zombie children of a Stephen King horror movie, than like book illustrations come to life. As in the first ""Final Fantasy"" movie, the illusion of life is powerful enough that it strains the suspension of disbelief that cartoons normally have, and in its place creates the uneasy feeling of not being sure *what* we are watching.. only that it's *something that was never meant to be alive* which is really disturbing and freaky. And scary, for a kid.It's a shame because obviously a lot of loving care and technical brilliance went into this very expensive movie.. but as family fare, it's a total misfire.",,Anonymous,Animation
Visually Engaging But......,"I liked the film, but I didn't love it. It is an interesting story with a real holiday message. The animation was well done. For me, I never got that sense of vulnerability among the characters. There are a lot of near misses instead of a true sense of humanity. I never felt that anyone was ever in any real danger, that this was all part of the gig. Still, the visual aspects are remarkable. The North Pole is quite a place. It appears that socialism is working well. It reminded me of May Day in the old Soviet Union. I know we aren't supposed to look at things that way, but do we have a right to wonder what the lives of these masses is like. They appear to be cut from some sort of proletarian mode, doing their things to complete the task. Do they get to experience the joys and wonders their visitors do? Anyway, the trip is delightful, the special effects are awesome, and the story is touching, thought I never knew why that little boy was so depressed. In the great Christmas epics, this character would be much more defined and not so needy (the Tiny Tim influence). This one does nothing to reveal himself other than things never go his way. It's certainly worth the trip just to see the incredible events.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

A magical ride,"The Polar Express might be trying to encourage kids to believe back in Santa Claus, yet you might even believe in the characters of Robert Zemeckis' film, such is the astonishing feat of CG animation. When a young boy stops believing in the jolly old red man, a magical train comes to visit him in the night, promising to take him, as well as several other children, to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. What then ensues is as fun a ride as any kid could hope to have, as we are treated to a whole host of action-packed sequences, which have double the effect if you are watching The Polar Express 3D. There might not be much depth or characterisation in this film, and the elves are about as annoying as anything at Christmas can be. But there is far too much magic on screen for the full 90 minutes for anyone to care.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A delightful Christmas animated picture for the whole family,"There is absolutely no doubt that Christmas is one of the most (if not the most) pleasing times of the year: a time to gather around with family and friends and share the holiday spirit. Arguably one of the best family-friendly features to adore the pleasant spirit of Christmas is this computer animated feature directed by visual storytelling prodigy Robert Zemeckis. Based on the classic 1985 children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, the film expands upon the popular source material with Robert Zemeckis adding brighter characters and expanding the story trajectory on a wider scale. Further ingredients added to the mixing bowl is eye-dazzling computer animation supplied with motion capture technology to bring the story in life. And the final product is an appealing holiday showcase that not only feel magical, it's fun. Set in the 1950s, this film follows the story briefly narrated by Tom Hanks of an unnamed young boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara) who's grown up doubting the existence of Santa Claus. At midnight over Christmas eve, the boy is awoken by the roaring sound of the train that comes to a screeching halt in front of his house. Wandering outside, the boy boards the train where he meets a fellow group of children including an unnamed girl (voiced by Nona Gaye), a self-doubtful boy named Billy (voiced by Jimmy Bennett), and an obnoxious chatter box kid (voiced by Eddie Deezen). Together, these children take the trip to the North Pole where they face self-discovery and learn about the true meaning of spirit.Very few filmmakers in Hollywood accomplish stellar visual storytelling as good as Robert Zemeckis, and this animated picture showcases Zemeckis operating in this cinematic grandeur at arguably his finest form yet. With a hefty hand, Zemeckis proficiently excels in both the visual and the narrative department. The astounding world of the Polar Express along with the North Pole is gracefully brought to life through exhilarating computer animation and stunning motion capture technology used to breath into the human characters. While the cast of Tom Hanks (who also voices the train conductor), Daryl Sabara, Nona Gaye, Jimmy Bennett, and Eddie Deezen provide slick voice work for the characters; the other half of the equation is made up by another cast including Josh Hutcherson who take the roles of the characters in motion capture performances. Combine the motion capture and the top-notch computer animation and you got a beautiful world sprung to life with compelling imagery (especially when watching in 3-D). In terms of storytelling, the movie brightly shines like gold. Following the story of a young boy as he is drawn into a world of self discovery and spirit of Christmas he never knew. The message he along with his newly found friends acquire on their adventure is believing against doubt and how the meaning of Christmas carries something more than just the question of whether or not Santa is real. The concluding result is vastly charming as much as it's deeply heartwarming. The atmosphere is no tearjeaker nor a cartoony comedic fare, but it is deeply riveting especially when you witness the character breaking out in a touching musical number. Don't expect any Pixar material however!The Polar Express is a delightful Christmas animated feature that boasts heartwarming entertainment for both children and adults alike. This film makes not just for a pleasant surprise but a fine pick for families to gather around and watch during the holiday. Looking for a sweet animated feature for the holidays? The Polar Express may be one you are looking for.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I was really looking forward to see it,"Good thing I didn't get a chance to see it in theaters, but watched it on TV for ""free"". Otherwise, it might not have been 3 stars, two of which I give for the excellent first try of realistic motion capture. No, it's true - at times I'd forget it's not a live action movie. Until they show the faces up close, that is. The third star goes for the sincere effort of making a good fantasy movie. As one of the characters put it: ""It's the thought that counts"".Now to the bad parts, one by one:1. There is hardly any plot. The whole movie is a sequence of unconnected and meaningless mishaps, which are supposed to be adventures, I guess. Take them away and you got nothing left. I couldn't shake an impression that the movie was made specifically to turn it into a theme park ride. I wonder why they didn't? Or maybe they did and I missed it? If so - lucky me.2. The real miss is that they didn't make it a live action/cartoon combo. The ""reality"" scene should have been done by live action - that's how it's supposed to be! Yes, sometimes you can break traditions, and it works, but this time it didn't.3. What is the deal with all the broken story lines? That weird hobo on the train (I do mean ON the train) - it looks like there is a damn good story about him. Who is he? Why is he the way he is, and does what he does, and thinks what he thinks? Nothing is ever explained, except for a very vague hint about ghosts, which, of course, reveals nothing interesting. I waited till the end to find out his story, but none came! We never even learn what was that present Billy was making such a big deal about. We are being teased till the end, but never find out. Why?! And what is the deal with the two main character having no names? That was the last straw.4. But the worst of all are the supposed ""messages"" of the film. I counted three: - Love Christmas more so that you can buy more presents. - Make friends so you can say ""goodbye forever"" to them. And, last but certainly not least: - You must throw away your rationality and the ability for critical thinking and succumb to a full blown delusion... for no reason, but to have a persistent auditory hallucination"".I don't think I have to explain what I think of those messages, do I?",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Seed of reality,"One of my favorites. Not for technical performance, not for travel, message, amazing Tom Hanks or magnificent train but for Santa bell.

Masterpiece is exaggeration. Nice is warm but fake. Moralistic - if it is for children. But the adults needs of it. Impressive - OK. But the taste of crumbs after its end say more. A experience ?

If I can persuade one person not to see this film...,"...my life will have been worthwhile.If you have kids who have already seen 'The Incredibles' that want to see another movie this holiday season, take them to see 'The Incredibles' again.I read the book this film was based on just before seeing it. The book is about fifteen pages long. Stretching it into a 100-minute movie was always going to involve a lot of padding.What's not to like?The CG work: all the things that are difficult to model are done badly; the hair, the fabric. The actual faces look creepy and unreal.The train: when he was plugging the film on 'Letterman', Tom Hanks made a point of mentioning that America doesn't really have trains anymore. What it does have, is rollercoasters in theme parks. This train behaves like one of those, up impossible gradients and round tight corners.And you can't steer trains: an error not seen since 'The Titfield Thunderbolt'The plot: the climax in a town square filled with red-suited elves is bearable only because the scene is nostalgically reminiscent of Mayday in Red Square in the days of the Soviet Union, an impression reinforced by the old Communist anthem played on the soundtrack (also known as 'Oh Tannenbaum').And I think I noticed about nine notes out of Cliff Richard's evergreen hit 'Summer Holiday' sneaked inappropriately in there.Oh, and yes I did see the 3D version. It didn't lift the film out of the ordinary but the special glasses did give me an awful headache.Please, if you want to give your family a special treat, take them to something else.

Kids will like it,"A young boy doesn't believe in Santa Claus at all. On Christmas Eve a huge, magical locomotive pulls in front of his house. The conductor (Tom Hanks) tells him to get on--they're going to the North Pole. It seems the train is full of kids who don't believe in Santa. Well...that's about to change.This is not a live action film. The characters look like humans (Tom Hanks has FIVE roles) and sound like them but are clearly computer-generated. In fact the whole movie is like that--EVERYTHING is computer generated. I saw it in an IMAX 3D theatre. I admit the visuals were incredible (if somewhat creepy)---but I really didn't like it.There's very little plot, no characterization and I was basically bored silly. The ""adventures"" on the express didn't impress me and there's a pointlessly long episode with three of the kids lost in Santa's town (or whatever--we're never told what it is). Tons of characters and situations are left unexplored or unexplained and it gets annoying. The waiters on the train serving hot chocolate had me going ""huh""? Also the meaning of the film (believe in Christmas) is heavy-handed even for a kids movie. They go out of their way to make you cry and choke up---I found it overly manipulative. Basically you just sit there and are bombarded by tons of visual tricks. For some people, that's enough. For me I needed more. The actors voicing the figures do pretty good except for Eddie Deezen--his voice is INCREDIBLY annoying (as is his character).So I didn't like it--I looked at my watch more than once. Still the kids in the theatre were spellbound--they sat there in silence watching the screen. So--I think kids will like it but, to be honest, I think some kids might get nightmares from this. These CGI characters look so strange. More than once I was feeling very uneasy looking at them. Adults MIGHT enjoy it. I give it a 6--and that's mostly for the visuals.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Vivid and imaginative,"The Polar Express is indeed a vivid and imaginative film created by Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis. It is a stunning adaptation of a holiday classic that will be cherished by many for years to come. This is indeed the ideal Christmas story about a young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, the boy encounters a massive locomotive known as The Polar Express, which guarantees a round-trip ride to the North Pole. The boy is reluctant at first but then decides to board the train perhaps because he is curious or perhaps because deep inside his heart there is still the belief in the unrealistic. While on board, the boy encounters a variety of characters including the appearance of a ghostly hobo, who teaches him that seeing is believing. However, the boy still has many questions which no one has the answer to except himself. Throughout the film, he goes on a journey of self-discovery and decides at the very end whether or not he still believes. The film has heart and is both touching and magnificent. Tom Hanks plays six characters in the film but does his best work as the conductor, who doesn't need proof that seeing is believing. There is also the appearance of the dead toy car, in which there are various amounts of toys that have been neglected over the years. The scene is both haunting and filled with sorrow at the same time. Yet the most touching sequence comes when the boy receives the first gift from Santa Claus towards the end of the film. The boy receives proof that some parts of life are not fantasy and learns that all of us must have faith in whatever you believe. Not only is the film powerful emotionally but it is also a visual wonder. Robert Zemeckis has used the remarkable technology of performance capture to create a world so genuine and realistic that you begin to question if the film is animated or not. It is a roller-coaster ride of adventure and Christmas spirit that never ceases to amaze. Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis have taught us to believe in the Christmas spirit with this magnificent adaptation of The Polar Express. The film will definitely go down in the annals of such Christmas classics as It's a Wonderful Life and Miracle on 34th Street.

3-D IMAX impressive,"Having seen POLAR EXPRESS only in 3-D IMAX I can't comment on the complaints about ""dead eyes"" and other technical disappointments of the 2-D version. What I can say is that as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed the tyke tale and oooh'd and ahhhh'd along with all the other kids in the audience. In 3-D, the eyes were strikingly real and expressive, right down to the nuanced squints, the mottled colors of the iris, reflections off the cornea, and apparent depth of the anterior chamber of the eye. The most notable technical achievement was the translation of subtle body movements that elevated the animation from cartoon to simulation. The application of motion-capture technology succeeded and the many producers who spent tons of money on this film should be praised rather than nitpicked to death by those expecting to see real people marching around on screen. To me, the subtleties captured in this technical tour de force are a huge advance and someday will be recognized unequivocally as such, without all the carping. On the other hand, the story could have been written better, edited more aggressively, tighter, less of the floating ticket, more about the sad poor kid in the caboose -- that is, there could have been better character and story development. They got a little too caught up in the techie tricks.

Polarizing,"Many years ago we opened a Christmas present for my daughter (now out on her own) sent from my brother and sister-in-law who lived 1500 miles away. The box contained a book, The Polar Express, and a sleigh bell. I'd never heard the story, and I remember looking at the book and the bell and wondering what they were about. I probably got more out of reading The Polar Express than my daughter did at the time. When the movie came out I made the mistake of reading reviews and put off seeing it. When I did get around to a view I was pleasantly surprised. The dark aspect critics panned to me reflected magical nights in decades past, looking out my bedroom window at snow falling in the street lamplight with that sense of awe, appreciation of beauty and security that only a child can have. While The Polar Express isn't what I would have made of the book it does have for me that dreamy sense of glory and anticipation that is the mark of childhood and what I most miss of those days.

"""Sometimes the most real things in this world are the things we can't see.""","The Polar Express is a beautiful movie based on the children's picture book of the same name. As wonderful as the paintings that occupy the book are, the movie looks just as good. The movie follows a young boy who finds out on Christmas Eve that he will be going to the North Pole to watch Santa take off on his worldwide trip to gift giving. He had doubts that he will see Santa at all, but goes on the trip and meets up with a know-it-all kid with a terribly annoying voice (voiced by Eddie Deezen) and a girl who has a song in her heart (voiced by Nona Gaye) on a train that goes directly to the North Pole. The Arctic Outback provides the backdrop for the train ride, as we see quiet forests, howling wolves, and interesting terrain that supplies most of the suspense in this movie. The most daring part of the movie comes when the train goes through a roller coaster of tracks, ending by skating across a glacier. This scene is a wonder to watch, expertly crafted by director Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future movies), though may scare a few of the young ones out there. Tom Hanks supplies the voices to six characters, including the train conductor, Santa Claus, a hobo riding on the train, and the young boy in which the story revolves. The movie was made by capturing the movements of the actors and running those movements into computers that animated the movie action. The final scenes of the movie take place in the North Pole, where the viewer will see more elves than they may ever want to admit to. The story of the movie is as simple as the book that it is based on, but is still fun to watch. Adults will like the simple story with a positive message, and kids will like the pretty scenes and the subject matter, though some of the perilous situations could scare a few kids.

Was it Bob Gale so ?I remember to have tried it month ago but then, I wasn't convinced by the dull and slow beginning. Now, pumped by Christmas spirit, I tried the whole bottle and it's worst !it's definitely not a Christmas tale but a reeducation camp: incredulous kids are abducted to accept the one and only truth. ""Learn"", ""Leader"", ""Believe"", that's what the camp warden says to them as a goodbye. During the trip, he asked for billets, make line and respect time! The pole looks like a huge factory, filled with anonymous slaves and Big bother is here to watch all naughty kids. Santa needs his crowd cheering like the best of dictator and it's the one movie about him in which he actually whips his deers!The production is sharp for nothing: the kids haven't characters and the story is just about going up and down, too slow or too fast on strange vehicles! If JK Rowling didn't stop Harry's adventures in the Hogwarts express, there a reason: nothing can indeed come out of a train trip!Now, you have been warned: If you look for true magic and poetry about Santa, prefer ""the nightmare before Christmas"" because here it's rather Satan Klauss !",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A beautiful picture that doesn't speak a thousand words.,"It has taken ten years for Chris Van Allsburg's charming picture book to make it to the big screen, but it has been worth the wait. Mostly.Robert Zemeckis has made a leap forward in animation with The Polar Express, the story of a sceptical young boy who gets on a train destined for the North Pole. Motion capture truly does capture the performances of its characters, and the human nuances that have eluded animators for so long are present here in spectacular detail. For this Zemeckis deserves an Oscar.Now let's talk plot. The Polar Express is a tiny story that can be read in ten minutes. It is numbingly obvious that Zemeckis has tried desperately to fatten up the tale with a barrage of subplots, which eventually all arc back to what is unfortunately a very weak central plot. It is certainly not a bad plot, I'm as much of a sucker for Christmas spirit stories as any five year old, but there simply is not enough of it to constitute a hundred minutes.The film chugs along at a slow pace, capturing a midnight mood by accident. The excitement is then delivered in gratuitous and all too common roller coaster sequences which would no doubt look so much better in 3D IMAX, the format that this film was made to be viewed in.In terms of characters, the little boy from the book has been turned into a sceptic in order to encourage some form of tension in the film. It is a good move, as without this, there is absolutely no drama whatsoever. Tom Hanks voices the kid, as he does almost all the male characters. To have Hanks voice the child is a mistake, as although he is good at it, the idea of the boy envisioning the conductor and Santa in the template of his father is lost, not only by this, but also through the underdevelopment of the relationship between father and son.Hero Girl (Nona Gaye) is the film's best elaboration from the original story, and her moral journey is a well developed one. The message delivered to the Lonely Boy (Peter Scolari) by the Conductor (Hanks again) on his ticket is an ambiguous one that needs further explanation if it is to be heeded by the film's younger viewers.The Polar Express is a film that will be remembered for its original and visually superb presentation. Plot, character development and pace will of course be (and in some ways, already are) overlooked when this film is labelled a classic of our time. It is wonderful that such innocent and moral driven films are still being made, but Zemecks' latest would have been so much more perfect if it had been made as a short film. There isn't enough to work with, and subplots are forced into place to fatten up the story. A beautiful painting that doesn't speak a thousand words.Rating: 3/5",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better seen in 3D,"Having seen both versions in the theater release the movie was made for the 3D IMAX experience, seeing snow flakes in the theater was incredible, the serving hot chocolate scene was better in 3D as was the train going through the caribou herd, the roller coaster effects were made for 3D. Many of the characters looked odd in the theatrical version and were fine in the 3D version. I will warn you not to put on the 3D glasses to soon. My eyes adjusted about 3/4 of the way through the movie. I wish that I had not seen the 3D movie previews in the theater. The children are stiff and do not move as children would, this is due to adults playing the children, for what ever reason. The singing of wish upon a star could have been eliminated and made the movie much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Powerful Like a Locomotive,"Ambiguity. It's not something you find too often in ""children's films"". Was the train's journey through the mountains and the snow all an epic dream? The young characters of the movie often ask themselves this question too, and I'll come to my answer at the end...By 2020's standards, the computer animations of this film may seem a bit dated. No-one goes in for this style anymore. But, it was 2004 once and Robert Zemeckis is still a bit of a visionary, despite what anyone can say. Yet, The Polar Express is beautiful. Certain shots, such as the engine twirling up the cone-shaped mountain are ingrained in my memory forever. The North Pole will always look as it does here for me; those plentiful brick buildings, shining yellow windows, miscellaneous Elves living their miscellaneous lives inside... Perhaps, the film manages to harness 2004 itself by accident.Tom Hanks voices several of the adult characters in the film, and is motion-captured for ""The Hero Boy"" too. He's great, and you can tell by the mannerisms and facial expressions that it's him. My favourite of his iterations here comes in the unsettling ""Ghost of Christmas Past"". What a cool addition to the film that was.The Polar Express is action-packed too. It's actually surprising how well each set-piece is pulled off - Roller-coaster rides down sharp slopes or drifting an entire engine down a frozen lake set to crack..! The suspense is wonderful. These scenes are more effective than any in a contemporary action flick. The movie also serves as a love-letter to railroading and locomotives in general, as Robert Zemeckis is clearly a fan. ""I've wanted to do that my whole life"" the characters say, in regards to blowing the train's whistle. The same dialogue appears in Back To The Future Part III (1990). The Express itself is an iconic, living breathing machine, and the film totally does the steam-powered beast justice.I cannot praise this movie properly if neglecting to mention Alan Silvestri's musical compositions for it. Pieces can be mysterious, exhilarating, sweeping, and, at their VERY best, haunting. I think it's his best work. Particular themes actually assist in making the film very moving. And shouldn't that be the directive of any Christmas movie? To make you smile and reminisce about that spirit from a time long gone? Santa Clause isn't real, but that isn't the point, at least not for the older audiences. The point is remembering what Christmas once felt like when you were a kid. The Polar Express succeeded in doing that for me, and by the end of it, you'll want to believe again... It's absolutely impressive, emotionally.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

One of my favourite Christmas films,"I have a small collection of Christmas movies that I can watch every year without getting bored of, and this is one of them. I love the story and the animation is just beautiful.'The Polar Express' captures the Christmas spirit as well as any Christmas film I have seen. It has a truly magical feel about it and provides endless festive adventure and excitement. The attention to detail is very impressive, so much so that it's hard to believe this film is over 10 years old.I would consider 'The Polar Express' one of my favourite Christmas movies and one that I always look forward to putting on over the festive period.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
See the 3-D version...,"An amazing film -- when you see it on an IMAX screen in 3-D.Though the film is somewhat lacking in story and not nearly as good as the book (by the same author as ""Jumanji""), there are certainly elements of the original story that are faithful to the original theme.Peter Scolari is resurrected from the 'Bosom Buddies' days of Mr. Hanks' legacy -- though the character he portrays is a dead ringer for Eric Per Sullivan from 'Malcolm in the Middle.'In the end credits Michael Jeter is the second person listed -- though he died over a year ago -- yet he had only a secondary part so listing him right after Tom Hanks was an homage to who he was; not what he contributed to the film.From very nearly the first scene in movie (at least in the 3-D version) you will be astounded.Everyone will have a favorite scene in which the special effects reign; for me it was not the train ride or the slide, it was all the elves ... how the animator could keep them all so individual yet so real.However, there is too much schmaltz and an obvious striving for a ""message"" that gets in the way.""Peter Pan"" and other films have done it better: Believe and it will happen.It has been done and said before -- in better and more entertaining ways.Not horrible -- but definitely a children's movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not meant for a movie,"I know most of the other reviews say that this movie was great, but I have to disagree.Sure, it's a good book! It was actually one of my favorites when I was verrry little. But it's just not meant for theaters. Maybe for a little half-hour short, but I don't see how they can turn a short kiddie book into a whole feature film.It is a cute movie, but I would only recommend it for really little kids. Older kids will have no interest it. Adults may have a little more interest if they watch it with their young ones. But anyone ages 7-Adult will have a snore-fest.Sorry if you disagree with me, but this is my opinion. :)",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolute flawless MASTERPIECE!! Phenomenal! 3d is AMAZING!!,"This movie gets better every year we watch it, I've heard some think its creepy.Its NOT creepy you're just not used to animation this GREAT!!

Anyway Tom Hanks is phenomenal in this already Christmas classic and the animation is incredible. We're some of the VERY lucky ones who get to watch it in lustrous, astonishing, phenomenal 3d!!! I purchased ( feel like I stole it) for a whopping 19.95 and for that measly amount of money I own a hundred million dollar MASTERPIECE that needed 100s of people spending thousands of hours to make and I can watch it anytime I want for 20 bucks!!

"Expressive,  Decorative and Dream work!!!","I am a fan of Zemeckis and have seen most of the films he made. One thing I like about him is, in every film he tries something new. Polar Express is no different!!! And the unique combination of Zemeckis and Sylvestri and Hanks takes us into a different world always.Polar Express starts as a narrative work and the adventures of Tom Hanks is portrayed in a pleasant, funny and breath-taking manner!!! Hanks has played his character in a more thoughtful manner. Seeing the film makes us a child in some scenes and we can enjoy others around as becoming the same. Though I found the background music adding flow to the movie, in some scenes it seem to lag or lead the scenes. The songs are good. The CG is no doubt the most modern thing being used.May be people with different taste may not like this film. But on the whole its worth seeing the movie.My rating is 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than expected,"*removes sunglasses and takes cool guy tooth pick out of mouth*Have you ever wondered what a midnight trip to the North Pole would look like? No? Neither have I. But that doesn't stop The Polar Express from attempting to capture that journey through the eyes of a young boy. As cool as I try to act, I have to admit that it is a pretty impressive journey. I know I'll catch heat from my friends for praising a G-rated animated Christmas movie starring Tom Hanks, but I'm man enough to give credit where it's warranted.The Polar Express is definitely geared more towards children. After all, the entire story is told from a young boy's perspective. The viewer is witnessing a dream inside his head; a dream that explores that pivotal moment in a child's life where he must choose to either close the door on part of his childhood, or to keep pretending that he believes in Santa Claus just so he can force his parents to continue to give him gifts from ""Santa Claus."" I'll never forget the fateful day when my parents closed that door of my childhood themselves, resulting in half the number of Christmas gifts in the years to come. It was a sad time, one that certainly put a damper on my 18th birthday, which was less than two months away.So unlike Johnny Betts, the kids on the polar express still have a choice. Each is on his or her own personal journey, and each has a lesson to learn.The first hour of the movie is great and moves at a very fast pace as we witness the adventures that occur as the train makes its way to the North Pole. Everything on screen is just impressive to look at - the scenery, the animation, the action, the characters. I especially liked the first-person view of the train barreling down a roller coaster-esque track. Robert Zemeckis wanted to make the movie feel like an oil painting come alive, and he succeeded. Not that I'm an expert on oil paintings and what they would look like if they were given life, but I digress.The movie does slow down for the last 20-25 minutes. Once the train trip has ended and the destination is reached, the movie starts to *ahem* lose steam. Bwahaha! But hey, prior to that, it was chugging along *snicker* at a great pace. I'm sorry. I was just trying to think of some lame puns that I'm sure plenty of movie critics are using in their reviews. I'm pretty sure I succeeded.Anyway, I could have done without the little sentimental musical number where three of the kids join together to sing about ""when Christmas comes to town."" And macho guys might start to lose interest once the children begin to learn their individual lesson. Yeah yeah, it's all sweet and good, but it's nothing original. I won't fault the filmmakers for that. A good ""moral of the story"" in a kid's movie never hurt anybody. So if you start to zone out then just pay close attention to all the fine detail, and you'll be impressed.One of the things that I found most impressive is the characterizations of the humans. The human characters benefit greatly due to a brand new system called Performance Capture. Performance Capture is a process in which the actors wear form-fitting motion capture suits, but unlike regular motion capture, Performance Capture is able to capture genuine emotions and natural expressions. Every single movement by the actor is captured, down to the flutter of an eyelid. The result is the best CG humans I've seen. The mouth movements actually look pretty good! Most CG humans look like they've got peanut butter stuck on the roof of their mouth when they talk, so this is an excellent advancement. I'm eager to watch this system develop.One of the main points in the movie, as the conductor tells the little boy, is ""it doesn't matter where the train is going. What matters is deciding to get on."" I don't know that I agree with that. What if the train is going to Detroit's inner-city? Or even worse, what if the train is actually on its way to Hell? What small child is gonna want to take that trip? If you decide to get on then you're in trouble, and you've got the conductor to thank. Quite the disturbing message, don't you think, Mr. Zemeckis? Oh well, it's all right to look past this and enjoy this visually stunning film.*puts sunglasses back on and places toothpick back in mouth*THE GISTIf you're looking for a movie you can take the entire family to, then go see The Incredibles. If you've already seen it, then The Polar Express is a very good second option. It's a little more child-oriented than The Incredibles, and the sappy moments might slightly grate the coolest of cats, but it's an entertaining movie, and at the very least you'll enjoy the visual experience.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)",,Anonymous,Animation

The New Christmas Tradition,"This is understandably a great Christmas movie for kids, but the adults may get bored with it. It does star Tom Hanks, which is a draw for the audience, and he does good voice-over work. The story is about a magical train, which does interest most children and adults alike, since most of us adore trains, especially at Christmas.The animation in the film is very nicely done, in fact, it looks very similar to the art in the book of the same name. ""The Polar Express"" is a neoclassical Christmas tradition that will join the ranks with Frosty and Rudolph sooner than we think.

Sometimes the most real things in the world are the things we can't see,"A magical train carries a doubting boy and other children to the North Pole on Christmas Eve.

However a few years ago a friend guilted me into watching it. I've watched it every year since. As for the animation, most of it is excellent. I love the train stuff. But the people are still a little mannequin-like. But, after repeated viewings I hardly notice anymore. The voice actors are all good. Hanks plays multiple roles and does quite well.

wrong message,"The movie has excellent computer animation, but it is all kind of cold. I found problems with the story. I haven't read the book, so I don't know how faithful the movie is to it, but expect that since the author co-produced the movie, it is faithful to his book. It's a secular take on Christmas aimed at kids, so it wants us to believe that the true meaning of Christmas is believing in Santa Claus, and that means giving and getting. But the kids in the movie mainly want to get. Presents. Even the short bit from the black girl giving friendship is kind of lost, and that also, while a very good thing, is not the true meaning of Christmas. That was conveyed a lot better in another secular take on Christmas, the 1938 Reginald Owen version of Charles Dickens's ""A Christmas Carol."" Sure a 3-year-old kid would love POLAR EXPRESS. It makes him believe Christmas is Santa Claus and getting presents. This movie does an excellent job of perpetuating the commercialism of Christmas, which is not the right direction for the Polar Express to go.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Hit and Some Misses,"My 7-year-old son and I were excited to see this film, having read and enjoyed the book many times.While we were both moved by the parts that were supposed to be moving, thrilled by the parts that were supposed to be thrilling, and awed by the parts that were supposed to be awesome, in the end, it missed the mark for me.I had a hard time getting past how strange and un-real the kids looked and moved. Their eyes were too big, which wasn't cute, it was just ... disturbing. And please, that whiny kid with the glasses... Maybe the director needs to LEARN that flat-out annoying characters are, well, flat-out annoying.On the other hand, the best bit in the film is the lost-ticket sequence, which brings to life my favorite illustration in the book, the two-page spread of the wolves watching the train pass in the distance. What a great choice to take one of the quietest moments in the book and use it to kick off some of the biggest thrills of the film.I'm sure it'll be a huge hit, but I doubt that I'll want to buy the DVD...Maybe we'll just read the book again.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

It doesn't matter if it's a well done movie what matters is the message behind it.I'm going to tell a few stories, many, many times I was at school, and I wonder when I would get home to watch. Once I was in the last period of class and it was PE, and it was raining a lot, and all I could think about was getting home and watching the movie with that rainy vibe. I was drinking hot chocolate under the covers watching the movie, I have always kept these memories, for some it's silly but it made a big impression on me.Again, I don't know how or why it is one of the movies that left a mark on me, but it did mark me. Some things we don't know why we like them, we just like them.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Dark and cold yes, but also vivid and exciting","Lots of people have noted that this is a ""dark"" or even ""creepy"" film, and I would like to also propose that ""cold"" should be added to the list of adjectives used to describe it, and perhaps that instead of calling it ""creepy"", ""dream-like"" or ""melancholy"" would be more apt. In any case, most of us could agree that this film is most definitely not ""cheery"". I think the underlying reason for this is that this film has an obsession with the not-exactly-Holly-Jolly theme of innocence lost--or at least, innocence in danger of being lost--and then it succeeds in its artistic expression of this theme perhaps a bit too well. This film tends to also be very heavy-handed with its metaphors.The film starts out illustrating the conflict between the main character's desire to believe in Santa Claus and the rapidly mounting real-world evidence against Santa as anything more than an alluring childhood fantasy used to market toys. And then it illustrates this some more. And some more. After maybe ten minutes of this, you feel like shouting ""OK, OK...we get it already!"" As the film progresses, the boy maintains what would seem to be an unnaturally high level of incredulity for such a young child in what most children would consider such wonderful circumstances. In fact, he appears so distracted by his struggle to overcome disbelief that he seemingly forgets to enjoy himself on what is, after all, a magic train ride to go see Santa Claus.Did I mention this film goes heavy on the metaphor? For example, if you edited out all the footage of characters attempting to snatch something precious that is either slipping, falling, or blowing away from their possession, the film would probably come out ten minutes shorter. All this footage of the losing of things and uncontrolled swirling of things in icy cold air is effective as a metaphor for the elusive nature of faith in a harsh and chaotic world for about the first minute in total. The remaining nine minutes of it are just irritating.It's not all bad, though. The cold and forbidding setting of this film is put to good use. Many parts of the train's journey though the frozen wilderness of what looks like northern Canada are exciting and beautiful in an unnerving manner as the monster steam locomotive from a hundred years ago does heavy battle with some of nature's most unforgiving elements in the frigid dead of night in the remote realms of the Arctic. This sequence includes a particularly vivid moment of the derailed train ice-dancing a crack-the-whip on a frozen lake. It's all very entertaining to watch, although some people will probably find the nearly continual, restless, full-screen motion a bit tiring to watch after a while.But what about the main character? Did he enjoy the journey to the top of the world? Uh, no. For him, the trip contains an awful lot of struggling to inch forward along (or just avoid falling off from) the top of the train as it hurtles at blinding speeds into very realistically animated heavy snowfall (yes, it'll make you squint) through desolate wilderness in temperatures and motion-induced wind-chill that would have frozen a real person solid in a minute or two. My daughter watched much of this film in my lap, insisting that I wrap my coat around her because she felt cold. I can see why.The main character periodically receives the assistance of a ghost or guardian angel, of sorts. Rather than a beautiful fairy, he's a haggard old hobo-looking type drinking swill out of an old can. I suppose this way at least the film avoids the good fairy godmother cliché, and this character does fit perfectly with the aesthetic of the rest of the film, providing a vivid blending of the realms of fantasy with a sort of real-world, Harley-Davidson grit.Santa's workshop is a surprisingly dreary affair. You would think that Christmas Eve up at Santa's complex would be like an over-sized, Christmassy version of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory, teeming with busy, cheery elves and bright colors. Instead, it looks like a cross between an inexplicably abandoned Mont St. Michel and some large-scale industrial site in Elisabeth, New Jersey. Maybe they were going for realism here, because the vast, gloomy factory spaces probably would have actually been big enough to crank out a toy or two for every child on earth. That's my punt, anyway.This is a film about the fragile and ephemeral nature of childhood innocence and the magic that such innocence makes possible during Christmas. The message it conveys comes across a bit disjointed to me, but it seems to be that, if you succeed in the struggle to maintain your innocence, you'll be a better person for it. The uphill battle this film faced was to overcome the tendency of the questions it posed regarding faith and innocence to drag the film into a conspicuously minor key. For the most part, it lost that battle, but in the process it became a film that can't be confused with any other. In addition to its uniqueness and the otherworldly beauty that often haunts this film, there is also an excellent and sensitive sound-track that reinforces its salient qualities. Whether or not you like those qualities depends on what you're in the mood for, but this might not be the film to see with the relatives to spread the ol' Juletide cheer.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A fun, wholesome, holiday film","It's so tough to review a film made for kids. I'm far enough removed from my childhood that I won't necessarily enjoy all the same movies that I would have enjoyed when I was young. Unlike the Pixar films, this is one aimed straight at the kids; there is little concern given to whether the adults enjoy themselves at the same time.The Polar Express tells the story of a boy who is struggling to retain his belief in Santa Clause. On Christmas Eve, a train shows up at his house on its way to the North Pole. The young boy lets his curiosity get the best of him and he boards the bus hoping to meet Santa Clause and regain his belief in all things magical. The film is based on the children's book of the same name.First of all, isn't it dangerous to lead kids to believe it's OK to get onto a train with strangers? I don't care how much the engineer looks like Tom Hanks, or which Pole is the final destination, or which mythical being the child hopes to meet. We preach to kids that they shouldn't talk to strangers, and here is Robert Zemeckis reprogramming our children. Obviously I doubt this movie will really encourage kids to hop onto trains with strangers, but it was fun to mention.The animation here is a mixed bag. At times it is frighteningly real, while at other times it is frighteningly creepy. The environments and animals are all stunning. The human characters are much harder to animate in a lifelike manner. A few of the kids look quite real and the emotion they are able to show through simple facial expressions is very impressive. That said, a couple of the kids are downright scary looking. As they would speak, half of me would listen to what they were saying as the other half waited for their head to spin around 360 degrees. Overall, the art definitely doesn't distract; there are far more jaw dropping moments than there are concerns over characters looking scary and stiff.Director Robert Zemeckis has made a career out of opening our imaginations and reintroducing us to our inner children. He is the creative mind behind Back to the future, Roger Rabbit, and even Forest Gump. This film will feel right at home on his resume. The vivid world he creates in The Polar Express is a pleasure to explore. The train ride in particular is often spectacular as it takes us through mountains and over cliffs at an often breakneck pace. The North Pole is also a fun locale that kids are sure to love. I always enjoy movies by Robert Zemeckis (with a few exceptions) because they are original and imaginative.Tom Hanks is good as nearly every male voice in the film. The rest of the voice talent does a fine job, never detracting from what's going on. The problem I have with the movie is that the story isn't complex enough to warrant 110 minutes of my time. Much of the film is spent on the train encountering various obstacles that could keep the train from being on time. There are quite a few sequences that felt thrown in simply to extend the runtime of the film. These sequences are validated by the conductor's obsession with being on time. Everything seems to go wrong on the train and the audience is supposed to worry that time is running short. As it turns out, time at the North Pole is much different than time elsewhere. The train arrives 5 minutes before midnight, but the next hour of elapsed film time happens without a single minute ticking away. In fact, a big deal is made of how the time at the North Pole stopped until everyone arrived safely for Santa's appearance. If this is how time works at the magical North Pole, then why was the train in such a hurry? I'll tell you why  we needed an extra 40 minutes of filler to reach a nice theatrical runtime. Most kids probably won't mind the delays, but the adults in the audience will be wondering what Zemeckis is waiting for.In the film, those who believe in Santa are able to hear sleigh bells while those who have lost their belief somewhere along the way can not hear the bells. I think that those who are able to hear the bells will have a great time with The Polar Express. Other, more cynical moviegoers may find that the film drags a bit at times.

This movie is a Christmas gift,"""The Polar Express"" is a magical and distinguish animated film directed by the great Robert Zemeckis.This is a different kind of animated movie because it looks almost real (mostly the characters and the sceneries). No wonder it looks so realistic because, after all, it is entirely live action using performance capture technology. As a consequence, the graphics are amazing and the movie is technically admirable. Plus, the visuals/sceneries/backgrounds are terrific, the special effects are amazing, the magic is naturally present, the Christmas carols are nice and catchy and the movie has lots of adventure, strong emotions and suspense. A formidable combination of loud sounds is another quality. Definitely approved.""The Polar Express"" is also a remarkable film for Tom Hanks's career. He plays 5 different roles in this movie (the Hero Boy, the conductor, the Hobo, Santa Claus and the Hero Boy's father). By the way, the conductor really looks like Tom Hanks, except that the conductor has a mustache and is bald. Anyway, as I was saying, if it's already admirable to see an actor playing 5 roles, even more incredible is when that actor is Tom Hanks. Usually I find Tom Hanks a weak actor, but he is very good here.This is, without a doubt, one of the finest Christmas's films ever made. Has everything to become a classic. Remember when we all used to believe in Christmas's magic and in Jolly Old Saint Nicholas? This movie brings us back this special Christmas spirit and some of the best memories from childhood. It even makes us want to believe again and hear the soft sound of the silver bell.A curious and original detail about this motion picture it that most of the characters's names aren't mentioned, except for Billy and Sarah. I'd like to talk a bit about the characters.First of all, the Hero Boy. He wants to believe in Christmas's magic and it's admirable how he ends up believing in Santa and all of the Christmas's magic. He is a nice and interesting character.The Hero Girl also adds a lot to this movie. Not only is she a sweet character, but above all things she befriends with the Hero Boy and Billy, helping them to restore their faith on Christmas.Billy is a gloomy and shy little boy who believes that he is «the little boy that Santa Claus forgot» and he has serious difficulties to trust on Christmas's magic at first... but the Hero Girl and the Hero Boy help him through this journey.""Know-it-all"" is the typical intellectual boy. He is wise, smart and intelligent, but nerdy, funny, very talkative (he speaks very quickly too), impatient and he can be a little boring at times. But even this character changes his attitudes. By the end, he becomes more calm, patient and ""humble"".The Conductor has amazing talents with the tickets. He writes words on them without even looking at them. Simply amazing!The Hobo is a mysterious and enigmatic character. He does have a great sense of humor and he is also one of the heroes in this Christmas's tale.""The Polar Express"" isn't an absolutely perfect film. Its negative side (from my point of view) includes the two engineers who happen to be ridiculous characters. Besides, I don't see what's the point of that Aerosmith's song and Steven Tyler's presence in a Christmas story (at least it's only for a brief moment). The Santa Claus looks okay, but a little... artificial? Could be a little better. But, overall, this is a wonderful movie. It's the movie of the year 2004.This should definitely be on Top 250.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"See It In 3-D, if You Can","I'm lucky enough to live in Colorado Springs, which has one of the few 3-D IMAX Theaters. Be that as it may, I hardly ever attend a film there because it's like $3 more than the regular matinée ticket price ($5.25). But I went with my family to see this yesterday and I'm glad this is where I saw The Polar Express.The Polar Express isn't necessarily a good movie. It shows how difficult it is to adapt something like a 32-paged picture book into a 100 minute movie. There are some pointless adventures on top of the train, with a ticket, and on some ice. Then within the workshops of the elves (I wish that more people would make elves tall, like the ones Tolkien brought to life in his novels). On top of that, there is a rather annoying musical number with, get this, Tom Hanks singing. And then, at the end, the film falls victim to its own sentimentality. It gets to be TOO sentimental, unlike the book, where the whole mood fit right in.And because of this, I don't think this would have been that great of a movie in 2-D on the regular screens. But in 3-D, Zemeckis's visuals pop out at you. You can catch try to catch the snow, stop the train, slap the Hero Boy in the face, or shake Tom Hanks's hand (my brother tried to do all of these). This is what made the movie cool to me.So, if you ever get the chance, see it in 3-D at an IMAX theater. But be warned, the lines will be HUGE. At the ticket booth, nearly all the IMAX shows were sold out while there seemed to be a lot of room in the normal theaters. Get there early and bring a book to read.In fact, if you're taking little kids like your children or siblings, why don't you take the BOOK itself and read it to them before going to the movie?Again, I'm glad my city has one of these theaters. Oh, one more thing. At least at our IMAX we didn't get those annoying blue and red glasses that came with Spy Kids 3-D. You get those nice black ones, so you can see all the colors the same, but the images still stick out at you. You know, the kind they have at DisneyWorld.For this film, I would give it 2/4 if I had seen it in normal theaters. But since I got THE IMAX EXPERIENCE, I'll give it 3/4.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

That movie where Tom Hanks is half the cast with creepy animation and children being kidnapped from their homes,"It's a decently charming spectacle, largely led by Hanks, who voices pretty much every important secondary character- and although it seems a bit too drawn out and lost its impact a bit in age, its message still stands strong. There are quite a few problems I have with this film, the biggest is the pacing. I feel like the film could have been like 45 minutes shorter, maybe serving as a christmas special rather than a full length movie. It's because of this it feels so drawn out, with so much unnecessary filler taking up the runtime. Also, the animation hasn't aged very well, the motion capture CGI- its just so creepy-looking and unsettling- it takes away from the magic of the film. That being said, I do like a lot of the visuals throughout, the train, the snow, the ice, Santa's village- even though the elves look like characters in Sonic '06. I also really enjoy Tom Hanks in all the roles he plays. I don't entirely understand the purpose of many of the characters, but I mean it wasn't an awful ride. Some moments throughout, when on top of the train and such, make me a bit motion sick to watch, so that wasn't obviously any fun- and I feel they shouldn't have tried to be so realistic with every single thing that happened- as unrealistic as it was. However, its ending is sweet, and its message is incredibly heartfelt. It's about belief and even despite all of its flaws, the magic still remains present in this tender little animated flick. In the end, The Polar Express could have been shorter, but it was enjoyable, and it made me smile.

This movie sucks.,"The script is subpar, as you will see in the many awkward silences between the stilted dialogue. It goes to great lengths to impress you, and this movie wastes no opportunity to bombard viewers with that pretentious score. It got old very quick. The most defining trait of classic animated movies, though, is the memorability of its characters. The drones in this movies, though carefully placed into predictable archetypes, are not charismatic in the least. Tom Hank's character is the only one that comes close, and he wasn't even that good. Santa wasn't warm and cuddly, he was a big freaky looking guy. The songs were both of the made-for-TV quality, namely the first one, which was probably played so fast so viewers wouldn't realize how bad it was. The second was empty fluff recycled from countless Christmas films.And ""believe"" has got to be the most overused word in movies, period.Don't waste your money. The little kids I was with didn't even seem to enjoy it. Go see ""The Incredibles"" instead.",,Anonymous,Animation
New Animation Technology Overshadows Story,"How do you adapt a 15 page children's book into a two-hour movie? You are going to have to stretch some parts and take liberties at others. The problem with adapting such a beloved book is that some people may have problems with liberties such as adding characters and dance sequences. With The Polar Express, Robert Zemecks and Tom Hanks, a dream team of sorts, do just this. Maybe their intention had nothing to do with bringing this magical book to life but was more about breaking boundaries with new animation. Because of this, they found it easier to add what they liked here and there because, after all, it's not hard to add anything from a shadow to a person with the new technology they employed for the film.The book tells the tale of a boy who has lost his Christmas spirit. On Christmas Eve, he boards the Polar Express when it pulls in front of his house. The train takes its passengers (all children) to the North Pole for the first gift of Christmas to be given by Santa to a lucky one of them. The film stays true to each of these aspects, but if it were to have only this, the film would be over in thirty minutes. So, a couple of side characters are invented. There is young black girl, a know-it-all boy, a boy who won't sit with the others, and hobo who is as mysterious as the Christmas spirit. Some of their adventures are cute and add to the story. There is a wonderful scene where the main character climbs on top of the train and meets the hobo. Of course, there are other parts that could have been revised. When the train skids across ice, the two main characters have to stop the train and even though the girl has been told which is the brake, they second guess things for a while culminating in a cringe-worthy gesture by the little girl; she quickly gives up and buries her face in her hands.The animation has been what's driven the buzz for The Polar Express. It's the latest form of motion capture, first used for Gullom in The Lord Of The Rings. The performance by Tom Hanks as the conductor (or one of his other six roles) is done by Hanks himself and then, using CGI, is animated and blended with the completely computer generated background. It is because of this that Hanks is capable of playing more than one character. There are many moments where he is the only actor in the scene although there are many characters. Some of his performances are recognizably him, such as the conductor or the hobo to a lesser extent. Others show the magic behind Hanks and the technology. He plays the main character without a trace of himself.There are down sides to the animation too. The people have an unnatural air about them. Perhaps it's the eyes, which are the only part of a performance that cannot be captured by the motion capture system. The eye is often the entirety of a performance in some scenes and is also often said to be a window to the soul. Without ""souls"" the characters are lifeless. Although the images from the movie are able to sometimes almost able to mirror those from the book, the effect it has on the people is still problematic. ***/*****",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
too scary for young children,"I took my kids to see this as a xmas eve treat.They are 4 years old and had to leave the cinema after half an hour.This is a film that should be rated PG because the first half hour is very fighting for younger children,especially the tramp on top of the train.Hanks plays many roles very well and the animation is very good but the whole start of the film is very dark hearted and gives the film a very bleak beginning. I am sure the end of the film is very suitable,happy and bright but my children did not make it that far with out being terrified. This film was rated very badly by the BBFC and there was no warning about scary scenes or performances. I would recommend it only for children over 6 or 7",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
First time watching,"I can't believe it's taken me 20 years to watch this movie, most importantly, I can't believe it's been 20 years since it came out! I found this movie to be super cute and bringing some if the best part about Christmas out. Honestly it doesn't seem outdated, sure the art and expressions are not top notch but the voice acting is top notch mixed with a great screen writing. Tom hanks with 7 roles in this movie was surprising because he made each character feel different. The characters in this movie felt easy to connect with and were all charming in there own way. This might be a movie i know will rewatch every Christmas, so hopefully I still feel the same way about it next year.I watched on Disney + on 12/8/24.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Spirit of Christmas in High Technology,"Tom Hanks rarely chooses a bad movie project to undertake, and the Polar Express is no exception. Motion capture is a developed technology that is presently being implemented into the cinema world. Those who have read the book will certainly enjoy this work of visual art. Of course there are some differences, the most obvious being the length of the feature, but the movie remains entertaining. One of the few shortcomings of the film occurs once the Polar Express arrives in North Pole City. At this point the film comes to a bit of a halt. Some scenes were pointless also, but adds for entertainment value nonetheless. Hanks plays numerous characters and fits well into all of them, this clearly demonstrates how flexible and ambitious of an actor he is. The movie takes place over the course of one night. The Polar Express takes children to the north pole who have questioned or lost some faith in Santa Clause. The journey to the destination is spectacular, with jaw dropping special effects. The movie is dark, however it does add to the mysteries surrounding the true meaning of Christmas. This film has reminded me and I'm sure as well as others, how fun it was to believe.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Where is Rudolph?,"Having watched this wonderful Christmas film at least a dozen times over the past years, with our children and now with our grandchildren, I have almost nothing but good things to say about it.

The Polar Express,"A young man is all excited as he heads to bed on Christmas eve. His sleep is disturbed though, when his house starts to shake. He bounds to the window whereupon he sees the arrival of a great train, one he quickly discovers is heading on to the North Pole. Safely aboard he encounters other children and adventure beckons as they learn that one child will get to meet Santa Claus himself before he embarks on his global deliveries! I didn't love this film. I found the rather sharp, linear, facial animations a bit too sterile and there is way too much chatter with not enough going on. I can play chase the ticket once, but after a while that became little better than a clunky conduit for the rather episodic nature of the narrative. I'm sure that technically it is a masterpiece of CGI and human interaction, but somehow it all just left me feeling that the cheesy sentiment overwhelmed it with it's messages of teamwork and the Christmas spirit well and truly over-egged. Alan Silvestri has provided a nice score, and when the animation scenes focus on the actual train then it does liven up a bit, but sorry - for the most part I wasn't sold.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Some Parts Work While Others Don't,"The Polar Express has the difficult task of trying to take a book that's no longer than about twenty pages and turning it into a feature length film. For the most part some of the stuff they added, like the extra characters and settings, work but there are still some things that feel unnecessary.The story is on Christmas Eve a young boy hears a noise outside his house and goes outside to see a train named ""The Polar Express"" has just rolled up to his house. He's invited by its strange yet friendly conductor to come with them to the North Pole where Santa will choose a kid to give the first gift of Christmas to. On the trip the boy befriends a girl who has trouble leading others and a younger boy who is incredibly shy. He also encounters a strange Hobo who lives atop the train who turns out to be a ghost. The boy, who remains nameless throughout the film, must learn to believe in things that seem impossible while their journey takes place and even gets a special gift because of it.Some of the things that work for Polar Express are the characters which are all pretty fun and the settings which are gorgeous. However the film isn't without its problems. One major complaint some might have is the animation itself. A common criticism is that the characters all have blank emotionless eyes which personally I never thought. I will say the way they animated the Elves is pretty uncanny though. There's also the strange choice of having Tom Hanks perform and voice several characters, like the Conductor, the Hobo and even Santa himself. They look a little different from each other but you can tell it's the same person even with slight voice difference. There's also the sometimes jarring adding of some scenarios to lengthen the film. There's a scene where they have to move caribou from the train tracks that seems to add nothing and a scene which explores Santa's workshop which is creative but after they rejoin the crowd it's never really brought up again and there's nothing really new that we haven't seen from other films that have portrayed the workshop.But the film is enjoyable nevertheless. It's not the best Christmas film but it gives you a warm feeling by the end that every good holiday flick should provide. And that song at the end credits to me is one of the best representations of Christmas in any film.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"like being tortured, slowly.","If you're wondering why an adult was watching this, don't ask.Watching this film was like having your fingernails removed, it was bland, uninteresting and horribly boring. I think if I saw this when I was a child I'd be bored half to death, you can wail on about the ""massive CG"" all you like but the question remains; with the amount of motion-capture here why didn't they just make a damn live action movie and be done with it?

The ghost of Christmas pasteurized,"I will no doubt be accused of being a Scrooge, but I'm afraid that, for me, ""The Polar Express"" was no more than a snow job. Far from arousing my Christmas spirit, the film merely reminded me how much the holiday has been over-sentimentalized and over-commercialized.The instrumental and song score alone was enough to have me muttering ""Bah, humbug!"" The music was so in your face that I could almost see the orchestra, especially the string section. It was bad enough having to endure Tom Hanks as the train conductor, without having to contend with the orchestra conductor into the bargain. And then there were all those snippets of classic Christmas carols, both as snatches of the instrumental score and as voiced by Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and the Andrews sisters. They may not have been roasting on an open fire, but they were chestnuts indeed.If I had to sum up ""The Polar Express"" in one word, it would be ""annoying"". Instead of telling a story from beginning to end, it seems to go off in all directions, or at least constantly off on a tangent. The stage business of the train ticket carried hither and thither by the winter wind seems suspiciously like an excuse for the animators to show us how very clever they are (""Look, Ma, no hands!""). I was most definitely NOT impressed by the human figures. To my eye, they looked like nothing so much as wax dummies from Madame Tussaud's, and they moved jerkily as well. I might as well as have been watching the string puppets in ""Team America: World Police"".There was, to be honest, only one moment when ""The Polar Express"" evoked any real emotion in this reviewer's breast, and that came almost at the very end, when the train conductor punches the children's tickets with a special message for each one.""The Polar Express"" takes a host of Christmas traditions and milks them for all their worth. But -- for this critic, at least -- the end result is as flat, warmed-over, and even sour-tasting as a glass of milk left standing overnight for a Santa who never comes.",,Anonymous,Animation
It could be a great movie,"Are human actors expendable? Are we witnessing the beginning of their replacement by animated characters no matter how much ""human"" they can look like? Why? Is it cheaper? Or does it avoid directors the trouble of directing them and having so often to deal with their whimsical behaviour? Well anyway it's indubitable that my vote of 7 for this movie could be 2 or 3 points higher if the characters where human and not mere computer made puppets. Because it has all the ingredients to be a great Christmas movie conveying everything good that's contained in Christmas spirit and message: a good and original story, beautiful images (some of them breath-taking) and a well shaped team of characters, everything totally adequated to the beauty and fantasy of the Christmas atmosphere as we all have always imagined it mainly when we were children. And don't tell me please that if the movie were made with human actors it could not have the amazing and fantastic scenes it portrays. Today computer techniques allow to combine the most audacious special effects with human acting including that of children. And no computer can replace real human acting, real human gestures and expressions. Thus this movie left me a bit disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"beautiful, but those eyes...","This film will probably become a classic, and many people will love it. There are sequences in it that truly honor the spirit of Christmas, but it would have been lovelier and more commendable had people looked at the expressions on the main characters. The children look like they're ""sleepy"" or under the influence of some harmful substance. Why did this happen?Some of the animation is truly outstanding, there is a couple of catchy new songs, and yet, the payoff is not quite what we expected it. Still, the children will enjoy it.Robert Zemeckis did an awesome job before. Is there a chance he can do what George Lucas do and go back and fix it a little bit?

Christmas Classic,"How has it been 16 years since this movie came out?I still remember seeing this movie in theaters. It was the first film I had ever seen (to my knowledge) that used the motion capture technology. I was transfixed from start to finish. It was thrilling, and yet also emotional, creating emotion with characters that don't even get names to be identified with. The music has been played every year in my house since that movie came out, and it's one I've revisited multiple times on VHS, DVD and now BluRay.It's a special movie, and it's still so well animated. It tells a very simple story about the power of believing. It's a fun movie but it doesn't skip out on the heart and soul of the source material.

Fun ride in IMAX - wouldn't necessarily want to see it again though,"""The Polar Express"" is an odd little hybrid of computer animation and live action - professional cast was assorted (including Tom Hanks, Michael Jeter and Steven Tyler), they acted out their parts with motion sensor captures recording their movements, and then did voice-overs. Hanks plays about four different characters, both visually and vocal - The Conducter, Father, The Bum, Santa Claus and five if you count the adult Hero Boy.Director Robert Zemeckis has always liked to fool around with the expansion of cinema (check out his other famous animation hybrid, the great ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit""), here he probably goes a bit too far but it's nevertheless a fun ride. As a piece of experimental cinema ""The Polar Express"" is breathtaking, as a standard Christmas animation film it's so-so - the story is very entertaining for the first 60 minutes but once they get off the train it goes on a bit too long. Animation is excellent at times, but then sometimes (particularly on the Hero Girl character) it's quite poor and unrealistic.But for the most part it is a very interesting film and a must-see if you're a daring viewer - it's different, in a good way. It's not a great movie because it has a lot of flaws but I saw it at London BFI IMAX theater and the trip was loads of fun, and a unique experience I'll remember for a long, long time.Overall, not something particularly memorable as a stand-alone film but if you're planning on seeing it, make sure you go to an IMAX - otherwise it's just an odd little film that'll entertain the kids and probably hold your interest on first viewing.3.5/5",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Cold like the Arctic,"It's cold above the Arctic Circle, even if you work for a robust, often maligned caregiver. Director Robert Zamekis ('Cast Away) and Tom Hanks ('Cast Away') join forces again to make an animation based on the illustrated Chris Van Allsburg children's book about a seven-year old boy who questions Santa's existence and travels by magical train to Toyland for the ocular proof.Although the art process of 'performance capture,' which transforms human movements into animation (used also for Gollum in 'Lord of the Rings') is revolutionary in its magic realism, the characters are wondrously almost real, a fact that leads me to question why have animation at all if stylization is not a value for animation. However, the roller coaster like rides and unusual camera points of view (one time it actually looks through a printed page with the letters suspended) satisfy my need for the representational and fantastic in animation.The movie is cold like the Arctic: There is a blatantly conservative message that Boy Hero (he is not named, presumably for universal application reasons), and by implication everyone else on the train and in the world, should 'believe': believe the fussy and punctual conductor, the hobo, the boy's parents, and even the elves, when they encourage him to accept Santa (sounds evangelical, doesn't it?) contrary to what his eyes have shown him in real life and what his growing analytical mind has determined. With the appointment of Condoleezza Rice as secretary of state, the Girl The obedience motif of 'Express' reminds me of the rationale for the Iraq war and John Kerry's claim about a 'plan for the future.'Beyond the theme, the art/set design disturbs me as well. While the express is beautifully drawn and moved--when it slides on the ice you know why animation can be superior to old-fashioned photography-Santa's village is patterned after a 19th-century German factory town, which feels cold and vacant, no matter how loud the elves or how benign Santa. This revisionist interpretation appeals to my Christmas-agnostic side while it looks more opposite the spirit of the myth than the myth allows, even if following the spirit of the book. It would be like setting 'The Wizard of Oz' (which 'Polar Express' resembles) in Cleveland.What I like about the film is that Boy Hero seems a tad skeptical even after the adventure. I also like A.A.Milnes' jaundiced view: 'I find it difficult to believe in Father Christmas. If he is the jolly old gentleman he is always said to be, why doesn't he behave as such? How is it that the presents go so often to the wrong people?'There's a rumored half billion dollars needed before the company turn a profit, given Zamekis and Hanks reputedly taking a third. With the rather bleak tone of the film going contrary to the prevailing spirit of the season and the softening needs of a war-weary world, I suggest the filmmakers turn quickly to world distribution and DVD sales. Otherwise, it can be very cold even in the warm California sun.",,Anonymous,Animation
Still could be late,"I can't understand this. Why did Robert Zemeckis uses the CGI in this film? Why is ""The Polar Express"" animated? IS NOT NECESSARY. The movie is made like a live action movie.

Finally, the animated work is terrific but it makes me feel afraid because this is the end of the real cinema, without actors and cameras or make up artists.I think that Zemeckis has wanted the perfect movie for his child but ""The Polar Express"" could be better without the animated work and it could be a true nice story about a child who DIDN'T BELIEVE",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Didn't really go anywhere fun but I'm glad I got on.,"I never knew the book of this but it feels like a paper thin book being stretched to a feature length running time.They do not invest time into a background for this. The kid's sceptical and you just need to role with that. It's the theme of the entire picture: faith. Now I like Mr C and all but I can't help but look at this like religious propaganda except it's Pere Noel instead of JC.But whatever...they're on a train and most of the action takes place there. It's impressive actually how they did manage to generate some appealing material conflict with this idea, all executed in an exhilarating fashion. A lot of this is kind of dumb as characters make highly questionable choices and astounding coincidences like why did the Kid go outside with the ticket? And how the ticket gets back to the train...it's a beautiful sequence and all but that doesn't stop it being total BS. It all comes back the theme of ""believe and you'll be rewarded; because shut-up, that's why"".Some people didn't like the look of the characters but they didn't offend me. A little dated but most of them were human enough. Tom Hanks in 5 roles is a neat gimmick but it gets old fast. He does his best but ultimately you can hear it's him and he is only one man.Ultimately this is a sequence of physically impressive set pieces contrived around a fairly contrived story that has none of the festive lyricism it thinks it has. I recommend watching it in the spring like I did.I did not like the artificial conflict with that bell toward the end. It was kind of a downer.Having said that, not going to lie, the closing gave me chills.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
hot chocolate changed my life,"I watched the polar express when I was a young lad and I loved it, but the hot chocolate song didn't really stand out. But I watched it again recently and with my new enlightenment of knowledge that comes with age I finally saw how important and amazing this song is.The song is seamlessly introduced by the conductor man asks if anyone wants refreshments. But before we get into the meat of the review I need to talk about the filmmaking at work here, each individual frame was inspected by the animators to make them the best they can be. The motion capture is groundbreaking, as they made the actors actually do flips and flops, and the choreography of this scene is truly on of the best. Believe it or not they motion captured the hot chocolate flying through the air and onto their lips. I I especially like the part where he has hot chocolate on his lips and it pans over to the lady doing the thing.And of course we cant forget about the music, this is literality, definitively, proven by science to be the best, most catchy most enjoyable song that ever has, or ever will, or ever could, exist. The tap dancing perfectly complementing the trumpets (?), and the choreography works the bestest with the song. And finally the scene ends by the waiter people cleaning up the magic table cloths and the dishes, and although it may be a little abrupt I think its the perfect ending. And the rest of the movie is good too.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Family fun Christmas film with exciting adventures.,"The animation is cool, and more cool because the images of the actors were incorporated to create the images of the characters. The effects complimented the animation well and really gave the impression of a polar world. Down to the colours and everything, the animation was well done. Perhaps though, the characters could have been given more facial expression. With the exception of Hanks, the rest of the characters didn't have their emotions portrayed very well.It was a little weird that they didn't really have names except for Billy, which makes me wonder why. A little random to name Billy when he is not even the protagonist. Also, I liked that they had a girl character portrayed as a leader. Two thumbs up for that!A fun film with lots of adventure that would keep both children and adults moderately engaged. I thought they would spend more time in the North Pole though, so was a bit disappointed to find out that the majority of the film is spent on the train.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Believe!,This movie stars a little boy that has difficulty in believing in the Christmas. Then he is confronted with issues that give him a chance to truly seek out and test these beliefs. Will he find joy in the Christmas spirit? I really think this movie is a beauty and I definitely understand why it is shown in IMAX so many times. This movie really needs to be seen in IMAX to truly get the full enjoyment. I really enjoy this film but it took me a few times to really get into it. Tom Hanks ends up playing like 10 characters throughout the film and the acting is very good. I believe that you will enjoy this film this year if you get a chance to see it.,7.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A Magical Train Ride into the Heart of Christmas, Where Wonder and Belief Collide","The Polar Express, directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a heartwarming holiday classic that follows a young boy on a magical train journey to the North Pole. Adapted from Chris Van Allsburg's children's book, the film captures the spirit of Van Allsburg's illustrations, creating an immersive experience. The film emphasizes the power of belief and the magic of Christmas, exploring themes of innocence, friendship, and the importance of holding onto childhood wonder. Tom Hanks delivers a compelling performance as the conductor and Santa Claus. The film's breathtaking animation, evocative soundtrack, and timeless message make it a cherished holiday tradition, transporting viewers to a world where the spirit of Christmas shines brightly.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Christmas equals noise,"This was considerably worse than expected. The fact that it clearly targets an American audience, up to the point where some details become difficult to understand for people who grew up with different Christmas traditions (milk and cookies as a sign that Santa hasn't been around yet, for example - I had to look that one up), is OK, obviously - maybe not as appealing to others, but I can't blame the film for that.Unfortunately, the movie fails to deliver in nearly all other fields as well. The animation is strangely lifeless. Especially kids and elves look more like robots than like kids - expensive technique doesn't automatically bring spirit into a film. An exception might be the Tom Hanks characters, but I think he just stands out because all the others are so bad. At no point was there any bond between viewer and protagonist, which is a big step towards a boring film. But there are more.The plot itself is rather thin. Two of the kids on the train don't really believe in Christmas, so they need to learn - but why is everyone else on board? Why does the train have so many cars when only one is used, when there are millions of other kids who stopped believing? What's the meaning of a train in the film anyway? Unfortunately, I know the answer to that: It's in it as an excuse for unmotivated roller-coaster rides that have no meaning for the film at all.There are a few moments when some nice messages are transported: friendship is important and Christmas is a cool time of the year. As soon as we get to these messages, though, we get loads of kitsch as well, which makes them hard to endure.The main message of the film seems to be: Christmas is a time for noisy roller-coaster rides and bright lights and for showing off your animation skills. Oh, and it is the time when Santa comes and showers you with gifts the size of yourself. For me, Christmas is a lot more than that.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Has anyone on this message board actually read the book?,"I am not typically a PC person who says ""the film spoiled the book."" However, in this case, I think this is largely true. Granted, I don't work in the film industry so maybe the $130 million effects were lost on me. Give me the $18.95 book anytime!! The simple language of a short book was spoiled by a 100-minute Hollywoodfied film. Take the page in the book describing the boy's hot cocoa. Rich imagery! However, in the film, it is turned into a major song and dance routine with less effect. The film is way too long, and the animation bizarre. The lead African-American character (a decent addition to the story in the book) looks peculiar. Braces on her teeth or no??The book is magical for all ages with the mysterious illustrations. When attending the movie, everal 5-year old kids in our group were totally freaked out, and wanted to leave. Tom Hanks and the author of the book totally sold out in, my opinion!",,Anonymous,Animation
Great family Christmas film,"A fun and exciting Christmas film but unfortunately the staggering amount of errors that can't be explained by a magic train weigh the film down for me. This movie is geared towards younger audiences and kids will love it but it unfortunately doesn't feel as magical as it should. Also the animation, as revolutionary as it was, does not hold up and feels very clunky in spots. But there are definitely plenty of bright spots and the camera work is very good by any standards. If you are just looking for some family fun on Christmas Eve look no further but don't expect a cinematic masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good and Bad at the Same Time,"I don't have a lot of reviews but I'll review this movie. I can see why audiences like and don't like this movie. I like this movie because I saw it in 3D and I like a lot of the scenery. Also, the boy believing in the end was kinda nice. I read this book about 25 years ago or so, and remember that I liked it. I can see kids liking this movie in general, regardless. But things I didn't like about this movie: 1. Most characters were flat, aside from the conductor. They didn't have a lot of uniqueness to them, and there was not a lot of character development. There was not a lot of strong character dynamics going on. And the annoying blond boy w/ the glasses, was just so over the top, he overwhelmed the main characters. A lot of the characters were creepy, like the quiet boy and the black girl. But animation is very difficult, so I can overlook some aspects of the way the characters creepily move. But even besides their movement, they were still creepy, like that quiet boy. 2. The movie had a cheeseball effect to it, like how the quiet boy and the black girl are singing that cheeseball song outside of the train, while they're looking into the night sky. I also thought Aerosmith singing in the end was out of place w/ the whole movie, and was the cheesiest of cheeseballs. 3. The elves were creepy and seemed mean. If I would have made this movie, I would have made the elves cute, jolly, and spiritedly. And I would have had one special elf pop out from the crowd that is memorable. 4. The whole movie is this journey to the north pole, but when they get there, the place is all empty and desolate, that is creepy and depressing. I would have made the place ""happening,"" w/ elves walking around, doing things, etc. 5. There are too many superfluous things about the movie, like the lost ticket, the homeless guy having coffee w/ the kid. Just things like that to stretch the movie out. But I understand this was good for 3-D reasons. 6. The movie was often creepy, like when the main character the little brown haired boy was trapped in that dark room full of puppets. 7. tom hanks playing 6 characters didn't work for me. 8. I wish santa was better looking and more jolly looking and nice looking. Well, if I made the movie I wouldn't have made it creepy, and I would have done more character development, and involvement, and get more of a plot going, and lose all the superfluous stuff, or not spend so much time on it, but still be able to get a good 3d effect. I would have made the friendships more meaningful and special, like the kids in the movie, stand by me, or something. I would have done anything to this movie to make it a good movie, whether it agreed w/ the book or not. sometimes i don't think you can literally translate a book to a movie, you can easily end up w/ a bad movie. i would definitely have not given it the cheeseball effect w/ aerosmith. well things are easier said than done, but that's what i would have done. regardless i was glad i saw this movie, and like i said, i loved the 3/d and the scenery. if u wanna see good plot, character development, script, and animation, go see the incredibles.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant! Christmas Classic,"The movie was exiting, fun, Enjoyable and magical. The characters looked really good and the film it's self also looked good. The plot was amazing it really got you into the Christmas spirit and it was like the book but even better. I really like that the people that believe in Santa Claus can only hear the bell. Some people say it's bad because of the characters and the plot but they are wrong because firstly: what's not to like a movie about a boy who get's on a magical train to the north pole, Secondly: What's wrong with the characters they are perfectly normal looking Thirdly: It's magical.

A mediocre yet enjoyable Christmas film that would have been better without the motion capture.,"Caption says it all. While the story is simple, the visual effects within the backgrounds and ""action"" scenes make up for it, along with the stellar voice acting and soundtrack. The soundtrack is probably the highlight of the film, and can give one goose bumps even by itself. Not only that, but the cinematography is incredibly well thought out and takes advantage of its animated setting while also using more traditional live action angles and techniques. The main issue as most have pointed out is that the motion capture models of all the characters look really unnerving, especially the glossy lifeless eyes. I get this was the first full length movie to completely use motion capture, but It would have been better if they had traditionally animated the film, or used real people on cgi backgrounds. Even so, The Polar Express is an enjoyable, albeit somewhat mediocre, Christmas movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

...A little Christmas sugar on an open heart...,"Tom Hanks's grip is tight and firm on this new Holiday movie, which is just as charming and sugary as Hanks himself. ""The Polar Express"" is more than a graphic movie, or simply another Hanks movie. This is a new-fangled classic holiday movie! Set to the book of the same title by Chris van Allsburg, ""The Polar Express"" sets to the theme of ""believing is seeing"", of which many previous Santa Claus movies have proved in the past, and succeeds by bringing in a child (Hero Boy) who is dangerously close to being a skeptic in the beginning of the movie when he is whisked away on the Polar Express train, a one-way to the North Pole. On the way, he makes friends with Hero Girl and Lonely Boy, and they find themselves in the scariest of situations. In his ""stunts"" in attempt to follow Hero Girl on top of the train, he comes in contact with the Hobo (voiced by Tom Hanks, with the appearance seems like a run-in between Hanks and Dick van Dyke), of whom seems to play the only role as the antagonist, pushing ""Seeing is believing"". It all works out in the end, as the trip is complete, but the adventure is never over until the little bell of Believing in the Unknown now rings in Hero Boy's ears clearly as he finds himself believing in Santa Claus, as seeing him face to face. But to be critical in some parts of the movie: the visual effects are amazing and are created to certain height. But all of the ""roller coaster"" scenes seem to take away most of the movie. Unusually, they only seem to add onto the emotions of the movie-goer and seem to share the emotional journey of Hero Boy. The golden ticket ""dance"" (very reminiscent of the feather of the Zemeckis/Hanks movie ""Forrest Gump"") seem to go on forever, and seems to be outlandish (yet all things happen for a reason)once mother nature interferes. The second critical point is the use of the score. It does seem to play much too often in the beginning, whereas there is a lot of mixed emotions, but that seems to be my only concern for the movie. Eventually towards the end, it seems that Zemeckis spreads out the emotions against the adventures. The score of ""The Polar Express"" is probably one of the most beautiful scores I have heard, which is up there with ""Chocolat"" and ""A Beautiful Mind"". Even my favorite singer was apart of the music, Josh Groban with the Ballard hit, ""Believe"". Josh Groban's voice is a perfect finish, which warms up the movie and the movie-goers' heart with ""hot chocolate"". This vote should really be a 9 1/2, but I can't find it in me to totally hate the flaws. This movie is a great edition to the holiday movie dynasty, I think the age range should be 7-adult, being the movie is very graphic and can be scary for little kids. Yet, oddly, the movie brings out the child in everyone, of which the little bell of Believing in the Unknown should be resounding in the movie-goers' ear all over again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very problematic but enjoyable,"The Polar Express has become a Christmas classic and you can vouch for that, but it's got a lot of problems, although I love the concept that this film has.The score for this film is great, but the songs are so bad. They may be annoying, but the real problem is that they don't amount to anything, they're pointless. Songs sung by characters in a film are used to convey what they want or what they are feeling, and this film does not do that whatsoever. If they wanted to have songs, they needed to make it a full blown musical with songs that have meaning. It could've worked well, but I don't think this film really needed to be a musical anyways.Around the beginning the main character goes to return the ticket that the girl left behind and ends up losing it, but it was the dumbest decision ever. Why did he do that, he could've just waited for her to return and then he wouldn't have lost it. Oh I know why, they needed some material to make a movie. They could've spent some time developing the other characters, that's what they should've done. The lonely kid says Christmas doesn't work for him, but why? It's never explained. Later he makes a dumb decision by going after a present, well he could've waited for later and not get himself in trouble. Maybe this could've been worked if it was explained why Christmas doesn't work, but nope. These decisions are not there to impact the story in anyway, they're just devices to fill in the runtime. The whole lonely kid character is pretty bad, he's just not written right. Like we don't even know anything about him and we're expected to care somewhat, but you don't because you can't.None of the characters have names, except one. That's just stupid. Three characters become good friends, but they don't even tell each other their names. The audience doesn't even know what their names. That's just stupid, how are you supposed to really care if you don't even know their names?Also I have to mention the animation. It's extremely ugly, it comes across looking like a 2000's video game. It's not really something that I can knock against the film, but it's worth mentioning.There were a bunch of minor issues, but they're not really worth mentioning.Overall, it's decent, it could've been better. It's enjoyable though. I rate The Polar Express a 7/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Graphics over content,"We own the book and the cd-rom, which is narrated by Garrison Keilor of Prarie Home Companion Fame.After reading the book and watching and listening to the cd-rom , I was expecting a truly moving emotional experience.Instead I got glorified computer game graphics, stereotypical kids and a lack of empathy with the characters.At first I thought it was knowing that that the almost lifelike ""actors"" were really only animated ,then I realized it was the overblown and contrived plot.The book and cd were both simple ,beautiful and moving.The movie was annoying,especially the nerdy character and the plot stretched to the breaking point.Every time I felt some emotion for the actors the doubter would throw cold water on the plot.Only the ending held some of the magic I expected to see.I apologize to all those who felt it was terrific,maybe it is if you haven't read the book or seen the cd version.The Snowman was everything this should have been but wasn't.",,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable,"Unlike Robert Zemeckis's subsequent Christmas-theme film, ""A Christmas Carol,"" ""The Polar Express"" relies rather more heavily on shine and dazzle than on substance to get itself across to its audience. The message is as functional and useless as ever invaded the genre: little boys and little girls must ""BELIEVE"" for Christmas to be real. Of course, in life, one would be loath to hear this sort of prescription to happily accept matters without any evidence, but, in the realm of children's holiday fantasy, the MacGuffin adequately propels its hero and his companions across an attractice world of snow-laden excitement.Accordingly, I'm sure a good bit of the appeal of watching ""Polar Express"" is lost in translation from 3-D-enabled movie theaters to thirty-inch television screens running a D.V.D. of the picture. Indeed, much of the merriment — involving high-speed roller-coasters, dizzying air-rides, and treacherous frozen lakes — obviously were conceived with 3-D technology in mind, and watching them via traditional means, one is oddly more aware of what one's missing than enthusiastic about what one is seeing.Altogether, ""The Polar Express"" does satisfactory work of filling the ever-increasing library of American Christmas cinema. It's mostly an empty candy cane with lots of glitter plastered on top, but there are much worse ways to kill an hour and a half in December.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Uneven,"I gave this a ""6"" because there were more parts of this movie that I liked than there were that I didn't like. However, sadly there was a lot that I didn't like.It is not an overly-long movie, at less than an hour and 40 minutes - however, it seemed much longer than it was mainly because of the self-indulgent action sequences that distracted from the story itself. Everything in the movie is supposed to be magic, of course. But the train barreling down roller-coaster-like tracks making wild turns was distracting in its impossibility. Plus I couldn't help thinking that despite the ""G"" rating, such frantic heart-pounding action sequences must have been frightening to many small children who watched. I would suggest that adults watch this with their small children so that they can cuddle them if the action sequences become too intense.This would have been a terrific movie if 20 or 30 minutes of extraneous frenetic action had been left on the cutting room floor.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""The Polar Express"" is a fun, magical ride into your childhood imagination","It was December 24th, 1994; I was 9 years-old. I lay awake anxiously in bed, as the waking hours of Christmas Day slowly approached. My parents were sound asleep two doors down from my bedroom. A bunch of fans we had were still on (the slow setting), but in the otherwise calm darkness, I could pretty much hear everything downstairs.Now I'm still not quite sure of it, because maybe I was dreaming or my imagination was in overdrive, but I thought I heard the fireplace door in our living room open and close, and the shuffling around of a large, heavy sack. Was that what I think it was? Could be, or could it have been my over-active imagination at its most deceitful?That's kind of the dilemma that some children face around that age, when the question of whether or not there really is a Santa Claus is open for question. I'm sure lots of children have laid anxiously awake at night in bed for some sort of sign that the jolly fat guy with a beard and a bunch of flying reindeer and presents is flying around in a sleigh out there somewhere. Some may even leave milk and cookies on Christmas Eve and be surprised to find them all gone the next morning. Santa, were you here?""The Polar Express"" stretches beyond the limits of the imagination and goes out of its dear way to prove to children that seeing is always believing. Robert Zemeckis, who directed the film, which is an adaptation of the award-winning children's book by Chris Van Allsburg, believes in the story the same way that young children do: the ideas presented match their own beliefs that there really is life at the North Pole and that Santa is always keeping a watchful eye on kids all across the globe.Even though I'm 19 now, this film reawakened my long-dormant curiosity in the subject, and I'm sure that any adult that views this movie with an open mind might feel the same. But again, the notion that there is a Santa Claus and life at the North Pole is just a childhood fantasy; I know this, and most other adults do too, but there's nothing stopping them from rekindling their youth.Still, however, this film almost brought tears to my eyes on a few occasions because it was a brilliant realization of something that I thought had been lost to me forever. This film does bring back the magic of Christmas, especially during the dark times of the 2004 world we live in today. We'd need something like this to escape into, to realize our dreams and long-forgotten fantasies about a time when innocence still ruled the world.Van Allsburg's ""The Polar Express"" is one of the best known books in children's literature, and one of the most daring in exploring a child's fantasy. In the late-night hours of Christmas Eve, Hero Boy (we never actually learn his name in the movie) lies awake in his bed, anxiously waiting for a sign - Santa Claus.And then his father says, who thinks that Hero Boy is sound asleep, ""Only an express could wake him up."" Sure enough, what at first feels like an earthquake only proves to be a massive locomotive called the ""Polar Express,"" which roars down the snowbound street where Hero Boy lives.Not believing his eyes, he ventures out into the cold night to see what's what. The Conductor (played and voiced by Tom Hanks, in just one of six roles throughout the film, including Hero Boy), ushers him on board, where he's introduced to the other children, including Hero Girl, Know-It-All, and Lonely Boy, who is the last child they pick up on their journey.From there on, it's a rough, fast-paced journey to the North Pole, a place that Hero Boy once thought only existed in his youthful imagination. Upon arrival, the quartet of children embark on a wondrous path of excitement, fun, and belief as they explore their innermost feelings about a beloved character in their dreams.Christmas is the most beloved holiday of the year, especially for children, who wait excitedly for the morning hours to see what a year of patience has brought them underneath their heavily decorated trees; I know I used to, and still do.Whether you're 90, or 9, Christmas has a magic that never goes away because that little kid in you will always be there, eagerly waiting for that sign - that special little detail that's overlooked by others but is caught in your ever-watchful attention - that maybe, the big fat guy you've always dreamed of, is out there delivering gifts to children all over the world.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This film has grown on me ...,"When I first saw The Polar Express I thought it had some good music, but not up the best Disney standards. And I thought it was a bit long. Then I really got into the bell ringing thing, and it has become one of my Christmas ""must sees."" The CD is worth buying for The Polar Express Suite alone.This film is on two levels. Is this only a Christmas eve dream, or is it reality? You can't be sure until the end. For those who no longer hear the bell, it is either a child's fantasy or silly fairy tale. For those who still hear it, it's a affirmation that there is something better out there than cold reality, which is especially hard to accept in these trying times with the pandemic.Leonard Maltin found this film worthwhile only for children. He didn't like the animation (the characters look like they are wearing dentures.) and could not see the ultimate point of the film. I guess the bell no longer rings for Leonard.

Not entertaining enough and the movie lacks a real point.,"For a Christmas movie- and a children movie in particular, this movie is really lacking in entertainment and likability.It's very simple to say why this movie is not entertaining enough. It's too artificial. Sure, the computer effects are beautiful looking and it's a really big achievement but it makes the movie also very artificial looking and therefor the movie has absolutely no magic feeling in it at all. Because of that very same reason, the characters are too shallow and the story itself is not involving or entertaining enough. I really don't understand why this movie had to be made entirely with the computer. The movie totally lacks human emotions because of this and the whole 'magical' feeling feels forced and fake.To be frank, I just don't see how this movie is much good as a children's movie. There is nothing to enjoy in this movie for the kids. There aren't really many jokes present and the characters that are in the movie are not really likable or easy to relate with for the kids. They even have no names. The story also has little entertainment value because it's not consistent enough and the events in the movie are just only highly unlikely and are not made to look believable at all. And in general, the movie is more creepy and dark looking than cheerful and happy. What an odd choice for a children Christmas movie. The movie relies too much on its 'magic' feeling...a feeling that is not present in the movie at all. Therefor ""The Polar Express"" is nothing more than a beautiful looking failure.The story is extremely simple and is told way too weak in the movie. Basically the story is one unlikely and even odd event after the other without them making an obvious connection. I'm also still puzzling what the message of this movie exactly was. I'm pretty sure of it that it's; Believe in Christmas. But it is never explained in the movie why. Other Christmas movies with these kind of messages also have a morale and explain why it's so beautiful to believe in Christmas and how it makes the world a better place. Not in this movie. The message of the movie is basically muddled in the effects and visual look of the movie. It also helps to make the movie a very forgettable one.And really, did Tom Hanks had to play basically every male character in the movie? I really like Tom Hanks as an actor but to be honest he is not good enough as a voice actor, in terms of putting diversity and character into the different characters through his voice. Every character he plays sounds the same and maybe because of that the movie also gets too distracting and for some confusing to watch.All of the characters in particular also aren't much special. Most of them are totally obsolete and some of the characters are also highly peculiar portrayed in the movie. For instance all of the elves aren't nice at all in the movie and they didn't exactly made a friendly impression on me. They were even a bit villainous. The way Santa Claus is presented in the movie is also totally wrong. In the movie they made him look like a sort of tribe leader that is treated as a king and is worshiped by all as if he is some sort of God. He is not a friendly, cuddly, cheerful guy at all in this movie.The musical score by Alan Silvestri also got highly annoying after a while. Basically it's the same 'magical' main theme being played over and over again.The motion capture techniques work out pretty good in the movie and also the animations themselves are really good looking most of the time. There also is some good action, so obviously the movie still has some good things to enjoy. It's of course far from the worst movie ever but also far from the most entertaining one. More was to be expected from a director like Robert Zemeckis, who before this gave us entertaining movies like ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and the Back to the Future trilogy.OK maybe it's because I'm European that I don't like this movie. I mean, the whole magical feeling around Christmas and the whole Christmas spirit is not really a that big thing here. So perhaps if you're American you can still appreciate some of the elements handled in the movie, although I stick to my opinion that it's still lacking in entertainment- and a real good point.A failure of a movie that is from a technical point of view is interesting and good looking.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A TRUE Christmas Classic!,"I waited a few weeks to finally see The Polar Express because of the negative reviews that I read. Yet, as always, I still wanted to judge it for myself. Someone I know said, ""If you do go see it, see it in 3D at the IMAX."" Wow, was I glad I listened. This beautifully crafted film is not only an emotional holiday gem, it is a MUST see in 3D IMAX. So many of the scenes were enhanced by seeing the 3D effects. I found myself wanting to try a catch the snowflakes on my tongue. 3 BIG HOLIDAY CHEERS to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for making us believe! Go see this film, bring a kid, ANY KID! but you will also find the kid in yourself.And yes, I do still hear the bells!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Individual moments of greatness, but suffers from a ""compromise"" between live-action and animation.","A young boy (Tom Hanks in motion capture and narration and voiced by Daryl Sabara) finds himself doubting the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve late at night, the boy is awaken by the arrival of a train through his neighborhood, the Polar Express. The Conductor (voiced and captured by Tom Hanks) offers the boy the opportunity to travel to the North Pole and after some hesitation boards the train which has other children including a Know-it-all Boy (Eddie Deezen), a girl who's a firm believer (Nona Gaye), and a lonely boy (mo-cap Peter Scolari and voiced by Jimmy Bennett) all en route to the North Pole.Based on the 1985 children's picture book by Chris Van Allsburg, the book was optioned by Tom Hanks in 1999 with Hanks intending to play both The Conductor and Santa Claus. The book's option came with the stipulation that the adaptation could not be animated. While Hanks and director Robert Zemeckis considered Live-action, Zemeckis deemed the approach to be unfeasible feeling it would be prohibitively expensive and not effectively capture the substance of the book. In order to keep the vision true, Zemeckis developed a process by which actors in mo-cap suits would be filmed in a black box stage with the rest of the movie animated around the actor. While Motion-capture had been used in films since the 90s with notable instances such as Batman Forever and Star Wars Episode I, the only other full mo-cap production was Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within. The Polar Express became a decent sized hit in its original release with the novelty of its motion-capture technology in 3D and Imax being seen as immersive, but despite having some really strong atmosphere and moments, the film doesn't achieve the statues of Christmas Classic it clearly strives for.Despite the source book only being a mere 32 pages long, the filmmakers get a lot of material from the seemingly thin premise of children traveling by magical train to see Santa Claus and the North Pole. The movie's characters are (mostly) unnamed and serve more as proxies and cyphers for the audience than as actual characters with each character very much falling into a type with the main boy's arc being about having faith in the unseen, the girl remaining mostly static with her distinguished trait being a kind believer in Santa, the Know-it-all learning humility, and the lonely boy getting his own Christmas as well. The movie has a mostly timeless feel to it avoiding any contemporaneous references in either the aesthetics or the dialogue (save for an ill-advised cameo by Aerosmith's Steven Tyler) and from the performances to the visuals there's a clear drive by the filmmakers to bring us something on the same level of family classics like Wizard of Oz or Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and 60% of the time we get that, the other 40%...The movie is pretty divided on its status as a showcase for the motion-capture technology that ended up defining a significant portion of Robert Zemeckis' career. While some people look favorably upon the technology and it's ability to create near photorealistic worlds and almost lifelike characters, others feel it's a compromise that doesn't take full advantage of the live-action or animated formats and is in a strange no man's land where it's held back by the restraints and limitations of either format. Some of the characters look really good, but others such as the credited ""Hero Girl"" and ""Lonely Boy"" have a doll-like quality particularly in their faces that make them fall into the uncanny valley. I also wasn't a fan of some of the action-beats such as a lengthy sequence involving a lost ticket that flies off the train and through a series of contrivances gets back on the train, or a sequence where Hero Girl and Hero Boy end up controlling the train while the two engineers do some very rubbery slapstick repairs on the train engine. Tom Hanks voices multiple characters throughout the film and while he does fine as the Conductor and Santa Claus, Hanks' voice is very recognizable and hearing it coming from five different characters (counting the wraparound narration) was a little distracting.The Polar Express is okay, there's some real moments of atmosphere and heart to the movie, but the film often gets lost in its technological showcase with action beats and slapstick sequences that feel at odds with the attempts to be ""real"". It's not the classic it strives to be, but it does have some good parts to it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Magical Christmas Roller-coaster,"While it has some simple plot building and un-original characters, there's no doubting that The Polar Express is a magical ride.

There is some movie magic that Zemeckis portray's really well. The musical moments that permeate the film are great, and the finale is spine tingly.

"Manipultive and with an overriding issue of visuals over all else; the film has, admittedly, a child-like enthusiasm difficult to brush off but it's all fairly pedestrian.","It is difficult not to pencil The Polar Express in as more style and effects over substance; but boy, what style and effects it's got. Witness, if you will, the sequence signalling the end of the film's set-up and systematic commencement of the protagonist's journey proper; a sequence following that of a magical steam train whisking it's way down into a suburban street and then off again once the formalities have been taken care of. Witness the way in which the many windows to the many carriages wonderfully sync up with the ground as it slowly chugs away from the curb as if it were leaving a station; the way the bright golds radiating from the lighting within each carriage to each window reflects onto the brilliant white lawns covered in heavy snow, each yellow rectangle sticking in perfect tandem as it moves off. Never mind the meetings with Santa Claus and never mind the ""state of the art"" motion capture technology on show throughout, the true beauty of this 2004 piece lies not with the residing characteristics of the beast nor the places it goes, but with the more simplistic little 'events' or 'happenings' such as the aforementioned examples. Therein lie the reasons to feel both good and at-once apprehensive about the film, a film all but indebted to its special effects and therefore often feeling the need to fall back on the sheer spectacle of the world it's depicting so as to get across the sense we've actually gone somewhere.The film was directed by a certain Robert Zemeckis, whose 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit is a crisp example of how effects can create a world around a central character's plight whilst complimenting the central tract rather than draw attention away from it. Tom Hanks voices a young boy living in a rich American neighbourhood somewhere in the 1950's , a kid with a loving family; a big house and a little sister. The young boy is growing up, and reading of mall based Santa's striking in the newspapers as well as discovering nuggets of information that places such as The North Pole cannot harbour human beings, his belief in the man is on the slope downwards. Late on Christmas Eve, another Hanks character, on board the titular Polar Express, whooshes down and parks outside the young boy's house – next stop: The North Pole, in what is an attempt by those on the other side to re-instill belief.In essence, that is as advanced it gets in terms of narrative; the film easing into a grove driven solely by the special effects of getting there and then briefly staying there before completing the circular journey and arriving back to a warm Christmas morning. Along the way, one of the characters has no ticket; the train itself does not have any breaks, it conks out on one occasion and there is an uncanny interaction with a homeless gentleman. There are a number of other kids on board, with them arriving this bizarre class tract to do with people from varying class levels all occupying different class compartments, but each coming together at the end as one happy congregation occupying the same realm, even those of whom come from ""the wrong side of the tracks"". Zemeckis takes the opportunity in working with this technology to recreate certain sequences from his past work, one of which is lifted from Forrest Gump but sees a feather replaced by one of those aforementioned tickets, and he even finds time to pay reference to the daring train cart negotiating that made up the finale of Back to the Future: Part III - complete with ""I've always wanted to do that!"" line once in the engine proper. They do nothing but have us wish we were watching those films instead.Nearer the end of the journey there is a steep drop in the tracks resulting in the train snowballing downhill, something shot from the very front of the vehicle and instilling this unnecessary roller-coaster aesthetic to proceedings reiterating what little it lacks in most film making departments but excels at in terms of spectacle. For the final final act, the train arrives in The North Pole to a pastiche of that Christmas-time Coca Cola advertisement you get on televisions. Then, it is revealed Santa's workshop is run by elves who sound like they've seen one too many New York City-set gangster movies and, in a creepy turn, have these tiny video cameras in the bedrooms of each kid in the world so as to check on bad behaviour. Admittedly, the 'permanant record' idea is good value and the big spinning globe allowing you access it all is neat.One is tempted to compare it to the likes of Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, or indeed James Cameron's more recent Avatar; films of which did not exist until the time in which they did due to the unavailability of the technology at hand required to build the worlds envisaged. Had one attempted to produce the film twenty or so years previously, the effects will often have looked stodgy; but if they were backed up by narrative and characterisation, those would be the limits of people's criticisms. Here, one is constantly pestered by the effects and how impressive they are, as well as how unimpressive it is to see them essentially act as dressing to weak arcs of self-discovery. I found those other two examples dull and lifeless; similarly, Zemeckis' prior work, in these post-Polar Express domains, have been the often woeful and tonally broken Beowulf and A Christmas Carol – in comparison, The Polar Express has a certain energy to it and is easier to watch. It would be true to say that as the 1910s merged into the 1920s, and audiences demanded narrative over spectacle, so are we going in the opposite direction ninety years on, and it is a sentiment epitomised in films such as The Polar Express.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A warm, fuzzy, holiday classic, this move is NOT!","I took my 4.5 year old and he wanted to go home after the first fifteen minutes.

Not that great,"I was hoping this movie would be similar to the gorgeous animated short film, The Snowman, but no such luck. That film has beautiful, haunting music that would have fit wonderfully into this movie. But instead, there were too many lingering, silent moments that made my mind wander and didn't set a mood.The movie was beautiful to look at, but like other cutting edge technology films, it feels forced. It's as if a story was built around technology. I felt as if the movie was animated by people who thought they were playing a video game.Plus, every voice sounded like Tom Hanks. (I wonder why.) Tom Hanks doesn't have the comedic talents to pull off voice-overs in my opinion. And the ""know-it-all"" boy had a voice that sounded like fingernails on a blackboard.220 million dollars? That could have fed a lot of homeless people here at the holidays. It's a shame really.",,Anonymous,Animation
It might have been better as a TV special.,"Robert Zemeckis is one of the few filmmakers, along with Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton, whose movies I make a point of seeing - and though his efforts as a producer have been weak (""The Public Eye,"" ""The Frighteners""), he's never directed a movie I hated, although he came really close with ""Death Becomes Her."" ""The Polar Express"" doesn't sink to that level, but it's still something of a misfire.It's not the animation that's a problem - for all the complaints others have made about how creepy the characters are, the only one who truly qualifies is Hero Girl (imagine Queen Latifah if she was a dwarf), and this movie is the kind that could probably only be done with some kind of extraordinary animation... for the genuinely unnerving kind, see ""The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb."" The trouble is that Zemeckis and co-writer William Broyles Jr. have taken a source that by all accounts (I haven't read the Chris Van Allsburg book) is a quite simple story and blown it up without adding much of any real help; a boy who's not too full of the Christmas spirit is picked up by the Polar Express to go to the North Pole to get it first hand - sounds like it should be full of wonder and emotion. But for some reason it isn't.A lot of the time the movie's pretty cold for reasons beyond it being snow-driven; the characters don't get much to build them (unusual for a director who often fills his movies with so much warmth and appealing characters), and some moments that should be show-stoppers like the ""Hot Chocolate"" number somehow fall flat. While the movie does get better as it goes along and it's certainly impressive to look at (and some of the vocal performances are fine, especially Tom Hanks and the late Michael Jeter - to whom the movie's dedicated), ""The Polar Express"" may have been better served by being a half-hour TV special; ""The Snowman"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" didn't need 90 minutes to tell their stories well, and they're still on TV 20 and 40 years after their first airings.And in spite of the movie's attempts to make the Josh Groban song its main musical element, for my money it's the title track that's the real standout song; it's not only good to listen to, but also brings back pleasant memories of the old Rankin/Bass specials, which have tons of genuine Christmas feeling and are also fun. Something that ""The Polar Express,"" for all its good points, ultimately doesn't qualify as - but there have been far, far worse Christmas movies over the past 10 years (""Jingle All The Way"" and the remake of ""Miracle On 34th Street"" come to mind). I don't regret seeing this, but where's Frosty the Snowman when you need him?",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

A major dramatic train wreck,"Despite its groundbreaking, impressive use of ""motion capture"" technology and its rich gloss, this is a very uninvolving movie.Its cardinal sin is its main character, the ""Hero Boy"". He's a total bore. He doesn't drive the plot. He doesn't want anything. He simply doubts the existence of Santa Claus. His juvenile cohorts are not much more interesting, either. There is a token ""black girl"" who is, of course, a font of wisdom and strength. There is also a Jewish ""Know-It-All"" who is just an irritation.Tom Hanks, for some bizarre reason, plays all the main characters. Or rather, they used his data to create them. One character, a ghost-like ""Hobo"" who rides the roof of the Polar Express, is the most intriguing, but he's creatively restrained by the film's desire to appeal to the widest possible audience in the universe.You know you are in trouble when a film's best sequence is a detour well away from the main plot. In this, that sequence involves a ticket that flies out of our hero's hand, flits about FORREST GUMP-style and is blown across several valleys and carried by various creatures across skies and snowy wastelands until it is fatefully returned to its origins.The storyline is 100% predictable and the 3-D is accomplished but unnecessary.What burns this costly turd to the ground, ultimately, is its PC nature. It plays safe with everything. Despite one or two concessions to minorities, it depicts a cloyingly middle class, white bread version of Xmas that made me want to vomit.Alan Silvestri's score shoots its dramatic wad way too early and because Zemeckis uses it so blatantly and shamelessly to make us ""feel"" things that are simply not there, it comes across as gratuitous.I really wanted to like this film. I wanted to be caught up in the magic its advertising promised. I wasn't. I was bored.Consider the difference between this and Miyazaki's SPIRITED AWAY, MY NEIGHBOR TOTORO or KIKI'S DELIVERY SERVICE. Miyazaki's films are about characters who want something first, concepts second. They take risks, they're not consciously PC and they earn every ounce of an audience's trust and involvement.The same can also be said for THE INCREDIBLES, TOY STORY and FINDING NEMO -- all great movies because their heroes want something badly.POLAR EXPRESS is a major dramatic train wreck.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
NOT a young kids movie,"I must have missed something that happened between the time I was very young and now. A big change, indeed. Exactly when did accepting a ride on a magical train, sent by Santa mean that you're in for a nightmarish trip fraught with peril? The number of times the kids on this train are holding on for dear life is in this nightmarish vision is ridiculous. I mean -- come on! -- isn't this a Christmas story?!?Now don't get me wrong. I'm not someone who sits at home, bitter because the whole world isn't sugar-coated. No way! In fact, I like a good action flick. But this was a betrayal for anyone who's read the book to their kids and thinks it'll be a fun little flick for young children. You see, I can't count the number of times I've read this book to my two girls (ages 6 and 4). It's wonderful! So much so, that I never dreamed I actually needed to read a REVIEW before taking them to see it. Yes, dear reader, I made the ultimate mistake -- I actually trusted Hollywood for once. And I paid for it. My error was figuring that, worse case scenario, it would be really dumb, or not well done, or simply just boring. Boy was I wrong, as only parents of small children can appreciate.Let me be specific here. The first 1/2 of this film is like one big nightmare with just a hint of sugar-coating: kids that are pretty sure they are going to the North Pole, but not *really* sure; a conductor that barks orders with all the warmth of a drill-sergeant made of dry ice; a little girl who loses her ticket when the not-so-nice conductor comes looking for it (""but it was right here...""); a boy who tries to return her ticket, only to find her inexplicably missing when he opens the door to the next car and suddenly comes very close to falling between the cars to the tracks below; screaming children on an out of control train as it hurtles through the blackness I could go on and on. This is not the trip to the North Pole I envision. It's dark, dreary, haunting and lifeless. It's something that might have come out of the mind of Alfred Hitchcock if he ever tried to make a kids' movie. Well done, but definitely not for young kids.My 4-year-old daughter agreed. While my wife and I looked at each other with that look of ""what have we gotten ourselves into"", she began crying. I kept thinking the movie would lighten up, but it never did -- one peril after another. Unfortunately, I don't know first-hand if it ever got better. I took my daughter out of the theater and spent the next hour killing time while my wife and 6-year-old finished the movie. My 6-year-old said it was scary, but she still enjoyed it. My wife was thoroughly unimpressed. If it had just been the two of us, it would have been fine but, again, this was a G-rated Christmas movie!In short, if your kids are still young enough to want to make cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve, you might want to think twice about taking them to see The Polar Express.

God-awful tedium,"There are so many things wrong with THE POLAR EXPRESS, it's hard to know where to begin. First, it barely has a plot, not surprising for a film based on a thin children's book perhaps (though see SHREK for an amazing counterexample), but this leaves the state-of-the-art CG motion capture technology to do the heavy lifting, never a good sign.And what does that technology produce? A main character so lacking in appeal that it's hard to care what happens to him. A series of train-in-peril scenes as old as film itself. A North Pole of endless factory-style red brick buildings with piped-in generic Christmas music that is the polar opposite of enchanting. A sea of elves greeting Santa that creepily evokes TRIUMPH OF THE WILL. A chance for its star to voice multiple roles, which leads to Tom Hanks fatigue.Support from the score includes some ""original,"" forgotten-before-they-finish Christmas dirges. And to maintain the CG tradition, there is a pop-culture reference gratuitously squeezed in near the end of the film (not counting the director's earlier homage to himself and FORREST GUMP's feather).There's probably nothing wrong with the technology that a good script couldn't cure, but without one, you're left watching a train wreck.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's More Annoying Than Anything,"Let's not kid ourselves, a children's movie has to have sparkly colors and a relatively short run time.

This movie should be just a short film that contains no sound, but still beautiful images.Mentioning images brings me to my second gripe. In the TV show ""30 Rock"" Tracy Morgan mentions the creepy valley: The creepy valley is that animations that are lifelike to a fault tend to be frightening. The movie's characters tend to fall into the creepy valley, which again could be cured by using simple, austere animating techniques.Overall it's not a bad movie and it's definitely worth a rental, especially those of you who have children.

The animation is good and the plot represents multiple themes. The hero girl has doubts as the hero boy repeated asks her 'Are you sure?' The hero boy doubts if Santa is real. The know-it-all needs a little humility and poor little Billy just needs some friends and a Christmas to remember.The action scenes are good and you must remember that the train is also a co-star. Just as the Sharps rifle is a co-star in Quigley Down Under, the train sequences are very important to the story.Yes, the story was modified from the book to be more inclusive, but remember that the author was a consultant and co-penned the screenplay. If the author approved then I can't pan the story. My grandkids watch this film with us every year and my nine-year old still believes. I'll dislike the day when she loses the magic.

"Forget Christmas with the Kranks, this movie has more heart and Christmas spirit","My favorite Christmas movie next to Elf, and the best animation next to the Incredibles. This movie makes me glad there is Christmas, and it makes me forget Christmas with the Kranks. This movie begins on Christmas eve night, as a young boy lies awake in bed eagerly waiting for Santa Claus to come, but a surprise comes by in a form of a train called the Polar Express, that will take him and a bunch of other kids to the North Pole to meet Santa. And the trip begins a night where anything can happen. This movie makes me and others feel that Christmas will never end. Tom Hanks was great as the voice of most of the characters. I can't wait till this comes out on DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Spectacular and charming though not for young children,"A spectacular and charmingly entertaining film. I loved it. It is visually breathtaking with scenes that were exciting and dazzling. The sound track is enchanting with catchy theme music and some excellent songs. The racing train scenes had me on the edge of my seat even knowing it was animation. As a fan of Tom Hanks, I was not disappointed; he dominates the film in many characters. Though some could see this as a negative excess, each was done with a different touch and sometimes even his voice was not recognizable. There are lessons for children throughout. My only caution--this is not for young children; though dark edges of the adventure and some elements could be scary, there are no villains or horrible creatures. Even so, the topic and scenes are perhaps best for 8-12 year olds, and old codgers like me.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A laugh at the true spirit of Christmas,"I would first like to name the positive aspects of the film, as to make it fair: The characters were wonderfully rendered. Tom Hanks did a good job and, unlike others, I didn't find them to be creepy. The backgrounds were great. You could almost feel the cold of the night while watching. The most delicious eye-candy available.But that's where it ends. First of all, the message they were trying to pass was one of believing in Christmas. I'm sorry, but it's a rather bad faith you're giving us. The poor boy, who always hated Christmas for not getting presents, finally accepts it - and it's a huge present. They added some completely perfect black girl. C'mon, I don't tolerate racism, but this kind of political correctness makes me just as sick. The nerd kid was amusing, but somewhat a cliché. What I mean is that the message is one of the true meaning of Christmas being presents. That is sickening. Children are already spoiled and materialistic enough, why give them more of that.The musical numbers were completely embarrassing, and the way they just added and added to the original story made the movie look disjointed. They turned some little Christmas story into a roller-coaster of action sequences, disjointed scenes and a corruption of the true meaning of Christmas.It's natural that only children can hear the bell, since it stands for the materialistic and commercial aspect of Christmas.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surround Sound,"This is the greatest of all Christmas feeling movies to date, it even appeals to the older age because this movie is apart of you, it's magical, mystical and breathtaking at the same time, CGI animation has gone amazing leaps from Tron since I was born.When I bought this on the DVD release I had to play it with the lights off, surround sound on with my crystal clear flat screen TV with the sound high and the sub-woofer at max and bass highish not too high as it spoils the songs, but doing so makes you feel the movie is real, it brings you closer to the magic that is Christmas, I must say Christmas became a thing of the past for me, one day I just felt that one day isn't worth looking forward to because life's too short, you could be dead before you get to Christmas, this movie, makes you a kid again makes you wish for Christmas.I have not one bad word against this film even if I didn't love this movie I'm sure I couldn't fault it. The most amazing CGI is with the Driver and the engineer, in there scenes of hilarity Dreamworks CGI took their time in making sure that this was perfect and it was.Tom Hanks you can't beat him nowadays, he's made it to an all time great actor, you know that Tom Hanks is almost every voice in this film (over exaggerated) 10/10 great voice work from the old chap.Personally I doubt a more sense of spirit, magic and feeling of Christmas in a film will occur anytime in the next decade, well done!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Even kids dislike this movie.,"A friend of mine asked me what I thought of this movie, I told her that it really wasn't that interesting, it felt like a lot of the situations in the movie that were just designed to fill up time. She told me that I probably felt that way since it's aimed for kids. I had to disagree on this one since I noticed a lot of the kids were getting restless while watching this movie.A really easy way to judge if a 'kids' movie is a good 'kids' movie is simply watching them in the theater. About 30 minutes into Polar Express I noticed that the kids around me (ranging from about 4-12) started doing more then just ask their parents basic little kid questions, they started wiggling around in their seats in that 'I'm bored' fashion little kids do. Then throw in they started asking the really confused questions since they couldn't tell visually what was going on (little kids don't really pay much attention to dialogue unless it's a really funny one liner or mixed in w/ slapstick humor)Now if you're about to jump all over me stating that this is just what little kids do, since they've got the attention spans of goldfish, I'll have to disagree. The week prior I saw The Incredibles, and the reaction of the kids in that audience was the complete opposite of what I sat thru in Polar Express. In The Incredibles the only thing I really dealt w/ was kids hoopin and hollering to all the excitement, action & slapstick going on. I don't remember any kids breaking out in tears because they started getting bored, or bothering anybody w/ goofy questions because they couldn't tell what was going on. Instead, they just sat back & had a really good time.So what have I learned from all this My general opinion of this movie fits the general opinion of the audience it was aimed towards. The movie is drawn out and boring.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
ELEVEN out of ten stars!!!!!!,"About an hour ago, I got back from seeing the Polar Express movie in 3-D at the new Jordan's furniture in Reading, Massachusetts. I have to say, it was without question the most amazing, monumental achievement in movie-making history that I have ever witness with my own eyes. Up until this point, I would have said the most ""amazing"" movie (and I choose my words carefully) was the Lord of the Rings: Return of the King (even though that wasn't my ""favorite"" movie, I have to admit it was absolutely amazing). Well, Polar Express 3-D blows that away.I am a 34-year-old grown man. But I have to admit, I got quite teary-eyed during several scenes - not just because the scenes were sad, or happy, or whatever, but because they were just so AMAZING to watch, I literally couldn't handle it. I have never seen anything like this movie before. Even though it was 100% computer-animated, the scenes looked more ""real"" than real-life itself (if this is even possible). The colors, textures, and detail in the characters and surroundings absolutely blew away previous ""wow, this movie is awesome"" films such as Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc., and even Shrek 2.But the catch is, you've GOT to see it in 3-D. You will NOT be disappointed. I will be remembering and talking about this amazing masterpiece of a movie for many years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

I Believe!,"This film is about a boy, who once believed in Christmas, going on a journey on a magical train that leads him and a couple of children to the North Pole.He doesn't believe in Santa Clause anymore, since he saw the newspapers and news that Santa was a fake. He's doubting everything including the magic train and going to the North Pole. He meets some friends. The animation is great. It's used by actors and actresses playing the characters that are in the film. The movement they do is in the film. Hanks plays four different characters: The Conductor, Dad, the Boy, the Bum, and Santa Clause.This film is really entertaining. There is major peril all over the movie and when you look at it, it's so amazing to see it. You are in awe and in shock, as you see the amazing visuals. The technology is great today that you can almost do anything with it. This could also be a sad film towards the end. The train is going to the North Pole where the first person will receive their gift before any other people in the world.This is an amazing film.

I really hated this movie,I do think Tom Hanks is a good actor. I enjoyed reading this book to my children when they were little. I was very disappointed in the movie. One character is totally annoying with a voice that gives me the feeling of fingernails on a chalkboard. There is a totally unnecessary train/roller coaster scene. There are some characters and scenes that seem scary for little children for whom this movie was made. The North Pole scenes with Santa and the elves could have been cute and charming. There was absolutely no warmth or charm to these scenes or characters. It usually doesn't work to make a short children's book into a feature film. This movie totally grates on my nerves.,2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Thoroughly Manufactured Holiday Novelty, Fake Like a Plastic Tree","Transparently forced Christmas ""magic"" that can't even lean on its CG visuals for support. Despite the wide variety of gaudy, jolly ghosts, elves and Christmas nicknacks flittering about the screen, this movie has no spirit, no zeal, no life. It sure goes through the motions, producing overly-familiar shapes, sounds and colors by the shovelful, but that never translates to more real emotion than the pajama section of a Sears catalog. It's mostly a one-man show, with Tom Hanks providing voices for a good ninety percent of the cast, but he's unable to work any holiday miracles with such flat source material. The wealth of bad, empty computer graphics do the film no favors, either, somehow managing to bridge the gap between hollow marionettes and the unnerving denizens of the uncanny valley. A desperate effort to join the endless parade of holiday classics, it's a noble-minded (but incompetent) talent flush.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Polar Express is a masterpiece of a  Christmas film.,"This is one of the best Christmas films made in recent years. It is a masterpiece in capturing the magic of Christmas, and ideal to see at the beginning of December, when the season is really getting under way. So simple, yet so effective is its storyline, Polar Express will have you gripped from start to finish. Amazingly, none of the characters (except Santa) have names - but so enthralling is the film that you don't even notice until the ending credits! Tom Hanks gives an inspired performance as the voice of many of the lead characters. Perfect not just for children, but also for adults. My parents (50) and I (18) went to see it and loved it enough to see it again in 3D. I advise you especially to go see it in IMAX 3D - stunning is the only word.

It's not a frenzy of action in search of a soul, but a story well told.This will play for years and years during the holiday season and is the first truly narrative feature quality and length I-MAX presentation that I've seen. In the hands of a master story teller, 3d-IMAX is experienced as a more total immersion into the story. 3d as a feature of the medium is blended into the other elements that support the telling of the film story and becomes another almost unnoticed element of film.

happy holidays from galaxy quest,"This is deeply odd. it's like space aliens have recorded earth television for fifty years, and have attempted to make their own sentimental television classic.The results are like those creepy un-Xmas cards you get from insurance agents that say ""happy holidays"" rather than ""merry Christmas"".As far as I can tell, the Betazoids who wrote the script seem to believe that Santa Claus is a religious figure, and the centre of Christmas. (Indeed, the whole Christ thing is so embarrassing that the Betazoids are very careful to avoid it: so no carols on the soundtrack, just ""seasonal"" hits).Somehow Santa elides into a kind of all-seeing, ever-present Jehovah, with a thousand faces, all of them Tom Hanks. Finally, he morphs into a type of giant embalmed Stalin figure, complete with Soviet star on the Christmas tree, and the orchestra blazing the melody of ""The Red Flag"".(As Anna Russell would say, 'I'm not making this up, you know') Apparently the message of the picture is that if we all just BELIEVE in this wonderful deity, we shall all receive train-sets on Christmas morning.

Express delivery,"I thought I'd seen most of the major Hollywood Christmas films down the years but somehow missed out on this gem, at least up until now.Like the questioning children on the train to the North Pole, I found myself thoroughly transported by an engaging story, exciting sequence of events and of course an all-tied- up-in-a-bow happy ending. The unusual nature of the super-realistic animation technique employed took a little getting used to for me but once we get on board the train, it's full steam ahead for thrills and heart-warming sentiment.Tom Hanks is just right in his main role as the genial train conductor while the late Michael Jeter in his last filmed role is effectively, if sadly ironically, cast as a helpful ghost. The detail and vivacity in the animation compensated for the too-real appearance of the characters and there's a pleasing selection of older-style Christmas songs, that is until Aerosmith singer Steven Tyler makes an unnecessary and unhelpful cameo appearance.While not the most original Christmas story ever, the time-worn tale of a growing child's wavering belief in Santa Claus eroded by maturity with even the device of a magic train transporting children to a magical land having echoes of ""Harry Potter"", nevertheless I have no hesitation in naming this amongst the best Christmas movies I've yet seen.In fact my only major regret watching it was that it wasn't the 3D version which I'll make a point of donning when I watch it again as one my Yuletide perennials next year!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Loud, creepy, horrifying","Against my better judgment my three-year-old son was taken to see The Polar Express this weekend.Five minutes into the movie he screamed and begged to go home. And he's not a particularly cowardly toddler.This G-rated movie is incredibly LOUD, violently kinetic, and a total sensory overload - completely inappropriate for young children. I got to see the rest of the movie after my son was taken home, and time after time I was amazed by scenes that were far more frightening than the one that first terrified my boy. He'd never have made it through without major trauma.Perhaps a five-year-old could handle it - but they would have to be pretty desensitized.For myself, the virtual actors were creepy, the elves at the North Pole scenes were disturbingly reminiscent of Nazi propaganda films, and the writing was disappointingly poor. The whole thing felt like a very deliberate, cynical attempt to manufacture a Christmas classic, but throughout the movie it was impossible to miss the set-ups for future roller-coaster theme rides and products.Why does Hollywood feel it necessary to blast moviegoers into insensibility? And why, why, WHY don't they understand that good writing is the core of a movie? The television version of ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas!"" was wonderful and heartwarming. The atrocity that was Jim Carrey's ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas"" was just awful. Why? Writing, more than anything. That, and the apparent belief that loud sounds and abundant special effects are all that's needed to make a good movie.People in Hollywood need to be chained into a theater showing all the incredible, well-written movies made without seat-shaking audio and computer-generated effects: movies like Casablanca, The Third Man, A Christmas Story, and even relatively lowbrow (but well-written) movies like Used Cars.

The story had no excitement save when the train goes down a steep hill and only then the first time it happened.

All of the animation was very tight. there were times when i thought i was actually watching a live action movie. the storyline is right on with the book and also has a few surprises in it.

2 reasons why this film is not worth seeing,"1- The storyline lacks of believability and any kind of excitement. It's both the character's and the events which are superficial. I even doubt if children are amused by this uninterrupted happiness and by not having a real hero as a leading character.2- The way it proves we're still not capable of producing realistic looking facial animation. It's quite frustrating to see pretty nice visual animation being alternated by bad eye movement and less expressions in the face. I'd rather see a less ambitious style with better looking animation. Maybe it's because I've seen too many Pixar films, that makes me compare. But I think their facial animation is just great! With all the motion-capturing techniques used in The Polar Express, I wonder what it needs to create photo realistic character animation.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Robert Zemeckis captures the spirit and imagination from the book as one of the best Christmas films ever made,"Let's just say I feel in love with The Polar Express book from Chris Van Allsburg along with his other precious titles like Jumanji, Zathura, Ben's Dream and more with colorful pictures, perfect writing and wonderful characters, they've become so popular that only three of them were made into films and this wonderful gem is one of them. I was amazed that this was being directed by Robert Zemeckis who made such great classics like the Back To The Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, and Cast Away and since he was chosen to direct such a timeless tale, he did a great job at capturing the spirit and imagination of the book in his first motion-capture animated film.I'm gonna get to the weakest points first before I could give some praise. Although, there were some great visual details to the characters faces just like the book, there was a lack of expression on them like most other motion-capture films including Simon Wells' ""Mars Needs Moms"" (which we all know bombed at the box office and caused the ImageMovers Digital company to shut down). The story, while capturing the essence and spirit of the book, was vastly expanded into an 100 minute film, but I think it was appropriate since it gave us a moral lesson about believing in what your heart is saying.With those out of the way, let's get to the strongest points. The scenery is wonderful it was exactly like the book with the lovely sight of the Hero Boy's town, the train, the mountains, the roller coaster scenes (packed with amazing danger), and the beautiful look of the north pole. The voice acting is terrific. Daryl Sabara did a great job as the Hero Boy, Tom Hanks did surprisingly fantastic as the Conductor along with the Hobo, Santa Clause and Hero Boy's father. The rest of the actors did well at their performances with a wonderful script that is faithful to the story. Since most children's films have great songs, this movies does the same thing too. ""Hot Chocolate"", ""The Polar Express"", ""When Christmas Comes To Town"", and the pop song ""Believe"" by the wonderful Josh Groban in the ending credits were such amazing songs to listen to.Although, not a masterpiece, Robert Zemeckis succeeded in making sure this Christmas gem stayed faithful to the story (with a wonderful music score from the great Alan Silvestri) as one of the best Christmas films ever made.

Tom Hanks voices all the main characters, which are differentiated solely by pitch. The one high point is the introduction of the elves, who, based on their accents, seem to be members of the mafia. I guess you need good organized labor to turn out millions of presents each year. If you want to preserve your childhood memories of the book, don't see the movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a holiday classic that is a fun family watch,"The Polar Express (2004) is a movie I recently watched with my daughter on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows a boy who believes in Christmas when few in his family still do. On Christmas Eve he hears a train outside and decides to get on it for a trip with other kids to the North Pole where he hopes to get a glimpse at Santa Claus before he starts his toy delivery process. Every child hopes to get picked by Santa to tell him their wishes for Christmas.This movie was directed by Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future) and contains the voices of Tom Hanks (Forest Gump), Chris Coppola (Beowulf), Nona Gaye (Crash), Michael Jeter (The Green Mile), Leslie Zemeckis (Welcome To Barwen) and Peter Scolari (Newhart).The animation for this movie is absolutely awesome. Tom Hanks was a great choice of voices as the conductor and every second on the train is magical. I loved the magic portrayed both inside and outside the train ride. There's also some great messages on the challenges children face by the household and circumstances they're born into. The Aerosmith cameo was nice and the ending was fun.Overall this is a holiday classic that is a fun family watch. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pure Christmas magic!!,"Robert Zemeckis's The Polar Express is a dazzling gem of a Christmas classic. It's endlessly re watchable, complete fun for kids and adults alike, and contains really impressive motion capture special effects that hold up terrifically to this day. Zemeckis is in love with the medium, having made three incredible ventures into it so far, this being his first. It's a hell of a ride, and at times very interactive with the audience, as the cameras swoop, swish, dive and throw themselves right into the action in exciting ways that wouldn't be possible with live action. The animation itself is jaw-dropping as well, each new sight the train passes more awe inspiring than the last. The train is a marvel too see and feels real to us, with textured surfaces rendered beautifully, and many a hiss, clank and roar melded into the sound design. On a quiet, snow blanketed Christmas Eve in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a young boy eagerly awaits Santa's jingling arrival with great anticipation. What arrives instead is a grand old steam train, right to his front door stop. When asked where it's headed, the energetic conductor exclaims ""Why, to the North Pole, of course! This is the polar express!!!"". And off they go, trundling through the holy night northbound into desolate forests, gorgeous mountains and scenery so well imagined you'll have trouble believing you're watching something made by a computer. It's not tacky or overdone, but rather muted and deep colored, as if the pages of the storybook leapt to magical life in front of us. The boy meets others like him and before they know it they're already knee deep in heart stopping adventure before they even get halfway to the north pole. The train careens and dips like a bat out of hell along impossibly wild roller coaster tracks and even ice skates along a glassy frozen lake at one point. The first half of the film is so packed with precise, visually boggling action that it feels like Need For Speed: Arctic Edition at times. My favourite parts are the haunting pack of wolves that follow the train down a powdery tundra slope, the stomach churning plunge down 'glacier gulch' that plays like Mario kart on steroids, and a comical detour around thousands of wild caribou. It's quite the adventure. And I haven't even gotten to the north pole yet. It is without a doubt the grandest, and my favourite depiction of Santa's kingdom in any movie ever.The sheer scale, beauty and detail of it makes your heart soar in appreciation. Hundreds of thousands of little elfies parade around (including one that looks and sounds suspiciously like Steven Tyler), giddy with excitement at the time of year, some in hilarious neumatic transit pods. Santas sleigh is a titanic bundle that requires two blimps to lift, and it's all set on a massive frosty dome in the middle of the northern desolation. It's. Damn. Spectacular. Tom Hanks works overtime in six different roles, the showcase one being the conductor, a neurotic loon whose overwhelming compassion and winking, jovial spirit peers through his gruff exterior. He also plays a mysterious hobo who rides the express in style and helps those in need, as well as the big man himself, Father Christmas. The holiday magic that fuels the train along with coal is there to teach every girl and boy onboard a very introspective lesson, which they themselves must come to terms with, with a dose of friendly nudging from the other characters. A true Christmas classic with imagination in spades, dozens of pleasing Christmas carols to sing along to (including a deafening rendition of Santa Claus is coming to town sung by the elfies) and a timeless feeling of adventure and awaiting joy to rival any of the best Christmas eve's that we fondly remember as children.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Oh, Boy . . .","All of the eyebrows move the same way, the realistic mottling of the skin is unsettling, and I swear to god, the Polar Express is a trip to Hell with the conductor as a badly represented bipolar version of the Devil. This is sometimes a musical, but it also isn't; so really, it's just jarring. The score reminded me of Back to the Future, then I found out Zemeckis did direct this. The pacing was surprisingly decent considering how immediately intense the story got. The scene of singing elves and kids turned this into a concert for a cult.

Just because it's the target audience is children doesn't mean the film has to be a stupid celebration of orthodoxy. In comparison to a clever and largely appealing film like ""the incredibles"", polar express comes up short. There are a handful of scenes where the film could have progressed beyond its preordained mediocrity, but instead it chooses to stay the course, boring all adults in the audience to tears, while indoctrinating the children with thoroughly inane, defeatest ideals.Yay we can all live outside the cubicle in our fantasy lives, and somehow vicariously survive through our children's delusions. No need to actually effect change, it's all about ""the magic"" of the holidays. One or two days per year are certainly enough for me to enjoy the happiness of being together with my family.

Some kids with creepy dead eyes take a dreamlike trip to the North Pole on The Polar Express,"A boy from Grand Rapids, Michigan, is at the age where he no longer believes in Christmas, as far as Santa, his elves and flying reindeer go, but a magical train appears in front of his home on Christmas Eve and whisks him away on an adventurous trip to the North Pole with several other kids.""The Polar Express"" (2004) was based on the 1985 Christmas book and was the first mainline movie to use motion capture animation for all its characters beginning to end (think Gollum from ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy). Some people think the animation is weak, but I feel it creates its own world and has its own charm. It holds up as long as you can adapt to those creepy dead eyes of the characters.Some people love this movie while others think it's weird, like a Twilight Zone Christmas flick. Roger Ebert, for instance, loved it and gave it a perfect grade. I'm sorta in the middle. I see its good points and appreciate them, like the haunting winter ambiance, parts of the trip to the North Pole (e.g. the quasi-rollercoaster ride) and the kids' investigation of the Christmas factory. But there are some meh parts and dubious sections like the whole last act with the multitude of elves and the towering Santa who looked like he was modeled after 6'5"" Christopher Lee with a pillow strapped to his mid-section.The movie's interesting in some ways but also quaint in a cheesy way, as well as peculiar and lifeless.The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes.GRADE: C",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Nostalgic Christmas Tradition,"Will I consider this as the best Christmas movie? No. But I really see this as a really nice tradition. The Polar Express is an enjoyable Christmas movie that does give expansion of the book it was based on. Maybe there are some things that can keep this from being the best Christmas movie like how the designs try too hard to look real. But I can admire on how it wants to adapt the children's book with an engaging story, animation that looks good on its own, nicely handled characters that gives development of the children it would be about, and an inspiring moral on the heart of believing. I think this is a really nice idea to watch this as a Christmas tradition, especially for the children. So that they will truly get inspired that no matter how old they would get, the movie will show that it's still okay to believe of what you want to believe.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Always hated this,I was scared of it as a kid and now I just dislike it. It has no Christmas cheer and is very dreary. The animation is also horrible. The characters are creepy and lifeless. Their eyes make them look dead and it is unsettling. The train comes and picks the kids up and brings them to a dark and depressing version of the north pole.

Truly the stuff of nightmares.,"This is a children's film. Yet it is full of the kind of monsters that haunt you at night while you writhe sweat soaked in a bad dream. The death mask like faces and cold dead eyes of the creatures in this film are soul shrivelling and yet these creatures are the children we take our journey with. Each time one of them speaks their lips peel back to reveal gnashing teeth. Their emotionless faces hold a kind of unfeeling malevolence that is fear inducing. Couple this with the fact each of them has a voice of an adult it takes you to some surreal place where everything seems somewhat sinister and unsafe.The angular empty world this movie takes place in exists on another plain. Cold and flat and devoid of any believable life. It is somewhere I would dread to wake up in.The elves are terrifying spindly little legs and goblin like faces. They are more like how you would imagine Rumpelstiltskin to look. Their appearance is more of something that would steal your soul than build you a toy.Permeating this film is Tom Hanks, speaking through several of these characters like some eternal element. The big brother of this vacuum world. A puppet master using these automatons for his own ancient devices. But at the same time he is also the voice of our Hero boy. Is this some internal struggle a part of this all-seeing presence fighting against itself. I don't know. But what I do know is that at night sometimes I see the faces of these hellions in my nightmares and so will you if you view this harrowing piece of celluloid.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

A Magical Christmas Movie With Many Memories Tied To It.,"The Polar Express was released in 2004. I was 6 at the time, so I would have been in Kindergarten. In first grade, we actually had a Christmas party in class, and we watched the movie in class in our pajamas and drank hot chocolate. (Which I didn't like at the time, but I like it now if made with milk and not hot water.) This became a tradition in the first-grade class of our school.The fact that I can still remember that 17 years later should show how special this movie is to me. I spent many December days watching this growing up. But what is it that makes it so special? I can think of a few things.The movie follows a boy named Hero Boy in the credits; we never hear his real name. He used to believe in Santa, but is skeptical now that he is older, and hears of frauds of ""real"" Santas.Enter a train on the night of Christmas Eve. The conductor (voiced by Tom Hanks) invites him on a trip- ""To the North Pole of course, this is the Polar Express!"" and he befriends 3 other kids (a spirited girl, an annoying nerd, and a shy boy who also doubts Santa's existence). Through this visit, The Boy learns how to value the Christmas spirit, and to have faith in the fat man who breaks into his house every December 25th to leave presents and eat cookies.As I mentioned, Tom Hanks stars as The Conductor. As if he wasn't talented enough, Hanks actually voices 5 other characters- The Boy(as a narrator, not the child), a hobo, a Scrooge doll that he puppets, The Father of The Boy, and Santa Claus himself.As seen from behind the scenes footage, this movie also uses a different form of animation. Instead of being computer animated, it actually used motion capture animation. Tom Hanks(among the other actors) wore a suit that captured their motions and that was edited into cartoon form.It's very impressive, also considering that the film is 18 years old. That said, some of the animation looks ""unfinished"" and some movements look clunky (witness the kids going down a slide or screaming when in danger), so while it's cool, it's not the finest animation I have ever seen. That is why I give The Polar Express a 9 and not a 10.While technically not a musical, The Polar Express also has some nice songs, such as The Polar Express and When Christmas Comes To Town. However, the best song is easily Hot Chocolate, hence the classroom tradition. In this scene, the Conductor asks the kids if they would like refreshments, and some chefs come in to serve the hot beverage and dance for them.To this day, if someone even mentions the drink, I often can't help but go: ""Hot! Hot! Hey we got it! Hot! Hot! Oh we got it! Hot! Hot! Yeah we got it!""Apart from memories of school I also have memories of watching it at home. For example, if you listen closely in the first few minutes, you hear that The Boy has a sister named Sarah. That was actually my now deceased sister's name. When we were kids, my sister actually would say that the boy was named Zachary- my name. Unfortunately for her, I would find out later by traditon his name is Chris, named after author Chris Van Allsburg.So while The Polar Express has flawed animation, it's still a cheerful holiday family movie with great songs, fun, and a lesson about faith and hope, not just in Santa, but in anything- from God to humanity. There are few Christmas family movies I could recommend more than this one. The Polar Express is simply a magical film.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"One More Time, with Feeling","Having seen ""The Polar Express"" with my family this past weekend, I was left with several impressions. First, the negative: CGi works well on backgrounds, much less so on human beings; some characters were monstrous; The North Pole cityscape looked more like Poland during the war than ""Christmastown""; the sound was too loud; the movie would have benefited greatly without the new characters and a shorter running time; some voice talents were totally miscast; the mood of the film is too bleak for young children. On the positive: there's some memorable songs; fantastic use of color; a faithfulness to the illustrations of the Chris Van Allsburg book ( which is the main reason the producers chose to render the entire film in CGi ); breathtaking nature scenes; a real kinetic energy; most of the children seemed to love it  which is the point, really  after all, it IS a movie designed for children.Consider the source material: I find the book rather bleak in itself.For me, it's one of Allsburg's lesser writes, though it's not void of charm. It should be for older children who are on the cusp of that basic level of maturity that questions the less logical aspects of life. That age group surely has graduated from pictures books. Or is it more a book for the precocious six year old who's unfortunately been informed by another less impressionable child that Santa Claus isn't real? Which is it? I'll guess the latter is probably the closest to the author's target. If true, the likely truth is that those children are in the minority, and the book's main fault is that it attracts an audience too wide than it's intended audience.Which is why the movie also is awkward in its approach to Christmas. Children see the Rankin/Bass productions on TV, then see ""The Polar Express"" and begin to think, ""Gee, is The North Pole REALLY like that?"" This modern depiction of The North Pole is a quantum leap from those old TV shows. I suppose that all these disparate depictions of The North Pole only fuel children's suspicions. Children thrive on familiarity, and The North Pole has been depicted, up to this point, thousands of ways. It's no wonder they start to question everything! The CGi people come off weird, unnatural and sometimes downright frightening. Remember that movie ""Westworld""? You've got it! I think the better idea would have been placing live actors in the backgrounds, as in ""Mary Poppins"". The charm factor would have been ratcheted way up. Why wasn't this done? Supposedly the director didn't want to bother with child actors. Huh?!? How can one get that childhood feeling while being surrounded mostly by adults during the production? ""One more time, with feeling."" As for the volume, all movies are too loud today. But the sudden noises and decibel level are totally inappropriate for this film. If I were a kid and saw this movie, I'd be treated to nightmares at bedtime.What did my six year old think? She loved it! Mostly she loved the train scenes where the movie show the workings of the train and the amazing speeds of which it's capable. Which is the weakness of my review  most kids loved this movie. But some younger children were scared by it. What  Christmas scary? Leave that to ""A Christmas Carol"", which is NOT for young kids! WHY toddlers were brought in to see this at our viewing is indicative of the lack of natural feeling people seem to exhibit nowadays. Have we really gotten so desensitized that ideas and common sense have to be bludgeoned into our minds? So, proceed with caution.Cheers: Beautiful backgrounds; breathtaking nature scenes; some good songs; a movie that really moves; fascinating animation; faithful to the book; teaches that faith is important in life; a crowd-pleaser.Caveats: Scary characters; too loud; bleak; awkward; animated dead people; too long; way too intense for impressionable five year-olds.Match, cut.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Refreshingly positive flick that makes me appreciate it more and more every time I see it,"It is not the greatest film about Christmas 🎄 but it is a positive effort by all concerned about doubting Thomases everywhere and the Christmas myths which kids grow with. The animation is a little difficult to appreciate, but the soundtrack and main music is very
much appreciated.Another reason to appreciate it is the ensemble cast which includes Michael Jeter and to whom it was dedicated as his last film. The story follows the outline of the children's book by Chris Van Allsburg.The viewer is manipulated (as all viewers are in movies 🎥) to see thru kids' eyes about those things they remember later in life as a positive influence on how they remember their childhood and what is important about from whence they came, be it the ""wrong side"" of the tracks and the friends they meet along the way.

Doesn't quite work,"I really think that given the idea this film should have been a lot better, but too much of it just doesn't click.Firstly I think the animation was really quite poor when it comes to the actual characters. Too often lips weren't moving in time with the words and facial expressions were absent. I know the film is nearly 20 years old but other films from this period were producing much better animation.The story also drags on a bit. There are too many antics surrounding a lost ticket that just get tiresome. A strange random ghost character that seems shoe-horned in for no reason. The film should have ended 10 minutes earlier than when it did. I did like the central idea however, and there are some nice moments for sure.What was really missing for me was the Christmas feeling from this film. Until the final 20 minutes or so things don't feel particularly Christmassy with this film, which seems remiss for a Christmas film.There is good voice acting however (would you expect any less from Hanks?), and there are moments of joy to be had.Overall a bit of a dud for me though.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Frightened 4 yr. old,"We saw the 3-D IMAX version. About twenty minutes worth anyway--the""Hissing steam and screeching metal"" described so eloquently in the book wasrealistically portrayed in the movie, and that, in addition to some of the ways in which the movie differs from the book (with which she was very familiar) was too overwhelmingly frightening for my 4 yr. old daughter. In order to make the nice little children's book a full-length feature they added intensity and suspense-- which sent my daughter running for the door. (3-D effects were impressive and fun for me). If ""Finding Nemo"" frightened your child, you may want to wait for video, preview the movie first, or just get a babysitter for the evening and enjoy yourself.",,Anonymous,Animation
Terrible. The book is much better.,"The Polar Express tells the story of a young boy who is beginning to lose his faith in Santa Claus. Then, on Christmas Eve, a magical train filled with other unbelieving children pulls up in front of his house to take him to the North Pole. Along the way, the children get into adventures until the meet Santa and learn the true meaning of Christmas. This film is terribly done and butchers the classic children's book.The book was so simple and great. It was a short length, and yet it covered so much. The boy gets on the train, there's a few pages of the journey, and when he arrives in the North Pole, he meets Santa Claus right away. Turning this story into a 2 hour movie was a big mistake. The film makers had to add so many ridiculous things to make the movie 2 hours, that the plot was too stupid to function. The movie is visually dazzling, I'll give it that, but the pointless additions to the story completely bog the movie down.As for acting, it kind of annoyed me that every voice in the movie was Tom Hanks. Maybe he could have changed his voice a little to make it unrecognizable. Also, maybe his name was too big for this movie.Overall, this movie has too many pointless plot points that make it boring compared to the book.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just not my cup of Tea 🍵,"The Polar Express never really interested me that much, I watched it recently in class, and I was dreaming about watching Home Alone 1 or 2. Those were my picks, the majority said they wanted ""The Polar Express"". Now I know this is a kids film, but this film didn't really interest me even as a kid. Up until the age of 9 or 10 this film where I started to take my disinterest on the film.The animation style is rough and the characters are creepy looking, they don't talk it's more of a lip sync. And the effects are unimaginative at best. It really does look like a still image of a moving picture, and it's the same snowy scene after snowy scene, it's a spitting image of the same exact sequence. Not to mention, the movie is way to loud. The audio on this movie is very rough, loud and a bit obnoxious. It certainly is deafening to the ears.The scenes that play out in the movie do seem rushed at times. Like why was their a whole minute of the lost ticket scene, heroically finding it's way back as if by magic. And it was the exact same the whole way through. Sequences after Sequence that are just their to feel up the time gap.But, with any movie and TV siries, despite flaws their will always be some highlights or something good in the movie. I do like the idea of a magical train going to the North Pole, and the kids that get to go are the ones that believe in Santa. The scenes with them on the train are great, and the kids all have a bond with each other. Mostly being stereotypical counterparts though. So overall, the film hasn't aged quite that well. And the scene where the waiters were bringing out Hot chocolate, that looked like it was from a video game.So, Would I recommend this film?Unless you want some Christmas spirit then yes definitely, otherwise just watch a different film instead like ""Home Alone"".",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cinematically amazing,"This movie, about a young boy who embarks on a magical adventure to the North Pole on the Polar Express, is a great computer animation movie!The animation, especially the facial expressions of the characters because they feel like they are from from a cut scene from a game, is definitely dated but its other technical aspects are amazing. I absolutely love its atmosphere, elevated by cinematic visuals, incredible sound design, and beautiful score. Also, the story is not very dynamic in the big picture because it rather focuses on the small details, creating its own charm. It masterfully blends multiple genres, like mystery, holiday, and comedy, capturing our attention, and while it is somewhat slow, it gives you time to reflect the story, appreciating what it offers.This movie captivates with its magical atmosphere, stunning visuals, and timeless charm, offering a reflective and enchanting holiday experience.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Captures The Christmas Spirit,"Some people argue this movie has problems because of the uncanny valley. Some facial movements are slightly unnatural, but that did not take away anything from my experience. The movie has a wintery mysticism with dazzling, icy and festive visuals. The movie has also something of a supernatural feeling similar to a ghost story. that in the titular train not being a bright ""choo choo"" train, but rather a powerful, towering, steam train. The acting is very good, not just because 70% of people in this world are Tom Hanks, but the child actors are good at acting. The movie also has some thrilling action scenes bolstered by the movie's visual marvel. You know this is a good Christmas movie when the soundtrack makes you cry.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Few Good Words.,"The Polar Express has some of the worst *movie* animation I have seen in a long time. When you compare it to works made by companies such as Pixar(Finding Nemo, The Incredibles)and Dreamworks(Spirit: Stallion Of The Cimarron, Shrek, and Shrek 2), it leaves much to be desired as far as animation goes. Animation is supposed to add to the storyline, not take away from it. I find that this movie cannot hold my interest what so ever because of it's horrible animation, the human characters look as if they have NO bones, they look like rubber when they move. I mean Tom Hanks did Toy Story back in what 1998 and even the animation back then, the animators grasped the concept of movement, true movement, in TOYS people, in TOYS! These are supposed to be people, but god it just hurts to look at. Now little children who don't know any better are not going to care because to them it's all about the story which in a book that is exactly what is should be. In an animated movie it's a partnership, one cannot work without the other. Personally they would of done better if this movie was hand drawn and not 3d animated. As far the book goes, this movie does not do it justice and I certainly wouldn't call this lack of effort ""the best Christmas movie."" It's such a shame.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Key Word 'Faith'......,"To start off I have Not Had the Chance to Read the Book Adaption ever, so this Review is Based off of the Film solely.And with that said to start us off as the Subject Title says I Loved the Message of the film, in particular in the Religious Context. So Much so I even mentioned it in the Church that I Belong to some time way before the COVID outbreak, of course for the purposes of this film it is Santa instead. Then the Next Positive Definitely must be that the Voices that Sang the song 'Spirit Of The Season' for the kids was Beautiful especially for the little Girl. And even the Song itself is Beautiful, and don't for get to mention the scene and context that went along with that song. Then there is the Journey to see Santa was Great it felt Fun had I watched this as a kid I would have found it really exciting and the end is well deserved, I would have called this an Adventure Film that happens to take place on Christmas Eve that's how exciting it was. Then there is the Vibrant Colors for the Film I felt it fits really well for the film. And On a Personal Note I do Like that Reference to A Christmas Carol on of my Favorite Christmas Traditions of all time, so that was really cool. And Finally I thought the Ending was Really Great and Heartwarming, and it even appease to the Religious Side of me. And Unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should be it for the Positives.Now on to the Negatives, to start us off I found that one Nerdy Kid really Unlikable at times and always Annoying in particular during the times when ever he feels he needs to show off his smarts. Then the Next must be I feel the Character Actions and in some ways their Model Feels Very Stiff and Plasticky I don't remember if that was the Best they could do at the time since I wasn't paying attention to that sort of stuff at the time. Then this Next one is kind of a Nip Pick for me but that Hot Chocolate Number was a little too Immature for my Tastes even for Back then, but it's a Film Gears Towards the Younger Crowd so I Guess that one is forgivable. Another Nip Pick for me is that I Wished we got a Mention or maybe even a dialog of the Backstory of that one Lonely and Shy Kid in particular why Christmas Never Works Out for him, and obviously I haven't read the Book growing up and so I'm not sure if they Explained it in the book version or not, but I guess it is what it is. And Unless I'm Forgetting anything else that should be all of the Negatives.Final Thoughts Despite those Flaws I still Think it's more than a Worthy Watch in the Month of December.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Magical Book to Magical Film,"I remember reading this book or it being read to me as a child, and thinking how magical it was. To me, the Polar Express was the predecessor to the Hogwarts Express.I then saw this in IMAX 3D, which was one of, if not the first movie I saw in 3D. And this is one of the few in my opinion where 3D actually enhances the movie. There are a few scenes in particular that are visually jaw dropping or simply thrilling.It delivers on the Christmas feels with the train, North Pole, and Santa's speech and presence. Tom Hanks does an incredible job voicing several characters. The film would not be even close to what it is without Hanks, that being a certified Christmas classic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
An Instant Holiday Classic,"Ever since I was a small child, I've made it a point to watch the stop animation shows like ""A Year Without Santa Claus"", ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"", ""Rudolph's Shiny New Year"", etc. To me, Christmas just isn't Christmas if I haven't watched these classics from the late 60s and 70s. I used to believe they'd stop making shows like those. Well now, a new movie has been added to my list of must-see holiday animation films. ""The Polar Express"" is an instant classic! I just watched it for the very first time today and was totally overwhelmed with emotion and Christmas spirit. I didn't know what I was getting myself into when I decided to watch it on TV, but I didn't want it to end. I cannot believe that this movie got such bad reviews when it first came out in the theaters. I'm guessing that many of the critics are just traditionalists who don't want to accept new concepts.I found the characters to be believable, with depth, and sometimes they seemed to be real people. Sometimes the facial expressions of Hero Boy were not as good as the others, but that's the only thing I saw wrong (and this was a very minor issue). The moral of this story was worthwhile and the movie was worth every minute put into it. And the North Pole as shown here....what a glorious place! I feel like a child again and I wish I could ride the Polar Express one Christmas Eve. What a great movie! I was moved to tears by the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is Joker Approved! Joker approved?,"Warning! If you don't like roller coaster rides don't watch this movie! Good thing is I do! Also if your an adult and you generally don't like kid films find something else to do while the kids watch.I must admit this film is great for kids that question does Santa exist. Not much of the film is intended for adults only those with more experience at being a kid. ;) It has a lot of wow factor and great scenes. The beauty of some of the scenes is really quite breath taken even your children would say, ""WOW!"". Unfortunately those that don't find much in the child videos as entertaining will find it boring and quit lacking.The story is a basic Christmas story but it does have some adult lessons and questions that all children want to know and experience. In this movie an adult can re-live through that part in their life where one questions belief, friendship, courage and many of life's other lessons that so many adults forget. As a kid with over almost two decades of experience,(LOL, I'm 29), I felt transported to early childhood when one is just in awe of Christmas.OK what is Joker approved? Joker is my boyfriend's 10 year old Blue and Gold Macaw. Everything we watch this bird watches. Parrots are very intelligent but are very child like in their behavior. In a nutshell, a perpetual 2yr old! We heard him laugh and react to the movie much like a child would.

So much potential,"A basic summary of what I am about to say: I classify this movie under a category that I like to call ""made for 3D movie.""In other words, the movie was clearly overstuffed with special effects scenes to the point that the movie itself becomes unenjoyable when not viewing in 3D. There are all kinds of camera angles, close ups, and gimmicks that are clearly designed to make you go ""whoa!"" when you are in the IMAX. The tense action scenes do not add to the story but are tedious to watch.The animation quality itself is very bad, as some others may have noted, to the point of being distracting. It looks like video game graphics. The characters just don't seem alive. For 2004, they could have done a lot better.The Polar Express was my favorite book as a child, from the time that I was three years old. I loved that book and the pictures in it, so I came into the movie with high expectations. It turned out to be a bit of a cringefest. I was hoping that the magic of the story alone would have carried it, but it just didn't for me. I will have to just stick to the book until someone makes a halfway decent version on film.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Continues To Grow On Me As A Holiday Institution,"When ""The Polar Express"" was first released in 2004, I all but refused to see it because of the motion-capture animation style I wasn't a huge fan of. When I did finally relent, I pawned it off as little more than a children's romp. But as the film continues to cement itself as a holiday season tradition, I have grown to appreciate what it brings to the table.For a very basic overview, ""The Polar Express"" follows the adventures of a young boy doubting the existence of Santa Claus. One Christmas Eve, a mysterious train destined for the North Pole pulls up in front of the boy's house and he is whisked away on a journey that may change his opinion on the holiday season forever.At heart this is indeed very much a children's movie, albeit one that uses such simple nostalgia to perfection by being holiday-themed (so adults can buy in as well). Directed by Robert Zemeckis, ""The Polar Express"" brims with enough crackling energy that it could easily be mistaken for a Spielberg romp. Not only that, but there is enough ""quirky stuff""--like Tom Hanks inhabiting multiple roles, inventive songs, and some legitimately funny sight gags--so that one is certainly never bored.Truth be told, about the only criticism I have of the movie at this point is that once the titular locomotive reaches its destination, I felt the proceedings lack some of the propulsion (pardon the pun) of the journey. For a 15-20 minute period, it becomes more of a stay-in-place flick--not befitting of the manic energy that produces so much entertainment beforehand. Fortunately, a great ending makes such a dip a relatively minor concern.Overall, I now very much understand why ""The Polar Express"" continues to find its way to cinemas every December. It is a well-made adventure flick that also packs an emotional punch in places. There is something for everyone--from the kiddos to the adults--to enjoy during its runtime. I'm not sure it will ever make my A-1 holiday movie list, but it is an easy/fun watch on a once-a-year basis.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I can't fathom who the audience is for this.,"This movie would scare young children and be viewed as lame and boring to older ones. So, I have to assume the audience for this is adults. It's a rather dark Christmas film which, as others have pointed out, seems to emphasize the belief in getting gifts as the main point of Christmas. All the characters never come across as happy (maybe they're tired after being awakened for a late night train ride), except the main character's sister the next (Christmas) morning. The best developed characters (and best animated ones), the hobo and the conductor, seem to play little role in the main plot line of the film ... particularly the conclusion. The main child characters are poorly animated and uninspired.So, what's left? The scenery is gorgeous, the train ride is exciting, the North Pole is clever, the conductor and hobo characters are well developed and engaging ... unfortunately that leaves us with great background scenery in a movie with a weak plot line and uninspired main characters. I doubt the book suffers from these same issues, and maybe if you've read the book, the weak main characters would not be as obvious. With so many good, fun Christmas films out there, I can't recommend this one.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Children might like it,"I am 50 yrs old, my fiancé is 48. We settled in on Christmas night to watch Polar Express. Her first words was that the animation was kind of eery and spooky. I commented that it was like watching a movie with animation that had the same look and feel of photo's from children's books. Maybe we were too used to the amazing animation from studio's such as Disney's Pixar? We loved CARS, Finding Nemo, Monsters Inc etc. The bottom line was that the animation for Polar Express was just too odd to keep us interested and we turned it off after 20 minutes and switched over to watching ""Cars"" from Pixar. Polar Express may very well be a wonderful movie, and kids might enjoy it. But it just didn't do it for us.

Amazing,"Amazing.I know that the typical format for a film review is to spend ample time writing about the story, the background, the making of the film and maybe even some history on the actors or the director before getting to your opinion. But in the case of The Polar Express, I wanted to save you a lot of time so that maybe you can use the extra minutes to grab a paper and check out the local play times.The Polar Express is nothing less than a stellar achievement in film-making that will instantly become a modern day Christmas classic. Based on the book of the same name by Chris Van Allsburg, the story surrounds a mysterious train that arrives on Christmas Eve to take young boys and girls to the North Pole to help him again believe in the magic of Christmas.With a screenplay written by William Broyles, Jr. and director Robert Zemeckis, the film perfectly casts powerhouse Tom Hanks in no less than five separate roles including the conductor, a hobo, a father, scrooge and even the big man, Santa himself.As a computer animated production, you may raise an eyebrow when I write that Hanks was perfectly cast, but The Polar Express incorporates a new animation technique that allows an actor to act rather than just provide a voice over. This new system has the actor dressed in a suit with strategically placed computer chips that feed back into a computer. Known as 'Performance Capture', this process can capture live action movement, odd angles and even facial expressions that are digitally aped bring us an actor's performance instead of a simple vocal range.What is most surprising is that the actor's animation works so well that you would think that it has been mastered from years and years of evolvement with the process. From every smirk on the conductors face to every hair on the young boys head you get lost in the incredible detail of the production and by the ten-minute mark you will likely completely forget that you are watching a CG-crafted film.But it is not just the actor's movement and expressions that are a crowning achievement in this Christmas classic. The special effects and sound are equally spectacular. Two scenes, one including a ticket that blows out the window and interacts with everything from an eagle to a pack of wolves before magically finding its way back into its owners hands and a visually effective scene of the train trying to outrun the breaking ice of a lake are fascinating and more exciting than any live action perils seen in such summer fare as The Day After Tomorrow.But no highly visual picture can survive without a strong story and The Polar Express stays true to the book in adapting the journey of a group of children to see Santa's lair. The movie focuses mostly on a young boy who has grown older and is at that pinnacle where he no longer truly believes in the magic of the holiday season. His adventure includes meeting a ghost-like hobo that aides him on his quest, a scary cabin car that houses toys to be recycled and three must-be-seen-on-the-big-screen-to-be-enjoyed roller coaster type scenes that are effective enough to have you leaning to the right and left as the screen follows the tracks.This is not the first time that Zemeckis and Hanks have teamed for some movie magic. They have collaborated twice before on Forrest Gump and Castaway and this newest venture makes them the quintessential go-to team in Tinseltown.So whether they work together again in the future or not, at least we can savor their latest venture. The Polar Express is one of the best films of 2004 and can stand beside It's A Wonderful Life as a seasonal classic.Amazing.www.gregsrants.com",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

An Elementary Teacher is disappointed,"For years I have taught an author unit on Chris Van Allsburg. His work is clever, thought provoking and his illustrations wonderfully engaging. So I raced to the the theater on the day ""The Polar Express"" was released.I was thrilled when I saw how true to his vision the movie was! Yes, the dog puppet was on the bedpost, for you Van Allsburg geeks. And then it all went bad.A charming, simple story became silly sequences of Rube Goldberg-like events that served no purpose other than to show off the technology. Needless characters and events were added which only served to bury a beautiful story of belief that reached beyond the commercialization of the season.So I am really hoping that Chris Van Allsburg sold his rights to any artistic control or I have lost faith in one of my heroes.I was still verklempt when the movie reconnected me with my fond memories of the book, but it mamde me angry when I stepped out of the theater and said, ""I hated it!""If you haven't seen the movie, don't.

The Polar Express is worth seeing!,"The first item that everyone needs to remember about the Polar Express ""This is a KIDS MOVIE  not an adult film!""

It is a film of believing and learning what it means to believe in something and never stop believing  ever!Mr. Simanton goes as far as to make a statement that the exciting scenes from the movie have ""...all the tension of an elementary school play about a lost little present.""Mr. Simanton's comments and a few others I have read, compare the movie to other adult films. THIS IS NOT AN ADULT FILM! If you want that type of excitement and drama, go see the ""Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events"".

A child will look at the Polar express and see that it is OK to believe in something that nobody else believes in. An adult that understands what the movie symbolizes will watch the Polar Express in their child's eyes and see Christmas as they remember it from long-long past.My suggestion to Mr. Simanton is stick with reviewing what you know best, adult-themed-films.

A jaded movie from the jaded enchanters,"Robert Zemeckis, in the worst tradition of Steven Spielberg, has made an easily forgettable Christmas movie that brings out the vapid nature in us all. This story is so old and so poorly told that the filmmakers obviously, though not to them, no doubt, were doing it by rote. Zemeckis, who has brought us truly brilliant fare like Back to the Future and Who Framed Roger Rabbit? must have had his brain cells on ice during the Polar Express scripting. I call he and John Williams the jaded enchanters because the film has no soul. It's a formulaic film of 'family magic' and inspiring people to 'believe' who have been at the top of their game (and pocketbooks) for so long that they've lost any touch with the reality that is experienced by actual human beings who live in the real world. The whole feeling of the story is artificial, the characters that are supposed to represent the poor and/or the disenchanted have no ring of truth to them. Again, the sense I have is that these believers have been either too far removed from reality for too long - or, more likely (since I'm sure they are well meaning), they have begun to trust their movie instincts too easily because those close to them aren't going to point out that the emperor is naked.I mention John Williams, incidentally, because he seems to have phoned in the score - his dreadful overuse of crescendos that have been borrowed endlessly from his own work manages to make nothing seem special and of crescendo importance until the crescendo that brings up the credits of those who are guilty of kidnapping our minds and dragging us through this experience.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

An hour too long,"The Polar Express is a wonderful Christmas book, and one would expect the movie to be superb. In some ways, particularly the voice work and beautiful animation, it is. Unfortunately the movie is not faithful to the original story and contains numerous pointless elements not found in the original story apparently added only to provide running time; specifically the protracted train ride (I recommend fast-forwarding through it). In my opinion the book has enough material for a half hour TV special. To justify the making of a full length movie around the book, the original story should have been expanded with character development, which is negligible in this movie, rather than adding superfluous elements that do not enhance the story. Children will likely enjoy the movie, and the message is good - although somewhat veiled. To truly experience the wonder of this story, read the book instead.

The most unique film of the year,"The Polar Express could probably be debated about for a good long time. Funny for an animated Christmas film!! Robert Zemeckis is not new to the idea of a unique film idea. I mean Zemeckis is a master director. He's the mastermind behind The Back To The Future series, three of the best films ever made. But granted this is new territory for him and yet he takes it and makes it his own. Zemeckis and superstar Tom Hanks team up again (the first time being the over rated but not bad film Castaway.) This film puts the final nail in the sign that reads ""TOM HANKS MOST TALENTED ENTERTAINER ALIVE."" There is nothing this man can't do or make us believe or act his way into. This is no exception, animated or otherwise.The film is about a young boy who is reaching that age where you start to realize that perhaps there is no Santa Clause. He is looking into the cold hard facts of the idea of Santa Clause and he's coming up with the realization it doesn't exist. The night of Christmas Eve when everyone else has gone to bed, the young boy stumbles outside of his house and smack into an enormous steam engine. The conductor steps down and invites him onboard to The Polar Express...the train that goes to the North Pole. The boy journey's through treacherous mountains and landscape, meets some other children who become good friends, and finally arrives in The North Pole to meet with Santa Clause himself and receive the first Christmas Present of the year.Story sounds pretty straight forward doesn't it? Nothing overly unique about that? The uniqueness comes from several things. The first is the graphics. The computer animation is brilliant, stunning, beautiful, and jaw dropping. The movements of each character are just flawless and captivating, you can't take your eyes away. The voice overs are so immaculate and Tom Hanks as several different characters breathes incredibly personality into them specifically the train conductor who is a mysterious, yet fun character to enjoy. He's protective of the children but by the book running his train.The actual film making is the key here though. If this were not a Christmas film with a lesson behind it to learn it would almost be too scary for children, it would almost be downright frightful to them. These kids have a harrowing journey through the frozen tundra, there are some extremely nail biting moments. The landscape, Christmas town, and everything in this film is just hauntingly beautiful and a little scary at times. It's different than anything I've ever seen in a film. Even Santa's elves come across as strange and scary at times. I don't think there is anything wrong with this new twist on the Christmas story. Certainly scare tactics are not new to a Christmas story. Take A Christmas Carol for example, almost a horror story at times. The Grinch, and other stories like that. But this story goes even deeper into an underworld of Christmas. One of Hank's characters in the film is a train jumping hobo who helps our hero several times but only to disappear in the snow like a Ghost. It never explains who he is, why he's there or whether or not he is actually a Ghost.The musical score for the film is also beautiful although perhaps only slightly overused at times. As I first began watching the film I thought of what a wonderful achievement it would have been to see this film in live action but as it continued I realized that it's whole heart is in the animation of it. They set up Santa Clause as this hero, a larger than life persona that for the most part we have forgotten about because he has become such an icon of Christmas.The beautiful Christmas music, the original score, the animation, the incredibly story, the action and nail biting sequences, the lovely Christmas lessons learned and the amazing acting voice overs by Hanks this film is timeless and finally a classic worthy of keeping around. I will add this to my Christmas viewing list every year!!! Although short, the film is wonderful for anyone. I insist everyone sees this Christmas classic. If your children are young, be prepared for a little scare but I think they will grow to love it!! I hope this film gets some Academy attention of some sort. 9/10",,Anonymous,Animation
For Children and Christmas Lovers Only,"A young boy is losing his faith on Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, he boards a magical train to the North Pole with other children and has a magical adventure in the land of Santa Claus.I was quite anxious to see ""The Polar Express"", which was nominated for three Oscars, and has another three wins and twelve nominations. The animation is really very beautiful, but although being a fan of animations and cartoons, I found the infantile story highly indicated for children and Christmas lovers only. I myself was very bored after 60 minutes running time. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""O Expresso Polar"" (""The Polar Express"")",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Believe,"I will always love The Polar Express. I remember when my parent would read me the book every December, and ever since I saw the movie, I no longer watch it every year on Christmas Eve. I would wear the blue robe, make hot chocolate, and sing along to songs like Hot Chocolate, When Christmas Comes to Town, The Polar Express, and Believe. Then, at the end of the movie, I would start to cry when I heard the bell, Billy made some new friends, the soundtrack music, and at the end of the film, when the conductor said what gets me every time was ""Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Rolling, Rolling, Rolling Down an Ice Sheet.","All-world film director Robert Zemeckis goes the animated feature route here with this highly interesting, but ultimately under-achieving little holiday picture. A young boy and a group of other children are invited to ride the titled vehicle as they all try to hold on to the belief that there really is a Santa Claus. An achingly simple and pretentious story-line with ho-hum cinematic executions almost sinks the landmark animation and articulate technological innovations. Tom Hanks tries his best by playing the voices to no fewer than five characters, but all the parts are so flat and under-developed that their three dimensional forms seem almost pedestrian. The character generation imagery is so life-like that it toes the line on being down-right spooky and even a bit disturbing. Fine effort and still a noble work, but really this had the potential to be lots more than it actually is. 4 stars out of 5.",,Anonymous,Animation
Sweetened version of Final Fantasy,"Animation reality is (almost) as good as Final Fantasy though, obviously, not as dark. However, certainly has an 'edge' to the movie. Not your typical holiday fluff. Tom Hanks proves his ranger once again and does another incredible job, especially as the ghostly hobo and conductor - to be honest, until I read the credits I did not know he was the character behind the boy also. Though not with the Hollywood'd theatrics, I am sure this movie will entice many to check out the 'real' Polar Express, a train that departs from Cochrane, Alberta (Canada) and goes north to the Arctic - unfortunate that same does not travel in the winter.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
$9.00 wasted,"I bought this one for the child in my life and we watched it together tonight. This one breaks all the boundaries of what a child's movie should be about. I could not find a moral lesson if there was one for it feeds into the materialistic wants of the season which is exactly what Christmas has come to mean to many of us. Believe in your presents, folks, it is all, it is everything. I couldn't find a story anywhere and the beginning has to be one of the creepiest ever. This weird conductor wheedling children on to a train. Right, when every child that is streetproofed would run and scream loudly if such a conductor even beckoned from a distance. The computer animation is extraordinary but wears out quickly as the characters are so downright odd. Huge eyes, dark lips and unemotional and eerily plastic hair. Ugh. Frightening scenes of heads exploding, trains out of control with children screaming in terror, a nazi-like Santa Claus surrounded by mini-Nazis all doing and running frantically, only stopping to sing a Christmas version of ""Hail to the Chief"" as he emerges from his hibernation. Singing and dancing out of nowhere with no purpose, a funny old odd fellow sitting with a fire on the roof of the train drinking his sockwater. A travesty. Avoid. 3 out of 10.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Polar 3D WOW,"Went to see this film at Imax cinema Bristol in 3D. My comments are probably biased but the visual experience was just wonderful. Particularly the runaway train sequences. Gosh you were right in there. But apart from the visuals, the story was good and the characters were well defined. There was also some effective humour adult style.Tom Hanks provided the perfect voices. This is a children's film that is magical for adults too. The CGI effects were brilliant. It wasn't cutesy cutesy but made you feel that there is a better world out there that we can all find. Yes there was a tear in my eye by the end. I would recommend this film to anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A very weird movie,"This movie is beautiful on the surface, but it has a very large subtext that is totally ignored by the characters. For example: why are the elves Jewish? They all have New York City accents and they use Yiddish words, and they all have trade mark noses. (I am a Jew). Why are two of the children on the train the very children who would have the biggest doubts about Christmas: the Jerry Lewis clone (another stereotypical Jew) and the poverty-stricken little boy who had never had a Christmas -- completely ignored and only the WASP kid from Minnesota got a Lesson of some very vague kind? Why was the Black girl there, except to heap more unhappiness on the poor kid by burbling about how Christmas is about parties, gifts, decorations and, in fact, commercialism -- and why does she remain clueless when clearly the poor child is made more unhappy by her burbling? Is she the PC version of the vacuous little rich girl?And why does the North Pole look like North Philly, with Muzak on a 45 rpm record thrown in? Who would relate to that?I enjoyed this movie for the visuals, but I would not take a child over the age of 8 to see it. They will ask way too many questions and you won't be able to give them any answers.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Foggy Christmas,"""The Polar Express"" isn't a regular animation movie. That said, do not take your kids under eight years old. Robert Zemeckis inspired a darker trip into the night of Christmas, more mystical and zen.The graphics are interesting, different. With the motion capture animation it continues giving the film an eerie atmosphere. There is a crashing feeling of loneliness and obscurity throughout the film. It's very interesting to see at night; and be consumed by the excellent atmosphere. I have rare goosebumps at watching this movie, it's potent and envelops the viewer to its dark atmosphere. The technical details are fabulous, the message is rather bleak. But I'll say it's marvelously told and composed.It's not ordinary. ""Polar Express"" hinders on not falling in common places, and exposing messages of inner child composition to make the movie worthwhile.It's a relevant trip, dare buy the ticket and take it.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Timeless,"Robert Zemeckis' self-indulgent, narcissistic masterpiece is entirely computer-animated and the enormous expense is all right up there on the screen, every penny of it. It's consistently in your face and (at least when seen on an IMAX screen in 3-D) frequently overwhelming--it's presented in a relentlessly showoffy manner. But it's also completely heartfelt and as moving as Zemeckis' best work, the sublime 'Cast Away' (itself one of the finest American films of the decade). The specialized CGI bravura is clearly the thing here, with well-thought, exciting and cleanly realized set pieces that take the nascent technical form to the limit. (A short section involving a floating train ticket is one of the most brilliantly realized examples of animation-any animation-ever created.) Based on the cherished children's book by Chris Van Allsburg in which a young boy who has ceased to believe in the magic of Santa Claus is whisked away on the titular train to the North Pole to restore his faith, it will delight and dazzle children of all ages and religious persuasions. But Zemeckis has become one of cinema's most sincere seekers and he concludes the film with a bittersweet questioning of the faith he has asked his audience to accept, noting that time--his primary passion in 'Cast Away'--and adulthood require the magic of innocent conviction to fade and be recalled simply as one of the components necessary to shape a life. Tom Hanks plays five roles that have been animated and they're some of the best he's played in quite a while, particularly the loving, no-nonsense Conductor that allows him to layer a humorously transparent veil of gruffness over the honest compassion he has styled his career upon. The magnificent Deco grandeur and elegance of the Polar Express itself and the North Pole workshops, by Rick Carter and Doug Chiang, fits effortlessly into Zemeckis' design of remembrance of things past. 'The Polar Express' should have no trouble being accepted as a holiday classic but time will reveal it to be what it truly is: the efforts of a master craftsman not only at the forefront of scientific methods to create art but with a yearning to explore the timeless qualities of being human.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Recommended as a Christmas classic,"I was shocked, surprised and flabbergasted by the negativity I heard on Keyframe.com. My Mom and I saw it in the theatre and I thought it is a wonderful Christmas film.

Overall, it is a beautiful movie with wonderful characters and a truly heart-warming story. It has it's equal share of surprises, seriousness, amusement and emotion.

Not a great message to start with, but okay.

Great Christmas Movie,I found the DVD of THE POLAR EXPRESS for a cheap price in a discount shopping and I didn't hesitate to buy it. I watched it with my four year old son and my wife and we all loved it. At the end my son wanted to see it again and again. The story is very well developed for children and adults and every detail is studied very carefully. There is everything that a child is dreaming during Christmas time. THE POLAR EXPRESS is a great adventure trip with a marvelous train and the audio and the special effects are great. I agree with one critic that the best time to see it is at the beginning of December or at Santa Clause time.

"Too Much, yet not Enough,  of  a Good Thing","In 1985 sculptor Chris Van Allsburg published his first children's book, THE POLAR EXPRESS, which became an instant classic, especially appropriate for family reading during the holidays. The beauty of the book was not only a simple story about a lad's discovery of the real meaning of Christmas, but also the power of Allburg's glorious art - which was awarded with the Caldecott Medal in 1986.Some of that book is retained and some of that is lost in this grossly overproduced, extravagantly expensive, film transition of the book. For reasons only known to director Robert Zemeckis, who also adapted the story for his film, and to his long time friend Tom Hanks, the decision was made to make not just an animated feature and not a computer enhanced film using actors, but a strange amalgamation of the two. We are seeing puppet-like characters morphed to resemble real people - and that must have caused the animators headaches but earned big money! But despite the bigger than life extravaganza version of basically an intimate story, the theme comes through and the message is sweet. Whether the 'fillers' heavily frosted on this version are additive is up to the taste of the viewer. But it is a tour de force for Hanks who plays almost everyone in the film, and it is evident that the film's heart is in the right place. Grady Harp",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A brilliant Christmas film!,"The Polar Express (2004) follows a young boy as he boards a train to the North Pole on Christmas Eve. This is a really sweet film that is a must watch around Christmas time! It's incredibly engaging with great characters and brilliant animation!This is a very visually beautiful film and has a lot of bright and eye-catching shots. The animation is very very good and still holds up to this day, I know it divides people but I personally love it and find it to be so unique compared to other animated films that came out in the early 2000s.One of the most recognisable elements of this film is the score, and for good reason! The score is iconic and really manages to pull on the heart strings. It adds to the emotions and tension! Also, the sound design was great too and really well mixed.The film has some really in-depth characters that are really well written! The main character is very likeable and genuinely kindhearted, a great role model for children, and the train conductor is funny and iconic. Tom Hanks' voice acting is absolutely brilliant and he really brings the characters to life!The movie is paced quickly and very consistently, making it thoroughly engaging and enjoyable. It also has a lot of tense moments too, that really get the audience on the edge of their seat! It definitely doesn't lack emotional moments either, and never fails to make me cry!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
If That Background Winter Scene on YouTube was a 3D Roller Coaster,"Visually, this movie is entertaining. I put it on in the background for my son so he can look up every time something exciting happens. Plot-wise, it's hard to keep interest. The book is a classic but they just didn't capture the magic here. They rely too heavily on ""roller coaster"" scenes because it would otherwise be hard to stretch this story to a full length movie. Ironically, those are the only scenes I watch now, just to see the snowy landscapes and listen to the quiet. There are also a lot of things that don't make sense just to create a reason for the kid to move around the train and get in trouble. The conductor takes the girl to the back of the train to walk along the roof to get to the front?? Sue, why not? Moreover, the acting tries to convince you that the stakes are high but they're just not. A lost FREE ticket gets you thrown off the train?? And the conductor acts legitimately pissed about it. It feels like the writers and producers got too caught up in the excitement of the new motion capture technology, and skimped on a plot that would actually do the source material justice.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
It Rang My Bell!,"When a young boy goes to bed doubting the existence of Santa Claus, he has no idea what is install for him that night. His bedroom rumbles as a large train pulls into his front yard and he goes outside to see what could possibly be going on. Should he board the monster? His curiosity gets the best of him and he is off on a roller-coaster adventure that will touch his life forever.I find it interesting that the only character with an identifiable name is Santa Claus. Even our young hero is called just that, ""Hero Boy,"" in the credits. Other major characters are the Conductor, Hero Girl, Lonely Boy, and Know-It-All. And you know, those identifications are all that is necessary -- nowhere in the film did I need a name for a character to know exactly who was being spoken to or about. More stories could use the same simplicity.I watched this movie with 7 other people ranging in ages from my 6-year-old niece to her 43-year-old father, and her 76-year-old grandmother.

The BEST Christmas film for children,"The film is based on a short, beautifully illustrated children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. The film extends the book significantly by adding characters and events that add more drama and nostalgia to the story, many new elements reminiscent of Dickens' A Christmas Carol.By contrast, 2018 saw The Incredibles 2 and Wreck It Ralph 2, both heavily tainted with sexism and overtly nasty politics intended to hurt young children. How rapidly the world has deteriorated for the worse at the hands of Disney!If you're looking for a meaningful children's story that stands the test of time, that isn't nasty or sexist and isn't designed to hurt children, The Polar Express is your film. However, I would warn that this film may be frightening for very young or extremely sensitive little ones. If they could watch Dickey's classic, they could comfortably watch this film.If you're looking to escape the unprecedented nastiness of Disney that escalated in 2018, this is the film for you. The film is politically correct free. There is no divisiveness, no ridiculing social groups, and no sexism. This is a wonderful movie filled with values of sharing, caring, believing and respect with a dose of scepticism and caution. All of these values are totally lost in modern Disney films.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

3 is generous!,"From the start there is far too much Hanks and at his most annoying. Don't misunderstand me, he is a very talented man and his roles such as 'Forrest Gump' (1994) and his police officer in 'The Green Mile' (1999) for instance are superb, even his Woody is pretty impressive (Tee Hee), but his exaggerated tenor tone just had me expecting him to tell the lead boy, who for some reason remains nameless throughout, ""You are a toy!"". Then to give him 6 parts in total just seemed like they were trying to save money, because it didn't enhance the experience, but actually somewhat muddied the waters of understanding instead. I had no idea what we were supposed to gather from his portrayal of the drifter as well as Claus and the Trains Ticket Collector. Was he Father Christmas all along?I didn't like the computerised treatment either, for me it's grim and not well done. Another reviewer commented on the dead look in the characters eyes and they're not wrong, dull and lifeless and actually quite creepy.The waiter scene is weird and the hobo scene incredibly unbelievable. In fact it seemed like the thrills and rides were only for effect and not to enhance the storyline, which was pretty meh to start with and actually had the potential to be something great. I mean can you imagine what a train ride to see Saint Nick at the North Pole would really be like? I'd hope it was nicer and more enjoyable than this vision. It could have been written and handled so much better.The elves are sinister and Father Christmas reminds me of Professor Snape from Harry Potter.Josh Groban's song should have been sung by somebody with a more joyful and toneful voice too.This film could have been so much more magical and absolutely failed to hit the mark for me.A very dark film in many ways and quite a bit miserable too.311.45/1000.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

What family traditions are built on.,"This story is a wonderful story and the movie does it great justice! It's a fantasy journey that keeps you wondering where it's going while keeping the kids entertained. In the end, the pay-off is there with a wonderful way to encompass the 'Christmas Spirit'. It has something for everyone because it gives a deep meaning to the spirit of Christmas but doesn't necessarily detract from the true meaning of Christmas, which is Jesus Christ and all the religion that surrounds Him. The first time I watched it, I wasn't sure what I was experiencing because I didn't read the book. I therefore didn't let myself get too involved for fear that it might take away from the true meaning of Christmas. What a wonderful surprise when it didn't!

I even like the scenes where the kids are served hot chocolate, the Hobo and the boy skiing on the roof, the train going down glacier gulch, the wide observation car ride, the ride in Santa's sack, and Santa giving out the first gift of Christmas.This movie is one of the best Christmas movies and it is fun to watch it as a family, and see it in theaters when it is rereleased.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"An amusement park, not a movie","How very disappointing. I was hoping for a Christmas movie with a ""spirit of Christmas"" type story about heart & warmth & spirit and instead I got a mechanical look at people riding a roller coaster. I've never read the book so I can't say how the story compares, but in this film there is no story. None, nada, zero, zip. Not one iota of plot at all.Here it is: kid gets on train. Train is a roller coaster and goes up down around trough over under left right etc. Kid winds up on roof as tunnel approaches. Somewhere in the middle of this there is a weird dance sequence where hot chocolate is served. The train arrives at the North Pole and main kids get lost and wind up in Santa's gift processing machine which is yet another amusement park ride, this time a slide. Kids meet Santa and go home.There are no characters in the traditional sense, thus no character development. The dialog is minimal as most of the movie focuses on the roller coaster's ... I mean train's ... trip to the north pole using stunning visuals and impossible camera angels. I suppose it's all very exciting but it leads up to... nothing.The ""BIG MESSAGE"" at the end is simple ""believe in Christmas."" Nothing revelatory here. And given the not-quite lifelike people populating the film, it's hard to get any kind of human message. The visuals are stunning, but the people are still not quite there yet. And this too-smooth, glossy mechanical look kills any ability to empathize with the characters. This might have worked better as a traditional 2D animated film or using more stylized human figures.Overall, a maddeningly disappointing film from one of my favorite directors.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Incredible IMAX Experience,I saw this film at my local IMAX cinema with my two children 7 & 9. The visual effects in IMAX are absolutely out of this world. You feel as though you are actually there.The film is so highly detailed it is possible to look away from the main action and pick up some other detail in the surrounding scene.The film is truly magical. It is a mixture between a fairy tail and an action film. The hugely impressive scenes of the train traveling through the arctic are awe inspiring.However in IMAX even the small details like the snow falling are very engaging.,9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A freaky midnight train ride,"Some poorly animated child Santa sceptics board a midnight steam train to the North Pole to have their belief tested, only to have their lives continuously and unnecessarily put in grave danger during a series of disturbing and nightmarish scenarios, while in the company of some unfriendly and strangely threatening characters.An eery and sinister Christmas nightmare for none of the family to enjoy.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the 10 greatest Christmas films of all time,"It is madness to rate this movie less than 10 stars. Why? This movie is what magic is all about. It would have been amazing to see this with real people however being an animated film it is one of the greatest animated Christmas films along with about 30 other ones such as Jim Carey's A Christmas Carol. The music score is an absolute Lord of the Rings masterpiece and makes my eyes water every time I hear it. The imagination behind the train, it's route, and the north pole are just a timeless work of art. This film screams holiday classic. There is so much element and mood that it's as if you are a kid sneaking out in the snow to go on your own adventure. This film is 10 stars plus. It should have won best picture and music score in 2004. It is pure movie escapism and an absolute feat of filmmaking magnificience. I can watch this film 50 times during Christmas and it never loses it's magic. Bravo to Robert Zemeckis on this because he will be remembered as the genius to bring this book to life. Any kid would love this film. It's too good to find anything wrong with it at all. Goes beyond what's in the book by leaps and bounds. S A Storyteller",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
a movie to be remembered,"the movie addresses the child in each of us, not to mention the perpetual desire for adventure . it opens the gates of the fantasy world on Christmas eve where our little heroes pass through fantastic adventures that can never be found in reality. it takes you in a breathtaking journey full of excitement, anticipation , surprise and a little bit of fear where the characters come to rediscover themselves and find the best in them.the movie , which is narrated through the eyes of a child , manages to create the atmosphere of the fairy tale , it captures the Christmas spirit of innocence, happiness , reconciliation and peace where nobody can be treated as a recluse or left to suffer loneliness on this holy night. it highlights the sense of collectivity and above all faith or ""belief"" in the better which is yet to come. one of my favourite parts was the presents factory, i like that feeling of being showered with gifts - this is a main feature of Christmas.the animation together with the visual and audio effects in the movie were superb. i've watched the making of the movie, with tom hanks putting sensors all around his body to copy every detail of his performance on the conductor's character. the idea of making an animated copy of hanks is really great. besides, zemeckis together with his crew tried their best to give a human texture to the cartoon characters as much as possible, and they succeeded to a great extent. apart from the characters, the whole setting was incredibly real.the soundtrack contributed to the Christmas atmosphere which wrapped the whole movie particularly the final song ""believe"" since it is performed by my favourite singer ""josh groban"" and carries an important moral message to both adults and children.",,Anonymous,Animation
One of the Worst Christmas Movies Ever Made,"I rewatched this movie for the first time in years with my husband this past holiday season and it was honestly one of the biggest cinematic monstrosities I've ever seen.Firstly, the motion capture animation is something that nightmares are made of. It was beyond the means of the time and aged so poorly.Secondly, the nerdy kid is the worst kind of stereotyping I've ever seen in a movie. He was so irritating I almost turned the movie off. Luckily, it was like a train wreck (pun intended) and I couldn't look away so I continued.There is so much more I could say about this movie. The creepy Santa, the old man elves that sent shivers down my spine, the homeless man that lived on top of the train, or the train conductor that was so MEAN to all the children HE picked up voluntarily. I will never be watching this movie again and will not be showing it to my children.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
I watch it every Christmas,"Robert Zemenkis is well known for directing some of the greatest live action movies of all time. Back to the Future trilogy, Forrest Gump, Cast Away, but he has also done a few animated movies, and the one most people will point to first is ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit."" And while I do really enjoy Roger Rabbit I have to say that I like The Polar Express more, and I'm surprised that a lot of people dislike it, personally, I watch it every Christmas.Whenever someone critiques this film, they will mention how the animation on the human's is creepy, almost zombiish. And they are technically right, the eyes are a little weird and the skin is a little too pasty. But remember, this was the first time a full motion capture film was made. Plus it may try a little too hard to be a Christmas classic, I don't really think they needed a song, it's just there to make it more wimsical. Other than that, it's all nitpicking.Any piece of animation that isn't a human is amazing, it still looks fantastic, the colors, the detail, the amount of stuff going on at the same time. And even though the characters look a little zombieish, I still like them, they're likable, they're funny, and the fact that Tom Hanks plays like half the characters makes this one of the most likable movie's ever made. It's also a really good adabtation, everything from the book is mentioned but they also add fun little additions. Some of it may feel like filler, but I still enjoy it. And it's got a great feel to it, this movie feels like a Christmas movie, and not some cash grab.I watch The Polar Express every Christmas, I know it's a mixed bag with some people, but if you can get over the aged character design than it's a very enjoyable Christmas film that adds to the book it was based on.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A joyful Christmas ride....My favorite Christmas movie,"This is my favorite Christmas movie of all time. The Polar Express is a 2004 computer-animated film written, produced, and directed by Robert Zemeckis. This movie has everything that you are looking for in a Christmas movie. An amazing movie that is studded with stunning visuals, great music, excellent characters, and most of all a delightful storyline. The animations in this movie is done by ""Live action motion capture technology"".This is the story of a doubtful young boy on Christmas Eve who boards on a powerful magical train that's headed to the North Pole and Santa Claus's home. This film takes its viewers on a delightful train ride which shows that the wonder of life never fades for those who believe. The characters,the surrounding atmosphere,the train and most of all the Santa are beautifully depicted and they are eye catching.

Better than Christmas With The Kranks (2004),"I find The Polar Express (2004) is an awesome Christmas movie, Because the story is very interesting and it's based on the American Yuletide storybook by Chris Van Allsburg from the year 1985. Also it's very heartwarming and adventurous as well. The voice acting is amazing. The Characters are interesting as well. Tom Hanks did the amazing job as The Train Conductor of The Polar Express, The Hero Boy as the Narrator, The Hero Boy's Father, The Hobo and Santa Claus. The moral of this movie is very interesting as well. It's a better Christmas Movie from the year 2004 compared to Christmas With The Kranks (2004). I'm giving this a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Quickly becoming a Christmas staple,"Along the same lines of ""It's A Wonderful Life"", ""Miracle on 34th Street"", ""A Christmas Story"", and ""Home Alone"", Robert Zemekis' ""Polar Express"" is quickly gaining ground as a Christmas staple film. I must admit to being less than overwhelmed the first time I saw it. Although the animation was unbelievably realistic, I found the pacing to be slow and drawn out and I felt the movie ran out of gas long before the kids made it to The North Pole. then something happened......I watched it again with my kids one frosty December night a couple of Christmas's ago and I started to like it. I guess it is just one of those films that have to grow on you. Suddenly I began to ask the kids if they wanted to watch it again and again as the holiday drew nearer. Then last Christmas, we watched it on the first Sunday in December and we are going to watch it again on the first Sunday in December.It is simply a warm, embracing family film full of joy and life that truly captures the mind of a child when they think about Christmas and what the holiday means to them.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A fantastic Christmas movie.,"THE POLAR EXPRESSI love this movie... I watch it every Christmas.It is a great story of a kid who starts to disbelieve in Santa, until one Christmas eve a train pulls up outside his house, even though there are no train tracks, and takes him on an adventure on the way to the North Pole.The animation is really good and the voice acting was also good in most places. Tom Hanks plays about 3 or 4 people, but unfortunately, no matter how much he tries to change his voice, it is always going to sound like Tom Hanks.The colours and Christmassy scenes in the movie are beautiful.

What I found to be nightmarish is that I was fully cognizant that this film was done via ""motion capture"" (not to be confused with stop motion) CGI.HOWEVER I'm having nightmares of being in some world where everyone looks like a mannequin.The attempt to be so realistic, and to even go so far to make Tom Hanks look like Tom Hanks just made it feel like I was in a wax museum where the figures come to life.Mixing this style in with alien entities and integrating them into Marvel movies or Golumn in LOTR is much more appropriate than creating an environment around very human yet inhuman looking characters...like lifeless corpses embalmed.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

Another one of Tom Hanks amazing movies!,"I have discovered on this web site, that Tom Hanks plays many people on this wonderful film. Its truly amazing that he can make all those voice changes. From the deep voice of old saint Nick and the higher and more childish voice of the hero boy.The director of this film I am sure added a lot more stuff than the usuaul book of the Polar Express. Like the Hobo I think. There is hardly anything wrong with the movie goof-wise thats good. Unlike other movies where there is a lot more.In my opinion this movie is filled with fun,suspense and somewhat funny too This is truly one of Tom Hanks better movies. It has a great story-line and all of the parts of the movie fit into the ending. Like he couldn't hear the sound of the bells unlike the hero girl and the lonely boy. But then when he actually saw old saint nick in front of him he finally believes. And he will believe forever.Remember everyone: BELIEVE",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Why,"Early on in The Polar Express, the main character is reading a book about the North Pole, and he quotes a line that describes the place as ""Stark, barren. Devoid of life."" If that doesn't describe most of the animation here, I don't know what else could.I'm writing about Robert Zemeckis' animated movies shortly, and while there's no way in hell I'm watching another Christmas Carol movie (there are too many Christmas Carol movies, and he did one in 2009) or his recent Pinocchio movie, I did check out Beowulf (it looked fascinating and weird; it wasn't great) and The Polar Express (it was worse). Felt like I had to do my research, because this one seems to get held up as the holy grail of uncanny valley movies.I think it deserves that reputation. The human characters largely look terrible, and occasionally even repulsive. Zemeckis clearly could make a fully CGI/motion capture movie in 2004, but maybe he should've stopped to wonder whether he should make a fully CGI/motion capture movie in 2004. He's a filmmaker who's done some amazing stuff with special effects, and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, while not 100% animated, does have plenty of animation and is a technical masterpiece. But I don't know what he was thinking throughout the 2000s.Much of this movie's nightmare fuel. A good chunk of it's boring. There are a couple of extended sequences mostly devoid of human characters that I actually liked (the ticket flying through the air scene and the train skidding on the ice part). I also find myself hating Christmas movies more and more as I get older- mauve Christmas in general, in all honesty. So even if I saw this in 2004, when I was just 9 years old, I still don't think I would've liked it much.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

I especially loved that it's a trip to the North Pole which would invariably travel through my home country Canada. The wolves that chase the train, the eagle that flies above...

The true meaning of Christmas is in your heart,"I read a review by another IMDb user who compared the look of the film to illustrations in old children's books, the ones that, for certain generations, bring back warm and much- cherished memories, and while The Polar Express didn't exactly knock my socks off like I expected it would, this is exactly what it looks like, and that kind of aesthetic appeal can go a long way.The story involves an urgent Christmas time emergency. A young boy lies quietly in his bed on Christmas Eve, as the story begins, and pores over doubts in his mind about the existence of Santa Claus. Enter The Polar Express, a magical train designed for just such an emergency. The conductor, in the film's defining moment, calmly urges the astonished boy, ""I think you should get on the train.""There are definite roller coaster moments which, for all of the movie's thematic cleverness, remind us periodically that this is meant to be a good ride, thrilling us with the stomach- turning train travel as much as with the brilliant animation and entirely new form of acting.This new kind of acting and animation is done through something that I believe is called performance capture, where the actors really act out the scenes that they are in, and using a gigantic number of sensors placed over the actor's face and body, the performance is then entered into the computer, and Tom Hanks can be turned into a whole host of characters in the same movie. I believe he plays five parts in this movie.What I love about the movie is that it doesn't give us a sugary confection when we get to the North Pole. Santa is not jolly old St. Nick here, he's a businessman with a lot of employees. Tiny employees, but also not cute little elves either. Even the reindeer look like real animals, that grunt and snort and, gasp, may even have bodily functions!There were some points where I felt that the character of the conductor was a little too abrasive, even mean. I appreciate that the movie doesn't shoot for your traditional Christmas movie, opting instead to add some excitement and even be a little scary, but at some times the effort to do this became a little transparent and we get something where the conductor just comes off as a jerk.Then again, I should mention that it is ironically because of things like this that the movie is so watchable, and re-watchable. I've heard some people worry about what this new method of capturing performances will mean in the future (I know that some people are, for some reason, worried that actors will some day literally be able to ""phone-in"" their performances), although that doesn't exactly strike me as a valid concern. It seems like an addition to the art, rather than a corruption. Either way, it's a pretty exciting ride!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm reviewing this in MAY of 2023!!! Why? 3D Talk...,"It's a CHRISTMAS FILM to be sure, yet somehow I found myself here reading ""The Polar Express"" reviews in May, funny what we humans do at times.I saw this NOT at the cinema & not in 3D (at first) and although the story is the MAIN appeal, it's a lovely & engaging one, concerning how perhaps the MAGIC of Christmas becomes diminished over time with some...Thankfully, I'm somewhat of a kid at heart still, so I liked it & that magic is still there with me, BUT...there WAS still, SOMETHING OFF...about this FIRST of it's KIND film & I can understand how others saw this & have commented on it here & stated in no uncertain terms that they didn't like it because of it, it can be a little jarring at first.So, whilst the rendering of the Train, the Wildlife, the Snow & the Countryside are all good, when it comes to the FACE CAPTURE scenes it has to be said that there's a clear problem regarding these, it's now some decades later & these have almost been perfected now so these problems are less now, but these here (created back in 2004 as a first) need time to get used too.It was at first a LOVE, HATE film for me...Loved everything about it except the HUMAN CHARACTERS or rather the WAY THEY LOOKED, although curiously enough not so much with the Tom Hanks character as the Train's ticket conductor or the Old 'Magical' Tramp type also found on the train, they somehow worked for me regardless of their rending...it's like they were like this as part of being the magical, different aspect to the film.Here's the thing, I later I bought this on Blu-Ray & so clearly the quality was much better than the DVD but it also came with the ability to play a 3D version (some love 3D whilst others clearly don't) the ordinary Blu Ray disc makes little difference as to if you will enjoy this film more, it's sharper but the same character renderings are here even in sharper detail (so this may drive some away even more) although I have found that over time, if you watch this film ENOUGH TIMES it may just be that you grow to (if not like) the rendering of the Human Characters then at least be able to cope with them more, having understood it was a first & that the STORY remains the main appeal...My Blu Ray copy of this was an early version & was the 3D anaglyph version, so yeah, those carboard blue & red lenses types & although there are clear faults at times with this version, it's a version I have LOVED the most...Do we get ghosting at times with the outlines of things & characters? We sure do, in fact, I would say for approx. 25% of it it's running times we get these, especially with multiple characters on the train (understandable) and yet I can forgive it this & the colour we obviously use given these old style 3D type glasses because amazingly...It equalises the characters renderings somewhat...I wonder if anyone else having watched this 3D version of this film has ever seen or felt this to be the case...
It becomes easier to live with the character renderings this way more & although the eyes feel tired after watching this anaglyph old 1950's version of 3D it works for me & is the way I've always watched it during the lead up to Christmas.I'm aware that a 3D version was later released using the TRUE 3D glasses type, which one assumes would clean up such ghosting? As these glasses are much different...
We had a 3D TV & true 3D Blu Ray but sadly by the time this version showed up for sale, our 3D TV had gave up the GHOST ;) sorry couldn't resist, so although we have a number of 3D blu ray discs we have nothing to play 'em on.Some modern Home Projectors have the capability to play such 3D Blu Ray films still when coupled up to the 3D Blu Ray players?I have no idea if it's just as simple as that? Or if you need extra synch type stuff to enable you to do so?Hopefully someone will read this & clear up such things for others & myself....but for now...This anaglyph 3D Blu Ray disc version is the way I shall continue to watch this truly magical, charming Christmas film (it has it's faults but like I said, strangely for me at least, it also levels up some of those original problems some have with the character renderings, by using through these types of 3D glasses they do seem to lessen such things & the depth draws you in even more, especially on a bigger screen)Now where did I leave that bell ;) yup I own a Polar Express Bell & I can here it ring :)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lifeless and spread ridiculously thin...,"Wow. I never thought Zemeckis and Hanks could produce something so...boring.The Polar Express is not only predictable (which can be forgivable, but not here...), it has no likable characters, and besides some eye candy, it really has nothing going for it at all. What initially appeared to be a visually spectacular film was actually lifeless. The characters look awkward and dull, and nothing great is really done with the scenery (besides a small handful of moments on the train). Most of the action ends up being theme-park driven POV action. Fun, for a couple of seconds, but without a motion simulator, it tires easily. The fact that it is repeated throughout some three to four times does nothing to up the ante.I'm sure the book had much charm, but as a fully fledged feature film, it is such a small story that is spread so thin that really, it becomes apparent that this should have been a thirty-minute short film - made for holiday TV viewing. Sure, it somewhat captures the ""spirit of Christmas"", but certainly not in any fun way. They really needed to take a page out of Pixar's book - develop a story which doesn't bore and characters that are well-rounded, FUN and likable.Forget this turkey and watch the Grinch again...",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Classic,"I have always been a huge fan of animated movies and television series, (both ones made through traditional methods and CGI), so when the trailers were out for Polar Express, it didn't take too long for my interests to be piqued. Unfortunately, up until now when I picked up my copy of Polar Express at HMV, I never got around to seeing it.The animation, in a word, is superb -- from the hair of the characters, to the Polar Express itself, to the the detail in the snow. The storyline was equally enthralling. I enjoyed seeing how one thing always lead to another and then back again. This movie touched me more than I even thought it would. Without a doubt, it is up there on my list as a true Christmas classic, right up there with ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and the 1947 version of ""Miracle on 42nd Street.""I recall reading the story many moons ago when I was a little girl in school.

Doesn't quite get the job done,"I didn't really know what to expect when I went to ""Polar Express."" All I knew of it was what I saw in the trailer. While watching it, I struggled with the urge to ask the people I went with, ""What, exactly, is the point of this film?"" I struggled, because the point is obvious. It's your basic ""faith-in-Santa"" story, which is fine. What I later realized was that this was quite a large effort to put forth such a small idea. I would liken it to building a skyscraper to house a newspaper stand. A lot of expense and effort went into the film, but it really didn't make it any better than it would have been had there just been a small cast of actors doing the same story.The only exceptions to me are the roller-coaster effects of animation when the train is traveling, which is quite nice, but not so over-the-top that it will make your stomach drop. I thought that was well done.But even the animation was wanting. Having watched ""The Incredibles"" the night before, I think I prefer my animated characters to act animated - not pretend to move as humans. I honestly found the animation a little creepy because things just weren't right. It got downright sloppy when it came to the boy they picked up on the wrong side of the tracks. When he began chasing the train, and was brought on board, the lengths and movement of his arms was very odd.Ultimately, I didn't really find the movie or its characters very endearing, or anything close to resembling an instant holiday classic. It was a small story that had a lot of generally superfluous action and other crap tacked on to make it last 90 minutes. It seemed much longer.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A Norman Rockwell painting come to life in a weird and wonderful vision of  the North Pole, Santa, and Christmas.","Watched it for the first time tonight and thoroughly enjoyed it once I started to appreciate the strangeness of it all; a Norman Rockwell painting come to life in a weird, wonderful, dream. Stripped of its visual ornamentation the story reveals itself to be, like all good children's Christmas stories, timeless in its simplicity. Its overall effect lingers for a bit after viewing; like being in a childlike fugue of Christmas spirit.As years go by and it continues to age I imagine what many criticized it for upon its release, it's singularly unusual visual style, will become, or continue to become, one of its more endearing traits.

I don't get the hype,"So, I had never watched the polar express as a kid, but I decided to watch it the other day, simply because I hear people raving about it all the time, and I wanted to see what it was all about. I didn't really have any opinions going in of loving it or hating it. That being said, I didn't even finish it. I'm not usually picky about movies- I'll watch corny movies, old movies, movies with bad effects, and still enjoy them if they are good. But there are a couple of movies that I have not made it through.This movie just kind of bored me. I had no connection to the main characters, no desire to see them succeed, and it just seemed unnecessarily drawn out in parts. The characters overall were kind of bland, and I didn't care about the kids goals. Maybe that's because I never grew up believing in Santa though, and so don't care about the magic of believing in Santa. I believe Christmas is just as meaningful, if not more so, without Santa.But more than that, I was creeped out the entire time I watched it. And before anyone protests that the lifeless animation was cutting edge for that time, that's not the only thing that was eerie. It certainly didn't help, but it wasn't the only contributing factor. When the train first appeared in the kid's yard, I was silently begging him not to get in the creepy phantom train that appeared in his yard. Then he got on, and was greeted by a group of children that I could easily have seen as ghosts on a train to the afterlife. Then there is the behavior of everyone on the train. The conductor is suspicious- getting easily angered by the kids, disappearing, taking one kid away- like, what is he going to do with her? Why is the one poor kid stuck in a dark car by himself? Who is the ghost man the hero kid meets on the train roof? I knew enough about the movie to know the train is not some demon train taking these kids to their doom, but the whole time I could not shake the feeling that something terrible was going to happen to them on this train. And I do not like horror movies, so I don't just have that on my mind when I watch innocent kids movies.I know this was supposed to portray the innocence and magic of Christmas for kids, but it didn't succeed in being fun and magical for me, but eerie. Maybe that is because it combined already slightly eerie and unknown magic with the soulless animation, but I don't know.Like I said, I didn't even get to the part where they are in the North Pole, because I didn't finish it, but I haven't heard that it gets better, and I don't much care to see for myself.Anywho, those are just my thoughts on this so called classic Christmas movie, written out rather late at night, so hopefully they make sense.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Big Hype, Little Delivery","I saw the Polar Express last night on IMAX 3-D. I had high hopes for this movie. Unfortunately, the movie didn't deliver. I never connected or felt anything for the main character and the supporting characters were just annoying. The musical scenes in this movie made me want to dig my eyes out with an unsharpened pencil. The only saving grace to this movie was the ghost character. The plot was slow in the beginning and felt rushed in the end. The only people I could imagine enjoying this movie are the under 7 crowd. Don't waste your money or time.

Tom hanks express,"This is not one of the better Christmas movies but it holds a special place in my heart and u watch it every Christmas eve. I never realised how uncanny the animation is in this movie. Its so poor and unsmooth that it is kind of off-putting for a lot of the movie. Tom hanks plays half the characters in this movie as well which is a bit weird. A lot of the characters are really Annoying as well, not just the know it all kid. Also I know this happens in a lot of Christmas movies but I'll take this one. If the adults don't believe in santa then where do the presents come from? Cause they aren't putting them there.

not very good at all....,"Yeesh. Where do I start? Well, anything other than humans in this movie looks very cool, like the caribou or the roller coaster-ing train tracks, but (as others have commented) the actual people all look undead or stoned or something. And *the words don't match the way their mouths are moving!* i mean if they can send a dang man to the moon, they should at least be able to move animated character's mouths so it actually looks like they're talking! Also, the characters aren't very developed or lovable. I wish we could have found out more about the Hero Boy and the one girl. It would have made the movie a bit more interesting. Speaking of not lovable, I know the know-it-all kid is supposed to be annoying, but they could have at least made him funny. I mean, I had to turn down the volume whenever he talked. He sounds kinda like Big Bird only terrible and devastating, and to top that off, his lines were said with about the emotion of like, a piece of cardboard. The singing waiters (even though they could sing very well) all looked exactly the same and made me a little embarrassed to be sitting there watching the movie instead of doing something cooler. And the end was just kind of randomly embarrassing. Probably anyone under 8 or 9 will be entertained but their parents/siblings will be boreder than bored like me.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

Have an incredible Christmas!,"The problem with Christmas movies is: they're generally  I mean, usually  made to make money. My point is, the producers/directors/writers/actors are often making the rounds on these ones  they don't pay much attention to what they're doing (example: ""Christmas with the Kranks""). They don't care.""The Polar Express"" really cares about itself. It's got a long, beautiful story that it dares tell children and adult alike about. It is a film full of the kind of simple wonder, joy and magic that I thought was all but gone for years. It doesn't need to tell a story of complexities, violence or conflict for the children to be interested. All it needs to do for that is to give the kids wonder, and does it ever.The story, though much expanded upon from the book, is still quite simple: a boy (known as Hero Boy) who is losing his faith in the existence of Santa Clause is  along with many other children  taken to the North Pole to see how it's all done. Of course the movie wouldn't be half as interesting if it was without their means of transportation: the Polar Express.The Polar Express is a massive steam engine which runs on both coal and Santa's magic. It is run by a flesh-and-blood conductor (Tom Hanks) and a couple of engine men, though the rest of the staff seems to materialize in (and out) of thin air when they're needed. For instance, when the conductor orders cocoa for the children a group of waiters leap into the car, pour their drinks, sing and dance, and are gone in a flash. Another instance of the train's magic is when Hero Girl's (Hero Boy's new friend) ticket flies out of the window and various parts of the environment (animals, wind) cause it to catch up with the train. Seeing this in 3-D was amazing.There are many other scenes of pure spectacle, as when the train skids over ice, or when Hero Boy and a strange hobo who lives on top of the train (Tom Hanks) race to an empty car before being crushed by the oncoming tunnel. These are very exciting, energetic, fun, and visually stunning action scenes, and require no violence either.The film keeps its supply of wonder and energy for the entire ride of the Polar Express, but when the train rolls into the North Pole, it slows down just a little bit. I think this may be because the Pole is already so familiar to us, too familiar for a few small adjustments to change. The Pole still looks nice, with its thousands of elves and its small buildings and toy factories (it looks more like hard work than jolly fun), but we've seen it all before, too many times. Still, this is probably the best envisioning on screen that I've seen.And probably also the best envisioning of Santa himself. Played by Tom Hanks, this Santa seems like a real man, warm and kind though with a no-nonsense voice, who reacts to his job and requirements like a real person might. His entrance is one of the most memorable parts in the movie, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed Hanks' ""performances"" in the film. Of his three most significant characters I would say the Hobo is my favorite, just because he's so eccentric and original, but The Conductor and Santa are right behind.Another thing, my mother said she didn't like how the movie was devoid of spirituality, but I disagree, I think it was all right there on the screen. I mean, when The Conductor says that life's best things cannot be ""seen""well, what else could he mean? So, it was a great film. A spectacle. It should be seen by every family. I suggest you see it in 3-D, because it is amazing that way, and you had better hurry. But I have a feeling they will play this every few years, at least, in the IMAX, so children decades from now will still be able to catch the experience of one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
This train is off its tracks and far off its course.,"This is about a boy on Christmas Eve hoping for belief in the true spirit of Christmas. However, this 'train' is off the tracks and off course.

"A simply magical, holiday classic.","While it doesn't stick very closely with it's source material, Chris Van Allisberg's 1988 novel of the same name, The Polar Express is a simply remarkable cinematic experience.The plot, much like the book, centers on a young boy living in Grand Rapids, MI in the 1950s (Which happens to be the same time Van Allisberg grew up, meaning that the main character may very well represent, or even BE Van Allisberg at a young age), who doubts the existence of Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, he has the remarkable experience of riding a magical train, called the Polar Express to the North Pole. The film features a cast of very eccentric characters, many of which are voiced (the film is made in Stop-Motion animation) by the film's executive producer, and the main reason the film exists, Tom Hanks (Hanks enjoyed reading this story to his children when they were young, and he came up wtih the idea to make a movie out of it, and then proposed the idea to the screenwriter, and director Robert Zemecis, who has since gone on to make the stop motion animated films Beowulf, and one of my other favorite Christmas movies, 2009s A Christmas Carol, with Jim Carrey.) Hanks provides the voices for, Hero Boy, the boy's Father, the train's Conductor, a mysterious, almost angel like Hobo, a puppet version of Scrooge (which is ironic seeing as how Zemecis later made A Christmas Carol in Stop-Motion), and Santa Claus. The film also includes one of Michael Jeeter's last films, and in this one, he plays the comical engineer and fireman Steamer and Smokey.

The computer animation or digital images of the scenery were just simply gorgeous! The facial expressions were so good they were scary. The music was well written and chosen. I rushed out to buy the CD after the movie. We felt the magic build as the movie went on. At the end, even adults sitting with me sat a moment just to ponder what they had seen. Go see it.

While it may be easy to gripe on the animation, when you consider the fact that this film is getting close to 2 decades old and implemented technology that had never been used before, it is truly remarkable how well the filmmakers did (especially Tom Hanks), with creating this masterpiece.

This film is about the ""magic"" of Santa, coupled with the brilliant, slightly acerbic voice-over of Tom Hanks as the Conductor and some mesmerising roller-coaster experiences. It really should be made in 3D.I note some comments about the film being scary. Pinocchio, Hansel & Gretel and Little Red Riding Hood are all more menacing than anything in this film.

"It bears repetition, repetition, repetition","My six year old son saw this movie last year and has wanted it on DVD ever since. Today, being Christmas, he got it and stayed up until midnight to watch the whole thing. I've never seen him last past 10:30 PM before.The sheer joy he got from this movie was an unqualified pleasure to behold. But what's more, I was surprised to find myself drawn in - craning my neck to see the TV screen as it played at the other side of the room. Usually I sit at my computer rather than actually watching the TV. This way I'm with the family, can hear the dialog, participate in any conversations, but still do what I need to do.Anyway, The Polar Express is an engaging movie and a very welcome alternative to the usual fare around here of Bionicle, Barney, spider man, rubberdubbers, rollie pollie ollie, and many others. I single out Polar Express because as most parents know very well, children will latch onto a book, song, or movie and play it incessantly - until they know the dialog by rote memory. Repetition is important to learning - especially with young minds, so it isn't to be discouraged, however this doesn't change the fact that you, as a parent, can find yourself clinging desperately to the last threads of sanity you possess.Occasionally a movie comes along that bears repetition. They are few and far between. I believe The Polar Express is one such movie. Your kids can play it over and over again and it won't drive you nuts. Such movies can get boring and even irritating, but not to the extent that you start thinking about how to bury the body of a purple dinosaur and get away with it.. A few other great kids'/teens' movies that come to mind (for me anyway) are Chicken Run, the Toy Stories, the Shreks, the Lion Kings, Nemo, and anything with Tom Hanks, Robin Williams, or Harrison Ford. Ones that definitely don't make my list are Madagascar, movies with guys disguised as women (this is so over done, and yes, Robin did Doubtfire but the same rules don't apply to him), movies with gang members in conflict over petty issues, superheroes (heroism is born of strong character yet humble means -invisibility and endless strength are hardly humble), and older cartoons - the likes of Woody Woodpecker that often championed unprovoked violence against an innocent bystander.Enough said. See Polar Express and decide for yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visual Masterpiece+ Forgettable Story= Christmas Mess,"Just to make some things clear, I am still young and I still love Christmas and Christmas films. I hated Polar Express. I can't understand why people would call this film timeless. It's the most over used Christmas story there is, just with a prettier backdrop. Someone doesn't believe in Santa/no Christmas spirit, some miraculous Christmas miracle happens, their love for Christmas is rekindled. It's been done. There's nothing classic about it. My second last sentence basically spoiled the movie for everyone.I know that's not the point of the movie, it's just supposed to fill us full or Christmas spirit or what not, it failed at that. I LOVE songs in animated movies, animated movies are my favorite genre. But the music absolutely made me cringe. The songs was lame, annoying, and uninteresting. That's the first time I've ever hated songs in a kids movie.I saw it in the IMAX 3D, and it was unimpressive (popping-out-of-the-screen wise). Two times in the whole 90 minutes does something actually come out of the screen, you might as well see it in the actual theatre. I left the theatre annoyed and cheated, even though I got the movie for free! I was filled with about as much Christmas spirit as 'Surviving Christmas' (bleh), and if you're in it for the visuals, see The Incredibles. It's far more entertaining. 4/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

3:10 to Mediocrity,"We of the Western cultures long ago passed a point of no return in how we take to heart the meaning in our various holidays. The big ones that we hold important and channel so much energy into -- namely, Christmas -- were subverted somewhere along the way, transformed into such highly refined empires of commerce and greed that even healthful sentiments such as, ""The true meaning of Christmas,"" are little more than corporate slogans, arbitrary noises sounded to make the trivial holiday-shopping frenzy seem more meaningful. Then there's the whole sticky matter of religion melded with the modern iconography of Santa, et al. True to superstitious nature, everyone acknowledges it on some fundamental level, but only enough so that their cognitive abilities don't bother to contemplate. It's been so long, so sustained, we just feel cozy taking it for granted.From its inception film has been active in shaping and influencing society's attitude towards this expansive partnership between non-thought and advertising. This ungainly cartoon is just one of the latest advertisements, taken from a children's book similarly devoid of nourishment but rich in vaguely alluring, winter-glossed imagery. A greater sin to me, personally, is that it is a modern animated film that does not exploit the possibilities of its nature, something that should be commonplace now that we have a few fine examples out there. Unlike the artists at Pixar, who understand the importance of visual imagination and give us worlds that exist in fuller dimensions than the ""real"" world of film and its constraints imposed by that physical contraption, the camera, this team puts a tight leash on their visuals so it looks as if we could be watching a story shot in live-action, with all its related limitations of space, but with a candy coating of digital animation to make it ""other-wordly."" How tame. How abominably dismal and lacking in adventure.There's a lot of action and commotion, sure, most of it involving the train, but observe how it's all blocked. You'll notice it's no more advanced than what we usually see grafted onto a CGI-assisted live-action movie. It's about as dimensionally thrilling as, say, that lousy Grinch movie from a few years back.Of course, many people will embrace this because marketing forces tell them it is good and such forces are most persuasive at Christmas time, when treacly sentiment provides an attractive defense for ignorance.Still, I beg of you, if you have children and insist on letting TV and movies help raise them, don't put them on this train. It is a murderer of the imagination, too much an emblem of our Macy's Christmas spirit.Blake's rating: 1 (out of 4)",,Anonymous,Animation
"Fasten Your Seatbelts, It's Going to be a Bumpy Ride","Robert Zemeckis teams up with Tom Hanks once again in this children's fantasy film about children being taken to the North Pole to see Santa and his world via a magical train called the Polar Express. This is definitely geared more toward the adolescents than the adults. The film has some outstanding animation process which creates a reality out of animation if you will. I personally found the process quite fascinating, but I must confess that I must have looked at my watch at least six or seven times during the course of the film. Never a good sign. At a running length of 99 minutes, The Polar Express seemed more like the Pony Express than Amtrak. There is nothing individually that I can pinpoint as a major, upsetting problem with the film. The animation was terrific, the voices(with exception of Eddie Deezen's which really got on my nerves as it was undoubtedly suppose to)were well-matched to their graphic counterpoints, the song and spirit of the film were nice, and the action scenes leading to the North Pole were exciting and suspenseful - yet, the film for me was rather boring. It really didn't do anything for me . It didn't cause me to hate it, but I said right after seeing it that I had no desire to see it again. Not much really happens in terms of concrete plot. Tom Hanks does some nice engineering as several different ""roles"" if you will. I think I liked his conductor best. I found Santa to be rather bland - as much of the film chronicling the adventures of the three ""lost"" children in the village at the North Pole.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great picture of an awesome film,"For anyone who is a skeptic of books made into movies, you will not be disappointed. This is a fabulous telling of my favorite children's Christmas book. Chris VanAllsburg will not be disappointed. They did his book justice. The animation (or whatever it is called) is fabulous. They did a good job of expanding on the wonderful and magical story. I was enthralled with the movie as were 350 kindergarten through 4th graders. The train ride is exciting and feels like a roller coaster. I wanted to ride that ride. At one point in the movie, I felt like I was there following this ticket that floats through the air (it had the feel of the feather in Forrest Gump). There was also another part where some children sing a song and I found the song to be touching. Tom Hanks does a fabulous job in all the roles that he plays. It shows his true gift as an actor.

Nostalgic? Or Nightmarish?,"The Polar Express is a lovely picture book. But it is still a picture book. There isn't a massive plot line or lots of excitement, but there is a lot of heart there for a short read. Adapting a picture book to an hour and a half film is always a risky business, because there has to be some extrapolation on the source to pad the runtime. In the case of Robert Zemeckis' adaptation of the classic book, I would argue the extrapolation was largely a failure.The film hits the main beats of the picture book, but most everything it adds is nonsensical or annoying, and brings the whole experience down. The music is not bad, and is even kinda pretty at points, but it doesn't inspire much emotion when the material is so weak.Ultimately, though, the elephant in the room is the animation. And while it hasn't aged well at all, I would argue they didn't look all that good when the film debuted all those years ago. The motion capture is rather creepy, in my opinion, and if you can't get around the visuals, you will likely not enjoy the film at all. I should also mention the voice acting is nothing special, and Tom Hanks' shrieking Conductor wears out his welcome almost immediately.Your mileage may very on whether you find this film nostalgic or nightmarish, but I am inclined to take a middle of the road approach. Thematically, it's well-meaning and basically harmless, if a little jumbled, but the creepy visuals are hard to stomach. As such, I give the film a 5. It was a nice try, I guess, but it definitely is not something I'd allow into my annual Christmas film rotation.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

The CGI isn't of the best of quality either. The animation of the characters is quite poor (and they don't look great either). The virtual sets look quite dazzling.

The Polar Express: 8/10,"I don't understand why studios (especially WB) continue to spend massive amounts of money on certain movies. I would think that from Troy (which cost over $200 million to make, got about $150 million domestically and somehow recouped its losses overseas), they would know better than to invest a whole lot of money into one particular movie. But the lesson was not learned for The Polar Express. Using motion-capture animation (how they did Gollum in the Lord of the Rings movies-or, even simpler, the animation Homer Simpsons invests a lot of money in), Robert Zemeckis (who last revolutionized animation with Who Framed Roger Rabbit) creates a dazzling world from Unnamed Suburbia to the North Pole. After hearing what the 3-D IMAX experience was like, I would have liked to have seen it there, but I saw it on a measly movie theater screen. Still, I loved it nonetheless.Tom Hanks, being the versatile man he is, does the voice and motion capture for about five characters: the boy (whose voice is mixed with Daryl Sabara's, from Spy Kids), the conductor, the hobo, the father, and Santa Claus. The boy, doubtful about Santa's existence, hears the whistle of a train right by his house on Christmas Eve. He steps aboard to see a bunch of other kids en route to the North Pole via The Polar Express. Along the way, magical things occur as the boy (trying to believe in Santa all the way) figures out the truth (secular truth, that is) behind Christmas.Surprisingly, being the cynic that I am, I loved The Polar Express. I think it was the simplicity-the book by Chris Van Allsburg is simple, and, although the movie is made out to feature length, it too is simple. The story's easy to follow, and that lets you get caught up in the visuals, which are astounding. All of the animation is astounding-not only is it lifelike, but it's also surreal. Some sequences (such as the ""lost ticket"" sequence) are so, for lack of a better word, gratifying. I'm not sure if it's only me, but when I was watching The Polar Express, I felt like this was almost the culmination of animation. It seemed like we worked for 100 years to get up to the quality of The Polar Express. While that obviously isn't so, it sure seemed like it, which is quite a plus for the movie. For a movie to make me believe that this is the best quality possible is pretty spectacular.What's even more spectacular is that the movie made an old Scrooge like myself into some little kid mystified by the Christmas spirit. Sure, it's a month too early, but still.... The ability to take most people from nine-to-fivers to five-year-olds gawking at the idea of Santa is probably the most stunning transformation a movie can do to the audience. And The Polar Express does it perfectly. It's more than the ""another year, another advance in animation"" movie. It's a huge achievement in film, and I speak that with no hyperbole. Not only is it the animators, but also Robert Zemeckis who make the movie what it is. Imagine the long hours that Zemeckis, basically overseeing the whole project, would have to work. I'm not trying to demean the animators here, as this was obviously a huge group effort, but if Peter Jackson can win a best director Oscar for making a nine hour movie, can't Zemeckis win one for making a movie of this magnitude?Unfortunately, having Hanks play four and a half characters means that four and a half characters sound exactly alike. It kind of takes away from the whole feel of the movie, when Santa, the conductor, his father, et al. sound exactly the same. Also, I think some of the situations were a bit childish (like the back-and-forth with the engineer, etc.), but still, that can't really diminish the awesome power the movie has. It's truly an amazing feat for everyone involved, and the fact that it probably won't get its money back is basically a sin.My rating: 8/10Rated G.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wonderful!,"I took my 6-year-old to this movie today. The theater was full of kids and parents, with a few unattached adults. I take my boy to lots of movies and I cannot recall the last time he and every other kid in the theater was completely silent for the entire length of the film. They were all enchanted, and frankly, so was I. While exiting, I heard some teenage girls talking about how they had been crying during the film, and I believe that. There is not much to the plot, but complicated story lines are not what entertains kids. The book on which it is based was thin, and so the lack of plot is understandable. The technology was terrific and the graphics made it quite exciting and realistic for an animated movie. We enjoyed POLAR EXPRESS very much, and I recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too cheesy for me,"I usually don't like Christmas films and this is no exception. The animation may have been good for the time but it is a bit plastic now. The best parts were the action sequences with the train. Other than that, the messages were hokey.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Visually Stunning Movie,"This movie is a visual feast. Everything from the snowflakes in the Polar Express's headlight to the roller-coaster ride on the train is breathtaking. While the movie took definite liberties with the book's plot (hence my not giving it a 10) --why on earth do we need a hobo ghost-- the message is there...believe in something bigger than yourself and share it with others. The book's award was for artwork, and that level of excellence was been maintained in the movie. Those who panned it are not looking through the eyes of a child. My daughter was entranced, as was I.

WATCH FROM A DISTANCE...!,"The 2004 digitally animated adventure from Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future/Contact) & based on a novel by Chris Van Allsburgh (Jumaji/Zathura). Never wanting to see the film when it first came out (I'm not a particular devotee of Zemeckis' work), I finally played completist & watched this romp which has Tom Hanks (reuniting w/his Forrest Gump/Castaway director) playing & providing the character models for many of the synthespians featured in this story which takes place during Christmas Eve which has a non-believer in Santa Claus whisked away on a magical train which will put him face to face w/the mystical man of giving. The majority of the narrative is spent on our hero (modeled by Spy Kid Daryl Sabara) learning important lessons through many train misadventures culminating in his belief in good ol' Santa restored. As a story, it works but what holds me back from embracing this effort wholeheartedly is the eerie, Plasticine looking avatars on screen (one of which is played by Nona Gaye, daughter of Marvin & another by Eddie Deezen, the eternal nerd from Grease) are so off-putting w/their uncanny valley eyes & awkward movements (the same issue which afflicted Zemeckis' Beowulf & A Christmas Carol) which doesn't exactly inspire embraces but more of an accepting nod from a distance away. Other actors/models include Peter Scolari (Hanks' co-star from Bosom Buddies), Josh Hutcherson, the late, great Michael Jeter, Charles Fleischer (the voice of Roger Rabbit) & even Steven Tyler from Aerosmith shows up to rock out a tune.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
So much is left out,"Let me just start by saying that this is a great holiday movie. I was glad to see it. However, so many things are left out of the movie. First of all, none of the characters (except for Santa Claus and Sarah) are named. Second, there is no back story at all for the boy hero (I don't know this for sure, I didn't see all of the movie). Third, we don't learn squat about the hobo. He's just there and he makes brief appearances. And there's that line he says to the boy hero, ""Do you believe in ghosts?"" Does that mean that he is a ghost? After all, he just keeps disappearing. I think the movie probably would have done better if they did these things.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Awesome flick for the family especially young children,"A truly wonderful Christmas movie. Viewing this each year will surely become a tradition. My three year old daughter was on the edge of her seat. The style of the film is gorgeous and some of the camera perspectives were brilliant. (the encyclopedia in particular) A very good score and soundtrack with one exception which I expound upon below.My only complaint.......what bonehead producer thought it would be ""cool and hit that other demographic"" to animate Steven Tyler and have him sing some stupid trite rock n roll version Christmas song. That was the only gay part of the whole thing, but not a deal killer. Why date an otherwise timeless picture with something like that?",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie doesn't age well and the story is bad,"The beginning of the movie is excitetend, but off the train the old cgi ruins it. The deadless characters doesn't help either.It was interesting too see how old CGI looked in 2004. But CGI wasn't ready for animating humans. It reminded me of older story driven video games with bad motions. A good learning point for Hollywood, I think.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Suprizingly excellent!,"WOW, I was very impressed with this movie. I didn't think it would be so well done, entertaining, enjoyable or marvelous! Considering it was based on a simple picture book, I didn't think there would even be very many words spoken. Tom Hanks and company put together a great film. This was a great adventure for all ages, and anybody who went into it with an open mind.On a scale of 1-10, I definitely give it a high 9 and letter grade of A. It is definitely worth seeing, and will probably become a Holiday classic many years from now. I recommend Polar Express to anybody with an imagination and who likes a good adventure!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Excellent visuals and animation, but with a terribly poorly written story.","It was with some expectation that I decided to see this Christmas movie. I already had the perception that the film, despite being fresh and recent, quickly fell into a certain way of oblivion, with the television channels preferring other films during the Christmas season. Inspired by a book, which I have never read but heard about, the film addresses as a great theme people's disbelief, from a certain point on, in Santa Claus.In the film, a child whose name we do not know is invited to take a night trip to the North Pole, aboard a magical steam train, to meet Santa Claus and watch the old man depart on his annual trip to distribute gifts to the children of the World. He, however, does not believe in Santa Claus. Based on these premises, the film tried to build a kind of fable about the beauty of the Santa Claus myth. This never really worked: in addition to having no logic, the film has a terribly abrupt start: in the opening five minutes, we get a glimpse of the boy's life as he pretends to sleep, and we board the train without further explanation. The journey is lukewarm and uninteresting, the other children are bland or irritating and there is a character, somewhat ghostly, whose reason for existing is never really explained, but who helps the protagonist when he needs it. The ending is a kind of Santa Claus Superstar, with a show of aerial acrobatics of the gnomes.Although the film has a pitiful script and was notoriously the victim of radical cuts at the editing table, it's necessary to bow to Tom Hanks for an extraordinary vocal tour de force: the actor took full advantage of his vocal skills and gave voice to a handful of distinct characters throughout the film, with evident highlights for the train collector and Santa Claus. But in addition to all these voices, the actor also sang in several of the main songs of the soundtrack, which has its moments of quality, despite not being memorable, having a series of moments where it seems to copy the soundtrack of ""Edward Scissorhands"" and having a certain song, ""Hot Chocolate"", which I didn't like because of the extreme simplicity of the lyrics. Another aspect that deserves our positive appreciation is the extraordinary visual accuracy of the film, which makes the most of visual effects and CGI, providing us with elegant, colorful, vibrant and engaging animation.That said, I fully understand why this film came and went as quickly as a comet, both in theaters and on television, and ended up in the wastebasket of cinema history: despite director Robert Zemeckis having made a strong bet on visual effects and in a good animation, no film can't be sustained without a good story to tell.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

The 3D Experience!!!  Wow!!!!!,"Seeing the movie in 3D IMAX was simply amazing. It turned an ordinary, probably not very likely to see movie, into a totally new experience. You are constantly moving your head all over the screen to try and take it all in. At one point, you felt the train was going out across the theater and stopping overhead. Audible gasps from the attending crowd were riddled throughout the screening. This is an event worth looking into. The only drawback was wearing the IMAX headgear for the feature length film. It sat fairly well on the head, but would slowly droop down to your nose. Simple paper glasses would have been a much better idea. Still, it's worth the pain. WOW!!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

3D Imax version is an incredible experience,"I deliberately avoided the conventional screen version of this film and paid the extra bucks to see it at the Imax in 3D. I'm sure you've read this before, but this is indeed the most fantastic eye-popping 3D movie made to date. Zemekis makes sure every shot has something heading straight for you. But even beyond that, it is almost freaky as you look into a mouth of a character's (very) large close-up on the Imax screen, and you sense the distance from the lips to the throat.Zemekis must've wanted a make a fantasy movie to be remembered, and it is easy understand the huge budget needed to bring it to life. I'm sure no other movie he has made (including ""Roger Rabbit"") comes close to the complexity of this project. This film was made for the 3D experience, and it reminds me of the first time I saw ""Wizard of OZ"", a spectacle of imagery that I have never seen before.Now, the story and characters are very tame, and there is nothing horrible about their adventures. I was more flipped out looking at these giant 3D heads on the super-size screen. The 'Hero girl' has a weird drawn face that doesn't quite look right. The eyeballs are more human like, which is why they look graphed on to non-human like animated faces. All the story subplots are designed to deluge the audience in further 3D effects. The elves all look like miniature Vladimer Putins, very freaky.As an adult, I would not say this film is enchanting, but I was laughing out loud with glee as I would a ride at Univeral Studios Theme Park. There are too many jaw-dropping images to recount, but it is suffice to say this a breakthrough film on par with ""Final Fantasy"". See this film only in Imax 3D, or you may be disappointed.I give it a 8 out of 10 (for the Imax 3D version only)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A must see for children of all ages!,"I am very critical of most movies, especially ones where I have read the book. This movie out did everything I expected. If you have read the book there are some changes but it only adds to the depth that the book took us toward the North Pole. If you appreciate great artistry you will love the animation in this film. The motion capture procedure they used is nothing short of amazing. To watch these animated characters come to life in front of you on the screen is a real treat for those of us who appreciate the complexity of CGI. If you don't go for the story just go to enjoy the animation. The level of detail in this film is fantstic. I was captivated at several points in the film just looking at the level the creators took the detail down to. Even the smallest parts of the train are finely detailed, the buildings at the North Pole, the way each character moves or runs, how the clothing and characters interact, how the hair moves, well, just about every detail you can think of.Now for the story. I have read this book to more children than I can remember for many years. I have read it in women's shelters to children who resemble the little boy who thinks that Christmas just doesn't work for him. I have never experienced anyone who was not enthralled with the story and did not want to hear the bell ring when I gave them one. I have worn a bell on Christmas day since the first time I read the book. The movie does the story justice. It actually expands upon the world created by the author. I would suggest going in and letting the ""magic"" exist inside of you for a couple of hours.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The bell that jingles,"The Polar Express starts out about a boy who does not believe in Santa Clause now he has become older. The magic of Christmas is receding. However a train The Polar Express arrives at night and the train conductor (Tom Hanks) invites the boy to hop in where he sees other kids on the way to the North Pole. The final stop sees a reluctant boy boarding the train who sits alone in a carriage. The kids on the train are a diverse bunch such as a know it all, a loner etc.Every now and then the conductor arrives asking to see the tickets and fretting about getting to the destination on time. On the way there are a series of adventures and sequences such as a ticket getting lost, waiters arriving to serve hot drinks and a hobo on top of the train.When the train arrives at the North Pole we see elves getting the presents ready for Christmas and then Santa makes an entrance where the boy receives a bell from Santa.The film directed by Robert Zemeckis is the first full length performance capture movie however the technology did not look as advanced in places. The characters look a little unreal especially with the dead eyes.However there are some breathtaking CGI scenes on the train along the journey such as the dancing waiters and when the ticket floats away. However subsequent scenes filed to hold sway as I felt it was there to show off the CGI than serve the story.That is the trouble, it looks very padded as if a short story was being adapted for a full length film. I watched this with my son who was disinterested mainly because he had seen the film before. It had no re-watch value for him.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Classic Among the Common,"In today's mega-movie world, we are bombarded with movie after movie in the weeks before Christmas. Our culture is becoming so jaundiced and our entertainment expectations so exaggerated, that we often fail to see genius before our very eyes. This movie is genius - pure and simple.Some critics have seen the genius in this movie, but many have not. Only in 20 or 30 years when we have forgotten The Incredibles, Sponge Bob, and The Kranks, will the Polar Express keep chugging and tugging at many of our hearts.I'm certainly not a kid anymore but when I see a movie like this, I yearn to be one again and, for a short time, I am.This is certainly not the most joyful movie ever made about St. Nick, but it is certainly one of the most memorable and meaningful. Even if you forget about the animation (which is spectacular) and focus only on the message, you should be moved to believe.Nor am I surprised that the IMDb readers have not rated this movie much higher. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was poorly received in 1946 when it was first released, and it is now one of the highest rated movies on this website. I wonder what its rating would be if it were released today?If you see this movie, see it with an open and unassuming, childlike mind. You should not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Depressing,"I watched this movie on TV during the Christmas holiday and I found it boring and slightly depressing. Afterwards, out of curiosity, I read some on-line reviews and I was amazed to see that some critics described it as a ""modern classic"" which will be watched over and over. By whom? I have no desire to go through another session of watching ""Polar express"" ever again. What I did not like about it: 1) the mix of real actors playing one (or more) parts and the half-real, half-cartoon look. It is creepy, even if it allows for some special effects (like the train sliding over ice) which would probably be a lot more expensive if done for a real-real movie. However, movies are not any better just because they are stuffed with special effects. 2) the length. This movie stretches on forever, even if the story is very short: boy discover that Santa exists, because magic train brings him to Santa central. Consequently, one cannot help but notice that most of the adventures are there just to fill time: the ghost, the lost ticket, the carriage that takes the three kids for an unexpected journey through the creepy Santa village, inhabited by the weird elfs... All irrelevant to the final purpose. 3) the believing-in-Santa message. Just why believing in Santa makes you a better person escapes my imagination (unless we want to border into dangerous territory and suggest that believing in anything irrational is better than not believing). Finally, I guess it would have been impossible to do such a movie without the usual ""screaming kids on fast vehicle"" scene, which seems to be beloved by the American public. That scene is so incredibly boring, I think I saw it in a million movies and yet it does pop up over and over again. For that scene only I would have disliked this movie that is not as innovative and amazing as some critics described. In fact, the only innovative thing is the creepy technique. The story itself is two lines and the moral is puzzling.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
I was prepared to hate it.. and just couldn't!,"Having seen The Incredibles last weekend, I was only going to take my kid and went in fully expecting to hate it. I admit it: This is a GREAT movie.Within seconds, the amazing animation pulls you in. At first, I admit it was a a bit creepy. But before long, you are believing this is real and not animated. Again referring to The Incredibles, I couldn't imagine anyone would have a chance for Best Animation this year. See Polar Express and you'll be astounded by the level of detail.I haven't read the book, so I won't be one of those who complains that this and that weren't true to the original. Whatever. The movie entertains and I would recommend it to anyone just as easily as The Incredibles.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
A classic that will endure,"Ignore the folks who are paid to review movies and know that this Christmas classic will undoubtedly become an enduring favorite for many years to come.The animation is a wonderful achievement and this is truly a movie where the story comes to life on screen. I was totally unfamiliar with the book, so I read my granddaughter's copy after the movie and realized the movie resonated with me moreso than someone of my granddaughter's age. This movie speaks to those who no longer can hear the sound of the Christmas bell. In many ways, there is something of a peculiar kinship with ""It's A Wonderful Life"" in the use of the bell for the spirit of Christmas as opposed to the sound of a bell for an angel getting their wings. Kudos to Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks for a brilliantly conceived vision. Haven't seen the IMAX version, but I can only imagine how much more harrowing certain parts of this movie might be in that format. The instrumental music is very interesting. Nearly a supernatural theme rather than a wistful one, but it works in this movie wonderfully. The individual songs may not be hummable as you leave the theater, but they work well in the context of the film.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Creepy, wasteful, and just not fun to look at","I've seen this movie three times now since it released more than a decade ago, and I've finally come an obvious conclusion: The Polar Express had a great potential to be a minor holiday classic, one of those movies you put on around Christmas and don't really have to pay attention to but are fun and cute just the same.The one thing stopping that from happening is the use of computer graphics. This movie looked creepy at release and has aged like milk. If there was any iota of style or charm to the way characters look and move, it would dramatically improve my enjoyment of The Polar Express. Instead, we get these disturbingly smooth, plastic humanoids that look a little too realistic, but never realistic enough. It is impossible not to stare at them in a kind of silent revulsion, wondering why on earth they had to make Tom Hanks look like a worse version of the person he already is. Infinite creative possibilities stretched out before them, and he looks like an alien wearing a Tom Hanks suit that doesn't fit quite right.They should have stylized this movie more. They eventually did: a version of this exact same technology, from this exact same company, was employed to create Monster House in 2006 (two years after Polar Express). Monster House looks great! Because Monster House still looks like a cartoon. Here, they went with a strange approximation of not-quite-reality, and all it looks like is a waste of money. They give CGI Tom Hanks a fake mustache that must've cost tens of thousands of dollars to create and render. Can you imagine that? They faked something that was already fake. They could have gotten a real fake mustache of the same quality from Party City for five bucks, but they spent weeks building a computer simulation of one instead. This whole production was an excessive waste of resources, time, and talent.And it's incredibly difficult to see past that fact. Every frame of this entire movie is infected with that kind of excess. Only by forcing yourself to grow numb to it over multiple viewings can you even glimpse the real movie underneath the wasteful, ugly technology. That movie is fine, but too much of everything else isn't.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent movie!,"OK, I'm a 41 year old male (father of two) who really connects with Tom Hanks. His focus on movies that come from my the period of my childhood (or at least near my childhood) makes him an endearing actor to me. This movie contains the BEST animation that I've ever seen. I have a fairly expensive home entertainment setup and have seen some fantastic graphics, animation and special effects, but the time and technology poured into this instant Christmas classic is unbelievably good. One thing, there is no mention of the real reason that there is a Christmas (Jesus) in the film, which was disappointing. The film follows the standard ""it's all about Santa and presents"" theme that today permeates most aspects of the US version of the holiday, and since we don't want to offend anyone of any other religious persuasion, we'll overlook this point and say that the movie, it's message and it's delivery are fantastic!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Rollercoast Ride,"Ah, the nightmare people. Robert Zemeckis was always a technically minded director with stories from actors like Kathleen Turner on Romancing the Stone about how he was more interested in interesting camera angles than her acting, but he never let the technology drown out the stories of his movies until now. He had his toys, and he loved them. Maybe he would use them more than other directors would (like on What Lies Beneath), but they were never the point until he discovered motion capture as a means for filming an animated story. It really didn't help that he chose to film an adaptation of a children's book made up of a few dozen pages with beautiful images and literally no words. It wasn't enough for a feature length film. This is a 30-40 minute short film squeezed into 100 minutes, and the extra hour feels extraneous at best.A boy wakes up on Christmas Eve night, fresh off telling his younger sister that Santa Claus isn't real. He's at the end of his childhood, and that's when the Polar Express shows up outside his door. He reticently boards and is off to the North Pole along with a dozen other boys and girls all at his age. Only three of these gain any prominence. There's Know-It-All, played by Eddie Deezen to his annoying extreme, Hero Girl, played by Nona Gaye, who is firm and brave, and Billy, played by Peter Scolari, who is an outcast, lonely, and sad. And then the movie becomes loud nonsense for about an hour.Okay, that may be a bit harsh, but, really, Zemeckis let his techno-freak flag fly in this movie and it's really hard to ignore. There's something off about Zemeckis's approach here, and it is much more than people's faces that look unconvincing and plasticky. This becomes a bigger issue in A Christmas Carol, but Zemeckis has a good visual idea, like the dancing waiters with the hot chocolate or the golden ticket flying around in the breeze outside the train, and he runs with it to an extreme. Well beyond the bounds of anything approaching physical reality or narrative restraint, Zemeckis pushes these ideas so far that they become distracting and self-defeating. The waiters perform impossible moves that end up making no sense (all cut together shockingly quickly to make a lot of it hard to comprehend), and the ticket blowing in the wind floats to the ground, floats back up because wolves run by it really fast, gets picked up by an eagle, given to its chick, spat out, formed into a rolling snowball, broken out in perfect form again, happens right in front of the moving train, and floats back to end up inside the right car again. I mean, magic is the literal explanation, but the rather ridiculous string of events, and the just this side of cartoonish nature of the animation, makes it feel silly. And the movie is full of stuff like this.The boy's efforts to catch up to the conductor on the top of the train starts really well with the boy meeting up with a magic hobo who guides him through the thick snow and whipping winds. That's really good, and then the hobo gets some skis and they sky down the train as it goes downhill. That's less good. The train gets stopped by a herd of caribou. That's good. They clear the caribou by having the fat engineer and the conductor pull on the skinny engineer's long red beard as a way to communicate with the caribou to get them to move. That's less good. They approach an iced over section of the track. That's good. They ride the ice to the other side of the new lake as the lake essentially implodes as they go, perfectly hitting the rails at the exact right second. That's less good.If this sort of thing happened once or twice, it would be one thing, but it just keeps happening. Zemeckis took a small story that didn't need a feature length 9 digit budget animated film and filled the gaps with sequences that distracted and don't really fit the actual story. How does the elaborate ticket flying sequence add to the boy's journey for belief in Santa? Or the girl's developing leadership? Or know-it-all's humility? Or Billy's sense of community? Or the sense of wonder of the setting? Or the magic of Christmas? It doesn't. It's a complete distraction, and the movie is filled to the brim with this stuff. Chock full of it.Even once they get to the North Pole, Zemeckis sends the core four children off on a quick side-adventure because the movie's not quite long enough yet. They get lost, wander around the underbelly of the North Pole, see some of its workings, and then get flown directly to Santa in his huge bag of presents. It's an excuse to see more of the North Pole and little else.Once the children do get to Santa it feels like the story reasserts itself, almost 80 minutes into this 100 minute movie, and it's actually quite nice. I'm not really a fan of the secular version of Christmas, but the boy's need to believe so he can hear the bell and meet Santa are really well handled. It's a tender moment for a little boy rediscovering the magic of youth. I just wish the rest of the movie was about it.And that's really my problem. There is some nice stuff in here. The boy's story, when it actually appears, is a nice little thing. The spectacle can actually be quite good to watch and enjoy. The movie consistently looks really good, embracing the beautiful aesthetic from the book in digital film form. Yes, the faces are off and don't really read quite human, but everything around them, especially the North Pole, actually looks really good. The technical achievement is something to be admired, but narratively this movie is dead on arrival, only working in fits and starts in between 3D rollercoaster rides.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful but not good at the same time,"I saw The Polar Express when it was first released with my family. I remember that my dad loved it and I thought it was TOO long. I still dislike it and think it's too long. The message of the story is that you need to ""believe in order for things to happen"" sounds like religious based instead of Christmas based.

See it in 3D IMAX,"This film is an absolute delight. If you are going to see it, skip the 2D version and head for the closest IMAX theater and see it in 3D. I had seen this process once before on the Titanic documentary, and it's unlike any other 3D process. The depth, detail and bone rattling sound are definitely worth the few extra bucks. I expected not to like this film - there's a lot of negative press floating about. But if you've got a bone in your body that still remembers what childhood feels like, you'll be transported to a magic dimension. The fellow sitting next to me, a father who had brought his whole family, was ooohing and awing and gasping more than his kids. The major complaint on the film - the stiff movements and blank eyes of the human characters - just don't matter. There's so much going on on the screen I never even noticed. Go see it.

Just look at ""Up"" by Pete Docter, it looks very cartoonish and silly, but soooo much more fun then this piece of garbage. Well I must admit, after hour and a half I stoppes watcing, so maybe the last half hour is much better, and my critic is therefore non accurate, but I really don't think so, since as i recall, this movie got all worse, not better with progress.

Thoroughly Enjoyable,"A young boy who doubts the existence of Santa Claus hears a noise outside his window on Christmas Eve and rides the Polar Express to the North Pole.I waited for this movie just as I waited for Santa Claus when I was younger: full of anticipation. It did not disappoint. There is a new genre out there making humans look like cartoon characters, or making cartoon characters look like humans and I cannot figure out which is which, or the name for this new genre, but it works. Thoroughly enjoyable.The photography or cinematography was nothing short of spectacular. I will admit sometimes it looked like Kaleidoscope magic, but it worked. There were only two things that I would have changed to make it better (of course). One: there was too much hesitancy when a child character would speak sometimes. I felt like the character was waiting for someone to give him/her the lines to speak. And, second, I would have given this more music. Oh, there was music and for a minute I thought this might be a musical and maybe in some ways it was, sort of, but there needed to be more of it and more upfront with it. You know, really ring it in. You betcha! In the second half the music was muted in the background. I heard Bing Crosby and others, but I kept waiting to hear Dean Martin too, but never did hear him.Now, this has the feel of a nice family movie, but I would be careful letting really young children see it because there are some scary scenes when the Polar Express goes off the tracks and LOOK OUT! Get it? Now, if the child is used to playing intense sock'em video games then okay. They won't be too shocked with this. Otherwise",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great Holiday Film,"The Polar Express has been a story that has been read to me since I was a child. Finally being created into an animated film is by far one of the greatest ideas from book and literature to animation. After I saw this film I was reminded of the greatest childhood memories from this story. Christmas would never be the same without this great child's story. I never would have thought the story would be created and done in such a great way. Two thumbs up in my book!I'd certainly recommend this film to anyone, children, teens, as well as family. I personally would take my family out and continue a tradition of reading The Polar Express to my family and children.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
I'm not buying a ticket,"Here's the problem with many feature length kid's films - they take up 90 minutes or so when they only have at best an hour's worth of material (see Finding Nemo). But instead of resulting in filler material, here the problem infects the entire movie, with everything that happens dragged out to an absurd degree. I mean, really, how many times can we see kids reaching for something fluttering maddeningly just out of reach? And how many times can we see something waft unpredictably for two or three minutes before lighting just where it should be? During editing didn't anyone say, hey, we already did that twice? I have to admit, I didn't hang around to the end (the Hanks character was bizarre and the North Pole looked pretty strange to me). My 4 year old who loves both trains and Christmas had checked out long ago. For once he had better judgment than me.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
too much fun!,"Even though it's after Christmas, you should make time to see this. It's not just a Christmas movie. It kept our interest on many different levels. We saw it in 3D IMAX and can't imagine seeing it any other way. At one point it's almost like being on a roller coaster. I kept waiting for the seats to shake like they do at Disney World. The story is touching and has a great message for kids. Although, the kids in our party were 19, 40 & 65. Tom Hanks is amazing as always. It was hard to believe all the characters he plays. The animation was so life-like, my father had a hard time believing they weren't real at first. So, don't wait for it to come out on DVD, go today. Greatly entertaining and well worth your time and money.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
All Aboard,"All aboard.. The Polar Express! Unfortunately, the story itself is far superior to the movie. There's no doubt this captures the true spirit of Christmas and makes you feel festive and ready for Christmas. But the movie itself is just too simple and childish. I understand it's a children's story BUT did it need these weird cartoons? Did it need the elves to be super weird? There was just so much more potential and opportunity that this missed out on. I do hope this gets recreated into a real life movie. That would be much more memorable. Nevertheless, definitely a good movie to watch leading up to Christmas.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
It was a movie that made my son believe,"This movie was brilliant! As an adult I totally enjoyed the high tech special effects and beautiful scenery this film brings to life. Also as a parent, I enjoyed the fact that the movie was clean and filled with wonderous things for my child to see and support his childhood beliefs. He really did believe after seeing this movie. Also I liked the fact that after the movie he asked me if we could get a present for a child that never has much. This was worth the entire price of admission to have a child understand and feel for those who don't have as many blessings as others. This is going to be a yearly Christmas movie my family will enjoy for years to come! 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just saw it yesterday,"...and it's amazing, just really, fabulous. This is a film for all ages, about growing up and not losing the child within you. Tom Hanks has been criticized by some, as was the animation.. ye folks of little faith, ""The Polar Express"" has the best animation to hit the silver screen yet. You will believe in miracles when you see the train conductor imitate each of Tom Hanks's facial expressions.The train ride was a roller-coaster. I doubt ""The Incredibles"" are going to stay on top of the box office this weekend. Mine, and I'm sure most viewers' main concern with ""The Polar Express"" was it would be silly and generic, like you know, most Christmas movies. Well, joy to the world and kudos to Robert Zemeckis are in order, for IT ISN'T. The film's got its share of thrills, its share of laughs, and some good ole spookiness. Given time, this one is more than likely to become a classic.Go see it today. Believe me, you'll wanna see it again when your kids cherish this flick.~O~",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

It will move you, no matter what your age.Like Will Farrell's Buddy the elf from last Christmas, Tom Hanks' Conductor will join the characters of Christmas classics. His work, along with the rest of the film, will be talked about for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Too dark to belong in the Christmas movie cannon.,"I feel like Scrooge or the Grinch for giving a kids' Christmas movie such a bad review. But compared to the classics in the Christmas film ""cannon"" (like A Christmas Carol, How the Grinch Stole Christmas, A Christmas Story etc.), Polar Express just didn't stack up in my opinion. This puts me at a minority, since most people seem to enjoy it.For one thing, I thought the animation in Polar Express was somewhat elementary in comparison to other CGI films, lacking the finer touches of Pixar or of Dreamworks or even of some of Zemeckis' other films (like Monster House or his version of A Christmas Carol). I guess I found the relatively poor quality of animation, of the characters' faces especially, distracting.Another thing is that both the story and the physical setting of the plot were dark and kinda gloomy (literally and figuratively) for a kids' movie, especially for one about Christmas. Sure kids' movies can get dark as the characters encounter difficulties in the story, but there just didn't seem to be many bright or happy moments here to counterbalance. I wanted to experience more of the magic of the train and of the North Pole instead of getting bogged down in the foggy, eerie, and dark roof of the train or in the abandoned inner-workings of Santa's shop. There was plenty of opportunity to show us some neat Christmas excitement and I felt let down.Finally, I didn't like the Oscar-nominated original song. It was too much like the storyline and setting and animation in that it lacked zest for the fundamental joy and exhilaration of Christmas.Tom Hanks certainly did a great job doing so many diverse voices throughout. I'll bet he enjoyed doing something like this, something quite unique for him. But Hanks could not keep this film afloat all by himself (like he did in Cast Away, another Zemeckis film, one which I liked). Overall, I wanted and hoped for more than I got with this movie. Zemeckis has done better.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of the best movies ever made,"The Polar Express is an incredible movie and is, in my opinion, one of the best ever made. The visuals are fantastic. The movie takes place at five minutes to midnight, so the sky is dark, but everything is shiny, glowing, and beautiful. The landscapes are gorgeous, as is the city of the North Pole.There are plenty of adventures in the movie which will entertain viewers of all ages, but will not scare most children. The pacing works well; the movie does not drag, nor is it choppy.The characters are unique and likable: the initially skeptical Hero Boy, courageous Hero Girl, annoying but funny Know-it-all, and lonely Billy. The animation is excellent, and the children are beautiful and innocent. Their mannerisms are charming and realistic: they sing, run around, and bounce in their seats on the train. The characters speak in short, simple sentences, which is appealing and realistic, since many of them are children. Their outfits (pajamas) are cute, simple, and childlike. The adult characters, such as Santa and the Conductor, are similarly quirky and innocent.The music in this movie is excellent. The score by Alan Silvestri is magical, and the old Christmas carols contribute to the holiday atmosphere. One of the most beautiful scenes in the movie is the duet by Hero Girl and Billy.The best aspect of The Polar Express, however, is the film's message that one should believe in Santa Claus forever. With so many movies that celebrate change, sexuality, and growing up, The Polar Express is extremely refreshing because it glorifies innocence. The moral of the story is that the best people are those who remain childlike and innocent and never give up their belief in magic and goodness. For some reason, this movie reminds me of the first two Harry Potter movies. These films all have warm, glowing visuals, glorious music, fun adventures, and beautiful, innocent child characters as well as unique and similarly innocent adults. The Polar Express embodies the qualities of childhood and innocence and is recommended without hesitation to anyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mystical,"I loved it and it will definitely become a Christmas classic. One thing that enamored me of it was the Department store name,Herpolshiemers. I was amazed,when growing up in Michigan my best friend and I would ride the city bus downtown and spend our Saturdays at a Herpolshiemers store and I assumed it was the only one of its kind until I heard it mentioned early in the Polar Express. I was absolutely flabbergasted when later on in the movie they said,Grand Rapids, Michigan. Can anyone tell me the connection in the movie and why Herpolshiemers and Grand Rapids Michigan is involved? This just floored me and brought back such great memories,as I am 54 now.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Journey to The North Pole. Believable?,"About a movie going to the North Pole. The kid learns to believe. Is that it? Surprisingly the answer is Yes. Movie was an absolute disappointment. Could have been a lot better. Worth a peek, but you probably wont stay for long.Direction: 6/10 Direction was OK. Could have been a bit better with some shots annoying such as when the director really wants to make the movie feel 3D. Then there were some pointless and worthless scenes that could have been removed.Screenplay: 5/10 About that....It was a pretty good attempt. Movie gets a bit boring and sometimes the dialogues make a bit no sense. Its a bit cheap too. Screenplay was OK.Editing: 5/10 Again. Could have been better. The animation was great but on the characters not so much. The Characters look horrible and don't have that final realistic touch into it. But on the scenery the editing was good.Story: 4/10 Horrible. I have seen the story many times before. Only difference, this one has a long boring train ride. Which makes it even worse. The story was pointless. At the end it said to believe and I was like really? I was waiting for 1 hour and 40 minutes for this? WOW.Entertainment: 4/10 Not entertaining. I'm not just talking about comedy. I am talking about if you got bored or not. I got bored. Really bored. Nothing exciting except for the train almost dead. I was bored to death in this movie.Music: 8/10 Music was alright. Nice attempt. Sometimes I wondered if it could have been better. But overall it was nice, nothing really annoying here.Verdict: A boring Journey with some missed tracks here and there. Rating: 5.25/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dear Jordan: I think you're out of your mind,"I've just watched this movie (animation) and it's AMAZINGLY STUNNING! Probably when you watched it, you were in a bad mood and your kid may have been sick or tired, or whatever. It's for people from all ages - 1 to 100 - and it carries beautiful messages. The characters are not creepy at all, except the ""guardian angel"". Hank's voice is well-used and it gives life to the characters dubbed by him. You should try and see the movie with your own eyes, not with your ""... 4-year old movie buff..."" ones (that's a strange label for a 4 yo) The animation is extremely vivid and the characters are... almost alive! What about the music? It's brilliant and touching, mainly at Christmas time. Well, people, as the movie says: SEEING IS BELIEVING! Take a closer look at it, with a kid's eyes, OK?

Fantastic!,"I just saw this film for the first time today and I thought that it was absolutely wonderful. I must be honest, I underestimated this film before it even opened in the theaters. I thought that it would be terribly boring, but I changed my mind when I finally saw it. Everything about this film was just amazing. I'm not usually a big fan of animated/computer-generated films, but this movie really did impress me. I must say, I think that this is one of the best animated/computer-generated films that I have ever seen. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone of all ages, but in my opinion, maybe people who are at least seven years of age, but I say that because of some suspenseful sequences. I really do hope that many people get to see this film, preferably around the winter holidays. It's a film that everyone can somehow relate to. If you do see this movie, I encourage that you have an open-mind while you view it. It's fantastic! I really do think that this film is underrated.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
I haven't seen a film this good in years,"I absolutely adored The Polar Express. It's been over a decade since i described a film as ""magical"" but any other word seems to fall short of capturing the essence of the film. The film was so beautifully designed that every shot looked like a scenic photograph. I am I have to say a large Zemeckis fan and this is easily one of his best. It's beautifully shot, the script is enchanting and calmly knowing (in the way that A.A. Milne's 'Whinnie The Pooh' novels were). I thought Tom Hanks gave six magnificent performances and managed to make some very difficult lines potent and easy. (He was also rather good at doing multiple voices).The score from Silvestri was delightful and catchy but soft and sentimental at the same time. The songs were also lovely and they matched the mood of the film well. But the loudest applause must go to Zemeckis himself. Ranging from roller-coaster sequences, to creepy ghost monologues, to action sequencing the film embraces that which is entertaining and fun only. And what's this? Child performances of a professional callibre? (Although Hanks steals the show in every sense).What I really liked about this film is that there was absolutely nothing sinister about it. If you watch any child's film, there's usually a dark, crisp adult edge to it, most Disney films have wit aimed at the adults, but this film does not have this cynical undertone. It certainly has some moments for the adult audience but only in a soft and calm way, in a sense I suppose I valued the film's nostalgic quality; it has been far too long since I've seen a film that is just about childish fantasy. Some may criticise the film for being too sentimental but I don't think it was too sentimental at all, it was designed as a sweet Christmas movie and is just that.Now don't get me wrong I'm not a soft-hearted fan of children's nonsense, my favourite films include Apocalypse Now, The Exorcist, Aliens, Naked Lunch, Citizen Kane, Brazil & The Piano, none of which are renowned for charm, but I just felt with this film that it touched a part of my viewing mind that has not been touched in a long long time. I think it is a great shame that this film has not received more acclaim.Thank you Robert Zemeckis.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Foreign versions did more than just dub,"I saw this with my fiancée a few weeks ago and loved it. Their attempt to give the imagery the same feel as the book was very successful. I read a few movie-critic reviews that suggested the facial expressions were spooky and lifeless, but I did not notice that quality at all.After seeing it in the U.S. (english), my fiancée and I took her nephew in Germany to see it as his first movie-theater experience. Of course I was expecting that the voices would be dubbed in German, but I was really impressed to find that all the images that contained text were also translated.

The Magic of the Book Survives,"So I went to see the first showing of the Polar Express today.BUT, I shelled out the extra money to go see it in 3-D at Imax and it was amazing. I mean I almost can't even put the experience into words. Every year since I was born my mom has read me the Polar Express at Christmas. I can't even tell you how high my expectations were for this movie. I was actually scared to see it because I was so sure I was going to be disappointed.I can't even describe how much I loved it. That is without a doubt the best movie I have ever seen. Not only was the CGI amazing and in 3-D, omg I was actually reaching out trying to touch the falling snow. But the story was magical and heart breaking and inspiring. When the little boy stood on the back of the train singing about Christmas not working out for him I wanted to cry. When the young boy finally hears the the bell on Santa's Sleigh I actually laughed out loud. I had the biggest smile on my face the entire time. It is so rare that a movie can you make you feel so much.I have been so stressed lately and I've been dealing with so many knew things. There's just so much going on. But when I was watching this movie I literally felt like a child. It was like Christams morning and going to Disneyland and all those wonderful things all at one. I forgot everything and it was just about the magic of the movie. I'm willing to admit that my connection to the movie runs much deeper because of my love for the book but I just have to say that everyone MUST see this movie at least once. I know I'll be seeing it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Meh. It's okay.,"First off, let me say that the movie was beautiful. The innovative animation techniques really captured the idea of a storybook come to life. That said-- I probably would have liked this movie better if they'd spent a little more time developing the characters and a little less time careening around like a roller coaster. I also thought the Mick Jagger cameo towards the end was a bit much. Overall, it wasn't painful to watch, but I'm not sure I'd want to watch it again if I wasn't required to. I'd rather they'd have added to the existing plot instead of trying to stretch a twenty-five page book into a feature-length film.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Stunning, absolutely stunning","I saw this movie two days ago, and I must say that I'm very surprised at the current low rating of 7.0.I was amazed by this movie. I saw the IMAX 3-D version. I really suggest that you see it this way. I have never seen such a spectacle in a theater. I have never seen a movie more than once in the theater, but I may see this one again, because that experience can't nearly be duplicated at home.I thought they did a fantastic job with this wonderful children's book. I really am surprised at the negative comments from people. I don't know maybe in a normal theater it would just be a very good movie. Many people are commenting about the lifeless look of the characters, I guess that is somewhat true, but it didn't bother me at all. I think the actors did excellent work with the voices. That brought them to life for me. Tom Hanks is so good.I went to the movie with two families, 4 adults and six children ages 3,4,4,6,10, and 10. There were some parts that I think can be scary for small children, but none of the ones in our group had trouble with it. My three year old son hid his eyes during the scene where the toy came to life and yelled at the boy, but it was over quickly, and he went back to enjoying the movie. I must say though, that I think it's a shame to have scenes in a movie like this that can potentially scare young kids. It's just unnecessary. Why put doubts in parent's minds?I think anyone of any age (above 3) would LOVE this movie. Go see it in IMAX. I think it's an instant classic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautifully Brilliant,"I suppose I had initial hesitations about this movie. Considering how another Christmas classic, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, was severely butchered and over-hyped when it made the transition to the big screen, I think many others as well as myself were worried the film could only spoil our memories of Van Alsburg's classic.Rest assured, this film lives up to and exceeds expectations. First of all there is the look of the film which does a great job of recreating the visual feel of Christ Van Alsburg's book. But more importantly, even though the story had to be expanded, (come on, the book was only about thirty pages, and most of those are filled with pictures,) it fully captures the essence of this holiday classic and adds more to it. The performances are simply wonderful, and the cinematography is beautifully dream-like. I admit there were one or two scenes that were so well done I almost wished I could jump in and join in the fun the characters on screen were having.Overall this is certainly a film people will be watching every Christmas years from now, and will probably be as equally cherished a holiday classic as the book itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Destined to be a classic,"My family and I loved this movie. I had heard quite a bit about the animation process and how ""unusual"" it was, and I was prepared for it to interfere with experiencing the story. I was pleasantly surprised at how little I noticed the new animation style. Every once in a while something about a character (usually the mouth) would jump out as odd. Overall, I thought the animation was well done. As for the story, Yes, it had a few elements that felt somewhat incomplete or slightly slow. But my 6-year old son, my wife and I thoroughly enjoyed it. I found it very touching and full of good messages: ""Children can and should be leaders. Greed isn't respected; confidence and compassion are. You get friends by first being one."" I believe this movie will be a seasonal classic like the animated Grinch Who Stole Christmas and A Christmas Carol. And I hope that 10 years from now, the critics who disparaged Polar Express will be perceived in the same group as those who panned It's A Wonderful Life when it was first released. I believe those critics ""just can't hear the bell"". I'm looking forward to making viewing this movie with my family a holiday tradition.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Visually stunning, ESPECIALLY in IMAX 3D","If you are going to see any movie in 3D, this is the one to see. Filled with cutting-edge, life-like animation, the 3D experience in IMAX makes you feel like you are one of the characters in the movie.Starring Tom Hanks (playing/voicing 6 characters in the feature nonetheless!), The Polar Express is the story of a boy (voice of Daryl Sabara) that is starting to lose his excitement in Christmas as well as his belief that there really exists Santa Claus. On Christmas Eve, he goes to bed with doubts on his mind only to wake up to a multi-car locomotive outside of his house led by Conductor Tom Hanks. The Conductor invites the boy to take a voyage up to the North Pole to experience for himself what Christmas is all about.While The Polar Express is light on a thought-provoking and/or innovative plot, it offers some of the most incredible visuals a moviegoer has ever seen. It is an enjoyable ride through the snow, ice and then some all the way to the North Pole where millions of elves help Santa prepare for his departure to deliver gifts all around the world to those children whom have behaved themselves.Bottom line: this is a must-see family film!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not For Everyone,"I think this movie poses and also answer the question of whether or not CGI. even in 3-D, can successfully carry a movie with nothing else substantial to offer. To paraphrase my 14-year old daughter and her friend with their own slanguage: It was totally without a story. It was like all specially effecty and stuff, and that was cool, but it was no story. Little kids liked it, but it was so boring for older people.I think that gets to the heart of why I rated it a 4. Success in animation has grown, mostly through Pixar, by offering up movies that have appeal across the age spectrum. Toy Story, Nemo, Shrek 1 and particularly Shrek 2 thrilled little kids while giving plenty of laughs and enjoyment to older kids and especially parents who would otherwise be struggling to stay awake in movies like Polar Express.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing,"The Polar Express is truly amazing, you have never seen anything like it and I'm not just talking about the animation. The way it is put together is just so original and so perfect I think I can easily say this is the third best Christmas film ever right behind It's a Wonderful Life and The Bishops Wife. The Polar Express book was my favorite as a kid and after seeing the movie I read it again and still liked it, thats pretty darn amazing because I usually don't like that kind of thing. They extended the story from the book a lot, but they had to to make a full length film. The story from the book is magical and wonderful but the one from the movie is even better fleshing it out more and making it seem more real. The story is also really helped by some great dialogue and character development. The only flaw I can really come up with is the acting which is a little cheesy and should have been more grounded some cheese is great for this film but not quite that much. But it is greatly directed by the same man who brought us Back to the Future and Forrest Gump, he is a great director. The visual effects/animation are some of the best ever filmed, they are just perfect even the way the clothes move in the wind looks real. The cinematography is perfect but a little jumpy so be warned it feels like a roller coaster even on your TV at home. You will love it I am almost sure of that, I loved it more than I have of a film in a long time. Everyone should see this magical film on and around Christmas day. It is sure to become a Christmas classic and will last years from now, my grandkids will likely see and love this movie if I'm not mistaken.

Great classic entertainment!,"The Polar Express/2004/***1/2Main Stars: Tom Hanks Daryl Sabara Eddie Deezen Nona Gaye""This is the Polar Express!"" Tom Hanks's marshmallow voice says when he encourages the main kid star (Daryl Sabara) to get on the train so he can go to the North Pole. There's also another character that instantly becomes friends with the main kid, another person that was on the train, (Nona Gaye) an African American girl, well at least in the movie she is. Of course, as I just said, the North Pole is pretty much the setting for this movie except for the kids' houses. There is also a know-it-all kid (Eddie Deezen) in this movie. He thinks he knows everything about the North Pole and Santa and he has a really annoying voice. This is really a delightful movie with a wonderful imagination! Well, Chris Van Allsburg is the writer of the book and did a very good job writing it but the book is only the main point of this movie. There are also screenwriters that write things to fill in the movie to make it longer. There is also an object in this movie- a bell from Santa's (Tom Hanks') sleigh and you'll see why they have this bell in this movie. This is a classic just like the two classics- The Wizard of Oz and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. The two of them just have a delightful story!

A young boy who is on the verge of losing his belief in Santa Claus wakes on Christmas Eve to find a train waiting for him. The destination is the North Pole. Tom Hanks plays five characters in this movie, all of them very well. The movie is beautifully animated. I felt I was on this train going to the North Pole. I love the journey on the train, the smell of the coal, and the smoke from the engine. The message of the movie is that for some of us the magic of Christmas goes away as we get older, some never had it to begin with (symbolized by the young boy sitting in the caboose), and a few who has it for the rest of their lives. I know this by experience. I think I lost the magic of Christmas a long time ago. I doubt I will ever get it back. This movie shows me what I lost and wish I still had. This movie is a modern holiday classic. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Feel Good Holiday Movie,"This is one of those movies that showcases the good side of people through a little boy who is doubting the existence of Santa Claus. It's been done before, but the storyline formula of ""believing"" in something to make it ""real"" is tireless and heart-warming. I give it an 8 because it gets a little slow in the middle, but I recommend it highly to all family viewers. I liked the story more than ""Shark Tale"" but not as much as ""The Incredibles."" I will say this for the movie: computer generated characters have come a long way. I foresee the future of movie-making in my lifetime where any actors can be portrayed in this ageless fashion. While that may make the high-priced megastars shutter, just think of all the avenues that will be opened for actors who may not have that ""look"" so desired by Hollywood today....",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Superb All Time Top 10 Christmas Family Movie,"This movie has become a Christmas 'must see' every year in our house. I'm astounded by some reviewers stating it's too long or too scary. My son has watched it from the age of 5 and loves it just as much now as then and has never for one moment been scared or got bored by it. It is a wonderful movie capturing everything I hold dear about Christmas, the magic,the feeling of excitement and anticipation. It is not a slushy film but a firm and steadfast adventure with morality that isn't force fed to the audience. I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone young or old who have traditional values of what Christmas means. I have deliberately not gone into technical aspects of the film as some movies should be enjoyed for what they are, not the boring CGI specifications or pixel prattling that neither adds nor detracts to the enjoyment. Enjoy this film for exactly what it was designed to be, a wonderful Christmas time story.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
One of my favorite Christmas movies of all time!,"This movie was my introduction to Robert Zemeckis and it's the movie from his filmography that I've watched the most times back when I was a kid. Even as an adult, this is a movie that I continue to love and I love it even more than I ever did as a kid.Positives for The Polar Express (2004):
The premise of the movie is the thing that I enjoyed the most about it especially on this recent rewatch. As a kid, I had always dreamed about going to the North Pole and meet Santa Claus, but then again what kid didn't want to do that. You also get that classic Christmas atmosphere and spirit that makes the viewing experience all the more special especially whenever I watched this movie during the Christmas season which was like every single year. I also got to say that the animation in this movie still looks great two decades later. The musical score by Alan Silvestri is phenomenal, it matches perfectly with the Chirstmas atmosphere here and is easily among one of the best movie scores he's ever composed alongside Avengers: Endgame (2019), Predator (1987) and Back to the Future (1985). The movie can also be really funny at times and I get a couple of laughs. And finally, this is one of my comfort movies that I can watch or put on in the background if I need something to make me happy.Overall, The Polar Express (2004) is one of my favorite Christmas movies as well as one of my favorite movies by Robert Zemeckis and it's a movie that I will continue to watch for years to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sublime Christmas classic!,"Merry Christmas, everybody! My older brother and I have a little Christmas tradition, in which before going to bed on Christmas Eve, we watch the beloved animated Christmas film, The Polar Express. In fact, my brother still remembers when we first saw it on TV in our hotel room on a trip to Barcelona, back in Spring 2005 (when I was barely 2, and he was 5). And it still holds up nineteen years later!Based on Chris Van Allsburg's 1985 children's picture book of the same name, The Polar Express takes place at Christmas sometime in the 1950's, and centers on a young boy, simply known as the Hero Boy (voiced by Daryl Sabara, movements by Tom Hanks), who does not believe in Santa Claus. However, on Christmas Eve, he takes an amazing train trip to the North Pole, along with many other kids, and sets out on a journey of self-discovery, where he soon learns that the mysteries and wonders of life never fade for those who truly believe. In other words, it puts a strong new twist on the meaning of Christmas spirit by representing it as a test of faith. And director, producer and co-screenwriter Robert Zemeckis did a flawless job of adapting the book faithfully, and he also expanded the universe to make it into a feature-length film, by adding new situations and characters; namely a girl known as the Hero Girl (speaking voice and movements by Nona Gaye, singing voice by Meagan Moore), a lonely boy named Billy (speaking voice by Jimmy Bennett, singing voice by Matthew Hall, movements by Peter Scolari), a nerdy boy known as the Know-it-all Kid (Eddie Deezen), and the disappearing hobo (Tom Hanks).The animation is extraordinary! This was the first movie ever to entirely use motion-capture animation, and it's aged like wine. Zemeckis managed to flawlessly implement the designs from Van Allsburg's illustrations into the models, and the faces of the Hero Boy and all the other kids in the movie, even the Hero Boy's little sister Sarah (voiced by Isabella Peregrina, movements by Leslie Zemeckis) still look exactly right for their age. You really can't tell that their movements were done by adults! The color scheme and sceneries, likewise, are downright gorgeous, and Zemeckis's dynamic camera moves and editing just add to it. The only problem is that sometimes, the characters' eyes look a little dead, resulting in some mild creepiness. But when it comes to mo-cap animation, I've definitely seen worse (Mars Needs Moms, anyone?).And all of the characters are excellently developed! The Hero Boy is a very engaging and compelling protagonist. The Hero Girl, likewise, is very sweet, kind, and resourceful. Billy is also very trusting and well-developed. As for the Know-it-all Kid, though he's meant to be annoying and does come off that way at times, he's also super quotable and funny. But the Conductor (Tom Hanks) is my favorite character in the movie! He's very businesslike, and gets some of the best lines. The train's crew, Smokey and Steamer (both Michael Jeter, in his final performance before his death) are great comic relief characters (especially when Steamer breaks the throttle!). And the hobo is very helpful at times.The voice-acting is amazing! Daryl Sabara supplies a certain earnestness as the Hero Boy. As the Hero Girl, Nona Gaye demonstrates that even at 30, she has the range to play a 12-year-old girl. Eddie Deezen is fittingly nerdy as the Know-it-all Kid. Jimmy Bennett retains that classic child's innocence as Billy. But in this movie, Tom Hanks really gets to show off his fabulous vocal range! While flawlessly using his natural voice as the Conductor and as the Hero Boy's adult narration, he gives a good, gravelly voice to the hobo, and a big, deep dignified voice to Santa.Before wrapping things up, let me talk about the music. Zemeckis regular Alan Silvestri, also the genius behind the scores for Lilo and Stitch and Night at the Museum, delivered a beautiful, Christmassy score for this movie! And the original Christmas songs that he co-wrote with Glen Ballard are fabulous. ""Hot Chocolate"" is a very fun song that my brother and I like to sing along to, and so is the title song. In regards to the slower songs, ""When Christmas Comes to Town"", sung by Billy and the Hero Girl, is chillingly beautiful, and the same can be said for ""Believe"" in the end credits. While I rarely think highly of Josh Groban, the way he sings ""Believe"" just makes it a better song than it normally would be. The movie also fabulously chooses really good 40s/50s-era recordings of classic Christmas songs, including ""Santa Claus is Comin' to Town"" by Frank Sinatra.All in all, The Polar Express is a sublime Christmas classic for several reasons. The animation is innovative and beautiful, the characters are marvelous, the music is wonderful, the script is excellent, the pacing is perfect, and it stays fully faithful to Van Allsburg's work. As such, it's a fabulous movie, and a compulsory viewing for Christmas.Oh, by the way... ""WHO IN THE BLAZES APPLIED THAT EMERGENCY BRAKE?!?!?!?!?!?!""",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Come on people!  This is a great movie!,"First off, I give this movie a 10 for production values. Innovative, exciting, stunning visuals. Buy the DVD, but if you get the chance to see a re-release on a big screen, do it.This movie is a ten for acting...yes, I say, acting. These figures on the screen are computer generated using a live action process with real actors. Sometimes the tone or volume of an actor's delivery is over the top in such quasi-animation movies. Actors tend to want to make their mark vocally when they believe their image isn't on screen. However, Zemeckis must have had the complete trust and cooperation of his cast. A beautiful job of maximizing the fantasy while keeping the characters human.This movie deserves a 10 for pace, continuity, and music placement. A story is told, action delivered, characters developed, a climax is reached,and an ending brings all the elements together. The writer and director execute the necessary elements that captures the viewer's imagination,makes us care about the characters, and keeps us watching for the conclusion.This movie deserves a 10 for entertainment value. Don't get me wrong, I love a lot of R rated movies, but I do yearn sometimes for intellectual entertainment as a change of pace to loud action or a few bare breasts. The fantasy does include scenes of suspense and ""action"" but the story line and the visuals are what entertains in this movie, not the visceral stimulation of organs south of the belly button.I give this movie a 9 because the limitations of a Christmas theme makes things just a little familiar. On December 23, with a few inches of new snow on the ground, a fire going in the wood stove, and a spouse, grandma,and the kinds gathered around the TV and a bowl of popcorn, this movie would get an 11+. But when you slap it in your SUV DVD player as brain candy for the 4 year old in the back seat as you drive to the family 4th of July picnic, it's thematic specificity is the only downside to this movie.Buy it, watch it, enjoy it, and for those of you giving this movie ones and twos, stick to watching the Blair Witch Project.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"If you don't believe, this will stir your doubts.","This is an excellent movie for all ages. As I sat in the theatre with my wife, son and adult friend, I was amazed at the wide diversity in attendant age. Seniors to small children and even adults without offspring were in the crowd. The realism in animated 3D characterization was excellent. The numerous roller coaster effects are spectacular and not for the feeble of stomachs. There is little laughter, except for the odd subliminal quip, but then again I don't believe that was the intent of this film. There is a message built in for every type of person and you must be ready for it near the end. You can't help but see yourself and at least someone you know in the movie. Be warned that you may even find a tear welling within even if you think you have a heart of coal. The scope of doubtful emotion and the sense to deny the child within builds to the final conclusion that maybe, just maybe there is a wish to believe.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
IMAX 3D version changes you from an observer of the action to becoming part of the action.,"At least for me, trying to describe the impact of watching this movie in IMAX 3D is difficult because it is such a radical difference from any other movie experience. It is the difference between becoming part of the action versus merely being an observer. The 3D effect is so perfect that you become the third person in a two person conversation, you get that roller coaster feeling in your stomach as the train careens out of control, your heart is in your throat when the characters (including yourself) are in peril. As a result it is not just watching a movie but creating an experience where you personally experience the action in a virtual world. Adding to this feeling is the sound track and high quality audio system which envelopes you in this virtual world. The deep rumbling sound of the train alone causes your heart to start pounding both literally and figuratively. Because watching this movie in IMAX 3D is a totally different experience even if you have seen the movie already in 2D don't hesitate to see it again in 3D. If you have not seen it at all I highly recommend making the extra effort to find the movie in 3D.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Movie That Jump Started My Christmas Season,"This is another underrated movie that too many people just didn't get. I haven't read the book (I just ordered it from Amazon.com), so maybe that's a good thing, so I can't compare the film unfavorably.THE POLAR EXPRESS is a simple but magical tale about faith. The script managed to get some mileage out of it, and you gotta love a movie in which Santa Claus is such a gentle giant, we see thousands of elves all the way to the horizon, one of them is Steve Tyler, and everything else in the movie, including the score, is grand! Why it wasn't Oscar-nominated for Best Animated Feature Film is beyond me, even if THE INCREDIBLES won because it was marginally better. The score should have at least been nominated (at least 'Believe' by Josh Groban was nominated). The title song is a fun arrangement, 'Spirit of the Season' gives me Christmas goosebumps even now that it's the month of May, and the instrumental music conveys the dreamlike quality of going to the North Pole. And how about the 'Hot Chocolate' number, though the song has very repetitive lyrics! The film has many wonderful moments, such as when Hero Boy first comes face to face with St. Nick. Isn't that a kid's Christmas dream?! At the age of 39, I can still appreciate that. That train almost becomes a roller-coaster as it presses on through rough terrain to meet its deadline. Even Tom Hanks' somewhat obnoxious train conductor is ultimately likable.I can't wait till THE POLAR EXPRESS comes out on DVD. I can understand if it doesn't come out tillChristmas, but whenever it comes out, I'm there! I wish I could see the IMAX version. And remember everyone, 'you have everything you need/If you just believe.'",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Beautiful Book, Beautiful Film","""The Polor Express"" is a wonderful Christmas book by Chris Van Allsburg. The artwork of the book has been amazingly transformed to film in Zemeckis' film.Many reviews have ridiculed either the quality of animation or the absurdity of the prolonged story. I think that this film did an admirable job at making a short picture book come to life in a wonderful tale on screen.I know that if I were a child again, this film would capture my heart. It nearly did that and I am an adult. I honestly think that children of all ages will enjoy this story as a wonderful Christmastime treat.There are so many small details that take the story telling in the film to a greater depth that is not possible in a book. It is a very good companion to the original book but in no way does it take its place. However, the film remarkably does not try to overshadow its source material like most book to screen transitions.At times the film gets lost in trying to create conflict to prolong the story, but it is worth going to see with family and friends if just to watch the beautiful animation come to life. The story's true essence is still present and it is filled with beautiful music by Alan Silvestry.Read the picture book with your family this Christmas and also enjoy the film. I know that you will love both.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Visual Extravaganza,"A great Christmas tale wrapped up in the BEST animation and direction all year!!! This movie was entirely animated because of one reason: to make the movie in real life would have cost something like $2 billion dollars (excerpts from Director Zemeckis). Watch it and you'll understand (although making this revolutionary animation didn't come cheap either, at $165 million dollars!). The filming angles, settings, character movements, the Polar Express ride, and the City of North Pole, simply could not be shot in real life with the kind of stunning effects presented in this movie. Tom Hanks delivers yet another (and another, and another... for a total of 5 roles) astounding performance. This is exactly how animated films should be made, to present stories in ways impossible with real-life characters and cameras!! (unlike cheap attempts like the Rugrats or Pokemon). Watch it in an IMAX theater if it's available to you! You are gonna be in for a visual treat!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
How many of you have actually SEEN the movie?,"Yesterday I saw the movie in a packed theater of mostly elementary school students. The children were captivated. They sang, they cheered, the ""woooohed"" through the action parts. The animation was spectacular, on par with an IMAX type attraction called Corkscrew Hill that I just went on at Busch Gardens. The animation of the children's faces was a bit creepy, but aren't a lot of animated characters kind of creepy?I can't comment on the geopolitical ramifications of how the children were treated at the opening or what the director may have said. I can say, if you want to take your children to a movie that will entertain everyone in your family, go see this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The best G-rated holiday movie this year!,"Awesome! After a flood of R rated or PG-13 rated movies lately, it's just a pleasant surprise to see a movie with a G rating that still keeps the audience interested. Especially a movie based upon such a holiday-based classic story. Having read the book thousands of times to the attentive young children on the local tourist train, I am quite familiar with the story background. It's nice to see that the movie maintained the storyline while sensationalizing, or filling in the gaps. After all, it takes 5 minutes to read the book aloud. So to go from 5 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes, that's a lot of filler! When you watch this movie though, you have to keep in mind that it's a dream. The train scene does get a bit wild, but it's just an illusion played by the young boy's imagination. Definitely take the kids to see this movie! I still hear the sleigh bell! :-)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice movie,"I found a movie that is a perfect family favorite. Based off of the 1986 children's book, the Polar Express follows a boy whom feels doubtful of Christmas hopping on a magical train, meets new friends and go on a railroad journey of a lifetime.This movie is exciting, touching, cute and admirable. A lot of work went into this movie and it is well worth your time. It is not an emotionless G rated movie (like most in this PC era), it was full of twists and turns and you could feel both sympathy and relief for the characters (especially the Lonesome little boy in the back of the train).I wish there would be more family movies like this instead of plot less toilet humor flicks.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A confession,"I would like to make a confession here. The polar express is not only the greatest Christmas movie but its one of the finest movies i have ever seen. It took the animation to a new level.I am sure u would agree with me in this occasion.Although there are some sloppy moments,u have to sit tight for almost 95% of the movie.Its like a joyride into the realm of fantasy.Robert Zemeckis has created a masterpiece here.Tom hanks has been awesome like he always was. Yah i agree with some that it may not be totally made for children as it has some frightful or to be precise ""exciting"" scenes.But in total its a must watch movie. The theme and plot was like a feel good movie at the end.But the movie at each point was not about Christmas only,but like a realistic adventure. The soundtrack was also too good.""Seeing is believing"",""spirit of the season"",""when Christmas comes to town"",""Believe"" was awesome. Lastly the special feature of the movie is the ghost.Its inclusion is really the most interesting part of the movie and its where Zemeckis scores.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

I can only comment on the IMAX!,"...but I thought that in 3D the characters really came alive. I've heard a review that the characters lacked any emotional connection with the audience in 2D. If that is true and you were left disappointed get yourself down to an IMAX cinema. It was my first time at an IMAX cinema and I left feeling I'd watched a really entertaining show... On more than one occasion my girlfriend told me she felt sick, which I thought was great. The reason why is she gets sick on rollercoasters. So therefore the effects when the train was shooting up hills and down steep drops seemed very real. There was one shot of the train skidding to a stop that caused me to tilt my head back to avoid a head on collision. The young boy came across well and if I had one criticism of the characters it would be that Tom Hanks didn't have to play so many. I think the diversity would've benefited the film. ps>I don't have shares in IMAX. Promise.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"What, there's a 3D version?","Polar Express has just opened in Australia and we saw it the other night. It is visually the most amazing thing I have ever seen. (We saw Final Fantasy just to see the CGI). It was also refreshing to see a movie where somebody actually understands how a steam locomotive is operated. Now you tell me there is a 3D version?Fundamentally it is like one of those beautifully illustrated children's books, but it moves and it talks. Ostensibly it's about Christmas and the Santa Claus thing, but it's really about the wonder of childhood - those who have it, those who don't and those who missed out. There are flaws, and you can be PC about some things - it ignores the Christian background of Christmas - which is fine by me (let's not get into pagan roots, shall we?) and it's PC about other things, but I am happy to overlook this, because I can hear the bell!If you haven't seen this movie, don't be put off by other user comments - they don't hear the bell.

My new favorite Christmas movie...,"We need more Christmas movies like this. I grew up reading this book and the story is excellent, this is a wonderful adaption. Great for the kids. And as far as people saying it is scary, it is probably those parents that never let their kids see anything and shelter them. It is not scary. And the action is great, it keeps the story going, and keeps you entertained.As far as the animation, it is incredible. I am majoring in animation so I know what I'm talking about when i say its great. This is some top notch animation. It really couldn't get any more realistic than this. The only character i thought wasn't developed very well was the little black girl. I think they could have made her a little more realistic. Other than that it is amazing and captures the feel from the book.Tom Hanks is amazing in this film too. His voice provided a warm comfortable feel to the movie. I also grew up watching Tom Hanks movies so this was a treat to have him in a Christmas movie.This is a great movie, and I think they put this movie together very nicely. It also preserves some of the magic of Christmas that is still left.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beautiful and incredible,"Many people seem to have missed so much in this movie.I took my two grandchildren, ages 6 and 3, and they were rapt throughout. Neither was afraid, both wanted to see it again. So we went again with their parents. I have it on DVD. I suspect that, as is so often the case, kids are scared because they pick up from their parents or adults with them who ""think"" kids will be scared. But then, my grandchildren have sat through the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"", and we're off next week to ""The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"".The movie wasn't intended to be ""real"" - so scenes with trains flying down roller-coasters, caribou on tracks, a wild ride on a frozen lake, all are believable in the overall story. This is a story from a child's point of view, where anything is possible. Never once were those children in real danger - it wasn't intended that way. It *was* intended to be a spiritual journey.Note to those who say Tom Hanks ""changed"" things and added to the story - Chris van Allsburg, the book's author, also was part of the team which wrote and created this. The sound of the train was really the sound of the real train upon which it was modeled and which still runs in Michigan. The homes were modeled after Robert Zemeckis' childhood homes.The whole look of the movie, and its use of light and warmth was amazing, not to mention the performance-capture technique. Look closely - eyelids move, eyebrows move, faces frown or smile. There is an African-American child, but there are also Asian children on the train - and the recreation of life in those days (I remember it well) was pretty accurate, which makes sense given that it was modeled on Zemeckis' own childhood.The scenes with the elves are a hoot - the main elf obviously comes from New Jersey, and caricatures of real people abound in a light and humorous way. The town at the North Pole was reminiscent of some of the old buildings in Helsinki and Tampere, in Finland.For me, the best part of the movie was Santa. He combines the aura (he glows) of a not-human, probably angelic being, but somewhat Nordic looking. Tales of Santa and elves abound in Finland, and I'm betting the creators drew on that history and look - even to some of the detailing in his costume. He isn't the jolly fat old elf (although a few ho-ho's are 'de rigueur'), but is tall and imposing, sturdy and strong, capable of being firm without anger, wise, compassionate, and with a sense of humour.This is not a movie about reality - it's a movie about faith and belief in the unseen. As a theologian, I've recommended this movie to my congregation as way of indulging in a little childhood fantasy, and grappling with issues of faith and disbelief in the things we can't see. Tom Hanks, Chris van Allsburg, and Robert Zemeckis, and the whole team in this movie have done a wonderful job of creating a beautiful movie with a message not only for children but for adults as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

He eventually gets on as he is swept away beyond his wildest imaginations on a journey worth remembering. The unexpected meeting with a enigmatic man atop the train will leave people wondering who is that person ? Santa Claus ? You'll figure it out in time to come.

Wonderful...,"What can i say... I am 35yrs old and i wish i was a kid again, this film has hit the right spot. Apart from the visual effects which where outstanding the story line is fantastic. The whole atmosphere of the movie made is worth while, my 6 yr old daughter was in her element. This Movie has made my daughter believe more in saint than before as she was starting to get the doubts.. This movie will make kids around the world believe which to me i think is a very healthy thing for kids to grow up with happiness and fun.. If you don't have kids just watch it yourself and make sure you watch it first thing in the morning because it will give you a smile for the rest of the day or even the week, it did me..I can describe this movie now in 1 word....FANTASTIC......",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is the best X-mas film I've ever seen,"Before going to the cinema I read several comments about this movie and they varied from admiring and rapt ones to very sceptical and ironic quips. But then I thought to myself: ""Dennis, a Robert Zemeckis' film cannot be insipid; just think of it!"" And I was right! This is really the best Christmas movie I have ever seen in my life! I have been so impressed! Even now I feel high, a day after. I have to say I even could not hold my tears though I am 35 and was seeing the movie together with my daughter. It's a good-hearted, cheerful and very delightful film. Its main words are ""Seeing is believing"" but naturally, if you believe in a miracle, perhaps it could become the reality? Of course, 3D technology makes the movie even more interesting than I expected. Brilliant.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent animated film (Brings back the child in me),"The Polar Express is one of the most outstanding and most spectacular animated films i've ever seen. I felt like I went back to my childhood days and remember myself many Christmasses ago when I kept waiting for Santa like what Hero Boy in the film did. I can see myself in him.. I just felt like I was a kid again when I saw the film The film has a beautiful story (thanks to the book of course) and a very wonderful music. The OST ""Believe"" is perfect and suits the film so well. This movie made me want to ""BELIEVE"" literally. It is just so wonderful and it brings back the magic of Christmas.I would like to quote the famous lines of the book which I truly love and which are in the movie as well: ""On Christmas Eve, many years ago, I lay quietly in my bed. I did not rustle the sheets. I breathed slowly and silently. I was listening for a sounda sound a friend told me I'd never hearthe ringing bells of Santa's sleigh"" ""At one time most of my friends could hear the bell, but as years passed, it fell silent for all of them. Even Sarah found one Christmas that she could no longer hear its sweet sound. Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me as it does for all who truly believe."" To sum it up, this movie is a must-see and while the Yuletide season is not yet over, it's good if you can go catch it in the theaters while you still can. I will definitely buy the VCD of the Polar Express when it's released so that I got something to cherish every Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Magical,"This movie is absolutely stunning. The visuals literally took my breath away throughout the film. The story is a classic that was handled with delicacy and grace in this adaptation. The filmmakers do an amazing job of capturing the Christmas spirit and making the nameless characters both realistic and memorable. Although some younger children might be frightened by the haunting nature of the film, I think most kids 6 and up will appreciate it's unique style. A movie like this should not be denied a cinematic experience. It is a perfect film for the holiday season and it would be a shame if bad timing and some unfair reviews kept audiences away. Don't miss this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

This movie was excellent!,"I saw this for the first time last night with my mom (who is also a holiday movie buff). I have to say that I really enjoyed it. It kept my attention the entire time; the CGI was incredible! The movie was so colorful, it was like you couldn't look away if you tried! Although the movie is geared more towards children, I cannot help to admit that I will be purchasing this. It has been added to my ""favorite holiday movie"" collection. I also hate to admit that the movie had me holding back tears a few times. It was just so refreshing. It made me miss that awe and wonder that you have as a child during the Christmas season. I remember growing up that I LOVED Christmas. It was my favorite time of year, and I would have the serious blues when it was over. I just like how it made me feel. Warm & comfortable.I definitely recommend it :)",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Journey of Christmas Spirit,"Let's face it, we all can remember the time when we were little kids, and we were full of anticipation of Santa Claus and all the gifts we would get on Christmas. This gorgeous film, reminds us of those times, and reminds us of the true spirit of Christmas.It's Christmas Eve, and a boy has his doubts on whether or not Santa Claus is real, due to some magazine clippings of regular people dressed as Santa, and a encyclopedia that states the North Pole is ""Devoid of Life"". So, naturally he gets a big surprise that night when a giant train shows up outside his home,its engine roaring, and out comes the conductor telling him it's going to the north pole, hence its called The Polar Express.The journey will be like no other, full of surprises and thrills, and complete enchantment, and we feel as if we are right there, going along for the ride. The friends that the boy makes are true friends, and the moment he meets Santa Claus, Christmas will never be the same. For those who believe, once believed, or never believed in Santa, and have at any time, imagined what the north pole was like and meeting him, will not be disappointed as the film beautifully captures the look and magic of the north pole and Santa himself. Tom Hanks did a wonderful job voicing the conductor and the hobo, along with the performance capture of the boy/hobo/conductor/and Santa.The other actors deserve as much credit, and I applaud Robert Zemekis for this brilliant achievement, from the man who gave us ""Back to the Future"" and ""Forrest Gump"", I didn't expect anything less.Now some have objected to the things that occur in the film and how it is inappropriate for some children because it might be a little too much. While I agree the film has some dark moments, they are certainly not the type that will give your children nightmares, unlike another film like ""Jumanji"". Others have criticized the look of the characters as not being so impressive, thought I found the animation to be better than I expected, and finally some have criticized about the action sequences to be a bit exaggerative, that the whole movie was nothing but a lousy adaptation of the book, spruced up to be the equivalent of a ""big blockbuster action extravaganza"".This film is none of the above, and it was a downright insult that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (Oscars), did not give this film a much deserved nomination and win for Best Animated Film for the year 2004. I know everyone was more excited about seeing ""The Incredibles"" and though I'm not knocking that film, I think its great, and I'm glad it got the Oscar, but I would have preferred for this film to get that honor. It's a shame that it was a commercial failure, because it deserved to sell as many tickets as ""The Incredibles"". Along with being released in theaters nationwide, a special IMAX 3-D version of the film was released, and it is by far, my favorite version, though I am just as happy when watching it on DVD. The IMAX version sold the most tickets, it did so well that IMAX brought it back in Christmas of 2005, the same time the DVD version came out. I really hope they bring it back in theaters Christmas of this year, because it is a genuine treasure, and the moment your hear the bells from Santa's sleigh, the bells will continue to ring in your heart, and in all the other hearts of those that truly believe, so Come Aboard!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's a Better Christmas Movie Than The Grinch,"I absolutely love The Polar Express movie! It's truly a magical and heartwarming film that captures the spirit of Christmas in the most beautiful way. The animation is stunning and the music is enchanting. The story is full of adventure, wonder, and the importance of believing in the magic of the holiday season.The characters are lovable and relatable, especially the young boy who embarks on a journey to the North Pole on the mysterious Polar Express. The film is filled with excitement and joy, and it never fails to bring a smile to my face.The Polar Express is a timeless classic that I watch every year during the holiday season. It never fails to fill me with warmth and nostalgia. I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a heartwarming and magical Christmas film. It's a true gem that will leave you feeling full of holiday cheer. 10/10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Have to agree with steve49er--VERY good Christmas Movie,"I have to agree with the comments of #57, steve49er. This movie is easily one of the most well done, original movies in a long long time. It's no re-make of the 'classics', like many attempted to do, and ruined, like what they did to Frosty the Snowman, and Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer. This one is indeed destined to be a classic in it's own right. My only regret is that I didn't take the time to go see it back when it first came out. Thankfully, it's been on Cable this week and I've gotten to see what I'd missed. My Wife and I will certainly be adding this to our library of DVD's. You'd do well to rent it, find it on TV, or just buy it. I'm glad that someone in Hollywood finally got a good story and ran with it.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
excellent,"I was totally mesmerized from beginning to end. I am going to add this to my annual Christmas movie list of ""White Christmas"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", ""Jesus of Nazareth"", etc. A must-see for all ages. I am 53 years of age and love to watch animated movies, including the Disney classics, Pixar animated movies and all animation genres. The Polar Express surpassed my wildest imagination as to what could be achieved in animation. The story line was beautiful, hopeful, heart-warming and will hopefully affect everyone who sees it with goodwill and love toward all during the holiday season. We need more of these types of family movies to show our children that life is not all 'shoot-em-up' video games.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great Xmas movie,"Every once in a while, we have a good Xmas movie come along. The latest ones have been ""The Santa Clause"" and ""Santa Clause II""; now we have ""Polar Express"".After we got back home from the show, we dug out the book. What amazed me was how hard the movie's animators worked to stay true to the drawings in the book (the whole book itself takes about 2 minutes to read). The writers took some liberties with the journey getting to the Pole, but all-in-all, this is an Xmas movie that will stand the test of time.Throw away ""It's A Wonderful Life"" and replace it with ""Polar Express"".",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Santa Zombie is great!,"Yes, the eyes are freaky. Santa Claus looks like he eats children. The conductor hides his dead grandma in the attic. But my 4 year old doesn't care. He loves this movie.I first watched parts of The Polar Express before becoming a dad. And I just had to think of zombies. I am sure that ""Zombies on a train"" could be a fun movie if someone ever made it, but it was a shame anyway, since everything but the eyes and some facial expressions is brilliantly animated.Even worse: The eyes distracted me from the magic this movie tries to create.My 4 year old brought the magic back. He loves the train, the songs, the reindeer, the kids, the elves, the action, Christmas and the not so very holy ghost and sort of tolerates scary Scrooge as long as I sit close to him in the sofa when the old guy turns up. My son even loves creepy Santa.And suddenly my previous opinion makes no difference. If kids love it, then why should I be grumpy and grinchy?I shouldn't. This movie grows on you, and if you let it, maybe you can feel the magic, too.After a while you don't even care about the eyes. Or maybe the conductor just ate my brains and I didn't notice.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Polar Express is more incredible than 'The Incredibles',"I must admit I had low expectations as I walked into the theater to see Polar Express. I had seen 'The Incredibles' just a short time earlier, and was amazed at how good that film was, perhaps the best film of 2004. I did not think Polar Express or any other movie could possibly top it.I was wrong. Polar Express may be the best movie of 2004, so farWhen creating a film from an incredibly popular and well-know book like Chris Van Allsburg's 'Polar Express,' I had wrongly believed that the Hollywood types could only screw it up, make it boring, and fill it with lots of Jerry Bruckeimer-type special effects that would only distract us from the wonderful story. Again, I was wrong.The film 'Polar Express' does an absolutely wonderful job of capturing the two best aspects of Van Allsburg's book: the artwork and the message.The computer techniques used to tell this story are, by far, the best use of computer animation I've ever seen. Nothing that Disney or Pixar has done even comes close. The look and feel of Van Allsburg's wonderful artwork is completely intact, and in some ways, even exceeded. It's like watching a beautiful oil painting come to life. The film, if nothing else, is an absolute feast for the eyes, I was completely in awe from the opening minutes to the closing credits. I truly did not want to watch this banquet of beauty and light to end.But of course there's more to a movie than visualization, and the simple, but powerful tale of a boy out-growing the need to believe in Santa Claus is very well done. In the book 'Polar Express,' the boy-hero very much still believes in Santa when the train shows up in front of his house. In the movie version, we see a young boy who's begun to seriously doubt the Santa stuff. The change is a good one, in that most of the audience, especially the adults, will be able to relate to this change in perspective about Santa Claus that comes with the coming of age. The visit of the train to this boy's house is more than just the start of an adventure, it is the beginning of a mission of redemption, even if that redemption is only one's faith in a Jolly Old Man.But that's why 'Polar Express,' first in book form and now a motion picture, works so very well. It' not really a story about Santa Claus at all, but about faith. The film drives home this message in a more heavy-handed way than the book does, but still without the preaching and condemnation that often comes from other Hollywood films that attempt to re-educate their audience.Polar Express works on a much, much deeper emotional and spiritual level than does 'The Incredibles,' and will fit in very well with those other Christmas classics that are really parables about faith, like 'The Miracle on 34th Street,' and 'It's A Wonderful Life.' And to a lesser extent, even 'A Christmas Story.'My seven-year old daughter, who saw both films with me, gave 'The Incredibles' a score of 9 out of 10. As we were walking out of the theater, I asked her if she liked 'Polar Express.' She told me 'Yes, I give it an eleven!'My review of 'Polar Express' is of the 2-D version that will be seen on most screens. I have every intention of going to see it again, but this time making use of the IMAX 3-D version. Roger Ebert (film critic of the Chicago Sun-Times) saw the film this way, and said it was the best 3-D experience he's ever had.I so wish the Polar Express would stop in front of my house this Christmas Eve.My rating: 11 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing animation film,"The film's animation, ahead of its time, retains a timeless charm, creating a wondrous world that sparks the imagination. Tom Hanks, in multiple roles, delivers a stellar performance, infusing the characters with depth and charisma. The expressive animation and Hanks' voice work contribute to the film's emotional resonance.At its core, ""The Polar Express"" is a celebration of belief, friendship, and the spirit of Christmas. The soundtrack, featuring the iconic ""Believe"" by Josh Groban, enhances the magical atmosphere, making it a holiday classic for generations. Zemeckis skillfully balances spectacle with heartfelt storytelling, ensuring that the film remains a cherished part of the festive season.Whether experiencing the wonder for the first time or revisiting it annually, ""The Polar Express"" earns its 5-star rating for its enduring charm, superb animation, and the timeless message that reminds us all to keep the magic of belief alive, especially during the holiday season.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

Still the BEST 3D movie ever made,"This movie was SO good in the IMAX 3D format - far better than the standard 2D version - that it will cause you to think that it must have been made first in IMAX 3D and THEN converted to the ""standard"" format (not so)!I have seen this movie in both formats; it is the IMAX 3D version that gets so many accolades and is the version that so many people love SO much. The unique animation style is indeed very interesting to watch, but it is the IMAX 3D conversion that enables the viewer to truly relate to the characters and EXPERIENCE the movie rather than just passively ""watch"" it. The 2D version comes off as typical holiday ""fluff,"" while the IMAX 3D version is a genuine ""tear- jerker"" that will amaze both kids and adults, no matter what your age or religious affiliation may be.If it ever comes around again in the IMAX 3D format and you haven't yet seen it be SURE to go, whether you've already seen the 2D version or not. You won't regret it - nor the somewhat increased ticket price that you may have to pay - and you will leave the theater understanding how it revolutionized the theatrical movie presentation industry by demonstrating exactly HOW good 3D - especially IMAX 3D - can now be.

The Polar Express: An Animated Triumph,"The Polar Express has truly everything you could ever hope for in an animated film. The film has a lot of action-packed scenes (G-rated of course) which adds to the action category. The kids are heading to the North Pole to see if jolly old St. Nick really does exist, so obviously kids who go to see this movie build up much excitement waiting for the big moment. The storyline is extremely effective in expanding the popular children's book which can be read in less than 5 minutes into a 100 minute film. And then there are the visuals. I was blown away by how good the animation of the film is, of course the film is the first to be made completely with motion capture and the results are amazing, that is only one way to put it. I loved everything about the film. In fact, if I were to rank my all-time favorite animated movies, The Polar Express would definitely be the greatest animated movie I have seen to date",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

An entertaining and very enjoyable movie I'm sure my kids will enjoy one day.,"""The Polar Express"" is a great accomplishment for Castle Rock and the Warner Bros. The animation and detail is incredible, the sound is perfect, and all the characters are realistic and believable (excepting, of course, Santa himself). My favorite character was the Hobo on the roof of the train - he was very funny and strange, and Tom Hanks was perfect for his voice. The soundtrack is beautiful and fits the story very well.As for the plot - Sure, they added a few characters and events to make it a better movie, but it really adds to the quality. The book is a classic, and this film honors it rather than ravaging it.The only reason I give it 9/10 rather than 10/10, is the know-it-all boy on the train. Everything about him is irritating, especially his voice, which sounds like it came out of South Park (one of the worst TV shows ever made), and doesn't even remotely sound like a child.

Might almost make it to be a classic - in time,"Like many others, I didn't really know that to expect from this title, back when it was announced.When I finally saw it, I was hoping to be blown away.

Then I saw it with my girlfriends son, and the magic revealed itself.I noticed his total engrossment, the lights in his eyes and I was spellbound myself. Even though it was the second time I saw it.Part of the magic, heck, MUCH of it, is certainly due to the wonderful soundtrack by one of the masters themselves, namely Alan Silvestri. Having received an Oscar (and a Grammy award) for the song ""Believe"", it sets the standard for how moving and emotional a movie score can be.The movie itself is also heartwarming and charming, without being too much.

A very weird movie,"This movie is beautiful on the surface, but it has a very large subtext that is totally ignored by the characters. For example: why are the elves Jewish? They all have New York City accents and they use Yiddish words, and they all have trade mark noses. (I am a Jew). Why are two of the children on the train the very children who would have the biggest doubts about Christmas: the Jerry Lewis clone (another stereotypical Jew) and the poverty-stricken little boy who had never had a Christmas -- completely ignored and only the WASP kid from Minnesota got a Lesson of some very vague kind? Why was the Black girl there, except to heap more unhappiness on the poor kid by burbling about how Christmas is about parties, gifts, decorations and, in fact, commercialism -- and why does she remain clueless when clearly the poor child is made more unhappy by her burbling? Is she the PC version of the vacuous little rich girl?And why does the North Pole look like North Philly, with Muzak on a 45 rpm record thrown in? Who would relate to that?I enjoyed this movie for the visuals, but I would not take a child over the age of 8 to see it. They will ask way too many questions and you wn't be able to give them any answers.",,Anonymous,Animation
Magical - an instant classic.,"I took my 3 1/2 year old to a preview screening in Broomfield, Colorado. Not being particularly enamoured of either trains or children's movies, I had steeled myself for an indifferent 1 hr 40 mins. How wrong I was...Putting it bluntly, this film is magical - an instant classic. A must-see this Christmas season. The animation, reminiscent of Rotoscoping, is an absolute joy, with the imagery and atmosphere lifted seamlessly from the book. The book has been fleshed out with some interesting, mysterious - at times scary - and hilarious characters. The dialogue is top-notch, and the story riveting. Surprisingly, this film contains a great deal of action. The scene crossing the ice floe is masterful and your pulse will race on numerous occasions. There are some musical interludes, and an interesting cameo by an elfin rocker...While covering familiar territory, the film somehow avoids sentimental cliché so typical of movies in this genre. I challenge all of you cynical nay-sayers to see this movie and remain unmoved. My son was transfixed, as was the entire auditorium, and I noticed several guys in the Men's restroom after the movie blowing their noses... myself included.Kudos to Tom Hanks and the crew. I rate this a 9/10 and recommend without reservation. Fantastic, wholesome, fun entertainment. Raises the bar and establishes a new benchmark in festive fare.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Christmas Classic for the whole family,"Tom Hanks plays the train conductor of a magical train heading for the North Pole. Based on a storybook written by Chris Van Allsburg, the Christmas story tells of a boy who has reached an age when he begins to have doubts believing in Santa. Late one Christmas Eve, the young boy is lying awake waiting for the sound of sleigh bells ringing from Santa's sleigh. Five minutes to midnight his room begins to shake, and he hears a thunderous sound outside his window. The boy jumps from his bed and sees a train in the middle of his street. The boy grabs his robe and rushes out the front door to look at the train. The train's conductor asks the boy if he is getting aboard. The boy asks, 'where are you going?' 'To the North Pole, of course, this is the Polar Express!' At the last minute, the boy jumps on the train and finds other young boys and girls going to the North Pole. Their adventure begins.The Polar Express movie uses a new animation technique known as 'Performance Capture' that allows an actor to act rather than just supply the voice. The actor is dressed in a suit with computer-chips placed on it, and the computer captures the actor's live action movements, including facial expressions. The animation looks so real that you almost forget it is Computer Generated (CG). For example, when the three children are in the back of the caboose, you can see their hair moving in the wind. With CG, Tom Hanks was able to play 5 parts: the train conductor, the ghostly hobo, Santa Claus, the boy's father, and the boy. I didn't know that Tom played the boy until I read the credits. The film will become a Christmas classic, and I highly recommend this movie for the whole family. I want to see it again just to see what I missed the first time. CG is not cheap; the movie cost $165 million to make. (Warner Brothers Pictures, Run time 1:40, Rated G) (10/10)",,Anonymous,Animation
Cynics should learn from this movie,"Many of us look fondly back on the holiday evenings when the CBS Special Presentation logo would spin and then reveal such puppetoon classics as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer or Santa Claus is Coming to Town.Yet, all the bad reviews for The Polar Express state how poor the animation is. How the eyes don't look quite right. That the North Pole looks like a fascist regime. Yet, we can't remember how the Munchkins or the Oompa Loompas acted around their guardians. Did the eyes in our puppetoon favorites look real? Did any of our favorite Christmas specials ever have tons of characterization?The Polar Express is a sterling movie. The 1940's/Victorian feel gives it what I call ""creepy warmth."" The Hobo on top of the train. The industrial city that is the North Pole with the 30's/40's scratchy Christmas music playing through the loudspeakers. All this gives the movie an unsettling atmosphere that is comforting, yet at the same time, makes you shiver. This is the atmosphere of Charles Dickens and Norman Rockwell.I was amazed at how much I was touched by the messages in The Polar Express.These messages were obviously lost on the cynics panning it.As I sat there watching the picture book coming to life, I put it in the perspective of the holiday specials I enjoyed as a kid. Within that boundary, it fits perfectly.I give this *** 1/2 out of 4 stars.",,Anonymous,Animation
Tom hanks is great even as a computer image.,"We own this DVD,and my 3 year old grandson will watch it as many times a day as we'll allow. It teaches subtle lesson throughout the movie. Not to be selfish,help a friend in need,follow the rules and more. At first I had a tough time accepting the images as ""people"". Even on the big screen they seem almost robot like. But over all I do enjoy the movie, no matter how many times I have to watch it. And our family has started using many of the catch phrases in our everyday dealings with a 3 year old. As in ""all ahead slllllooooooooooow"",""What in the name of Mike!"",and ""lookie here, you've got a authentic genuine ticket to ride"". This movie has become a classic in our home. And I hope I'll get a chance to take my grandson to see it on the big screen next holiday season.",,Anonymous,Animation
"A movie that shows many gifts, or expensive gifts are not always the best thing to ask for.","I am a Tom Hanks fan and knew I couldn't go wrong with this one. I thought it was a great movie for Adults and children alike. It had so many messages in it. The one I liked the best was that a single Silver Bell would have such a great meaning. The spirit of Christmas the way it was long ago is lost today. All we can think about is how much can we spend. How many gifts will I get. That's not what Christmas is. It's helping people a little worse off than you. The feeling you get from that is a gift alone. You saw in the movie a boy who had nothing and when he received his first gift for Christmas he was so excited. It was just one gift, but it would bring him so much joy. The little girl who wanted to help everyone showed what Christmas is, giving of yourself for others. Then there was the Boy who only asked for a Silver Bell for his Christmas gift. The sound of that bell brought joy to him. Even the boy who wanted everything had his eyes opened to what Christmas really is. Be thankful for what you have and help a friend in need. That's what the Polar Express showed me.",,Anonymous,Animation
BEAUTIFUL FAMILY MOVIE -- A CLASSIC!,"This was a beautiful movie to see with your kids or loved ones, and I bet it'll be out for ages, alongside the original Chuck Jones ""Grinch Who Stole Christmas"", ""It's a Wonderful Life"", and the original ""Miracle on 34th Street"". It's great for adults and kids. This movie made me miss my own childhood, and the time when I loved Christmas so much and it lasted the whole month of December, not just the one or two days we get off of work and the hectic weekends spent rushing around malls. It's not for the cynics out there, as it is a 32 page picture book made into a movie. But I loved the feeling, the innocence, the excitement and belief in this movie. Truly, truly beautiful.The only thing I could wish for this movie was that it didn't come out on a Wednesday in mid-November, but maybe a little closer to the season. I'm sure it will be a classic for a long time to come.",,Anonymous,Animation
I Almost Forgot How to Believe,"Thanks to this warm, genuine movie, I remember how it feels to be a child again. I remember the anticipation, the happy feeling of Christmases in my younger days. Adults get so caught up in the dollars, the stresses, and the gifting, and we all need to just pause to sit back, reflect, and believe. I love to ""hear the bells"" of Santa's sleigh through my children. If you have young ones, they can sit through it. My 3 and 4-and-a-half year old loved it. I'm a softy who is a sucker for a feel-good movie. This one is a pure confection. I read the book every year as a Christmas tradition. Normally I would say the literature should be unadulterated by having a film version, so that the imagination can design its own pictures, but this isn't the case. The movie is that good.",,Anonymous,Animation
I don't know about you but I enjoyed it.,"Unlike most, I've watched this movie on IMAX 3D. There is no other way to watch it. It was as if it were made to be viewed as a 3D movie should. I do agree that the story was a tad dark for most kids, and that the characters were artificial. But at least it was more animated than Final Fantasy. It may not be real enough, but by the time it is, most of us would be dead. This is something I've learned to look past and enjoyed the movie as a whole.The IMAX 3D was breathtaking! Watching on a regular screen wouldn't do it any justice. I've seen it twice with a sold out crowd, and there were many oohs and aahs, and innocent giggles throughout the film. Some people were reaching out to touch the falling snow! This looks like it's going to be a reoccuring movie every Christmas on IMAX 3D. From which I will attend and enjoy.",,Anonymous,Animation
Spectacular animation; great story,"My spouse, hearing that this movie ""got poor reviews"", chose to stay home when I took my 12 yr. son to see this film. His loss. This movie was wonderful!. We loved the 3D animation, the special effects blew us away and the story - well, the story was an old one but one that always bears repeating. The tale of new friendships and simple faith - a belief in something which others may doubt is so appropriate at this time of the year. I was crying by the end of it. Actually, it is unfortunate that this film will probably be out of theaters by Christmas time. It has some of the same qualities as ""Miracle on 34th Street"" or ""It's a Wonderful Life"". It's G rating (something rare these days) makes it appropriate for everyone. If you're looking for a real ""feel good"" movie with great animation and some awesome special effects, I recommend it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Magical,"Okay, I'm 23 and have no children. I have been in love with this book since the age of 8. It is a beautiful book and I was really if-y about them making it into a movie. However, I found that I really liked it. The music and the Elves at the end were somewhat cheesy, but the heart of the story from the book is still there and it's still a story about hope and believing. I like the characters they added a lot, it really filled out the story, because, well they had to.The animation was brilliant, there was just the right amount of comedy without taking away from the heart of the story. It was beautifully written and drawn and I believe it will be a Christmas classic. At least it will be in my life. As a long time fan of the book there was somethings I wish they wouldn't have done with the movie, but as a whole I found myself loving it just as much as I do the book.",,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful and Heartbreaking,"For those who have so eloquently (read: ridiculously) panned this movie, I ask...did you see the same movie as I did???THE POLAR EXPRESS is so rich with depth, spirituality and nostalgia, I cannot fathom anyone especially anyone old enough to feel a connection to the past not enjoying this movie. Robert Zemeckis succeeds in capturing what it really feels the first time you experience, and to regain faith in something despite what life hands you to try and prove the contrary. This was a movie made by someone who experienced the joy and then sadness of Christmas (despite the erroneous thought that Robert Zemeckis is Jewish, which he's not. He grew up Catholic, celebrating both Christmas and Easter.)The animation is true to Van Allsburg's book, with a touch of Andy from Toy Story. The eyes are ""scary?"" Not at all...more like, the eyes are sympathetic, at least in the characters who are on screen for more than 2 seconds.This movie does lack one thing that runs rampant in ""kids"" movies today: STUPIDITY. You actually have to be invested in the story, and from frame one, I was. When I was a child, I NEVER liked movies that were made for kids. Ever. I always liked being in awe of the story, not feeling one step ahead of it. I liked being scared, because most good movies like this paid it off. Such films helped me to appreciate a deeper meaning, and I appreciated not having ideas shoved in my face or handed to me. POLAR EXPRESS moves, challenges and delivers on all levels.The movie looked great, touched me to my core, and will hopefully be recognized for the masterpiece that it is. I cannot say enough good things about this movie, other than to urge people to go see it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Must see!,"One of the most beautiful modern Christmas stories to date, I have seen other Christmas movies that use absurd characters with no reality, filled with slapstick and no substance or warmth. This film is completely the opposite, had me hooked from the start and is suited to adults and children alike. The kids i showed this to loved every minute of it! Excellent acting especially from Tom Hanks, and great animation There are humorous moments throughout that make you chuckle and the music is a perfect backdrop for the story to hang onIf you want a a Christmas movie with modern humour and technique mixed with old time warmth of films like miracle on 34th street this film is for you!",,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent and spell-binding,"This film is absolutely breathtaking in its reality. At times I had to scrutinize the screen to confirm that it was, in fact, animation. The story is very touching. Tom Hanks' talent is amazing. It was a surprise when I read the credits and found that he had not one, but six roles. I was reading to determine who Santa Claus was...yep, Tom Hanks. The runaway train scenes are fantastic. The wolf scenes will touch the heart of any animal lover.The strength of the 'hero girl's' character is wonderful. The transformation of the children's characters is wonderful. What can I say, I truly enjoyed this film.",,Anonymous,Animation
For kids of all ages!,"This movie is definitely a movie for children - of ANY age. I just watched it with my 7 year old daughter and my 2 1/2 year old son - who would not take his eyes off the screen. They both loved it. I was a bit concerned of how my son would react, this being his very first theater movie, but he did not move the entire time. That is something we have never experienced with him - sitting all the way through any movie or television show. We absolutely LOVED it. My daughter can't wait to go to school tomorrow to tell her friends about it. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see a really great holiday movie. The characters in this movie seemed so physically real. I went into the theater expecting a lot after hearing all the reviews and seeing interviews on T.V. and I did not feel let down at all as I was leaving after the movie was over. I will buy this movie when it comes to D V D and it will become a holiday tradition for my family!",,Anonymous,Animation
Technology comes together with a beautiful story to create a classic,"I sat in the dark not knowing what to expect, never having read the book and having read some pretty tepid reviews. What ensued was a visually-astounding journey of emotion that left me, at times, on the edge of my seat, other times tearful.The children in the audience did find some scenes a little scary but, as the characters all triumphed over the potential disasters, the children sighed a relief and moved on. I saw the film at a regular theatre and imagine the scenes of the train's drop or the eagle's flight would be astonishing in an IMAX version.For myself, at the movie's denouement, I was sorry it was over and tempted to buy another ticket and see it again. That, to me, is the earmark of a terrific film. This is the first holiday movie I have seen in ages that I have felt was destined to become a classic.",,Anonymous,Animation
great with reservation,"My biggest and most harsh criticism is with having Tom Hanks play so many parts. He is without a doubt talented, however he has an unmistakable voice and having the dad, the hobo and the child all with basically the same voice ... you see where I'm going don't you? Also grown ups, no matter who childlike THEY think they are, they are not children! The two main children, a little boy and a little girl. especially the little girl, their facial expressions are just NOT childlike. It may be easier to work with adults, it may save costs, etc., but sorry, there is no recapturing innocents. It was so apparent that all the children, with the exception of the last child on board, that the actors were adults trying to recapture their youth. I do wonder how this generation of children will accept the original book now that it has been altered... and come on, why such a stiff SANTA? Where was his happy loving face and warm disposition? You could have done better!",,Anonymous,Animation
These negative critic reviews are ridiculous!,"the titile says it all, this movie is outstanding. The one who said that the negative critics can no longer hear the ringing of the silver bell was absolutely correct. I hope that nobody listens to their stupid comments and gos to the film anyway. It is a good movie, and worth seeing. If you don't go to the film at the theaters, at least rent it on DVD. the movie is a great Christmas film, and will surely go down as a Christmas classic. Great music, great animation, and great action. I was even on the edge of my seat a few times. The mechanics of the train are very precise as well. This movie really had some extrordinary work done with it. I hope to see other films like this one at the big screens soon. Very good movie, loved it!A polar express fan",,Anonymous,Animation
Breathtaking,"I must say I was looking forward to this film since I heard of its existence. The night before my wife and I were scheduled to see it in the cinema I went through the Polar Express movie homepage and discovered the IMAX 3D version of the film. We(I) decided that we had to see it in the full glory of a 5 story screen and in the 3D. It being my first such movie I was astounded, the visuals are amazing, although that word alone does not do it justice. The best way to describe them is that toward the end of the film, I tried to brush away a snowflake falling on my leg, only to realize, AFTER I had done so, that it was not real. The locomotive and different railroad elements are spot on. Being trained as a volunteer steam locomotive fireman/engineer I know a lot of the equipment and how it should behave. I found not one error, and their inclusion of railroad slang was perfect for the situations/time they were in. The story is remarkable and I will not ruin any of it but I must say that I fought tears through several parts of the film. My only complaint is the ""Rockin' On Top of the World"" song by Stephen Tyler, it just doesn't fit the feel of the movie, however, the rest of the score is again superb. With this one fault there is still no way I can describe how fantastic this film is in the 3D and most likely out. If you are looking for that innocence and blind faith that you had when you were a child, go see this film, you might just find it.",,Anonymous,Animation
Is Tom Hanks ill?,"Mother and I have now seen the preview for this movie, and I just have to ask, IS EVERYONE BLIND?!!! TOM HANKS LOOKS AWFUL!!! Dead staring eyes? Skin like a tailor's dummy? Jerky uncoordinated movements? Are these signs of good health where he comes from? They certainly aren't down our way. Gone is the physical and energetic chameleon who won our hearts with Bonfire of the Vanities, where he played Sherman McCoy opposite that blonde woman whose breasts GREW BIGGER as the story progressed (it can happen btw). Now, though, he's but a shadow of his former self. Is this one of those big public secrets - like Michael Jackson or George Bush - that everyone knows about but no one mentions? HE IS OBVIOUSLY VERY, VERY ILL!!! We sensed something was wrong when we heard his attempts at speech in 'The Ladykillers' and thought things had gone from bad to worse when 'The Airport Lounge' came out. Mother said he was on the way out then('obvious irreparable brain damage' were her exact words) but he seemed fine afterwards in interviews - dribbled a bit, but he's at that age - so we thought he was on the mend. Thinking back, though, everyone was always very, very nice to him, as you are with someone who's been ill or is a bit simple, so I suppose that was a bit of a giveaway. So. America. LISTEN UP!!! I realize that he has a lot of friends in Hollywood, but I think the kindest thing to do surely, rather than to cast him in lead parts in multimillion dollar movies, would be to send him home and call the doctor. Surely none of us want to risk losing this brilliant leading actor when all that is needed is a kind word, some bed rest and possibly some sort of enema? I'm tired of watching this great man suffer just so some studio exec can set fire to yet another five dollar bill and shove it down some stripper's g-string. Have some compassion, PLEASE!!!",,Anonymous,Animation
a little like the Wizard of Oz,"Going to see The Polar Express might be a nice way to escape any holiday blues you could be suffering from. If you don't go to movies much, you will be amazed at how far computer animation has progressed. During a good portion of the movie, I sat mesmerized by all the life like snow, animals, machinery and, of course, characters, all of whom, except Santa himself, appeared as one would expect for a movie of this genre. Otherwise, expect a rather weak story with predictable dialogue and a pretty heavy dose of morality thrown in just in case you were contemplating being a bad boy or girl this season.A trip to the north pole, heh? Substitute ""Oz"" for ""the North Pole"" , and ""The Wizard"" for ""Santa"" and what have you got? No, on second thoughts, don't even try to compare this movie to the Wizard of Oz, which was far more entertaining in every respect - story line, character development, music and last but not least -drama/suspense. (Yes, anyone who has reservations about taking their 4 year old to see ""The Polar Express"" should remember how scary the Wizard of Oz was.). Anyway, I was amused when the train got to the North Pole to hear music that sounded suspiciously like the music that plays when Dorothy first arrives in Oz. Look closely and you will find many other parallels, especially towards the end of the movie. But despite the breakneck animation and train misadventures through snow and ice, Dorothy's journey down the yellow brick road was far more harrowing. All of this was made possibly by Dorothy's misdeed - killing the Wicked Witch of the East, which hung a death sentence around her neck.No death sentence hung around the neck of our hero in ""The Polar Express"", though, who's only crime was not believing. And he was just one of many - who knows why the other kids were on board. I guess to me thats were the story line kind of faltered, in that it gave insufficient cause for these kids to be getting bused to the North Pole in the first place. Without that, all of the misadventures and morality lessons they encountered along the way seemed a bit contrived.Which is not to say I didn't enjoy the movie. I did, but my expectations have been lowered substantially over the years. What I regret most of all in movies these days is the way that gimmicks and high tech action have replaced real suspense and drama that develops naturally from the story line itself. I was happy not to see sea monsters snapping at the train in ""The Polar Express"", so I should give the director some credit for showing restraint there. Still, the movie in my opinion needed a convincing story outside of the dream - one to lend urgency to the train ride and likewise make the return home more meaningful. With that, I would have given it two thumbs up.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Simply Magnificent Experience,"Aside from occasionally choking on moments of excessive sentimentality, I found this movie a glorious, enrapturing, imaginative, goose-bump-provoking experience. Simply the ride on the splendid train, with the astonishingly-faithful rendition of the glories of a large steam locomotive, and a brightly-lit passenger train flying through the night, would have been worth the time and the ticket price. But then there was Tom Hanks the slightly prudish but paternal conductor, Tom Hanks the world's most classic King of the Road, able to feast upon the freedom provided by computer animation; Tom Hanks the Santa Claus with dignity palpable without even seeing his face. Moments of the acme of zaniness, imaginativeness and humor, such as the crazy scene on the lake, or the nutty exchange that clears the caribou. The reindeer, and the departure of the sleigh from the North Pole, was more dramatic than anything I had ever imagined during my days of believing in Santa Claus. Let those who sniff at the plot or the roller-coaster rides go get lives - and then come back and enjoy this richly delightful holiday film.",,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely Worth the Wait,"When I was a child, my parents would read The Polar Express for my brother and I (and later my sister) on Christmas Eve. It was a magical story, and it'll stick with me for years.So in 1999, when I read about a CGI Polar Express movie,I was psyched and couldn't wait for it. For 6 years I'd waited for signs of it coming, feasting on all the rumors and information that came out about it.Today, thanks to my school, I went to see and advanced screening of the film with my family.. It was worth the wait.The film retained the magic of the book while still adding enough original elements to make it a feature film. I give this movie 5 stars, 2 thumbs up, 10/10, whatever rating system you use.If you're a fan of the book, or a Christmas lover, then I highly recommend this film. If your looking for a good family film, I still recommend it.In fact, I'm waiting for the release date so I can see it again. *****",,Anonymous,Animation
The greatest movie of any holiday season,"Instead of giving a retread of the story, I will give the impression left by this remarkable achievement. This movie and the animation has a haunting, magical wondrous quality, the stuff of dreams. Even the music is memorably haunting. At least two of the original compositions, the Josh Groban-sung tune and ""When Christmas Comes to Town"" are as good if not better than any of those overplayed Christmas classics you hear on the radio during the Xmas season. Yes, sections of the film are on the dark side and, based on some of the other reviews, has scared a few young viewers. But this ""dark aspect"" is true of all family classics, such as The Wizard of Oz, the Disney animated films, i.e. Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, Pinocchio, etc.Like life itself, classic literature and film chooses not to be all fluff and happiness. And like life itself, the darkness is necessary to ultimately support the overriding positive themes. The Polar Express' powerful, overwhelming sense of wonder forces adults to recognize what they have sorrily missed since childhood. Children will be left awe-struck, their imagination left stretched to unlimited bounds. The message of the film: the importance of retaining throughout our lives the hope, belief and optimism once sensed at childhood -- even after it all has worn away upon having moved into cynical adulthood --hauntingly lingers long after leaving the theater. These kinds of powerful impressions can only be accomplished by the greatest of movies. To add to the magic, see, as I did, the IMAX version.",,Anonymous,Animation
WANT TO BE DAZZLED?,"For those whose communities are fortunate enough to have an IMAX/3-D IMAX theater in their community, there's a holiday super-treat that should not be missed by you, your family and your friends. I'm referring to the 3-D IMAX version of THE POLAR EXPRESS that is showing right now in many of the IMAX theaters across the country.The stunning technical achievement of the 3-D IMAX version of THE POLAR EXPRESS is beyond anything that you could even imagine for a computer-animated film ... you will definitely be blown away! ... particularly if you are also into technical DETAILS. You literally will not believe the stunning beauty of the audio-visual treats that await you in this 3-D IMAX version of the film. Words are totally inadequate to describe the visual intimacy of a 3-D IMAX production of a computer-animated story such as this.It is recommended that you arrive early in order to obtain seats as high in the center of the IMAX theater as possible since the film's 3-D projection places the center of the image directly in front of those seats; i.e., looking straight-ahead instead of up. If possible, it is recommended that you experience this film during the week when the crowds of are smaller. Purchasing tickets in advance is also highly recommended where possible.This film of the popular children's illustrated book, and particularly this 3-D IMAX version, are visions of filmmaker Robert Zemeckis. He must be a genius of a most special sort because it is hard to believe that a single human-being could guide the production of such a mind-bogglingly complex and delightful enterprise. Every aspect of the 3-D IMAX version of THE POLAR EXPRESS is infused with consistent and breathtaking QUALITY.",,Anonymous,Animation
Taken By Surprise,"Let me begin by saying I'm an 18 year old college freshman to whom the magic of Christmas has long since vanished. The same old Christmas movies were watched every year in front of a glowing fireplace, presents no longer from ""Santa"" were opened, and toys were replaced by practical gifts, like clothes and electronics. I had completely forgotten the story of The Polar Express...until some of my friends decided to invite me along to see it. Right from the start, I was drawn into the old children's classic. The CGI is incredible, bringing the characters to life from the moment the snow flurry clears from around the Christmas train and Tom Hank's legendary voice yells out ""All aboard!"" Throughout the movie, my friends and I were gasping, wincing, and laughing, and a few of us left in tears. The Polar Express is nothing short of beautiful and touching, a perfect movie for everyone. It's definitely one to be added to the list of movies in front of the roaring fire.",,Anonymous,Animation

I knew of ""The Polar Express"" story from my childhood. I honestly couldn't remember the plot. I do however remember the great illustrations from the book. So when I heard my nieces were going to see this, I said I would be happy to attend. The expectation wasn't too high because the word around was the reviews were poor. Once the movie began, even before the story started to unfold, I was already completely drawn in. The animation was absolutely beautiful and so much great detail; I didn't care if the movie wasn't going to be great. On top of that the 3D just added an element that an average movie wouldn't have and I loved it. They should make more movies in 3D. After all that talk the movie's story turned out just fine. I liked the story allot and I would recommend this movie to anyone. I don't know if this movie is strictly shown in 3D, but if it is not I would absolutely recommend that's how you see it.Enjoy.",,Anonymous,Animation
A letter to those without imagination,"The word is out: Tom Hanks and Robert Zemeckis' historic third collaboration, The Polar Express, is making a mark in terms of the incredible computer-generated technology called ""performance capture,"" allowing star/co-executive producer Hanks to take on not just one, but an unprecedented six roles: The Boy, His Father, The Conductor, The Hobo, Scrooge and Santa. The technicians of Sony Pictures Imageworks allow you to experience the story the way Chris van Allsburg's original illustrations permitted you to. ""Derails in zombie land,"" scoffs Newsday's film critic. ""A failure as much of imagination as of technology,"" grumbles the New York Times' critic. People, ignore the mixed reviews. The money and the imagination are up there on that screen --- and more, they're there for one reason: for the first time, you're not just a part of the CGI experience, the experience literally happens to you!There are several reasons why the popularity of the original book simply had to result in the making of the film, some of those reasons having real life on their side: since the book was first published nearly 20 years ago, several real-life performers have literally staged their own adaptations of The Polar Express, using some of van Allsburg's characters as key elements. The real test, I think, will be in comparing the staged versions, of which, I think, there were some 60 across the country and counting, with the film.The story follows a young boy who is gradually losing his faith in Santa --- until a mysterious train appears at his front door, its mission being to take him and various other children with similar doubts to the North Pole, where, in celebration of his first Christmas flight of the year, Santa will present the first gift of the season to one person. Who will that person be? And can that person prove himself brave, truthful and unselfish enough to go the distance and make it to the end of the journey in one piece? That is the mystery surrounding this remarkable film, and I would be surprised if the incredible technology combined with the spellbinding story did not earn this movie the Best Animated Feature Oscar, as well as the Oscar for Visual Effects.The film is dedicated, by the way, to the memory of co-star Michael Jeter, who died shortly after completing his scenes in this film. His contributions will obviously be a lasting legacy.In conclusion, then, the magic of this awesome adventure is right up there with all the live-action Christmas classic features of the last 30 years. Jack Matthews of the New York Daily News is right: ""If you take one train this holiday season, this is the one."" To which I, being a train lover in one or more senses, must add:""Get me on this train!""",,Anonymous,Animation
Christmas,"A boy doesn't believe in the existence of Santa Clause. He believed in it in the past, but he looked a scene that his father wearing costume of Santa Clause put his Christmas present.

Movie magic in the snow.,"With the Polar Express Robert Zemeckis has managed to transport me to a land of wonder. The Polar Express is cinematic magic - a delightful tale guaranteed to enthrall viewers of all ages. Does that sound like advertising hype, or the words of a publicist? Perhaps, but it's a reflection of how strongly this film pulled me under its spell. For children, this is a glorious adventure, full of excitement, splendor, and plenty of holiday good cheer. For adults, there are deeper meanings to be found, not to mention the bittersweet nostalgia of gazing back through the years to the point where innocence gave way to the curse of maturity. As I watched The Polar Express, I was immersed in the experience. On one level, I was a thirty-something critic taking notes, but part of me was a seven-year old boy having trouble getting to sleep on Christmas Eve. That's one of The Polar Express' great strengths: for many viewers, it will seem like the movie is plundering their memories. Who knew how universal some things are?",,Anonymous,Animation

""sometimes it those things that you don't see are real"", or something like ""believe"", and many many more... it just seems so evangelistic... maybe think too much... really hope if there is someone out there to confirm with me if you feel that way too... really wish to see more comments... It just seems to tell me about faith, as we believe, only then we will hear his voice and will only be no long spiritually blinded...",,Anonymous,Animation
one of the best holiday movies made,"Get ready for the Holiday season. I've seen this week's movie twice now and it hasn't even come out in theaters. The second Christmas movie to come out this year, after the poorly marketed Ben Affleck movie 'Surviving Christmas,' that came out in October, is the third collaboration between Director Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks; Polar Express. Polar Express is the new animated movie inspired by the book of the same name written by popular children's author, Chris Van Allsburg, the man who also brought us Jumanji.Polar Express tells the story of a young boy who's struggling in his belief of the big man upstairs. By upstairs, of course, I mean up north, and by the big man, I mean, of course, Santa Clause. On Christmas Eve, this young boy lays awake in his bed, pondering the question of his existence hoping to hear the jingle of his sleigh. He soon hears a noise, not of sleigh bells, but of a train whistle; the Polar Express. After meeting the train's conductor, played by Tom Hanks, the boy goes on an adventure of a lifetime to meet Santa along with several other great characters.Polar Express is a superb, innovated animated film. They use the technology used for sports video games, attaching sensors to the actors' body to capture their facial features and body movements, making the animated characters look like the actual actor. Now, I, personally, have been getting sick of this computer animated movie fad. However, this movie is completely different from any other animated film. The feel of the entire film is as though it's live action. The animation in this film perfectly captures the soul behind the story and illustrations of author Chris Van Allsburg.It's safe to say that the acting in this movie is very well done. I know, its weird to say that regarding an animated film, but it actually is acting.Tom Hanks does a fantastic job lending his voice to, and becoming the character of not just one, but five different characters. I won't ruin the surprise as to the different characters that he plays, because I found it fun trying to figure out which characters are, in fact, Tom Hanks. However, his acting for each character is unique and rather flawless. Look out, also for a cameo by an animated Steven Tyler, lead singer of Aerosmith, as he puts on his daughter's shoes and becomes and elf. The children characters are beautifully created and, while watching, you're really able to remember what it was like to be a child having these grand feeling for the holiday season.Robert Zemeckis, director of other Tom Hanks films, Forrest Gump and Cast Away, does a fantastic job at turning the popular children's book into a fun, inspiring movie. It is beautiful to see his vision come to life in this movie. The film is animated with gorgeous scenery and awe-inspiring shots. The cinematography is some of the best I've seen in recent films. It is simply beautiful. Zemeckis is able to capture the spirit of the holiday with wonderful vigor. He takes us into the mind and heart of the child and recaptures what if felt like to be a child and have such wonderful excitement about Christmas.Polar Express is an adventure ride that not only keeps the heart in suspense, but warms it as well. At its heart, Polar Express is a film about believing, as the conductor says, 'Sometimes the most real things in this world are the things we can't see.' This film is beautiful as it warms the heart and inspires us to return to our childhood attitude toward the upcoming season. It truly is a beautiful film, and is one of the best Christmas movies ever made. And, it certainly gets my nod for best animated feature of the year come Oscar season. I can only wonder if Tom and his wife, Rita, are going to argue about who has the better Holiday movie; her Jingle All the Way or his Polar Express. While I love Rita Wilson and the Governator's Jingle All the Way, my vote goes to you, Tom. Please, I beg of you, see Polar Express. It will certainly inspire all who watch it whether you are the youngest of children or oldest of adults. Coming to theaters and to special 3-D Imax theaters this Wednesday, Polar Express gets all 5 bright Christmas stars and three Christmas season 'Ho Ho Ho's!'",,Anonymous,Animation
a great movie,"I saw this film recently and was very impressed with the animation, the story is very well done and plays perfectly for style this animation. It is also being released at IMAX theaters and visually it will probably be even more exciting.It comes across very dimensionable,no quite 3-d but close.But I'm sure that IMAX will be even better or at least closer to 3-d.Tom Hanks seems to still be Hollywoods golden boy and this film is just another hit in his hat.The only draw back is that it is opening 5days after ""The Incredibles"" and that film is going to very big and pixars name is the new Disney.So unless your scrooge you'll enjoy it(but then again scrooge might get a laugh or two).",,Anonymous,Animation
Computer Animation...Enough already,Am I the ONLY person who is fed up with computer animation? From Toon Disney to Nick Jr. Now a beloved American classic. It's getting so my kids wont even know what a good cartoon looks like. Toy Story was OK but the joke's not funny anymore. $70 million I was told this movie cost. Sorry but I can't see where... The characters all look like Pinocchico Perhaps when they grow up they want to be real toons? After this scary looking movie I'm not taking the kids to see any more computer animated rubbish. It may be a small stand being just one family but its a start. From cheap ill-fitting clothes to sub-standard electronics America has to stop this decay in the quality for services and goods we are offered and that goes for this computer animated rubbish as well.,,Anonymous,Animation
Oh no!!! another terribly mainstream movie!!!!!,"Why do the studios invest a lot of money in such awful movies?, do they are broke?, I think the producers of this movie thinks that the people are simply massess that can be controled, I guess the Frankfurtian's were right in some way, people who like to watch this movies can be manipulated in many ways, people who see this movies are dumb; I can't blame the children that are going to see this movie but please parents they are better movie's for children this days than this commercial ""wannabe movie"", think something parents: ""your children are not dumb the see everything and help them to develop good taste in movies.I don't understand why Tom Hanks sold his integrity to make this movie, he's such a great actor, I guess everybody needs to pay their bills, but please how can this talented actor make this awful thing?, and by the way the are better movies this season like The Incredibles from Pixar/Disney, SpongeBob, Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason, Alexander, Ray and many others.Talking a little more, I don't know why the production companies invested more than 200.000.000 to make this animated film?, what they were thinking?, the computer graphics are horribly, the storyline is a big cliché, we already heard the slogan of this movie before in another films ""Belive in miracles"", we can sense the great originality of this movie because it uses previous Hollywood formula to make bad commercial films, please producers, writers, directors of upcoming movies do something more original than this ""masterpiece"".D.B.K.",,Anonymous,Animation
Enchanting (i.e. don't let it fly UNDER your head...),"I have read the comments of some who claim that this movie contains no story or that the script is weak, etc. I can only say that there are a few things you need to consider: 1) the plot of the movie comes from a children's book (not War & Peace people) and therefore the creators had to add a good amount of ""filler"" for lack of a better term. The title is almost self-explanatory. It's a children's movie. For some of you, no one, expect maybe your own sense of intelligence or ego, is going to be bruised. 2) don't let the plot fly UNDER your head. This isn't a high-brow Henry V and it doesn't contain as many plot twists as The Lion in Winter. If you are looking for a deep plot, this isn't the film for you.3) the plot relates to both children and adults who can still remember the excitement of Christmas Day, however faintly. If your children can't think (I don't mean that negatively) maturely enough, then they might miss the entire, but not all, of the experience of the movie. If you or your children are only entertained by explosions, then you or your children might be bored with the film. Perhaps you or your children will get it when ""you get older."" 4) the film isn't a comedy. See The Incredibles if you are looking for that.Summary: I think this film will begin to do better in the box office once children are done seeing The Incredibles. This film may even become a holiday classic. I won't comment on the animation since that's been done. The film asks you to have faith. In the United States, you don't have to have faith in God, government, your neighbors, or anything for that matter. But why not at least have faith in yourself?P.S.= This review refers to the 2-D theatrical version.",,Anonymous,Animation
A must-see 3-D,"Hopped aboard the Polar Express last night at a media preview at the IMAX in Chicago's Navy Pier. I can't honestly remember the last 3-D movie I went to, but the effect in this marvelous film is nothing short of jaw dropping. With my Harry Caray-sized specs on, it took a few minutes to adjust to the dazzling 3-D presentation, but once immersed, the amazing imagery never failed to deliver.Obvious highlights are the lost ticket sequence, the runaway train in the ice field, and the hobo skiing sequence. I had a visceral reaction during these intense scenes, but there are many other subtle moments where the depth of realism will draw the viewer into the action. Watch as snowflakes waft within reach, ticket snips shower seemingly within inches of your eyes, or try not to reach out and grab onto a caribou antler as they argue with a red-bearded engineer in their native language.I've read a few mediocre ""professional"" reviews of this film's treatment of the original story, including one which found the children's faces disturbing. I found the screenplay to be a wonderful upgrade to the book, but I confess that the technical visual achievement(and audio, for that matter) overwhelmed my appreciation of the plot.I'm certain the standard 35mm print will look terrific, but to see it 7 stories high in breathtaking 3-D is unlike anything I have ever seen in a theater. Drive the few extra miles if you have to, but find this on the BIG screen and put on the goofy glasses. You'll never forget the experience.",,Anonymous,Animation
Fun for the whole family!,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, but then I love a good fantasy. It was great ""seeing"" Tom Hanks back to what he does best, movies for the young and young at heart with an upbeat message. We need much more of that in this era of reality TV, extreme violence, filthy profanity, and anything that will shock viewers. Thankfully, around the holidays we can expect Hollywood to put on its ""Sunday best"" and come up with clean, family movies, love stories, movies to uplift and not incite, movies to give the viewer hope and not disgust them. My only negative comment is that some of the music, although I loved it, sounded extremely similar to the music from Edward Scissorhands. At any rate, keep up the good work Tom Hanks!",,Anonymous,Animation
Polar Express,"One interesting subject which is brought to mind after having seen this film is the subject of child pornography. With the ability to present such lifelike images, would or should child pornography produced in the same manner be illegal.It has been a subject of courtroom drama and real-life court cases and will become more significant in the future.This is an important social and legal issue which will haunt all of us for years to come.Many irrational arguments have been presented on this subject in the past. All of us need to keep our wits about us as we debate this subject.",,Anonymous,Animation
This movie was awesome!!,"As a kid I used to have this book read to me all the time during the Christmas Holiday. This book, along with all of my brothers and parents (5 brothers including me and my mom and dad), is considered to be one of our favorites. For my mom's birthday this year we surprised her by taking her to go see this movie and after reading several reviews about this movie about how it wasn't so good, I was sort of worried. After the movie I thought this movie was outstanding!! I loved everything about this movie and I think people have been too hard on this movie. People have too high of standards for movies now a days and they don't actually appreciate the movie for what it really is. But in the end, i highly recommend seeing this movie, I know i'm going to see it again!",,Anonymous,Animation
A definite two thumbs up,"As a firm believer in movies being able to ruin a perfectly good book, I worried about what might happen to my love of Polar Express after seeing the film. I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the film recreate the feeling and overall emotion of the children's story, it captured the entire aura of Christmas and created an almost completely believable world. I absolutely loved it. I recommend that everyone go see Polar Express this holiday season. I don't think you'll be disappointed. The imagery gave me chills and the characters completely drew me in. The music was both classic and inspiring and I think 3D animation is the only way in which the magic of the tale could possibly be portrayed. Take the family and get into the spirit of Christmas early this year.",,Anonymous,Animation
A Storybook Comes Alive,"What a wonderful film! Having seen this in all it's IMAX 3-D glory, it is hard to imagine how this film would play out in plain ol'2-D. I assume that most everybody know the story: kid is just at that age where he's pretty sure Santa is an elaborate deception, yet his little sister and presumably some of his friends haven't yet stopped believing. Kid spends Christmas Eve on a magical train and encounters all sorts of characters and experiences which ultimately reaffirm the power of friendship, innocence, and faith.Now you've seen these themes explored before: Miracle on 34th St, A Christmas Carol, even E.T. However, The Polar Express manages to approach its subject with so much energy, freshness, and wide-eye fascination, that you will find yourself wishing you were eight years old again, climbing aboard that powerful locomotive along with Hero Boy, if only for a couple of hours.A word or two about the animation. It is truly amazing, creating an almost dream-like quality that, will have you examining every aspect of a scene: the reflections on the windows in the passenger cars, the steamy breath of a young boy waiting in the snow, the brown bubbling of a mug of hot chocolate, etc. This effect is unlike anything that I've seen, and in it's own way rivals the painstaking composition and attention to visual detail you'll find in a Franco Zeffirelli production (or in a more whimsical fashion, Fellini!)This film is not doing well commercially. Partly it is due to production costs, partly because of poor marketing decisions. Perhaps it is also because the film lacks the ambiguity, relativism, and ""edginess"" that seem so prevalent in popular entertainment. In the IMAX theatre that this film was playing, the performances have been consistently sold out. The audience consisted of parents and their young (five to eleven-ish) children, teenagers, and aging baby boomers, like yours truly. I was expecting the worst experience: crying toddlers, wisecracking teens, and bored, restless adults. I was shocked at what I experienced. Although the crowd was a bit skeptical at first, within 20minutes the audience became completely captivated by the film and I swear there were tears on not a few cheeks by the time the credits were rolling.So do yourself and somebody you love a favor and take them to see The Polar Express (IMAX 3-D!!!). You will believe again.",,Anonymous,Animation
"It's a Norman Rockwell painting Come to life, But will kids like it?","""Polar Express"" is beautifully made, extremely well done, and for adults a real engaging film, but for children, I think they'll be un-enthralled with this.Based on the book, which is only 30 short pages, Robert Zemekis seems to make this little book come to like as if you're watching a Norman Rockwell painting come to life. It's all shot like it was drawn in the 30's. The look of the movie is terrific. But that being said, I believe kids will be put off with the zombie like eyes and character generation imagery. The characters might look creepy to young children and because of the retro look it may turn them off. My 6 year old saw it and seemed to like it OK, but my 3 1/2 year old was scared by it.The story is very charming and timeless. I liked the animation and I got caught up in it. Will the film be considered a classic? Only time will tell, but my first instinct is no. Is it the disaster the critics are making it out to be? Not in the least. It's not making any money, but that doesn't mean it's a bad film. I hope people warm up it. (***)",,Anonymous,Animation
Destined to be called 'Classic',"This one goes right up there with FROSTY the SNOWMAN and RUDOLPH the RED NOSED REINDEER.I had heard a great deal about the movie before I saw it, so I had some high expectations; when I finally got to see it, I was blown away.Years from now, children will beg their parents to watch it ONE MORE TIME, and if the studios have any common sense, they will re-release it during upcoming holiday seasons.I can only hope that Chris Van Allsburgh is hard at work on another story, in a similar vein, with the same creativity that he brought to this one.",,Anonymous,Animation
