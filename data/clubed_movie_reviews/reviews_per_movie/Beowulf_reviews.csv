"A compelling dramatization of a thesis paper, not a poem","In the original epic poem, why does Beowulf come back from defeating Grendel's mother carrying Grendel's head? It's an interesting question that has fired literary critics imaginations for a while, and when Robert Zemeckis set out to make his big screen adaptation of the poem, he went beyond merely adapting the text itself. Instead, he took those questions that critics had considered and ran with them dramatically.So, what we end up having isn't so much an adaptation of Beowulf, but an adaptation of a master's thesis on Beowulf.The movie received mixed to positive reviews when it came out. A lot of the negativity seemed connected to the movie's visual style. Expanding what he had done on The Polar Express, Zemeckis used motion capture and computer animation to get realistic-ish looking characters. The problem is that the characters exact right in the middle of the Uncanny Valley. They are too real to treat as cartoons, but not real enough to convince the mind that they are real, so there's a natural barrier that's created because the brain knows it's not real despite a somewhat realistic looking appearance. I was more okay with the look of the film upon its initial release, but less so now.I understand, though, why Zemeckis was enamored with the technique. The freedom as a filmmaker to build the environments he wanted and place the camera wherever he wanted must have been quite enticing. The problem was the effort at getting photo-realistic effects, which end up falling short. A more cartoonish look might have been less jarring for the audience.Moving on, though, the movie's approach to the material, as implied, is really smart. It's not just a monster movie, but an exploration of bravery, heroism, and the costs of power. It takes a different approach than the original poem, but that's fine by me. The seduction of power, and the literal seduction of Grendel's mother, is an interesting approach to take, and I think it works really well. Beowulf must sell his soul to achieve power, but when the bill comes due he doesn't lay down like Hrothgar did. He fights. He reclaims his honor and sense of bravery by having a spectacle infused fight with a dragon. It's a sop to modern movie convention, but it's still fun on its own while refusing to undermine the basic point of the story.Performances, which you mainly need to judge by voices since the faces do have a plastic-like feel that they movie can't escape, are very good. I can see why Zemeckis wanted to cast Ray Winstone as Beowulf because he carries a gravelly voice that matches the vision of the character perfectly, but Winstone is, at the same time, not a body builder with 8 pack abs. Brendan Gleeson is wonderful as Wiglaf, the sad advisor, Anthony Hopkins is wise, sad, and guilt-ridden as Hrothgar, and Angelina Jolie is pure seduction as Grendel's mother. Special nod to Crispin Glover as Grendel, speaking Old English and evoking quite a bit of emotion as a monstrous creature with inside out ears.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"To CGI or Not to CGI, that is the question?","I have read Beowulf a couple of times. It's great northern European mythology, and mandatory reading when you are young in my opinion (Along with Norse, Greek and Roman Mythology as well). And though the movie wants to re-write some of the epic, you will need to separate the Hollywood version from the beautiful measure of the original works. Being a work of CGI, you will also have to allow for the flaws of pure CGI work. Very stylized and beautifully colored, it is an epic adventure that elevated Zemeckis' previous work ""The Polar Express"" to a new level. Polar was beautifully modeled after Chris Van Allsburg illustrations for his book, but Zemeckis' adaptation to the story went a little over the top when it became a musical. Even though most of Beowulf's story line is answered here, it did make me pause and wonder:Why didn't Robert Zemeckis just direct this thing in real life instead of virtual?With the capabilities of dropping in CGI into real life action, this telling of the story could have had so much more of an impact if the expressions were more poignant. Look what he did with ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit?""? Zemeckis is fully capable of it. Also, to add to this, when you have CGI characters like Jacksons Gollum and King Kong to compare notes with, the modeling here just isn't up to snuff. I felt the entire movie came off like a gigantic ""cut-scene"" to a video game than a full featured animated project. I can only give this a little better than a good, hence the exclamation. I do this sadly. You really should see this in a theater, bigger than life. The dragon is excellent, the ugly v/s the beautiful is wild, the sequencing is uneven, though at the end it takes you on a great ride. Oh, and for you people that want to go see Angela Jolie nekkid? IT'S CGI!!! I've seen harder stuff on Fox networks! Seeing my wife and I saw this as a matin√©e, the crowd was on the sparse side and there was literally no kids present. I couldn't get a solid feeling from the audience though most people as they left seemed genuinely happy with their experience. I'm sure it was PG13'd because of the sequences with Angela, otherwise it would be a solid PG. I wouldn't suggest this for a kid under 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Nice Hero story in CGI fashion,"Normally I loathe CGI, but here, it's necessary. And it works - well.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
As I understand it, the story was originally just a poem, but it was filled out nicely.Warrior stories are endless, but this has a plot twist I've not seen or read before, and it's pivotal for the story.I could have done without Jolie and the copious amount of lust, but men like their stories of war and women. Oy ...ACTING:
This includes the ""acting"" of Anthony Hopkins, a brilliant British actor who I've followed since his earlier years.Otherwise I thought the characters were decent, though their development is not the emphasis.ENTERTAINMENT:
Moderate to high value, but as always, it depends on your tastesTEMPO:
Quite good, though it must have crazed blood and carnage to satiate the lusts of menCINEMATOGRAPHY:
For a CGI film I was very impressed. What's intriguing is how difficult it is to ""draw"" the human mouth while speaking.There are so many muscles in the face, jaw, and tongue so those subtleties are lost, but an excellent attempt.MUSIC / SOUND:
A beautiful song ""Hero comes home"" but otherwise far too much ""epic"" musicDIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: Zemeckis has a very impressive resume, and this reinforces his ability to handle a wide variety of genre.I've seen many of his films, and nearly all have left strong impressions.Writers: While I thought this story was reasonably well done, the combined works of the two screenplay writers
is flat or filled with TV waste.Is it a good film? YesShould you watch this once? YesRating: 7.5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Decent movie,"It takes a while for your eyes to get used to the uncanny animation, but once you overcome the ordeal, Beowulf turns into an outrageously entertaining ride. The performances are solid, the visuals are unique, the score is uplifting, and it has great action sequences. It's really good fun for adults of all ages.",,Anonymous,Animation
I AM (slightly let down by) BEOWULF!!!,"It seems we have a new cinematic fad coming into fashion... the genre of mythological action. It began with '300' (a film I really enjoyed), and the first that stands to benefit from 300's success is Beowulf. Beowulf is the newest film from Robert Zemeckis. Zemeckis implements many of the same visual themes of his last project, the heart warming Polar Express, with varied success.Beowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar (a delightfully campy Anthony Hopkins)which is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover). Help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf (Ray Winstone), who arrives with an army of 14 men and his right hand man, Wiglaf (Brendan Gleeson). It his his job to slay the monster. However, he must also deal with Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie). Beowulf is opposed by Unferth (John Malkovich), and has also been paying close attention to the king's wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).Perhaps the most surprising element of the film is its sly, wink and a nod, sense of humor. This can be viewed two ways. The first view is one of enjoyment and laughter. However, it is hard to comply when we are asked to feel or identify with these characters after so many scenes presenting them as mere caricatures.As expected, Beowulf is visually stunning. I'd argue it is the one category where this film bests 'Polar Express'. The 3-D photography is shockingly good. It is a film I wouldn't want to imagine in the traditional two dimension format. I strongly advise anyone who is going to see this to view the film in 3-D. Without it, the film would be borderline un enjoyable. The highlight is by far the final battle scene,which just begs you to forget the film's past misdeeds. Close, but no dice.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beowulf the film, not the poem","Beowulf is not the old school poem. It's a story retold like mythical tales that have different revisions. A wolf becomes a bear, a bear becomes a troll, a troll becomes a dragon, etc. It's like another take on an old story, and told from the lips of a different story teller; this is all completely fine. The story is about Beowulf's quest to kill the creature Grendel and his story after that event.It doesn't sound particularly interesting but when you add in the fact that Beowulf can kill monsters with nothing but his pinky and thumb it starts sounding a lot better. If you are a big fan of medieval swords and shields tales you're going to love Beowulf. If you are big fan of blood, violence, and sexual themes, you're going to love Beowulf. The special effects and sound of Beowulf are top notch and the best technology has to offer these days.Every breaking bone, every ripple in every face, and every flexing muscle look as good as CGI probably ever will at this time. Sound effects, from the clang of swords, arrows firing, water, wind, the ocean, every thing sounds great and is a treat to hear. I saw the Unrated version so I can't speak for the PG-13 one but Beowulf is a very sexually charged movie, I will tell you that. It is not for children and when I say children I mean any one under 16 years of age.This movie should have been R rated from what I've seen. I can't imagine they took much out of the movie because the director's cut is only a fraction longer than the theatrical version. Now with the negative parts of this movie. The movie can be very paced to the point of silence. Some parts feel long and drawn out, I never got this feeling but I can see how some may not like this. I myself was too focused on soaking up all the lovely high-techery CGI.The point is don't go into this movie expecting THE Beowulf and you'll be all right. If you think that the retelling of a story should be 100% accurate with the poem it's based on, don't even rent this. You will not be happy. If you are looking for a great epic, and an all around entertaining film, watch this. It suffers from crappy ending syndrome but is well worth the price of admission, that is if you watch it for what it is; Beowulf the film, not the poem.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a bit underrated and is definitely a must see,"Beowulf (2007) is in my DVD collection and is also available on Netflix. The storyline is about Beowulf who arrives in a town plagued by a curse where a deity and her son ravage the land. When Beowulf fights the son and confronts the deity tough choices will be made that will determine his future and direction. This movie is directed by Robert Zemeckis (Forrest Gump) and contains the voices of Anthony Hopkins (Silence of the Lambs), Angelina Jolie (Tomb Raider), Ray Winstone (The Departed), Crispin Glover (Willard), Robin Wright (The Princess Bride) and John Malkovich (In the Line of Fire). The storyline for this is very good and contains some fantastic twists and turns. The animation is out of this world and looks very much like the actors used for the voices. The cast is very well selected and fit the characters and storyline to perfection. The action scenes are absolutely amazing, especially the depiction of the creatures and sorcery. The kill scenes and gore is also remarkable. The full circle of the storyline is excellent as is the absolute final scene. This is a bit underrated and is definitely a must see that I would score a 8.5/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Father's Sin,"In Denmark, A.D. 507, the realm of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is threatened by the tormented demon Grendel (Crispin Glover) that attacks the locals in their celebrations. The Danish king offers a reward for the death of the creature, attracting to Herot the brave Geet warrior Beowulf (Ray Winstone) that seeks for glory. After a fierce battle, Beowulf defeats the demon and after receiving an old relic as reward, he finds his men slaughtered in the party saloon of the castle. King Hrothgar advises that the Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie) was the responsible for the bloodshed and Beowulf chases her in the lake where she lives. The creature takes the form of a seductive woman and seduces Beowulf with a promise of becoming an invincible and wealthy king if he makes love to her and gives his golden relic to her. Years later, King Beowulf feels the aftermath of his sin.""Beowulf"" is a dark tale in an age in the beginning of the Christianity and a unique experience with the entire movie made of computer-generated image (CGI). There is no live action, but the stylization of the characters and images is amazing. In accordance with the director Robert Zemeckis, this resource allowed to make this movie with lower costs, using unusual movements of camera. There are silly moments, like for example Beowulf fighting completely naked against Grendel, or the ambiguous character of Unferth, but in the end this movie is entertaining. I only imagine how frustrating might be for actors and actresses performing in blue screen without interaction or set. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Lenda de Beowulf"" (""The Legend of Beowulf"")",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Better than I expected,"I didn't expect a lot from 'Beowulf', for lots of reasons, most of which were to do with the casting: incorrigibly cockney Ray Winstone as a warrior from what's now southern Sweden; wacky John Malkovich as a cynical counselor; loony Crispin Glover as a flesh-rending monster, and weirdest of all, Angelina Jolie as the monster's mother...thaet waes wundorlic castyng, as the poet might have put it. Then there was the way they did the whole thing in CGI, running the risk of making it all look a bit rubbery. Finally, Robert Zemeckis is the director and my great respect for him plummeted through the floor and into the crawlspace after he presided over the insufferable 'Forrest Gump'.Nevertheless, this is a lot better than I thought it would be. I missed the 3D incarnation as we were watching the DVD rather than the cinema release, but after a while you stop looking at the CGI and start enjoying it. This is a 'Beowulf' where the story, although different from the poem, is actually very far from shabby.Without giving too much away, the main difference from the poem is that in the poem, there is no connection between the monster Grendel and his mother on one hand, and the dragon in the latter half of the poem on the other hand. In the film, a connection exists. Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary do a professional job of tying it all together in a satisfying Hollywood way, without betraying the basic darkness and sadness of the story; it's not like Beowulf rides off into the sunset with Wiglaf at the end. Crispin Glover is genuinely scary as the tormented and raw-boned Grendel, whose main problem is that he just can't stand the sound of people having fun, although since most of this fun consists of hairy men singing lewd songs you can see his point. Angelina Jolie's animated self spends all her on screen time walking around without any clothes on, something that apparently gave Jolie a blush when she saw a cut of the movie. (One of the more eerie things about this film is that the cartoon Angelina Jolie looks marginally more realistic than the actress herself.)Despite an accent that's more Stockwell than Geatland, Ray Winstone does a fine, sombre job as the hero, although my wife thought that the animated Winstone looked more like Sean Bean. Brendan Gleeson does a splendid job in the niche he's carved for himself of Hairy Sidekick. The acting honours, or at least the animation honours, go to Robin Wright Penn (or whoever worked on her character) as the pale and melancholy queen; she has moments of subtle hesitation and sadness that struck me as a triumph of CGI acting.There is much excellent smiting, some of it unfortunately toned down a little in order to keep a PG-13 rating - so we don't actually get to see Grendel biting men's heads off, just people's reactions to him doing so. Most importantly, the story is not a travesty of the original. It's thoughtful and interesting, as you'd expect from a writer of Gaiman's quality (if not from the author of 'Killing Zoe') and contains some striking meditations on the power of legend and reputation. Plus, there's a really huge kick-ass dragon. 'Beowulf' is a strange and unexpected treat.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A gothic, colorful and spectacular fantasy carried out by an innovative 3D technique.","Based on a legendary and mythical poem and filmed using the Motion Picture technique by Robert Zemeckis with a well-known casting, such as Ray Winstone, Angelina Jolie, Crispin Glover, John Malkovich, Bernard Gleeson, Charlotte Salt, Sebastian Roch√© and Anthony Hopkins. In a medieval land this bloody story of the battle of a Norse warrior against a great troll assassin named Grendel takes place. In contrast to the arrival of Christianity, this is the story of the ultimate hero who confronts a monstrous troll that wreaks havoc on the mead hall of the Danish king Hrothgar (Sir Anthony Hopkins). The latter offers a hefty reward for the death of Grendel (Crispin Glover), so there comes Beowulf (Ray Winstone), a boastful Geat warrior, victorious in his own right. The monster, Grendel, is not a creature of mythical powers, but a being of flesh and blood with immense flesh but of shapeless mass, he has furious blood and is driven by revenge. That is until the arrival of Beowulf, a mysterious mercenary who offers help to Hrothgar, the ruler of the kingdom, in hunting down Grendel. Out of loyalty to King Hrothgar, the highly respected Lord of the Danes, Beowulf leads a troop of warriors to rid a village of the marauding monster. But swinging his sword against a large, stinking beast is not such a simple act. The warrior Beowulf must fight and defeat the monster Grendel, who terrorizes Denmark, and then Grendel's evil mother, whom he begins to kill out of revenge. The story takes place in barbaric Northern Europe, where the reign of many gods is giving way to one: the invader from the south, Christ, here represented by a Catholic priest! Evil breeds pain! Survival is ruthless! Face your demons! I will kill your monster! Pride is the curse!Revenge, loyalty and mercy are powerfully intertwined in this spectacular Nordic adventure. Beowulf (2007) is a launch pad of dizzying 3D images, about the heroics of man against beasts, set in a besieged land, in which Beowulf must fight against the horrible creature Grendel, a carnivorous being that is killing all living in the kingdom; all of this being set in the eternally adolescent tradition of horror and gothic fantasy comic books. This is a fantastic story of blood, beer and sweat, which removes the mask of the hero-myth, leaving a raw and tangled story. By recreating the actors' performances, 'motion capture', the technique Zemeckis used for 'Polar Express', was improved. This Zemeckis production begins with a true sense of awe and surprise and develops through continuous fights until a fight against a giant dragon. The film contains a lot of action, wonderful cinematography, impressive fights and a bit of blood and nudity. Stunning battle scenes illuminate the full-blown adventure with a host of engaging combat action scenes, in which heads and limbs are cut off here and there and everywhere, while other body parts are cut open.Beowulf was a poem written in England, but set in Scandinavia, commonly cited as one of the most important works of Anglo-Saxon literature. Beowulf is considered an epic poem since the main character is a hero who travels great distances to demonstrate his strength against impossible odds against demons and supernatural beasts. It has been variously dated to between the 8th and early 11th centuries. It is an epic poem told in historical perspective; a story of epic events and great characters from a heroic past. Although its author is unknown, its themes and themes have their roots in Germanic heroic poetry, in the Anglo-Saxon tradition recited and cultivated by ancient English poets. The poem is divided between Beowulf's battles with Grendel and with a dragon and he also confronts Grendel's mother. According to the classic poem, the main protagonist, Beowulf, is a hero of the Geats, he comes to the aid of Hrothgar, the king of the Danes, whose great hall, Heorot, is plagued by the monster Grendel. Beowulf kills Grendel with his bare hands with a sword, once used by giants, which Beowulf found in Grendel's mother's lair.It contains an evocative and breathtaking musical score by Alan Slvestri , Zemeckis's regular, As well as a brilliant and picturesque cinematography by Robert Presley. The film was compellingly directed by Robert Zemeckis (Polar Express , Castaway, What lies beneath, Forrest Gump , Back to the Future I, II, III, Allied) . Rating: 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
impressive,"The first risk about this version of ""Beowulf"" is to see it as one of Zemeckis eccentricities. A technique used for a sort of childish game without limits. The second view discovers the purpose of the game - to propose the right essence of poem. The fluidity and dramatism of plot. The bitter flavor of confrontations. And the seed of the victory. Impressive, shocking in few scenes, it is a precise exploration of a world who becomes less familiar. Because, behind shadows and animation, violence and nudity, the message of ""Beowulf"" becomes more clear. And usefull. And, maybe, this is the most important thing in its case.",,Anonymous,Animation
"Not as bad as some are saying, Not as good as you hoped","Given the power of the cast and the budget, you perhaps hope for a movie which is stunningly entertaining and in some way expands your consciousness, if only for a brief 90 minutes or so. Unfortunately you get neither, just an action movie with a rather twisted and unhistorical plot. The acting does not shine through the CGI very well. Maybe it's because I am in my 50s and did not grow up with CGI, but I keep feeling like I am watching a cartoon, which is to say the least distracting.I can certainly understand that in such spectacles as the monster fight, CGI offers at least an approximation of realism. But in scenes where human interaction predominates, CGI falls far short of communicating human expression and emotion and leaves me cold.There is a lot of discussion of the historical ""accuracy"" of this movie. I did a little research, and it seems that there are major gaps in the major historical document (literally, much is missing or has crumbled away), and how it should be interpreted. Given this, it seems peculiar to pan the latest rendition of a reality that causes great controversy, even among academics. I do agree that Beowulf is portrayed in a very unflattering and unfavorable light by the movie.In the obvious comparison CGI movie, the 300, the producers emphasized the myth. In Beowulf, they denigrated it. Neither, by itself, is reason to reject the movie itself. But 300 sold itself as a CGI production, and exceeded expectations. Beowulf sold itself as an exceptional human drama and fell flat on its face, saved but hardly exalted by its action scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Denmark?! That's not Denmark!,"The movie's OK, I think; won't go into details. The thing I wondered most about is the research done about the Danish country...or lack of same. It seems that those who did the research may have visited Denmark's neighbours Norway or Sweden and decided that that's how all Scandinavian countries look like. However, Denmark - my home country - looks nothing like what is depicted in this movie. Never has. The geography of Denmark is that of a rather flat country. We have hills, yes, but not mountains, and certainly not cliffs. Beowulf lands his ship on a beach with large cliffs in the background. Not one single place in Denmark looks like this. The same thing goes for the place of the king's hall. No place like that in Denmark. Just an interesting thought from a Danish fellah...",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
What's the Point of Motion Capture?,".....and I'm not sure about the 6-10...perhaps it's for the 3-D, which is really quite a spectacular achievement...being able to essentially move your head around in an environment and look this way and that, choosing to focus on what you will.....But, the computer animation is nothing more than an all-inclusive production design, which is fine- all films have to have a unifying production design. But to paint over real actors, when they are already being used seems a terrible waste, when the technology still can't render the human form believable. They're coming closer, but the actor's main tool, his face and mouth, still have yet to be fully realized.Motion capture gets the broad strokes of body movement, giving the body a sense of mass on-screen, which is why this technique looks so much better than the digital avatar that stands in for Toby McGuire in the Spiderman films. Spidy has no sense of mass when it isn't McGuire. But all the actors in Beowulf do not have realistically expressive faces, and consequently the film falls apart. Given that the plot is thin gruel, not worthy of a two-hour plus film, Zemeckis would have been better off to use the techniques employed in ""Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow"" and let the real actors play around in a digital environment. The photorealism would be intact, and the actors would be allowed to bring all their chops to bear.To be sure, motion capture is fine when the actors are covered in digital make-up a la Gollum, and I'm sure Ray Winstone appreciates the fitness programme that he did not have to embark on to get himself ripped for this role, but that's it! So what's the point? Filmgoers have been willingly suspending their disbelief for the sake of buying the fantasy since the original King Kong, and Fritz Lang's Metropolis. Ray Harryhausen was delivering the goods way before digital technology came about.This film works only as a technological exercise. Someday they will be able to replicate an actor's facial features exactly, mimicking the skin and muscle contractions that make the human face such a magnificent tool for the performer. But until then, why not use the real thing? And none of this substitutes for telling a good story. Beowulf is a sad commentary on American films that make technique king over substance. That's why Andy Warhol isn't Rembrandt.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Surprisingly Good - A 3D Treat,"When going into the theatre to see this I in two minds - it was my first 3D movie and I had heard good things, however I wasn't particularly taken by the concept or the trailers. I was unsure what to expect, however I ended up leaving the cinema extremely satisfied with the film, and tellingly, unable to stop discussing it long after the ride home.Visually it is an absolute treat, Zemeckis uses 3D superbly, some of the camera angles and sequences are as great an art as the photo-realistic animation. Occasionally the odd shot appears where the impression is that it was set up solely to emphasise the 3D (e.g. starting at the end of a branch and panning out) and whilst this doesn't add to the film it is actually a pleasant reminder of the novelty of 3D.There are only two areas that let Beowulf down aesthetically: the eyes and the mouth. The eyes were static throughout and it is the little details that make the difference when trying to make something as uber-realistic as this, such as the fact that the pupils didn't react to light. As for the lips - they're just not quite there yet - sometimes the speech didn't seem to be quite right.The characters are expertly introduced and developed, most notably Anthony Hopkins character, Hrothgar and the tension between his wife. Grendell and his mother are wonderfully creepy and seductive, and bizarrely enough almost encourage sympathy.For me the most disappointing part of the film was actually Ray Winstone as the titular character - he was fantastic when talking in a low growl, however the film really suffers when he shouts in full cockney accent. ""I will kill your monstah!"". I half expected Grendell's head to be smashed between a car and it's door. John Malkovitch is a saving grace with his none-more-sinister voice and interesting faith sub-plot.The rating for this film has been hotly discussed and in my opinion I do not think it is suitable for children under the age of 12. Grendell would have truly terrified me as a child. The violence, as well as bawdiness, does not make it a family film for young children although having said that the lewd references do provide good humour and balances out the movie.So, overall, this was worthy of an 8. Breathtaking animation, incredible action (especially the finale featuring an excellent dragon) and a generally brilliant cast. Beowulf throws down the gauntlet to film-makers to show what can be done with 3D and is an indication of the potential. It's not all the way there yet, but it's a damn good start.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf in 3D - partly,"First of all 3D is not a gimmick - without it this type of movie goes straight to XBox without a cinematic release. While Beowulf is just another Lord of the Rings wannabe, neither true to the source material nor actually a film - this is what the next few years hold.Overall the movie is great entertainment. There is a neat enough plot, the effects are fairly spectacular. And it probably hangs together a bit better than 300. It doesn't have the finesse of Sin City - and 3D cannot cover the usual Hollywood film weaknesses. But at no point does it let up.We now have the three directions that all other blockbusters will go. CGI as realisation (Lord of the Rings, Transformers), CGI as style maker (Sin City, 300) and CGI as everything (Beowulf, Final Fantasy). There doesn't seem to be room for using CGI in just a few scenes anymore. No room for anything else.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I will kill your Monstah!!!,"Everyone knows the story of Beowulf, one of the oldest poems ever written. So Robert Zemeckis certainly had his work cut out to make a film that was both entertaining for modern audiences and still paid tribute to its original source. Zemeckis deciding to film in Motion- Capture again, after the iffy results of The Polar Express, was another brave move. The film did have me questioning certain aspects beforehand, would the Motion-Capture work? Could it avoid becoming another typical action movie? And why Cockney hardman Ray Winstone as the Swedish hero? Making the whole thing work and pay off would be a huge achievement.The follows the poem as warrior Beowulf and his men travel to Denmark to rid a kingdom of the monster Grendel. After Beowulf manages to kill the creature, he learns that its mother is still wreaking havoc and goes to her lair in order to kill her. However, once there he makes a bargain with her to become king and bare her 'son' that will have terrible aftereffects. The film deserves massive credit for managing to extend the story without diluting it, something that concerned me prior. The more time means that more characters are developed and become more interesting the longer things go along, especially Beowulf and the Queen. The things involving Grendel and his Mother are great, the older thoughtful Beowulf offers good insight into the man and the climax, with a Dragon, is superb.The Motion-Capture is a main talking point and, thankfully, it is excellent. There have clearly been developments in the field as the zombie-like expressions have gone and everything is even closer to real life. The characters are brilliantly designed, for example Grendel looks truly monstrous and Beowulf himself is excellently rendered. The characters a look very lifelike and have close similarities to their actors, all except for Beowulf himself. Seeing as he is played by a burly Winstone they make him more athletic looking and he ends up resembling Sean Bean, which sounds strange but works perfectly well.The details are fantastic, the scenery looks beautiful in all its snow covered glory. A lot of work clearly went into making the backdrop look authentic and it really is visually stunning at times. The use of snow and sunshine looks extremely realistic as they add to the visual spectacle. Certain visual aspects like the injuries and Beowulf's battles are really well stylised, never being too goofy and always looking very effective.But could Ray Winstone succeed as Beowulf? The answer is a strong yes. In theory the Cockney Winstone shouldn't work. Yet it does, as he possesses excellent charisma and there is an understated intensity to his performance that makes things click. The Cockney accent creeps in at times, such as when he shouts 'I will kill your monstah!', but for the most part he tones it down and does sound like a tough warrior. Here is where Winstone proved that he does have some amount of versatility and he shows he do a great job at the forefront of the film.The other performances are extremely good. Anthony Hopkins offers his usual hammy turn as the under pressure King, though given the tone of the film this actually works okay and he is entertaining. Brendan Gleeson gives a solid turn as Beowulf's right-hand man, John Malkovich is effective in his backing role and Robin Wright is excellent once again as the sombre queen, showing once more that she is a brilliant actress. Crispin Glover adds touches of sadness and sympathy to the monstrous Grendel. The animation on him looks great and his soft tongue reflects his brutal actions well. Angelina Jolie shows up as the beasts Mother and spends a lot of time with little clothing on. Despite her short appearance she portrays the seductive and cruel creature excellently.Another hotly discussed aspect is the rating, and I agree with the general view. How the hell did this get a 12 certificate? The violence is truly brutal. We actually see Grendel ripping people in half, blood pouring out of wounds and arms being sliced clean off. Not to mention that there are a lot of sexual references and some very scary moments. Just because it isn't real-life doesn't tone it down. I do enjoy the viciousness as its ads to the films impact, but the rating is just wrong.The action scenes are impressive, as I've alluded to. Beowulf's battle with Grendel is intense and has some pounding action, even if him fighting in the bluff is a bit distracting. The climax involving a dragon is excellent, containing plenty of pulsating action and edge of your set thrills. Even the drama hits the right spot, the scenes of the older Beowulf and the focus on the Queen leads to a lot of interesting moments. Elsewhere regular Zemeckis collaborator Alan Silvestri delivers the goods again with another top notch score, it has the right amount of intensity and melancholy to fit the film.I'm actually happy that Beowulf passed my expectations. It answered concerns over expanding the story and the idea of Ray Winstone as the man exceptionally. Some may question why the film wasn't just shot in live action, but I think that the Motion-Capture adds to the films uniqueness and does allow for many wonderful visual moments. The film itself does show that Motion-Capture can add a lot to a film instead of taking away from it. Don't be expecting a perfect adaption because it's not that type of film. The acting is excellent, the action sequences are thrilling and the visuals are truly something to behold. It is a thoroughly entertaining film.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Glorious 3D treat requiring little brain engagement,"This movie is a lot of fun. In 3D. I suspect its impact will be considerably diminished in 2D, so I urge anyone who wants to see it to seek out the 3D version. There are lots of beautifully constructed tracking shots where the camera glides and swirls forward, back up and down, and trees, rocks, arrows, dragons or whatever slip past the edges of the frame, and this effect is stunning in 3D. In fact, all the action scenes are stunning in 3D, particularly the climactic battle with a top-notch, fire belching monster of a dragon.The plot isn't much to write home about (although there's just a hint of a theological debate about the way Christianity has displaced the old mythic religions, which made me think for about 5 seconds). The acting is variable - Robin Wright-Penn is fine, but about as sexy as a paper cup, Hopkins is his usual reliable self, Ray Winstone is suitably heroic as the heroic, self-aggrandising Beowulf, and Crispin Glover is just brilliant as Grendel. Grendel is a lovely creation, oozing slime and blood, and wracked with pain.But who cares about all that. This is not a scholarly work, it's entertainment. And my wife and I were as royally entertained as the kids surrounding us in the cinema (and we're both 40-somethings). Leave your serious head (and any timid youngsters) at home, and go and have fun.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Motion capture CGI getting better,"Based on the epic poem, King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is attacked by monstrous troll Grendel (Crispin Glover). He offers a reward of half of the kingdom's gold and Beowulf (Ray Winstone) comes to answer the call. He finds not just Grendel, but his mother (Angelina Jolie) as well.Director Robert Zemeckis is using his motion capture CGI technology once again. It is a big improvement over 'Polar Express'. However the faces still lack a certain amount of life. Their eyes are still doll-like, but it's getting much better. This movie doesn't really answers the question of why. Other than a couple of interesting scenes, the movie could have easily been done better with live actors.As for the story, it lacks a character to root for. The dialog is so stiff. The movie needs an antagonist more compelling than a muscle bound screaming hero. Nevertheless, the advancement in movie technology should be praised.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is a cinema experience for sure!,"Just this minute got back from seeing a free preview of Beowulf and OH MY GOD! This is a cracking film and I highly recommend everyone goes to the cinema to see it (it's a cinema experience for sure!). Not only that, but it's 3D (which I wasn't aware of) or rather the all new 3D (no more red/green glasses). Everyone in the audience was given what looked like cheap-ass shades, but they did the job wonderfully and fitted snugly over my regular specs.As for the movie, the plot was tight and well scripted, the voice acting was great (Ray Winstone rocks), the action was breathtaking, some of the CGI was unbelievably gorgeous and the music and incidental sound was great! The only downside for me was some of the CGI. It seemed apparent that given an unlimited budget, this movie would have looked phenomenal in every scene, but unfortunately the budget wasn't unlimited and it shows in a number of places. Nothing looks horrible, but you can tell that they had to pick and choose where to go for high detail. The movie also suffers from the age old, it's creepy because it's almost perfect.As for the 3D, apart from an awesome intro, nothing seems to be done just to exploit 3D, it's all very natural and adds an amazing level of detail to the movie. The depth of vision you get is truly breathtaking in parts.Quite honestly I wasn't expecting much from this movie having seen the trailer, but I was blown away. I've not been this excited leaving the cinema in a long long time!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf review,"""Oi've cam ta kill yer mawnster!"" declares Beowulf, voiced by Ray Winstone - although he looks more like Sean Bean thanks to the magic of motion capture.

awful just awful (shakes head in sadness),"I guess that i am a purist or i guess that a poem that has stood the test of time for thousands (I repeat actually thousands of years old) would not be ravaged like this. I tried to enjoy the movie and the horrible script that just recycled one-liner after one-liner ""I am here to kill you Monsta indeed."" Every line was a rip off from the now clich√© Gerard Butler line ""THIS IS SPARTA!!!"" This movie took away everything that i loved from the poem and made it into something almost dirty it made this epic hero that stood not only the horrible monster Grendel but also his horrible mother, and then in his older days he still could beat up a dragon into something dirty. It made Beowulf seem to be a braggart perhaps it was an autobiography for Gaiman who writes all right but most of his tooting comes from his own horn. It reminded me of Troy which ruined the Iliad for exactly the same reason: none. It makes me sick to think that both of these epics are good enough to remain relevant and exciting for THOUSANDS freaking THOUSANDS of years is not good enough for Hollywood writers who have to ""improve"" the story line.Mr. Gaiman the true monster in this story is you, I just hope that you have not weakened Beowulf enough because he is indeed the monster killer i am just not sure that he could survive this massacre.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

The Old English epic in motion-capture CGI form.,"I try to steer clear of motion-capture CGI that attempts to border on realism: I either want my films to be live-action footage or clearly animated. I find the awkward middle ground just a little unsettling. That said, with such a cracking tale (the original poem is a thousand years old‚Äîstories don't endure for that long if they're crap), superior acting from a solid cast, and masterful storytelling by director Robert Zemeckis, I'm willing to make an exception in this case.Zemeckis's film does deviate from the original story a tad, which might upset the literature purists, but since the average cinema-goer probably has as much in-depth knowledge of the Beowulf legend as I have of the inner workings of the Hadron Collider, I can allow a little artistic license. With such an epic narrative, enjoyable action scenes, cool monsters, a naked digital Angelina Jolie, and a CG rendering of the main character's ass for those who like that sort of thing (thankfully Beowulf looks nothing like Ray Winstone), there surely is something for everyone.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Entertaining and thought-provoking, even moving","""Beowulf"" (2007) is an animated version of the epic poem of antiquity featuring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Robin Wright Penn. It uses live action motion capture animation, which was previously utilized for ""The Polar Express"" (2004) and ""Monster House"" (2006). Although it's a ""cartoon"" it's the equivalent of an R-rated picture with brutal violence and openly sexual situations & dialogue.The film has the same characters as the epic poem - Beowulf, Hrothgar, Wiglaf, Grendel, Grendel's mother and the dragon - and the three Acts split between Beowulf's fight with Grendel, Grendel's ""sea hag"" mother and the dragon; other than this the film deviates from the poem with some interesting ideas to tie everything together. Needless to say, don't watch if you're a Beowulf purist.However, if you don't mind the animation or the re-imagining and enjoy sword & sorcery adventure like Conan, you'll likely appreciate this. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking. I recommend watching it back-to-back with 2005's ""Beowulf & Grendel,"" which is a live-action version with Gerard Butler and Sarah Polley, shot on the gorgeously bleak landscapes of Iceland.I should add that, not only is this a beautiful film to look at, animated or not, it also has an excellent epic Viking-ish score by Alan Silvestri, highlighted by the main title, ""What We Need Is A Hero,"" and the two versions of ""A Hero Comes Home,"" the first is the shorter version sung by Robin Wright-Penn whereas the second, sung by Idina Menzel, plays during the end credits.The message of this animated version is that the reality behind the story is much different than the legend because it has been embellished over the years. Some reviewers complain that Beowulf isn't a genuine hero, but he's certainly heroic, faults and all. He's a bold warrior who takes on the gargantuan and intimidating (not to mention UGLY) Grendel NAKED and somehow defeats him! He then goes on to lead a mighty Nordic kingdom for decades to come. If this isn't heroic, what is? So he exaggerates his past exploits and has a weakness for women, what else is new?The main lesson, aside from the one noted above, is that new political leaders tend to make the same mistakes as past political leaders, so new leaders should be careful or they'll experience the same pitfalls.Other morals include: Apart from redemption, the ""sins of the fathers"" will cast a pall over the family or community and eventually come back to bite 'em (literally, in this case); even the greatest heroes are human and have serious flaws; deal with your past mistakes (sins) or the guilt & shame will drain the life from you and your environment; it'll also make you wish you were dead; offer a man unlimited power, wealth and fame and he'll likely go for it no matter the cost, selling his soul to the devil, so to speak; men are easily entranced by feminine beauty, regardless of how obviously impure her intentions; the importance of saying you're sorry and forgiving; the importance and ultimate triumph of love.Some things to chew on: Why is the dragon one-and-the-same as a noble-looking gold-skinned man? Does this signify he's a cross between malevolent blood and noble blood (mother and father respectively)? Is the golden man his spiritual side and the dragon his dark side?Some criticize that Beowulf is not a Christ-figure, as in the poem, which isn't accurate. (***SPOILERS FOLLOW***) Although late in the story Beowulf mourns that there are no heroes in the new Christian era, only ""weeping martyrs,"" ironically he goes on to be an obvious type of Christ by sacrificing himself for the people of his kingdom (the world) by slaying the dragon (the devil). Keep in mind that, according to the Bible, all things were created through Christ, which would include the angel Lucifer (a ""son of God""), who later devolved into Satan. Likewise the golden man in the movie is the son of Beowulf and ultimately revealed as a hideous dragon.All human types of Christ are flawed because humans are flawed, even ""heroes"" like Beowulf which, again, is one of the main points of the film. Hence, Beowulf's perception about ""weeping martyrs"" is faulty and can be attributed to his fallen condition when making the statement. Later, he rises out of the ashes to slay the dragon and sacrifice himself for the people. Right before doing this he declares his love for his wife and asks her to forgive him for his past failings.One scene had an impact on me. Years after becoming a king, Beowulf boldly confronts a defeated Frisian warrior who mocks him on the Nordic coastline. Beowulf commands his men to step back, discards his sword and challenges the warrior to kill him (at this point the Frisian has picked up his battle axe). Weaponless, Beowulf yells at him with every fiber of his being, ""KILL ME! DO IT! KILL ME! KILL ME!"" Why does Beowulf do this? Is he invulnerable and, hence, has no fear of death? No, the ending shows that he's wholly mortal. Actually he's so burdened by guilt and shame that he no longer even cares if he lives or dies. This is reality.The film runs 1 hour, 55 minutes.GRADE: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hollywood takes a dump on a classic,"Beowulf the book is an epic poem. Beowulf the movie is an adaptation of this classic, except with extremely poorly written dialog, an abundance of tit jokes, and everything else you would expect from a Hollywood film. Secret love affair? Check. Jealous rivals? Check. Excessive imagery against Christianity? Check. Nothing quite like having someone burned by a dragon in a church after holding up a cross. Expect to see about four crosses burning in the movie, along with multiple references to the inefficiency of the religion of Jesus Christ.For all it's faults, Beowulf is still a good movie...for a drinking game. Just take a shot every time someone says Mead in the scene when Beowulf gets to the Mead Hall. You should be passed out rather soon and thus, you won't have to sit through the Hollywood book rape that is Beowulf!",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Fun, handsome, but spoilt by 3D","Pretty much everyone knows the story of Beowulf - man fights monster, monster's mum and then a dragon - but this ancient story has inspired generations of writers and academics, now it gets a shiny makeover courtesy of Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary.Beowulf (the man) could have been written as a cookie-cutter hero, but fortunately he's something else - fallible and not yet the hero he must become later in the movie. But (and this is really hard without spoiling the movie), the battle that turns him into a hero also leads inexorably to his undoing. That's something the two writers have brought to the millennia old text and it works perfectly to help fill in some of the gaps in the original poem and provide a back story to events.A special mention also to Crispin Glover's Grendel. I wasn't particularly struck with the physical realisation of the monster, but the performance is knock out. Instead of just being a rampaging beast, Grendel is almost something to be pitied - a misshapen outcast with noisy neighbours, and his final scene is remarkably touching. Oh and if you don't understand Grendel, you clearly haven't been keeping up with your Old English classes!But let's be honest, everyone watches a movie about Vikings for the action. And Beowulf delivers this in spades. Here comes my first proviso - Beowulf in the UK is getting a 12A rating, but there is no way I would take a 12 year old to see this film in all its eye-ball spearing, spine-snapping, ligament-tearing glory. This movie would get a higher rating had it been shot in real-life and it's worth considering this before packing the kids into the car. Mostly the violence is justified, but it is there and it's NOT cartoony.The animation is the talking point of this movie, and its a real step on from the zombified performance of 'Polar Express'. The impression of living, breathing flesh is almost complete with the exception of strangely dead eyes - this movie is a landmark in computer imagery. The majority of the characters are stunningly rendered (Beowulf in particular) in close up, but they somehow look less convincing at a distance. Generally the men are better done than the women, with Queen Wealthow the spitting image of Julie Andrew's queen in Shrek 2.So, its a violent special effects triumph - could anything be wrong?Actually yes.Two things. One - the accents. Oh dear god in heaven above what were they thinking - this is a treasure house of appalling voices, Irish(ish), Scottish(ish), Welsh(ish) are all thrown into the mix, but the standout horrors are Jon Malkovich's take on Danish which might have been inspired by the Muppets and Angelina Jolie dusting off her accent from 'Alexander'.The second is the 3D projection. For reasons best known to studio executives we're all meant to get very excited by 3D all over again. Beowulf is one of the first movies to be released in the UK using REALD - a system familiar to anyone who has been to a Disney park in the last 20 years. The animators of Beowulf clearly had great fun working out new ways of making things jump out of the screen at the audience, but the effect becomes slightly wearisome after a minute or two. Fortunately things settle down later in the movie and the makers stop trying to show off their new technology.More disappointing, the poor quality of the Polaroid glasses you have to wear make the image slightly blurry and spoilt by reflections. After years waiting for the crystal clarity of digital projection, the whole thing has been undone by a gimmick. If you have a choice, you might be better off seeing a regular 2D version.A final comment, Beowulf spends part of the movie naked, bet you can't watch it and not think of Austin Powers.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely worth a watch.,"There have been several Beowulf's brought to the screen, from lower budget Gerard Butler through to Antonio Banderas' hugely underrated 13th Warrior. This is a more straight forward adaptation of the original legend albeit with a very interesting twist by the always talented pen of Neil Gaiman (author of American Gods and Coraline) that is in keeping with the parent/child conflict of Greek Myth and the cyclical nature of Norse mythology.
Beowulf is tempted by the riches on offer from King Hrothgar whose kingdom is cursed by the monster Grendel. Beowulf rises to the challenge but lurking behind Grendel is the greater threat of his Mother.
Stylistically it's a PG13 Polar Express and other than gimmick factor (and that Ray Winstone isn't built to be a leading action hero anymore) it's hard to fathom why it's animated rather than love action but it's rendered well and I soon forgot I was watching an animation.
The voice talent is great, Ray Winston is a great bullish young hero and as the older, jaded Beowulf really excelled. The always talented Brendan Gleason is fantastic as right hand man Wiglaf and Angelina Jolie is a disturbingly sexy Grendel's Mother (this is part of the plot). Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Robin Wright and Crispin Glover round our the main cast.
Ultimately it's a story of sin, corruption, power and glory which is at the heart of the original epic poem.

Beautiful but Flawed,"Visually this film is stunning. More than once I had to remind myself that what I was looking at was not real actors caught on film but a CGI interpretation. It's difficult to purvey this feeling as either a negative or a positive one: on the one hand I cannot see the point in producing CGI if what the filmmaker's goal is realism of reality. CGI in film is of course appropriate when trying to achieve fantastical creatures and set pieces (which are of course inherently unrealistic) but in Beowulf each actor's face, verbal, and non-verbal performance are recreated in CGI verbatim. This I cannot fathom ¬ñ why recreate what is already there, in the flesh and far more believable? On the other hand there is a sense of true wonder when in a handful of scenes you are genuinely fooled into thinking that what you are looking at is not CGI, but live action film. You are left with no choice but to marvel at the technical and artistic achievements. However, the illusion is inevitably shattered when you begin to pick up on some of the unrealistic lighting, dodgy physics and for some reason: gesticulation (wooden puppets spring to mind). It's really hard to understand what was being attempted with this film: genuine realism (then why recreate the actors in CGI?), complete fantasy immersion (then why are some scenes so tangible?), or (as I suspect) purely an exercise in what is possible with modern CGI.The pace of the story itself is about right with a good balance of character development and plot enhancement. Anthony Hopkins puts in a decent performance as Hrothgar and John Malkovich as Unferth is suitably sinister. Ray Winstone is, well, Ray (WYSIWYG) Winstone. Angelina Jolie makes a brief and scantily-clad appearance as Grendel's Mother although at times I found it very difficult understanding the dialogue between Grendel (Crispin Glover) and Grendel's Mother due to some very obscure accents. It's difficult to discredit the physical acting because although it is clear that the original actors did perform physically I suspect that much was lost in the CGI transformation.Unfortunately this movie's biggest flaw is the story itself. I appreciate that when interpreting the written media to film some degree of poetic licence is required, but why do so many filmmakers blatantly disregard original source material unnecessarily? Beowulf does present the key protagonists, and the first half of the film is fairly accurate but the second half is wildly aloof in its interpretation of the original text.That said, overall the film is beautiful and should be applauded for what has been achieved but for the time being you are left feeling that this technique of story telling should be confined to games. Incidentally, I felt the same about The Polar Express, although that film was aimed at a far less mature audience¬Öor was it?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Easily one of the most male centered movies I've ever seen,"And I loved it. The creators of this little gem have far more potent imaginations than I and I envy them that. What a rousing movie! I picked it up in DVD to fill up an evening while my wife was away and what a pleasure it was to get engrossed in this brilliantly told tale of courage and adventure. It took me about 30 seconds to get used to the animation. It will take you longer to get used to the idea that this movie actually does a better job evoking a bygone time than the literature on which it's based. That's amazing to me. Another surprise was that Ms Jolie's much ballyhooed nude scenes were more disappointing than I had expected. I found myself more entranced with Robin Wright Penn's Wealthow who is undeservedly undervalued as an indispensable part of this film's magical weave. Ray Winstone rings more true in the lead than anyone had any right to hope for, in my opinion. And then there's Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich, both adding bits of irrepressible humanity to the mix. This is in sum a thoroughly enjoyable film and I don't hesitate to recommend it, but especially to guys who will have a richer appreciation of it all than I would expect the usual woman will.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beautiful, gory, sensual.","The film has a very unique look to it. At times the animation actually looks real. This is maybe due to the fact that this is not completely animated. Instead, they used real actors, similar to 'The Polar Express'. In fact, Robert Zemeckis did 'The Polar Express' and 'Beowulf' back to back.The film is bloody and gory, yet also has very deep emotion. It is a great story, and a wonderful epic action adventure fantasy horror. The actors did a great job, and the film is visually stunning. The film was also very sensual, focusing on both the male and female physique. Beowulf has a body to be admired.If you've purchased the Blu Ray or DVD, be sure to watch the special features.

"Don't waste your money on the 2-D version, this has 3-D written all over it!","I have never had the experience of seeing a 3-D movie before on the cinema, the only experience I have had with a 3-d film, only courtesy of some 3-d glasses coming free with a DVD, was Spy Kids 3-D, a movie while mildly entertaining isn't exactly the best film every to display the greatness of 3-d. So Beowulf today was my first 3-d experience, I went in expecting something good because of the 3-d, but I didn't expect the movie itself to be superb. Part of my reasoning behind this was because of the one and only experience I had had with Zemeckis and his new way of making movies. That movie was unfortunately the Polar Express, a supposedly happy tail that actually freaked me out more than most horror movies! So what an absolute delight to say that Beowulf not only works because of it being in 3-D (more on that brilliant factor later) but also the movie is a genuinely brilliant movie anyway. The motion capture isn't remotely creepy this time round and actually it seemed to make sense in some bizarre way as to why they did the movie like this. The actors surprised me big time, Ray Winstone delivering actually one of his best performances in a long while, Angelina Jolie playing the slinky seductress to perfection and Anthony Hopkins being a joy to watch on screen. Beowulf is an action packed, well written and entertaining piece of popcorn cinema. Just watch the dragon sequence near the end, every single person in my cinema was on the edges of their seat and looked in awe. The action sequences just amaze, and the dialogue sequences surprisingly really work as well. Unfortunately however if you see this movie in 2-D then you will not be experiencing Beowulf in my eyes, take off the 3-D this is a 9/10 movie, with the 3-D it gets the 10/10 rating with a blink of an eye.As I've previously said the acting in the movie really caught me off guard. Ray Winston obviously is not the first actor who comes to mind when playing an ancient warrior. However when you see the movie and see the performance you understand why Winstone was cast. Sure his cockney acting at first seems a bit bizarre coming from the character, but after a while you see the subtlety of the performance and come the final half hour you realise he's quite possibly the best thing in the movie. He delivers a heartfelt and genuinely brilliant performance. Anthony Hopkins not only looks real in the movie, but he too delivers a performance truly worthy of Anthony Hopkins. Sometimes Hopkins can do a role for a sake of a role (see Mission Impossible 2), but here he seems to be having a blast as Hrothgar and he has some superb moments in the movie. Angelina Jolie plays the most interesting character of the movie, Grendell's Mother, alas she appears very briefly. But her few scenes stick firmly in memory, and her entry scene is one of the most beautifully pieces of cinema I have seen when watched in 3-D. Crispin Glover too has brief screen time as Grendell, but he delivers a heartfelt performance, in fact I felt genuine sympathy with Grendell. Glover might not be recognisable, but his performance shines through in the early scenes. John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn too deserve considerably praise, as does a brilliant cast Brendan Gleeson.So as I've said the 3-D really makes the movie have a cherry on top of an already beautiful cake. After they filmmaker get over the gimmick of chucking things at the screen the 3-D is used less prominently, until any action sequences, and when the action sequences begin I doubt you will draw a single breath. Grendell's attack on a beer hall is the opening action sequence, and it is surprisingly violent for a 12a and also amazing to behold. But its the dragon sequence and late battle sequence that stick firmly in mind. I shall not spoil them, but those sequences really did make me wish that every action movie ever made from now will be in 3-D. The problem with the 3-D being so good is that the 2-D version seems like a cash in, in fact the movie relies so much on the 3-D at times that I doubt the 2-D version is worth watching. Swords pointed at screens, the camera pans through trees, the multi layered effect it gives off, in 2-d it just won't work as well, so my advice is to find a cinema that does play it in 3-d, you'll get much more for your money if you do. The storyline and film making is also extremely effective. The subtle dialogue scenes, especially the stuff between Winstone and Jolie really are some of the highlights. Also the relationship between Beowulf and his queen is touching.So are their any faults? As I've mentioned the 2-D version just won't be as good, but also the movie doesn't seem like it'll be that good at the start. In fact at the beginning, for five minutes, I was expecting to be bitterly disappointed. Thankfully that little slouch at the beginning is livened up with the arrival of Grendell, and from that point onwards you will adore the movie. This is Zemeckis' best movie since Back to the Future and definitely one of my favourite films of the year. Go and watch in 3-D and pray that more movies will be made like this in the near future.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Off Somehow,"After seeing this movie, I've decided that I'm not really a fan of motion capture animation for a primarily human cast. I didn't think much about it in ""The Polar Express"", as I assumed the primary reason for it was to attempt to emulate the illustrations of the book it was based on. I also didn't think about it much in movies like ""Monster House"" and ""Happy Feet"", as the characters were cartoons for all intents and purposes. In ""Beowulf"", however, I believe the use of motion capture animation caused us to lose some of the human expression that may have really helped this feature to rise to the next level. While it was fantastic in some scenes, and especially in some shots of the movie (there were extreme closeups that never could have been done with a live camera), other scenes fell short where they should not have. My new opinion of this new technology is that it should be used to enhance film-making, rather than create it's own genre. For instance, if we were to perfect this new technology, we could create and use those shots that could not be done with a live action camera in a primarily live action movie (most illustrative point is Gollum). Having said all that, I thought the story was very well put together and not at all disjointed, as so many movies lately have been. The voice work was almost all superb, and the animated surroundings of the characters were beautiful. It's really too bad that it's so difficult to connect with characters that just don't feel human enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Myth movie has come home at last.,"Despite all you might have read, Beowulf does not appear on screen as he was in the poem which was the origin of this incredibly well designed CGI tour-De-force. This, although a shock to some, I'm sure, means little to the vast majority of viewers who either 1 - never heard of this legendary hero in the first place or 2 - would forever picture him as Christopher Lambert in the eponymous, and eminently forgettable, straight-to-DVD movie of some years ago. The truth is, this movie is a spectacle to behold: it grips you from the first scene, wrings you by the seat of your pants and absolutely knocks your socks off at every corner - at least CGI wise. It has its faults, surely, as any masterpiece, but a masterpiece it still is. Some set pieces are not as well rendered as others (the water in the ocean is a blatant example) but others are just plain outstanding and technology-defying (like the last battle of the movie, which I won't reveal here). Ray Winstone (Beowulf) is tremendously convincing, as is the generally under-rated Crispin Glover (Grendel - who, go figure, is no dragon, as other people said) - Sir Anthony Hopkins is very much royalty in his own right (King Hrothgar) and Robin Right Penn, Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich excel in the little nuances that give supporting role characters their chances at the Oscars - unfortunately, Angelina Jolie's part is both a visual treat and at the same time an auditory shame - very few lines are spoken - it seems seeing her with zero garments was understood to be enough to satisfy the teenage crowds - well, I would certainly have liked for more character development but what the hell, can't really complain. As far as anthropomorphic CGI goes all the main characters are instantly recognizable but not perfect (this is still an evolution over Zemecky's own ""The Polar Express"", mind you) and no matter how much the 3D effects try (and try they do, believe you me), they still seem like gimmicks - the first part of the movie and the cave scenes encompass the best 3D trickery on display - and this new fangled technology is truly superior to the previous red-blue glasses of yesteryear - and will probably leave you with a little less of a hangover afterward. When all is said and done, it stands out on its own merits: epic, comes to mind, and so does cutting edge. This is a movie that will sell a lot of HD hardware (be it BluRay or HD-DVD or whatever else just comes out meanwhile), and sure to be displayed in plasmas and LCD screens all over the world when this movie goes on sale. Go see it now, at theaters, in its original digital form, 3D glasses over your nose and enjoy it for what it is: pure magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A great retelling of a legend...,"Ever since the year of 1995 saw the release of Pixar's ""Toy Story, the first computer-animated feature film, a whole new way of creating animated movies was born, as while computers were already used in traditionally animated films, now they could be used to create animated feature length films. And just like traditional animation has developed several techniques (like Rotoscoping), 3D animation also developed its own styles, like photorealism, which attempts to mimic real life employing techniques such as motion capture. Director Robert Zemeckis has been working with this style for a while, with his first animated film being 2004's ""The Polar Express"", which showed the potential of motion capture. His next animated feature was also based on the motion capture technique, but this time he used it to recreate England's oldest epic narration: the Norse legend of ""Beowulf"".Following closely the epic poem, the movie chronicles the story of how a monster named Grendel (Crispin Glover) terrorized the famous mead hall Heorot, slaughtering the people of danish King Hrothgar (Anthony Hokins) and bringing death to his lands. Hearing of the problems at Heorot, a Geatish hero named Beowulf (Ray Winstone) arrives to Hrothgar's mead hall with his men, claiming to be the world's greatest hero and the only one able to kill the monster. King Hrothgar decides to give Beowulf and his men a chance to prove their courage and allows them to battle Grendel, however, this fight will prove to be decisive in Beowulf's life, as not only he'll face a monster beyond his imagination, he'll also be forced to confront his inner demons when he meets Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and to make things worse, he'll fall in love with the King's beautiful wife, Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).As written above, ""Beowulf"" follows the Old English poem quite faithfully, in the sense that it covers all the major battles and challenges that Beowulf faced. However, writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary use the poem's outline to add a back-story that ties all the poem's events, and at the same time explores the theme of the difference between man and myth in heroic tales. This adds an interesting complexity to the poem's characters (which are more archetypes than real persons), as while we do watch Beowulf as the mythic heroic warrior the poem talks about, we also see him as man whose greatest wish is to be remembered as a hero, and often falls in the temptation of exaggerating his feats. It's a take that many purists of the poem may dislike, but personally I found the script to be the strongest part of the film. The touch of sly humor is also another welcomed surprise in the screenplay.Director Robert Zemeckis makes a good job at making the Norse legend come to life again in animated form, recreating in a very detailed way the atmosphere of myth and magic that the epic tale conveys. While Gaiman and Avery's script takes some liberties with the original story, Zemeckis makes sure to keep that sense of thrill and adventure that has made ""Beowulf"" to be a captivating story for over a thousand years. The technology employed in the film is definitely a big improvement over the work done in ""The Polar Express"", and it wouldn't be an exaggeration to call ""Beowulf"" the best motion capture film ever done so far, however, Zemeckis' decision to use an extreme photorealism in the design (to the point that some actors look exactly as their real counterparts) isn't really as fortunate, as the closer the characters look to real life, the easier it gets to to spot flaws in them.Now, this is not really a problem of the cast, as while they aren't all excellent, for the most part they all make an efficient job in their roles. As the heroic and proud Beowulf, Ray Winstone is very good and makes a very human portrait of the mythic warrior, taking advantage of the fact that the script has humanized his character a bit. As his best friend Wiglaf, Brendan Gleeson shines despite the small size of his role, and he gets some of the best lines in the film. Anthony Hopkins is good as Hrothgar, but nothing really surprising, and the same could be said of Robin Wright Penn as Wealthow. However, Crispin Glover steals the show as Grendel, as he manages to deliver a poignant performance behind the his computer generated facade. Angelina Jolie is also very good in her role, although her accent wasn't really the most appropriate.With a very good cast, the best technology for computer animation and on top of that a solid script, one would think that ""Beowulf"" could be a flawless example of animated art, but sadly, something just doesn't work completely. The problem, in my opinion, is that once again Zemeckis seems to be too enamored of his technology, and in his choice of making an extremely realist animated version, he has put the animation's flaws on display to everyone. What I mean is that this search for realism brings to the spotlight a major problem: the quality of the animation doesn't look constant, as while some characters do look amazingly like the actors that play them (Grendel's mother being the most notorious), others look extremely fake (Wiglaf and Hrothgar for example), so the contrast between them is glaringly obvious, and that's really bad.And this leads to another problem, or more precisely, a question: if Zemeckis wanted such an extreme photorealism in his film, why not use real actors to do it? But despite this, ""Beowulf"" is not only an interesting experiment, if one gets over the idea that it's an animated film, one will find that behind the flashy graphics there's a powerful story, a story that has been thrilling our imagination for centuries. And still can do that and more.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Deeply poor.,"The CGI in this film is good, but CGI still has a way to go if it's to replace real-life. In fact I found the CGI characterisation a little off-putting because some of the characters were clearly supposed to be based on the actors who supplied the voices but I spent the entire film wondering who they were. In this respect I found the choice of Ray Winston for the lead role of Beowulf particularly incongruous because no matter how much CGI is applied to the process of making a film as soon as I hear that voice what I actually see on the screen isn't a muscle-bound (anti-)hero but a fat cockney: Even if Ray Winston were to have a full body transplant (which is effectively what this film gives him) I'd still see a fat cockney on the screen and I'd spend the entire time wondering where he was hiding (or trying to guess who Unferth is, only to find - to my disappointment - that it's a particularly crap attempt to render John Malkovich's face).I'd say more-or-less the same the 3D element of the film which, though a nice bonus, I found most effective in the film's quieter moments such as the shot along the pebble-beach with the longboat in the distance. All that flying through the air around and about Grendel failed to impress - if anything it just left me feeling dizzy and a little sick.So what of the adaptation? Well it's terrible, of course, because Hollywood touched it and Hollywood just can't bear to leave any story untouched by its own mutable standards. To put it bluntly: As an adaptation of Beowulf this film is clown shoes. I'd have enjoyed it more, and it would have had more artistic integrity, if Beowulf had a painted face, stick-on nose and a fright wig: At least it would have been an honest statement of intent.The nearest thing this film has to integrity (bearing in mind that Mel Gibson recently felt free enough to release a film entirely in Aramaic) is Grendel muttering some of his lines in Anglo Saxon, which would be alright were it not for the fact that no-one else in the film speaks in Anglo Saxon, so the effect of this device it to make it appear as if Grendel is speaking his own monster-language, not the same language as everyone else in the epic.In summary then: This film is a terrible adaptation, with graphics that will look dated by next year, and some awful scriptwriting. Well done lads, you've penned another hit! Hollywood Ending: OTOH if you like Hollywood action movies with a D&D twist (like Eragon & LotR) then this film is for you. You'll spend your ¬£5, you'll laugh, gurn and cry your way through the film and come out the other end of the movie sausage-machine feeling replete.And more fool you.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Imaginative, weird and lots of blood and gore.","This was a brilliantly animated movie, I wish I could have seen it in 3-D. In fact, why don't the makers start working on video games? We'd have a gaming revolution overnight! I loved the senseless blood and gore, and the wild imagination that led to the creation of the demons and the archetypal world of ancient Denmark.Also, here's a little constructive criticism: The entire movie took place either in the drinking hall or somewhere around the village. This made me feel a little claustrophobic. However, I know that animators can't create as many backdrops as they'd like too, or they'd take six years to do it.Beowulf is quite full of himself, but of course that's just part of his character. However, he seems a bit too legendary to even be considered human.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Definitely worth a watch but only at the cinema, and only for the 3D thing","Let's not beat around the bush here. This movie is good for one reason and one reason only - the jaw-dropping, unable to drag your eyes away from the screen 3D it's filmed in.The CGI is very good for the most part. The women look a bit fake but the guys are very impressive. They really seem to have facial hair thing down. The standard of acting wasn't very high although Anthony Hopkins was almost indistinguishable from his real life version and Brendan Gleeson provided some much needed comic relief as Beowulf's right hand man. The rest of them though seemed very wooden and I was unsure whether it was the animation or their voices which let them down.The only thing I found truly disappointing though was what they did with the character of Grendel's mother. As far as i'm concerned, it's just plain wrong to change such an old and epic story just to accommodate Angelina Jolie's computer animated boobs. It was silly and disrespectful to the poem although I'm sure it'll draw in the crowds, or at least the teenage boys.Acting and story-changes aside, the action is fast paced but not exhausting. It never drags or loses it's way and seriously, the 3D is very impressive, even if it does milk it a little at the beginning (lots of pointlessly traversing landscapes and people throwing things at the 'camera')In summary then it is definitely worth watching but only at the cinema, and only for the 3D thing, oh and Angelina Jolie's boobs if you're really that desperate.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
an unlikely epic blockbuster done in CGI meant for 3D; it's brutal and fun,"Robert Zemeckis and his Imagemovers team and CGI people and 'motion-capture' folks have turned out another following the Polar Express in 2004: once again the technique of a fully realized animated feature wrapped around real-actors performing only animated over. It's a little like a mix-and-match method of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, only this time with Toontown completely bleeding over LA. Speaking of bleeding over, Beowulf is not the kind of movie that will work well for the wee kiddies, the ones who maybe just have gotten a taste of Lord of the Rings; despite the PG-13, had it been animated by someone else like Ralph Bakshi, it would definitely get an R. While not on the same level of relentless video-game violence of 300, Beowulf does contend to bring in a similar contingent of an audience, while also likely alienating many who might have loved the original epic poem in the murky middle-English text. Transformed into a tale of a flawed monster killer who keeps on reminding us over and over ""I-AM-BEOWULF!"" as he ascends into a position of total power as a living legend, Roger Avary and Neil Gaiman leave it more as a director's film, making little moments of nuance and strength in the epic action-movie sort of way.To be fair, Beowulf isn't very complex, which is just as well for many of the people who will go see it. There's also not much intended humor either, albeit somewhere in the similar ballpark of unintended laughs as 300 (if, perhaps, with a slightly better filmmaker at the helm). Story: Beowulf (Winstone, who's voice is about as commanding as imaginable) is called by a Danish king (Hopkins) to slay Grendel, a man-monster living in a mountain, who comes down to demolish all the people in his path based on noise vibrations that tick him off. He does slay the beast, and when Grendel's mother finds out, she goes also on a rampage of some slaughter. When Beowulf goes to confront her, he knocks her up (and why not when it's portrayed by a consistently nude Angelina Jolie), and she bears a son (not quite) unbeknownst to him. Then his son is born as a dragon, who also as Beowulf is an old king ravages the town. Take 3!Inbetween this there isn't much else story, save for a tiff between Beowulf and Malkovich's character, and some allusions to adultery in the King's marriage to the Queen (color us shocked). The reason to watch the film isn't for it's poetry in language, anyway, but for the rip-roaring sensationalism of the piece visually, as a kind of pop-art throwback to both folklore and video-games of the present. Luckily, Zemeckis has gotten rid of the ""dead-eyes"" syndrome that plagued the Polar Express. It doesn't mean from time to time the characters come off a little wooden, even if it is behind layers and layers of silicon detail. What works best is seeing Zemeckis and his technical team make it as something of a marvel: when watching the shot where it pulls back all the way through the village, through the woods, and to the mountain and cave where Grendel groans in agony, the shot and the audio of the dissipating banging and singing in the King's hall makes as much of a stand-out as anything in Zemeckis's arsenal.Add to this the imagination in the fantasy elements: Grendel is one of the great creations in the realm of computer animation, right up there with Gollum and the new-and-improved Yoda; he's an abomination, with no skin and lots of deformities all very close up in 3-D, but there's a very real human quality to him too, tortured and retarded, led on by the (as a contrast) slick, golden, and attractive mother. Then back to the dragon in the climax, who is a combination of all three, and even if somehow the dragon doesn't quite work as well as Grendel, it comes close. As a piece of drama, it leans towards the silly and pompous, including a five-minute fight sequence where the animators avoid an R with the dreaded shot of Beowulf's crotch. As a piece of skillfully controlled work of eye-popping maneuvering, it almost completely makes up for the flaws in the material. It's a must-see in the sense that you should see it on a big screen, with the glasses, and as close as possible. How it is with flesh and blood characters is just so-so.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Beowulf, portrayed as a braggart/anti-hero/swinger.  Grendal's mom was a monster, not a hoe!","This movie sucked. The story-line was thrown out for a more ""Modern"" interpretation.

Holly Wood again made a hero--someone who is weak willed morally, promiscuous, and not creditable--without merit to begin with. So then the geniuses try and spend the rest of your time convincing you how a bad guy is really cool. In this movie Holly Wood struggled to heap some more sex in the movie Beowulf--to the point that the plot of the movie was lost in the great effort it took the perv---er--writers to spend endless hours trying to figure out how to work all that senseless hedonism into the final product: worthless movie. Holly Wood has an incredible imagination. In the book there was no sex with monsters!!!!That dragon-mead flask came from a dragon's cave (which was of no relation to Grendal's mom or Beowulf).

Disgraceful that they should call it Beowulf,"I understand that when a piece of literature is translated into a movie that changes have to be made. Indeed, considering the source material it would be understandable why the director might make significant changes. In fact, it is my opinion that movies such as this should not be a page by page copy of the original, but should by the directors own vision and interpretation of the story. It may even by OK to add to the story to bring greater depth and complexity to the characters.Overall, it doesn't matter how similar the plot is with the original poem, but how well it represents the themes of the original. Therefor, Beowulf(the movie) is probably the worst adaptation of any piece of literature ever.The Beowulf of the poem and the Beowulf of the movie have little in common when it comes to their characteristics. In many ways, this movie was a betrayal of the original. in the original, Beowulf was a role model of Anglo-Saxon society, but in this version he was responsible for the dragon and doesn't kill Grendel's mom. the themes represented in this version are nowhere to be found in the original.This movie is altogether not the story of Beowulf, it is a completely different movie. Robert Zemeckis took an entirely different story,and made some changes to make it sound like the poem probably so that it get more publicity.Disreguarding the fact that its supposedly the story of Beowulf, the story wasn't that bad, though it could use room for improvement. this would probably have been a better movie had they not been trying to make it into Beowulf. The CGI is OK, but it still doesn't beat the real thing. I would have given this a 6/10 if it wasn't for the fact that they lied by naming it Beowulf, which in my opinion dishonest and Extremely disrespectful of the poem it was ""based"" off of.Therefor its a 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"The end of motion picture, as we know it","I've heard some say that starting with the silent movies at the beginning of the last century, the motion picture has finally reached its ultimate destination, in something like ""Beowulf"". I am inclined to share this view.The bizaare merging of real life acting with animated screen presentation was fun as far as it went in ""Waking life"" (2001), particularly when it had Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy giving the craving audience another glimpse of Jesse and Celine, between ""Before sunrise"" (1995) and ""Before sunset"" (2004). But ""Waking life"" is true animation, by which I mean you see characters drawn the way they would appear in a comic book.""Beowulf"" is an entirely different kettle of fish. In this ""animation"", they try to make the characters look as if they were real. Question: if I can see the real actors, why would I want to see their computer-generated replica? A general observation of the result: the men look almost real probably because of the effect of their beard, but the women look pathetically ""plastic"" (can't think of another way to describe how they look on screen).As an animation heroic tale, ""Beowulf"" scores high. The entire story is shrouded in a gloomy Greek tragedy mood. The characters are larger than life ¬ñ tragic and flawed hero, blood-curdling and yet irresistible enchantress, lovely suffering queen, terrifying monsters, loyal comrade-in-arms. The action sequence produced by cutting edge technique is of course a visual treat. There is also excellent voice acting, particularly from Anthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone. In the end, however, I stand firm in that while I enjoy tremendously CGI action sequences, I prefer to see real actors. ""300"" is just fine but ""Beowulf"" has gone too far. But if people like Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich see a reason to lend their support to this project, what am I to say?",,Anonymous,Animation

Mediocre.,"Over the past few years I have enjoyed the progress of animated film making, PIXAR often giving the most noteworthy contribution.However, BEOWULF is a step backwards in what animated film making should be.First and foremost, the film drags. It attempts to stretch a 40-minute-or-so plot over a period of two hours, resulting in a lot of dead space where no progress in the story is made. Useless, predictable lines are uttered and shots are held out longer for ""emphasis"" in the place of quality storytelling, hallmarks of uninspired direction.Throughout most of the film, we see VERY impressive artwork--great textures, great models, great hair, skin, water etc. Some characters are better than others. The better ones not only look real, but possess a great deal of character.However, most of this cool, realistic-looking stuff doesn't MOVE right, despite the fact that a lot of the animation is motion-captured. This severely affects how characters emote throughout most of the film. What results are awkward and inexpressive performances from the virtual actors. Only a handful of shots in the film actually had heart and soul in the animation, where characters actually emote properly. Unfortunately, these were in the second half of the film.When Beowulf is put next to Ratatouille or Shrek, the difference in animation and quality of storytelling is immediately noticeable. It feels as though PIXAR and Dreamworks really care about the movement and expression of the characters and the pacing of the story. In addition, they manage to pull off better screen writing in their animations. BEOWULF pales in comparison in these regards.It's not good animation, and should be discouraged in modern film making. 5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

"""I am naked!!!""","THE way to see this film is in a digital 3D environment. It is one of those films that is enhanced when seen in the proper environment.Technically speaking, the film, seen in a digital 3D format, is awesome. There are still some work to be done in capturing a realistic gate of a horse running and here and there the movements are jerky. But all in all, this is a technological achievement.Story wise, the film is pretty good. The bravado encompassed in Beowulf's exclamation of ""I am Beowulf"" perfectly captures the essence of the character. There is an uncomfortable exhibitionism about Beowolf. He seems intent on meeting his enemies in the ""barest"" possible setting. If you can get passed Beowulf fighting ala commando, you will enjoy the story and action. The film does start out a bit shaky, but once Beowulf shows up, it picks up pace and we are transported into a fun story.There has been a lot of advances done with motion capture over the years.

An unintentionally funny film with a about average plot but very good SFX if that matters to you ...,"I just wondered when I saw this whether it was meant to be a comedy or not, but I give it that it was entertaining in a way.The story about the hero - who is obviously the title character - slays a monster Grendwald and weirdly enough talks with an unintentionally funny strong cockney accent, voiced and motion captured from Ray Winstone.The has to be one of the most sexual 12A films I've seen, so parents, you've been warned. There are moments of horror which scared a bit(but it was more bizarre or creepy really), and even if the first part was weak and I was fighting sleep, the heroic ending with our hero who redeems himself is at least worth viewing, even if it does look like something I've seen before somewhere ...Yeah, the effects are like the standard XBox 360/PS3 stuff now, and while some characters looked very real, like Anthony Hopkin's character, others were obviously computer animated, like some of the women. In other words, the tech is yet to be absolutely perfected.The music in it is quite good(I liked a few songs Robin Wright Penn sang), but I don't think this is worth money to pay to see, though, as you could be very disappointed.Overall, a big epic that suffers from some dodgy dialogue and plot but has great special effects that will probably please some in need of something that looks flashy and impressive.

S10 Review's Beowulf (2007),"Spielberg prot√©g√© Zemeckis continues his animated adventures by bringing the classic epic poem of 'Beowulf' with a script provided by Neil Gaiman (Sandman) and Roger Avery (Pulp Fiction, Killing Zoe}.Being an animation fan I couldn't wait for this one. The CGI animation keeps getting better and better. A few more generations and you may see a huge shift at the Cineplex. The invention of the 'Real D' technology helps to sell it even more with an absolutely jaw dropping experience. So jaw-dropping in fact I don't think that it will translate too well in 2D and the small screen. Being a huge Neil Gaiman fan and having loads of respect for Roger Avery I was even more interested in it but the screenplay is big on sight gags but a little weak otherwise. It may be due to the shortcomings of the source poem since I only vaguely recall reading it in school.

Just utterly, utterly unconvincing and I'm pretty good at suspending my disbelief. The vacant eyes; inaccurate mouth movements, limited facial expression, the clumsy graceless galloping of the horses. I've seen hand puppets with more emotion. As to the actors behind the faces - OK - but personally, I thought Beowulf looked more like Sean Bean. Again, visually, parts of it are a treat - but please combine real actors again with superb c-animation, like LOTR - which ticked all my boxes (although I'm still ticked off they left out Tom Bombadil and Goldberry, etc). I can't yet buy into the idea that films like this Beowulf are going to be the future. There's a place for them of course, but I prefer relating to real live actors.

Epic!,"Oh dear, some people have found out the story is not true to the poem. Not by far, actually. So what? It's a Hollywood production all right, but this entertaining movie has plenty of strong merits going for it.For instance, the fine art direction and sweet set design work in harmony with the wonderful CGI cinematography to make a brilliant gem of a picture. This animated work of art is a marvel to behold! As technology progresses, it may look slightly dated one day, but never outdated.The acting is also strong, with perfectly rounded stereotypes, though none overly shallow. Especially Beowulf is a fine character: a genuine epic hero who's actually a bragging windbag who then becomes a hero. There's lots of love, lust, friendship, machismo, pride, greed, glory and opportunism going on, just as you like it!The language used strikes a perfect balance between general accessibility and a genuine Old Germanic feel. There's even some dead language used by Grendel. I would not know for sure how accurate it is, but since the audience can follow it, this really adds a lot. Again, well done! Some may consider the plot a bit too typical for modern age Hollywood movies, but still the story holds up pretty well and stays interesting to the end.In sum: mighty fine high-tech entertainment based on the epic poem.

"Well, it certainly looks nice","Here we have a film which is a triumph of animation. Unfortunately it is not a triumph of storytelling. The animation is so good, often eerily lifelike, that it is almost worth seeing the film for that reason alone. But be forewarned that in order to see all the impressive visuals you're going to have to sit through a story which fails to engage. And if you're a Beowulf purist, because I'm sure there is such a thing, be prepared to be disappointed as this film version of the story strays in very significant ways from the original text. I suppose it's understandable that the filmmakers would find it necessary to jazz up such an ancient story for a modern audience. But so many of the changes seem pointless and any attempt to liven things up seems to have failed because, at least as it is presented in this film, the story of Beowulf is a rather dull one. All the eye-catching animation can't hide the fact that this story really drags.Despite the failings of the story, it must be said that there are some fine performances in this film, although seeing as the actors are not actually ""there"" on the screen, it's a whole different kind of performance than we're used to. But the king Hrothgar sure looks and sounds like Anthony Hopkins, now doesn't he? And hey, isn't that Brendan Gleeson? And Robin Wright Penn? And Angelina Jolie, only all painted up gold and with high-heeled feet? Hopkins and Gleeson and all the others do a fine job of bringing their not-quite-real versions of themselves to life. As Beowulf himself, Ray Winstone may look less like himself than the others but his performance is fine as well. And a special mention for Crispin Glover, who I am fairly certain is not in fact a giant, hideous monster in real life but who here does a good job giving some life and personality to the monster Grendel. But still, despite the impressive cast and the impressive way that cast is brought to animated life, the film really doesn't work. The story fails to take off and for much too much of the time we're left just biding time until the next admittedly visually stunning battle scene. For all the obvious effort that went into the animation you'll end up wishing a little more attention had been paid to the story itself. The story is where this movie fails.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantastic !,"There are some movies that just deserve the word FANTASTIC. For Beowulf, that's just not enough. Maybe one of it's many synonyms: ""Unbelievably Great"".I saw the movie last night and, being in Bucharest, the only way to watch it is 2D. I was kind of disappointed that there's no IMAX 3D cinema in my country, but I went to see the movie anyway. And it was worth it. Beowulf is the best animation I've seen, and I am a big fan of this genre. It has the depth of a real life drama and the greatness of an epic poem. Some people complain it doesn't resemble so much to the original Beowulf poem. I've seen some people that even gave this movie the minimum rating just because of that. But I see it as an adaptation. It wants to be much more than an animated version of an epic story. That has been already done and undone. The story is flawless, the cameras are fantastic, and the CGI is the best of today. Comparing Beowulf to other animated movies, it has a huge advantage over them. It has real actors . It's not only the voices. The graphics are so good, you can actually see emotions on the character's faces. Their eyes show fear, courage, lust and deception. It's remarkable how you could tell by the animated hero's eyes that he's not telling the truth.There is no point in saying how perfect Ray Winstone ,Sir Anthony Hopkins or any other actor in this movie plays his/hers part. They are , as always, extraordinary and this movie lets them shine.The only downside of this movie is Angelina's accent, witch creep-ed me out in Alexander and now it's back to haunt me. But that's just not enough to scare the perfect 10 this movie deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is the beginning of a new era in Cinema!,"OK, let me start by saying that I knew nothing of the Beowolf poem/legend, etc. going in. From reading the reviews here, I guess that was a good thing. Most fans of the story are not liking this adaptation.But from a simply cinematic position, this movie is stunning! The story (and I won't go into it here, enough of the others will fill you in) is just so,so. Ordinary, shallow dialog that's often hard to understand. The performances are fine, but then they are basically CGI/animated, so what can you expect. The facial expressions and movements are stiff and the eyes, although better than Polar Express, are still lifeless.But again, the visuals are stunning. The 3D version is the ONLY one to watch. I think those who have panned this movie so badly must have seen it in 2D. I can't even imagine how boring and flat that must have been. The movie is always and only about the new 3D. This is the first (not really the first, but the first in wide spread normal theaters that have been updated with new digital screens and projectors) in what I think will be a steady staple of great 3D pictures in the future. (one of the previews was for the first-ever live action 3D... coming soon... looks great!). In the first few scenes there's a bit too much of things coming at you as the director is showing off his new toy, but then the movie settles in for a great cinematic visual experience. It's actually so good, that there are few things that really stick in your mind as you leave the theater. It all is visually stunning, not just a scene or 2. The ""RealD"" 3D glasses are much better than the old style, yet not up to Imax quality yet. And they have a tendency to make the entire film seem too dark ( a few times I peeked above the glasses and it was far brighter) but overall it was very enjoyable to watch. Angelina looks especially good naked and in 3D! As I said, the movie is just so so for acting, story and dialog. But it gives us a glimpse into the future of the 3D cinematic experience that is coming. Within the next few years, something will come along completing the rest of the equation and we will see a movie that is stunning in every aspect in this amazing new format.7 out of 10 for the pioneering of a relatively new format!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Contrived story and very bad graphics,"This film is about a hero called Beowulf in ancient Denmark, who kills monsters that plague the kingdom.I was hugely disappointed with the animation. Many scenes are so badly faked that they hurt my eyes. For example, the scene where a soldier challenges the old Beowulf on the beach, the whole scene is so fake that it looks as if it is lifted off a badly animated video game. Lighting is bad and uniform, movements are unconvincing and faces look like plastic mannequins.The bad animation already turns me off. It is not helped by the ultra simple story line. Many scenes are laughably contrived, such as John Malkovich's character challenging Beowulf and then makes up.Or old Beowulf's girl begging Beowulf not to go, and the girl runs away after Beowulf refuses.People say ""Beowulf"" is visually fantastic and fascinating. My friends were thrilled about the film, but I did not feel the same way.",,Anonymous,Animation
Entertaining...nothing more.,"We've all heard about the stunning visual stimuli: the motion-capture effects used in Zemeckis' 2004 adaptation of the child book favorite, The Polar Express; we've, too, heard and seen plenty of Angelina Jolie's sensual portrayal of the hunted monster's mother; and we've all certainly¬óor at least hopefully¬óheard of the tale itself: the sweeping, grand Old English epic of Beowulf, the demon slayer who tore through foes like he ripped through Grendel, ever-slowly luring him towards a fateful end. However, what you might not know is that the praised visuals in Beowulf are no more impressive than that of a next-generation video game console, that Angelina Jolie's screen-time is minimal (lesser even than in the text from which the screenplay was adapted), and that, though Gaiman and Avery's adaptation is fair for a 3D-intended blockbuster spectacle, it lacks what made the historic poem so true: the sullenness of the main character, who hid behind a fa√ßade of heroism and prestige, only to be poisoned by his own secrecy and hollowness, and the knowledge that his glory came birthed from the lies he'd told. Don't get me wrong, Beowulf is entertaining¬ópretty darn entertaining, in fact¬óand contains enough blood and eroticism to gratify a young boy's lust for such things, but its aspirations seem to end there. What could have been a condensed LOTR-esquire experience falls far short of anything close, and ends up where our supposed hero did, lost between what it tries to be and what it actually is.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This is not Sparta,"Robert Zemeckis clearly wasn't paying attention the last time Hollywood tried to make 3D films, otherwise he'd have been party to forgettable trash like Friday the 13th 3D or the third Jaws movie and most likely, decided to dismiss it and release Beowulf as a regular film. Regardless of how good you might consider the finished product, sitting in a theatre watching it makes you realise how tacky the 3D gimmick is. Bodily fluids and weapons do not fly out of the screen at the audience, the only thing it adds is a degree of depth perception to the crowd scenes and a decrease in picture quality, where weapon edges are blurry and the screen isn't entirely in focus. Shame really, as a film, Beowulf is quite decent. It's not a masterpiece and there's bound to be a few purists out there driven to fury seeing a classic piece of literary prose turned into a silly piece of pop trash, but it's still quite fun in places. It's also got more brains than you might first realise.The main reason behind this is that Zemeckis hasn't gone for a straight adaptation. The core story of Beowulf fighting a string of monsters one after the other is still there, but the central hero isn't the infallible stalwart he was in the fifth century. Here, Beowulf's mouth is as big as his biceps, his ego is so massive it casts a shadow and the story is as much about the creation of his myth as it is about fist fights with cave trolls. He's also an incredibly randy sod who finds it difficult to turn women down, which gets him into all manner of hot water throughout the course of the film.Aside from the frustrating 3D meanwhile, Beowulf's biggest selling point is the motion capture animation and in close ups, it's remarkably impressive. Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and Brendan Gleeson look fantastic, the detail so startling it's occasionally difficult to tell that it's not the real thing. When the camera pans out however, the cracks begin to appear. The extras are bland and ill-defined and in some cases look no better than extended cut scenes from Playstation 2 games. Thankfully, the characters still sparkle with warmth and emotion, but it's not a major leap forward by any means.If there's one place where Beowulf shines though, it's the action scenes. Grendel's initial beer hall rampage is a bit dizzying, but the rest is fantastic to behold. Beowulf's flashback tussle with a pack of ravenous sea monsters is the first high point as he butchers his slippery foes in a series of ingenious ways, turning the sea crimson in a ludicrously macho five minute sequence that gets the adrenaline pumping in time for his naked rumble with Grendel. These are merely the warm up bouts however and his main event battle with a giant, golden dragon is a riot; serpent and Dane spilling down a mountain, crashing through forests, battling on bridges, plunging into the ocean and kicking seven bells out of each other in a jaw dropping brawl that should satisfy any action junkie's fix.Thanks to the delirious violence and overtly macho storyline, Beowulf is perhaps the first film to benefit from 300's success earlier this year but sadly, it isn't as good as the Frank Miller movie. The central premise of a man making his own myth is surprisingly clever and the action scenes are a blast, but it's just not as instantly memorable. It's a fun way to spend a night out, especially if you psyche yourself up by listening to Viking metal like Turisas, Amon Amarth and Finntroll beforehand, but a fun night out is all it is. Fifteen hundred years from now, it's a safe bet that this version will be entirely forgotten while academics still write dissertations on the poem. Go and watch it for the blood, the thunder and the popcorn, but don't expect to witness the future of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
It's all about the sensory overload,"The success of ""300"" and ""Apocalypto"" no doubt have set the stage for violent setpieces set during ancient history, where visual resplendence that cater to testosterone-bearing members of the audience are preferred to a richer narrative. The latest in line is Robert Zemeckis' ""Beowulf"".Ray Wintstone plays the eponymous character, who travels the high seas to answer the call of the drunk King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins): to slay the demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), who has been terrorizing the town of Heorot. Beowulf does so but incurs the wrath of the demon's mother (Angelina Jolie), who in turns seduces him into a curse that befell generations of leaders.Written for the screen by fantasy novel/comic book whiz Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary (""Pulp Fiction""), the film employs the same motion-capture 3-D animation he used in ""Polar Express"". Consequently, this retelling of an Old English epic is no doubt a sensory overload. The renderings are photorealistic, and the fight scenes are exhilarating. But at the course of its length, it all becomes tiresome with its source's themes relegated to the backseat in order for Zemeckis to suit it to modern viewers.The same can be said of Zack Snyder's and Mel Gibson's previously mentioned works; but whereas those films managed to keep the viewer engaged through its action scenes, ""Beowulf"" doesn't. And in all its visual splendor, ""Beowulf"" also lacks stronger characters that would elevate it to the level of the film's technical breakthroughs. It's at once exhilarating yet exhausting.The climactic battle scene (which in itself is an incentive to see the movie in IMAX) punctuates a two-hour exposition that lacks a thematic depth. It's not unlike one of those extended cutscenes in RPGs that seem to go on forever and ever, making you wonder when gameplay would start again.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Despite all the hate, this is a very good movie","Hearing all the hate for this movie, not just from this site but from my friends also, I placed this movie on the end of my ''watch list'', and as a result, forgot about it completely. All I knew is, and I quote my friends here - that the movie was supposed to be a ''weird mix of Lord of the rings and Shrek, not quite a movie and not quite a cartoon either'', and as a result I didn't even see it in the cinema, instead going to watch ''I am Legend'' and ''Transformers'', and man, was that a mistake!So there was this one night where I had absolutely nothing to do, I just watched all the movies available, including a mediocre horror ''The hills have eyes'' and listing all the movies I had available, I came upon this one. I said to myself - hell, I can think of a worst way to spend this evening, and decided to grab a bowl of popcorn and turned on the movie.Several minutes in I noticed that it's not a real movie, but rather a detailed animated feature film, however as the movie went on I completely forgot about it as I enjoyed one of the more epic fantasy movies I have seen in recent years - and I've seen quite a lot.While not really true to the poem, and not fit to stand next to really epic fantasy movies like the Lord of the rings, this gem had enough action and fantasy to keep me at the edge of my seat. And not to mention that I cursed my friends that we didn't go and watch the cinema release of the movie, opting for the mediocre ''I am Legend'' instead...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Appalling,"Digital ""motion capture"" Beowulf looks more like a computer game than a movie. Anthony Hopkins's Welsh voice evidently proved infectious for the rest of the cast who turn the Anglo-Saxon epic, set in 7th century Denmark, into a succession of sub Under Milk Wood accents. Ray Winstone fights various battles stark naked, his naughty bits strategically masked in many imaginative ways. Angelina Jolie plays Grendel's Mother as a nude she-devil in high heels. Her phallic tail fails to frighten the audience. Her lack of nipples is slightly more disturbing. Laughable script is perfectly matched by crashing over the top score & power ballad. This makes Jackson's Lord of the Rings look like King Lear.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"A fun, if shallow experience","As a normal film, Beowulf clumsily falls downward due to the paper-thin script. But as a 3D IMAX experience, the violent, eye-popping work transcends it's simplistic tale to offer viewers a visually immersed experience unlikely to be rivaled until we see some more 3D-intensive work to be released in the next few years. Never mind a few unintentionally funny moments and some questionable pacing during it's midsection.

If you want to see a film that aspires to the same aesthetic as Beowulf, go and buy a ticket for Stardust. Robin Wright Penn's acting is stiff and unpolished - anguishing to watch. Granted, the actors tried their best in the confines of a sub-par script. Truly, every moment of this film is a computer-generated, paint-by-numbers formula-epic-drama that is not worth your time. I only went to see it because in Thailand they are allowed to buy out the box-office and it was playing in five of the eight screens in the biggest movie theatre in Chiang Mai.

Don't be put off because someone tells you the CGI is not up to human-realistic standard. It doesn't matter. For what is essentially a cartoon, the acting is excellent and CGI is the only way to tell this fantasy. Despite their wooden body movement, some of these avatars act more animated, more human-like than the lead actor(s) in Harry Potter.

Epic in the right context,"I was fortunate enough to see this in cinema, however I don't think I would somehow spend 20 pounds on the DVD when it became available. Yes the film loosely follows the manuscript, however it fails to provide the sense of 'superlativity' that the poem was intended to provide. I digress, the film itself is one of those epics that will be remembered, it is in the ranks with 300, Ben Hur, Star Wars, LOTR and the likes of. However the animation is comparable to Shrek and the story line is comparable. Yes, it follows the path of a great warrior and yes it shows the traditional struggle of triumph over evil, but it's just too cheesy don't you think? The amount of angloisms (British based words and terminology such as 'bollocks' and 'wanks') leaves any non-British audience feeling slightly flummoxed, and the timescale from Beowulf as a young warrior to an aged king is immediate, which is not the way in which the original Old English Manuscript intended but also confusing to any audience. There is no doubt that Ray Winston, Brendon Gleeson and Anthony Hopkins performances were at their best throughout the entirety of the movie yet it lacks in that certain quality feel that will rank it highly amongst the greats of the 21st century. To the average audience such as myself when I first saw it, yes! this movie is great, full of action, swears, boobs and violence, yet to capture the true ideas of the poem written 1000 years ago, i feel it cheapens the memory of not only scribes and 'bards' of the era, but also its inhabitants. Yeah OK a good film all in all, very entertaining, but not wholly accurate and not wholly pleasing, decide for yourself.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Good actors put to wasteThe story is Beowulf and his men are summoned to protect a Nordic kingdom from a psychotic monster, Grendel. He makes goo goo eyes with the queen and she trembles at the sight of his bare chest and arms (she's not alone) and Grendel's mother comes for revenge in the form of the sexy Angelina Jolie.Trust me it's not worth it but Beowulf himself is a certified hottie for a computer animated character.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
A true fantasy movie - at last!,"For fans of CGI and fantasy, your dreams have finally come true. I have been a huge fan of the fantasy genre since I read my first fantasy book in back in 1990 (it was David Eddings ""Belgariad"" series). Since then I've read Raymond Feist, David Gemmell, Robert Jorden, Terry Goodkind - the list goes on. Each time I go to the cinema and see ""Dungeons and Dragons"" or ""Eragon"" I feel cheated, because the movie never comes close to the images I have in my head of a fantasy realm. Beowulf, like Lord of the Rings, changed that for me.Without giving any details away, the atmosphere in Beowulf is exactly like the CGI rendered cut scenes for a lot of great Fantasy computer games. If you like watching the opening scenes for games like World of Warcraft or EverQuest II, then you will appreciate the beauty of this movie. At times it feels like you're looking at the real thing, most notably Angelina Jolie's face in most of her scenes or Brendan Gleeson towards the end of the movie.I saw this movie in 2D and was extremely impressed by it, more so for the fast heavy beats (the music is awesome) that vibrated throughout the cinema and the excellent dialog that Beowulf delivers. I went back to see it in 3D two days later because I couldn't get it out of my mind - if you're able to watch this in 3D, it is far superior to the 2D version.I watch a lot of movies, almost 1 a day and I very rarely watch the same thing twice.

Quite Entertaining,"When I go to see the movie I was bored and have no expectation of this movie at all, the trailer didn‚Äôt even look that convincing.

That is when our hero came in ‚Äì Beowulf.I have never read the books before so I will go by the story of what I see in the movie. The whole movie was much more entertaining than I thought it would be, maybe because I have no expectation like the others who also went to see it. I must say that extra money that they charge me for the 3D thing was worth it, the outcome, the animation and everything was breathtaking. It was crystal clear. They even gave the preview the different between 3D and non 3D.I thought the whole story was pretty OK, nothing great or memorable, seem like they put more energy in the making of this movie into 3D than the great storyline. The story is not that well distributed and here and there can be a little bit boring. The character is quite shallow and the dialogue in this movie was way too little. And there is so much gore that seems quite unnecessary.The good outcome was I don‚Äôt really get border by the fact that this movie is CGI like I felt as I watch The Polar Express; this one felt more like a normal movie. As I said before this movie seem to only concentrated a lot on making it a lifelike as possible so tried to watch it in a highly enhance Digital Cinema like I did and you will felt quite impressive at the new technology that everything look so clear and real.Overall it was a fun flick, don‚Äôt expect that good of the story but tried to look at that awesomely done CGI.Recommendation: Should At least Watch It Once.Reason to Watch: The Future of Film Making!!!!

Of course their accents sucked but I didn't care as long as the movie got better.Then here comes Beowulf, the first true hero. They make him look like a jackass right from the start. My heart starts sinking. About an hour into the movie, nothing changing, the script keeps pointing out imaginary flaws in the character Beowulf, then the movie just plunges, completely flies off track that the original story was on.The rest of the movie I sat in agony as I watched one the greatest literary masterpieces get butchered, again and again. Beowulf in the end did't seem to end up a hero like he should of been. The movie gave him too many flaws. It seemed he was more of a martyr.. and for nothing too. Butchered story, butchered character.The only character that I truly thought they did well with, was Grendel, and the way Glover showed his plight, and made you feel Grendels pain... but come on, this movie was not Beowulf.Guess I have to wait again till I find a truly good version of Beowulf.

Great job guys,"I saw this when it came out and didn't like it. Many years later after reading Eaters of the Dead, I became very interested in Vikings and read a bunch of books, including Beowulf and watched any movie or show I could get my hands on. So I decided to revisit this one and really enjoyed it.I think we all read Beowulf in high school. I've read it a few times since then and of course since knowing about Viking culture I understand the story more. I think the first time I watched this I didn't like the changes in the last half. But this time I really liked it.It's a faithful adaption and takes a new approach to make it a well rounded story. Bacause the poem isn't. Just like all the Viking sagas. They tell a story and they're not well rounded, they are stories documenting what happened. Main characters change left and right, hundreds of years go by, they don't use the story structure that we're used to. So I applaud their effort to make this a cohesive story. They were able to take it and make Beowulf a tragic character. In short they made it their own.Daniel McCoy author of ""The Viking Spirit"" said something to the effect of the way to keep these stories alive is to keep telling them and keep updating them. The writers understood the story and made acceptable changes.Of course they kind of change Viking culture a little bit to fit into what modern audiences think of as medieval times. That's okay. Little things like that don't ruin all the good they they did. These are just minor details.They were able to keep the story mythology which I liked. It stayed true to the poem. The modern approach to these old stories is to find the reality in them. And Michael Chrichton did that in Eaters of the Dead. But i really liked that they expanded the story and kept the spirit alive.I'm not a fan of this digital style. For me it's ""what's the point?"" It looks real but looks animated. It's animated but looks real. Just pick one. But I get it, Robert Zemeckis is an innovative guy. He tries new things. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. The constant ""bullet time"" shots can be confusing at times because you're zooming all over the place and it can be disorienting.If you were like me and didn't like this at first or at apprehensive about watching it at all, I think it's worth a watch. It's well made, well written, exciting and full of adventure.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Definitely worth it--if only for the technology,"After seeing the trailer for Beowulf, I decided I had no interest in seeing the film. However, after the screening last night, in 3-D at an IMAX theater, I'm glad I did. Other than the character names, places and objects, and some of the sequences that take place, the film is nothing like the epic poem. In fact, the underlying premise of the entire movie is completely made up and found no where in the poem. It's certainly sexed up and modernized, Hollywood style, to make it more accessible. And while I think it works well for the film, I certainly hope no ninth grader deems it a substitute for reading the actual epic. I actually pulled a copy myself from my library to re-read.But who really cares about the poem, right? Haha, I jest! The story's the same as all the trumped up warrior movies of late (compare ""I...Am...BEOWULF!"" with ""This...Is...SPARTA!""): heroic, sexy, hedonistic and violent. The monster Grendel is a foul ravaging, pus-ridden beast who towers over men with ease and rips their heads off like twigs. Liberties were taken, however, to make him also meek and hesitant, and clearly existentially bewildered. This gives the character soul and compels the viewer to find humanity in the creature. I really liked Grendel's mother, I must admit, even though creative license took her far beyond the original character in the poem. The cartoon version of Angelina Jolie arouses just as well, if not better, than the real thing (I could have lived without the high heels though). If I were Brad Pitt, I'd be quite jealous of cartoon Ray Winstone! It's a cool movie and definitely worth watching, but more so because of the technology, and less so about the story. You've got swords and blood and waves and stones and spears and beasts all coming at you at once! It's like you're in this foreign world battling right along with our hero! Alright, it's not that impressive, but it's certainly worth a movie ticket to check it out. I really can't say for sure how I'd feel about the film if I'd seen it in traditional two dimensional style on a normal movie screen... But then again, I'm not reviewing that experience, now am I?",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Worst ever,"This was absolutely the worst adaptation of any story ever in the history of man. I urge you not to waste your time on this piece of garbage. From the horrible accents to the inaccuracies in the story line, this filth takes low to a new level. I watched it for free on Netflix and STILL want my money back. The animation was pretty, but that's about the only redeeming quality of the movie. If there was an option to give a negative score, this would be the movie for it. I don't think the English language has enough negative adjectives to describe the awfulness of this movie, and I wish someone had warned me before I watched it. at no point in this movie did I feel I received any entertainment value. I award it no points and may God have mercy on your soul should you decide to watch it after reading this review.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliantly bloody visuals do not automatically mean an amazing movie,"Beowulf.Everyone, or most people at least, remember encountering it in a high school English class. A lot remember the main story, and some, like me, slept right through most of the readings, and cannot fathom any idea about the story other than recalling the fight between the heroic Beowulf and the monster Grendel.So in a way, it really does not help my case that the new film, tinkers and reinvents the legendary poem into something a little clearer and more tangible. While the key events are present within the film, it does change quite a few things within the mythical poem, but does stay fairly within the realm of the idea of what happens to Beowulf (Ray Winstone) after he fights Grendel (Crispin Glover).Looking beyond the fact that the film is based on material written originally in Old English, the film stands out as a bit of a mishmash of ideas and concepts based in the initial text, but also based around the style of epic film-making. For one, it really brings a sense of age to the screen. The viewer can easily get a sense of similarity between this film and the likes of The Lord of the Rings, Gladiator, even the recent 300. It just does not feel entirely fresh in the aspect of it staying within the ancient European epic genre. It also falters in the dialogue. It frequently shifts between using Old English style wordings, to normal modern wordings, to just throwing in random pieces of comedy for no reason (and sequences designed specifically to incite laughter alongside them). The material is clearly brooding with darkness and cynicism, was there really a reason to make light jokes at the expense of the kids watching it? Do the majority ruling adults have no say? It jumps around for the entirety of the running time in this manner, and at times, becomes downright bothersome (hell, Grendel only speaks in Old English).There has been plenty of publicity about Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary's long road to getting the film made, and it really brings to light the reasoning behind the ill-placed light hearted sequences. It just does not feel like it is a fully cohesive piece. The tone is never steady, and if it is not trying to catch some laughs, the dialogue comes off at times as being ridiculously overacted and silly. How can anyone assume they are in for a hell of ride if you cannot even get past some of the horrible deliveries? Continuing on that same idea, the characters themselves are not much better. With the exception of Beowulf, Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and maybe Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), none of the characters are fully described or are even given some sort of backstory. We are subjected to this over and over, and never does it seem like the film is making a genuine attempt at even trying to cloak the idea that the characters are written so poorly. Some are given small doses of influence and motivation (like Grendel and even Unferth (John Malkovich)), but even then the characters seem very grounded in their ideas and style. It even gets to the point that when they talk, they just bring the entire movie down into sheer boredom (even with the stunning credit list of supporting actors). Incite and intrigue seemed to be the last thing on anyone's mind when they were actually creating the film. For the most part, the actors do look like they are trying, it just does not look like they are doing too much.Winstone, as the lead, is a lot like the tone and design of the writing on the film. He truly shows off his talents as an actor in one scene, and then wavers into an uncontrollable mess of a character in the next. There is no balance whatsoever when he appears on screen in these scenes, and it brings to mind the question of how a true hero really should act. Winstone nails the lines, and the body language, but he just does not have the zest to carry the film in the direction it needs to go.What does carry are the visuals. Absolutely immaculate in their design and near flawless, these are some of the best CGI scenes ever put to celluloid. By using motion capture technology, director Robert Zemeckis and his crew have put together characters that look, move and sound like the real thing. You can see the shade in all of the characters (and mythical creatures) that suggests that they are animated, but every other moment it is a bit more difficult to notice that the actors are animated.. The most minuscule physical details are corrected meticulously for every character, even the disgustingly deformed Grendel (who looks astonishingly realistic, and may just be the ticket to an Oscar come February). Just examining the beard Beowulf has exhibits millions of tiny hairs and blazingly realistic wrinkles. No CGI character (save for Gollum, Kong and Jar Jar) has ever been so completely and minutely realistic as the characters are in this film. I just wish liquids looked nearly as good as the actors and the backgrounds.What is also interesting is the aging and weight loss given during the film. Winstone is a big guy, but you would never know because he is rather chiselled and athletic in this movie. And when he ages by fifty years, you can see no difference in the character other than the age. It is absolutely awestriking to watch and if for any reason to see the movie immediately, it would be that.The film is not perfect by any means, but Beowulf is a valiant try at capturing an epic poem that is practically untranslatable. See it for the visuals, not the incomplete story.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fairly Surprised,"I was not planning on seeing the movie but won tickets to see a screening in 3D. I was expecting a flop but was surprised to see the movie did the story justice. They kept the movie flowing well and did a good job at adding comic relief. The action scenes were very well done. Many movies nowadays are so close to the action you cant tell what is going on. There are a few moments when you first met Grendel that were close but I think it was just to draw out his entrance. This movie stayed far enough away to keep the immediate area in view which I prefer. The computer generation seems very ""Shrekish"" to me.I probably wouldn't see it again and I may have given it a lower score if it weren't in 3D.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Special effects and stuff,"This was a slightly over-long movie, with too many slow spots in between. However, I'm glad I went to see it in IMAX 3D, as it heightened the enjoyment, above what it normally would've been. I'd highly suggest you see it in 3D too, rather than in the normal version.One thing I was surprised to find out was that this was a completely animated movie, and not a live action movie with special effects. That's because the characters in the movie all mostly looked like the actors who were just playing their voices. Anthony Hopkins looked like Anthony Hopkins, Brendan Gleeson looked like Brendan Gleeson, and of course Angelina Jolie looked like Angelina Jolie (most of the time). So when I saw the trailers, I just assumed it was just live action. It was an interesting choice to make the characters look like their voice actors who we're all familiar with.However, that's not to say that it was perfect. I found the characters' expressions were lifeless. I wish they had put some scanners on the voice actor's faces and replicated them to their animated character's faces. This is a problem with a lot of animated movies trying for authenticity -- they just never get the facial expressions right, for example the Final Fantasy movie. It isn't such a problem with a character based on Angelina Jolie, who has relatively few facial expressions, but it was a problem for the Anthony Hopkins character (King Hrothgar), the Ray Winstone character (Beowulf), and especially Robin Wright Penn's character (Wealthow). Wealthow looked like a marionette throughout the movie with almost no expressions on her character's face. Also, in some scenes the Angelina Jolie character looked like her (almost too perfectly, her animated body was much curvier than her real life body), but in other scenes it didn't look like her at all. It doesn't look like they paid attention to quality control throughout the whole movie.Also a warning about the 3D effects. It is somewhat headache inducing. The movie looks 3D alright, but mainly like the flattened 3D like what you would see inside a Viewmaster stereoscope. Foreground objects pass in front of background objects like you would expect in 3D, but the foreground objects look like 2D cardboard cutouts; there is no depth to the foreground objects themselves. I hope some future 3D technology takes care of this annoyance.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf is an epic of a movie as epic of a poem,"So we've all read Beowulf in school at some point, and whether you loved it or hated it I think we can all agree it was given to us to read for its historical significance. It is the definitive hero's tale that is just as importantly about its anonym...(read more)ous authorship as its classic action/adventure arch-typical story. The fact that it is author-less gives strong support it is a myth that has echoed through the ages and passed on through oral tradition. In this way Beowulf is held sacred for its straightforward and rudimentary mythology, not for having an elaborate plot.The movie holds onto this logic, yet drastically improves on it, and if I seem like I am gloating, it's because I am; this movie is great. Although I strongly recommend seeing this movie in IMAX 3D, its overall impact should serve the same in a regular theater (just not in 3D). Now it seems that there are two major arguments against the film; 1) the complete and exclusive reliance on CGI. 2) The adaptation and deviation from the poem. I can strongly say the CGI doesn't for a second take anything away from the film, and if anything it gains momentum from it. Robert Zemeckis's action sequences are breathtaking, and perfectly fitting for the epic nature of the story, and although I am in no way an advocate for entirely CGI films (""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" anyone?), it seems this time they really did get it right.The adaptation from epic poem to epic film was no different, and Beowulf the film was going to need a stronger narrative backbone to work, which thankfully the script successfully gave it. The problem of course is when you have a story as prolific as Beowulf there will always be purists and literary historians that expect it to stay loyal to its origins. However what writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery had done was provide a new emotional depth and a stronger moralistic center that the original Beowulf had only hinted at. The major themes in Beowulf have always been about pride and reputation, and the ability to rise above them. These were problems Beowulf discreetly dealt with in the original poem, but in the movie everything is extremely focused around them. In doing so Gaiman and Avery deemed it necessary to change Beowulf persona from fearless hero, to flawed boaster, who although is still heroic, is now exclusively ruled by pride and recognition. This also changed the role of Beowulf three villains, who instead of being basic foes become metaphoric specters of a hero's heavy conscious. Every change made was done with delicacy and appreciation for the original tale, and I applaud Gaiman's and Avery's writing depth and ability.However what is most important to note about the films CGI and deviated narrative structure is it carries on the oral tradition that supposedly birthed Beowulf in the first place. If it really is true that Beowulf was passed on orally from generation to generation as all ancient myth's had, then Gaiman and Avery script is just another addition to the extension of this tradition, and the CGI was another way of emphasizing the epic proportions that once could only be imagined through spoken word. This movie not only succeeds in doing this, but does so in gigantic strides. It is a great achievement, and a milestone in our tradition of inspired moralistic storytelling.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Without the gimmicks - decent, but still dry.","The all-CGI, 3D release Beowulf kicks off the holiday fantasy season with a bang. What other force on earth can draw together English Lit majors and frat boys gawking at Angelina Jolie's naked boobs? Everyone's anxious to see the spectacle of an all-CGI movie. We've been disappointed in the past, but we're still hopeful. We love the shinies, oh yes we do. From the previews, we all know the movie looks stunning. But does the story hold its own? More or less. I enjoyed it more than the book, at least.Beowulf is an ancient English tale about a boastful warrior (Beowulf) who vows to save a small Danish kingdom from Grendel - a man-eating troll. Through the course of the movie, we learn why the kingdom has been cursed, and what other evils lie in store for those who are brave enough to face them. The new screenplay adds some interpretations and irony onto the original poem, turning this from a hack-n-slash tale of trials into a story more suitable to hold our attention spans for two hours of visuals.Please don't bring your children to this movie. If you've never read Beowulf or aren't familiar with ancient literature, then you may not know that these stories are usually very violent. Though you may equate animation with cartoons, this is not a kids movie, and unless you have no problems letting your children watch Beowulf hack various parts off grotesque and disfigured demons, do us all a favor and hire a babysitter.The film doesn't attain Apocalypto-like levels of violence, but enough to push the envelope. If you're a fantasy action enthusiast, you'll love the epic battles. Grendel bursts into the hall and picks up every nearby human, crashes them to the ground, uses humans to beat on other humans, and tears people in half. A very impressive dragon makes an appearance in the last act of the movie, and Beowulf fights on his back, hacking at his wings and fiery throat as the dragon proceeds to destroy half the Danish city. Yay, dragons! We never see Mommy's true form, but it's hinted at in her reflections, and in point-of-view shots with her tentacles caressing Grendel, her monstrous son.The graphics are beautiful. Most of the people look like people, Ms. Jolie among them. The 3D affects were a constant delight to many of the moviegoers, who constantly OOHed and AHHed at the tips of spears protruding towards the camera, pebbles flying up into their faces as horses ran a cobbled road, and deep, snowy landscapes wooshing into view. For all the awe-inspiring graphics, there are still plenty of problems in rendering the characters. Queen Wealthow was so meek and withdrawn in her body language that she looked like a cartoon. Many of the movements in action sequences were too fast or too smooth to look natural. And the movie seemed to use two lighting schemes only - dark shadows cast by glowing fires indoors, or stark, monochromatic winter landscapes. But the graphics do their job rather well, because after awhile, you forget about the 3D goodies and CGI humans until the next 3D trick comes at you. I don't like the gimmick, but I think that CGI has the potential to be the best format for fantasy movies. Supernatural elements are better immersed in a CGI movie than they are in a live-action film that adds CGI afterwords.For those wanting to see Angelina as her creator made her, you might want to stay home and watch the Apple trailer, because the trailer has almost all of her nude scenes in the movie. In fact, there are more naked men in the movie than there are women. Beowulf strips down and fights Grendel bare, and King Hrothgar is frequently derobing while drunk. I appreciate the equal opportunity, but I'm not really a fan of fanservice. I'm even less of a fan of being in a theatre with fans of fanservice.The story and acting could have made this movie fantastic, but fell short. I appreciate the updated take on Beowulf and the added irony, but there's a lack of affection for most of the characters. Beowulf is a generic hero - we get a hint of his boastfulness and heroic spirit, but he's mostly lost in the action and constantly shouting his own name in an annoying fashion, a-la ""this is SPARTA!"" We get the sense that King Hrothgar isn't as foolhardy as he initially seems, but only in glimpses towards the end of the movie. Queen Wealthow is a vision of loveliness, but doesn't say much and acts out even less - most of her time is spent casting worried glances. Grendel cries in a very congested human voice, which some may find disconcerting but others will find out of place.The best performances in the movie go to John Malkovich as Unferth and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother. John Malkovich's role might have been tailor made for him. Unferth is neither good nor bad, a little smarmy, very arrogant but dynamic, and can admit to his own faults. The dialog and Malkovich's delivery stand out as the voice of intellect in the movie, where all the rest of the men grumble in a forgettable, standard half-brogue. Grendel's Mother also has some notable speeches, dangerously low-pitched and slithering with lithe consonants. The desired effect may have been creepy and a little sexy, but wound up the other way around - no one minds.Do shell out some extra for those 3D glasses if you're a graphics freak. Don't go if you're expecting to find something to put next to your Lord of the Rings DVDs. Beowulf is in many ways still the same dry meal you had in your high school English curriculum, only with interesting side dishes.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
has the potential to be one of the biggest flops ever,"Supposedly a heroic epic, this film lands a bit short of everything it intends to accomplish. Highly sophisticated motion capture technique was supposed to bring real world actors' facial expressions to a new level in animation, but what did they achieve? Good resemblance, but nothing more. There is absolutely nothing in their faces, no pain, no anger, angst, or even genuine smiles. The film itself could have been entertaining but instead was boring from the first minute. Also, the dialogues were tremendously stupid - and please remember that we are talking here about one of the most widely studied artifacts in anglosaxon literary. Maybe, if you are willing to forget everything that was told around this film and simply take it as another animated film, you will like it - I would not bet on it, though.

I shall make you the greatest king that ever lived,"When I heard that Ray Winstone was cast as Beowulf and was only 5' 5"", I wondered why. Seeing him act, I have no doubts that they knew what they were doing. The benefit of CGI and Motion capture puts a great actor in a mythic role. A perfect fit.Another perfect fit was Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother. I mean she was just an animated figure, but Oh what an animated figure. Angelina never looked so beautiful as she did here. There is no doubt why no one could resist her charms.The movie was just an incredible experience with fine actors (Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, and a really believable Crispin Glover, as well as Winstone and Jolie), and an ending battle that will leave you breathless.

Technology is the Star Here,"I watched this spectacular movie completely in mind-blowing 3D and IMAX! I think this is the only way to watch this movie, and I do not regret the money I paid for it.This is one of those movies where the technology is the star, not the story, the script nor the actors. The movie is completely computer generated. The artwork was excellent in the architecture, the landscape and the male characters, especially Beowulf himself. The 3D effect multiplies the grandiosity and excitement of everything in the film several-fold. The action sequences were really top notch in 3D, most especially the climactic battle of Beowulf and the Dragon. I certainly cannot imagine how this movie would look and feel in 2D.Ray Winstone's Beowulf looks every inch a hero, but the story makes him flawed, thus more realistic. I did not know who Winstone was before this movie. He has a grand time looking heroic, with his stances, poses and braggadocio. He was totally naked during his battle with Grendel, and the way his manhood was hidden by various other props can be quite amusing, which distracts from the great action somewhat.I was a bit off-put by the strange over-the-top rendering of Grendel's monstrosity. I did not expect such extremely grotesque interpretation, with a mishmash of deformed human features. The script did imbue Grendel with much drama and tragedy, much enhanced courtesy of Crispin Glover's acting.Angelina Jolie was depicted in gorgeous elaborate artwork as Grendel's mother. All the scenes involving Jolie were really very well done. She does well in looking both beautiful and sinister at the same time. Her costume is very remarkable as well. Unfortunately, aside from her, the other female characters were not very well rendered, particularly Robin Wright Penn's Queen.Overall I would really recommend watching ""Beowulf"". But please watch it in 3D. I cannot avoid comparing this movie with a similarly-themed movie shown earlier this year, ""300"". I liked ""300"" much better because of the live actors involved. (I read that 300 was also available in 3D IMAX format, but I am not sure if they showed this locally. I don't think so.) I gave ""300"" a 5-star rating despite seeing it only in 2D. ""Beowulf"" could have been an average movie, but it gets an extra star because I saw it in 3D.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very disappointing,"I was excited to see that a new version of Beowulf was coming out on the same weekend that I was visiting Oslo as part of an ongoing exploration of Scandinavian history. The signs were good: a promising looking cast, including Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Angelina Jolie; a good story; and an excellent precedent in Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings. (The two stories have much in common: Tolkein was a professor in Old and Middle English and was deeply familiar with the Beowulf poem).However as soon as the film starts one realises that the whole thing looks like a teenage video game. The overall visual style could be called 'arcade-cheese'. In the original poem the characters are admittedly highly simplified, 'symbolic' figures - who do nonetheless have a basis in history. With this as a starting point it would be possible to build on the poem, as Tolkein did with the Lord of the Rings, and create credible characters with believable human characteristics. In this film, however, all the characters are cardboard cutouts. Consequently there is no real acting to speak of throughout the film.The storytelling in the film lacks the keen edge of the poem. Beowulf is an epic story of heroes and monsters, told in a high style. The film fails to capture the poem's seriousness and a better telling can be found in the audio version produced by Naxos, which is a much more exciting affair: http://www.naxosaudiobooks.com/PAGES/242512.htm. It is also worth noting that the film script departs very considerably from the story in the poem. This fact didn't bother me especially, although the changes didn't add anything significant to the story. The scriptwriter showed a tabloid instinct for inventing murky sexual secrets, combined with a Disney-style sense of humour: elements that were of course totally lacking in the poem.The single star is awarded for Beowulf's battle with the dragon, which was excitingly done.Those of you, like me, who were expecting Lord of the Rings style quality may well be disappointed. Very disappointed.Overall: visually unimpressive, bad/no acting, flat characters, weak storytelling.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Amateurish, rotoscoping fiasco . . . A missed opportunity","""Beowulf"" is a mildly interesting retelling of the classic story that is rendered virtually unwatchable by the CGI motion capture technique used to ""film"" the actors. The result looks like second-rate animation or third-rate photography. It's actually quite shocking to me that the movie was released in the state that it was. I don't know how any artist with even a semester of an art-school drawing class under his or her belt would be satisfied with that work. It looks like a second draft pre-visualisation for what the film might look like when completed. Whatever their budget and time-line was they obviously needed to double it.I suppose what it most resembles is a poorly drawn version of ""Shrek"". But quite frankly that is insulting to ""Shrek"", because the makers of that film would never put their stamp on characters with such vacant expressions, lack of detail, childish shading, and wooden movement. However there is still a visual similarity between the human ""extras"" in Shrek that are painted with less precision and the characters in Beowulf. This makes for a creepy experience when you see them in sexually suggestive scenes or using coarse language. It's like a pervert's transformation of a child's film.Two questions popped into my head when watching the movie. The first question which occurred about five minutes in was, ""Can I actually sit through two hours of this crap?"" Well, I was able to answer that question with a begrudging, ""Yes"". The second question was, ""Why on Earth did they choose this technique?"" That I cannot answer.The fact is that if they had chosen either pure animation or live action filming, the result would have been incalculably better. John Malkovich is a great actor, but I found myself staring at the face of his character at one point trying to get some clue about his motives, but it was a completely blank slate. It was like watching a mannequin. What a waste of a fine cast. Watching the DVDs extras you get to see Anthony Hopkins in costume or the beautiful Robin Wright Penn on the set and it hammers home the point, ""Why?"" Why, did they throw away those potentially magical performances for this dreck?I could go on for pages but due to the space constraints I suppose I need to capture the essence of my objections and it is this: I felt absolutely no emotional connection to any character or event in this film. This is quite rare for me, as I'm an easy sell. So as a piece of art it was a complete failure. It is a quirky oddity that may one day be remembered as the most ambitious example of an abandoned technique. Let us hope so.",,Anonymous,Animation
Good film but I don't get this motion capture technique,"Well, if this had been made as a live action feature, I would have enjoyed it a lot more. To me there's no sense in using motion capture instead of live action. OK, the director seems to think that he may have more freedom with camera moves, art direction and the aging problem, not to speak of using the not very slim or athletic Ray Winstone (who I really like as a live action actor) as the hunky hero. The only exception may be the 3-D part, which I wasn't able to see. But I'm pretty sure that this could have been made for the same amount of money as a live action feature with lots of CGI. In ""Beowulf"" I haven't seen anything that wouldn't be possible in live action/CGI. The dragon? Look at ""Reign of fire"" or even ""Dragonheart"" and ""Eragon"". Complicated camera moves? Look at ""The Matrix"" and ""The lord of the rings"". Art direction and production design? Again, look at ""The lord of the rings"", ""Troy"" or ""Gladiator"". And instead of Ray Winstone (Sorry, Ray) I'm sure there are enough athletic actors capable of this role. To me, the motion capture versions of Hopkins, Malkovich, Gleeson and their colleagues were distracting during the entire movie. The only really good and realistic looking face was that of Angelina Jolie, which sometimes seemed to not really be ""overpainted"" at all. I'm wishing everyone involved in making this film the very best, but I do hope that this movie won't recoup it's costs and that motion capture will be relegated back to making creatures like ""Gollum"" or ""Grendel"" possible, but not making entire movies using it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable movie.,Having not read the story of Beowulf the only reference I had was the earlier film Beowulf & Grendle. Both films roughly stay true to one another until Grendle is no more then the stories seems to be quite different.I've since read the story of Beowulf and Grendle and find that this adaptation to be less faithful than its predecessor. Some things that differ from the story I later read seem to have been altered for no reason and would have spoilt the film for me had I had a better knowledge of the story.Despite this I found it enjoyable. And the animation was nicely done.,6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Regarding the Movie's Relationship to the Original,"I love the Beowulf in its original form (by which i mean the original plot-line since all I can read are translations); however, I understand why the writer changed it. In the original, Beowulf has no inner-conflict. He is supremely confident, goes into battle ready to die, and so on. He makes no moral choice except to choose glory and honor. Thus, he only faces external foes which don't make for high drama, so they had Beowulf choose the demon and glory over the queen and domesticity to have the hero make a moral choice that he'd later reap a terrible consequence. The message of the real Beowulf is the pagan emptiness, the pathos of lost glory and old age compared with the Christian hope of eternal life, of which Beowulf has no inkling.Interestingly, in the story the conflict is in the narrator who is clearly a Christian of some kind whose relating this very pagan tale. His conflict between Beowulf's world and the Christian perspective in which he writes is incorporated in the story though I thought unnecessarily.All in all, I thought the movie failed to create a compelling drama. It ended up being mostly smoke and noise.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

The basis of the movie is of course the epic of the hero Beowulf, a worthy endeavor, if the production company would actually stick to the friggin story. The plot was hard to follow and the accents were too thick (i.e.-they were hard to understand) the fact that Sangri-La decided to use CGI was a completely idiotic move.

"Worth the spectacle of Imax 3D, effective but not perfect..cynical, boring and serious people will hate it.","I went to be entertained..I was..Was it a little silly? well yes..but that's Hollywood for ya Did i care less about the original poem? no...get real who in their right mind would expect it to be even vaguely faithful knowing its a Hollywood film? Was the animation good? hell yes Was it perfect?, well of course...no, yes bits look fake, some look amazing.Is the 3D fantastic?, yes indeed you would have to be a pretty overly indulgent and mournfully serious dull person (well obviously if you read this far you can see there's plenty of those on the planet) not to have engaged with the spectacle this film creates in Imax 3D.It's simply amazing and well worth the visit to an Imax theatre.The rating i would have to say seems somewhat bizarre.

A 3D Effects Showcase,"Simply put, this movie is a showcase of how 3D effects can greatly enhance a movie viewing experience. May not be cutting-edge technology as this are already in use in theme parks or IMAX. Still, I haven't seen a 3D movie as mesmerizing as this. When I saw the swooping landscapes, the 3D really gives it a very good sense of distance and perspective. I can feel the scale of near and far objects. Then there's the action sequences which benefits from the use of 3D effects. Adding that third dimension enhances the viewer's experience by giving the illusion of being closer to the action. Combine this with the clever use of camera angles and movements and you got yourself a winner. Even simple scenes such as people talking and moving around - we see the characters, surroundings and objects pops out of the theater screen. It's a treat for the eyes.The 3D effect is topnotch but the CGI animation itself is somewhat of a letdown. The quality is not consistent. There are times when King Hrothgar, portrayed by Anthony Hopkins, does look like the actor but on other scenes the character looked entirely different. Facial animation is very important as this is the main driver for the visuals of the character's emotions and yet we see unblinking eyes and some video game-grade lip-sync. Face modeling looks great for the male characters while a little patchy on the female characters. Beowulf's face is nicely rendered, the facial hair, pores and scars looked realistic. Contrast it with Queen Wealtheow's face whose texture looked like it came from a wax museum. The jerky movements of the characters is also noticeable at times. Overall, good animation but I've seen better.The story takes a backseat from the overwhelming visuals but it's still good. It is based from the heroic legend of Beowulf, battling a monster named Grendel and a dragon. What I appreciated about the movie is that the writers, Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, ties up those two unrelated battles by including a subplot showing that the hero can be fallible and dearly pays for his mistake. I like the story adaptation but purists will surely be upset.Recommended viewing just for the novelty of the 3D effects, so please skip the 2D version. The movie is a good effort and I'm looking forward on the next generation of 3D movies.I watched the movie at SM North, admission price P300. Disappointed with the cheap 3D glasses provided, which is made of carton, but it gets the job done.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"It's not the 3-D that sinks it, it's the motion capture","This action trinket starts off as great fun, thanks mostly to the novelty of 3-D, which is done very well here.But the motion capture technology deadens all of the performances and leaves all the characters looking like little dolls in a diorama. That may have been appropriate for The Polar Express, but it works against this film. Not only are the performances dulled as though seen through gauze, but the technology also seems to shrink the actual scale of the spectacle.As for questions about the adaptation of Beowolf, this film is a comic book and not a serious attempt to adapt epic poetry.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Ray Winstone?,"240 other people have already extensively commented on this fine movie.However my only question is why on earth did they cast a cockney in he lead role? There's something that just doesn't quite fit with the character, the Vikings and the knowledge that he's actually quite fat in real life.The actual CGI Beowulf looked far more like Sean Bean who surely would have made a better lead?OK movie apart from that. The other characters, though displaying some dodgy Danish accents, appear quite at home in the movie and the plot and action sequences move along very nicely.I was only put off by the completely out of place Cockney Winstone, chirping in here and there - worst when he was trying to be eloquent.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Enjoyable yet flawed,"While there are some conceptual things about this movie that I don't really agree with, such as modelling the faces of the actors in acute detail in CG instead of just using the actors themselves, I found that I enjoyed it a lot more than what I thought I would.The graphics themselves are very impressive and almost photorealistic (which isn't necessarily a good thing, see previous comment). The film was more hardcore horror than what I thought it was going to be, which made it all the more surprising and entertaining for myself. I am very glad to see that Zemeckis hasn't settled into a groove and is trying new things cinematically, some of which are very evident here.The voice acting was interesting - my guess is that as the Celts originated from Saxony it would make some sort of sense to have the actors put on different forms of Celtic accents, apart from Jolie's stereotypical Russian business and Winstone's broad London brogue. Given the pedigree of the writers it's not surprising that the script is very well written - not childish in the least, more engaging and adult than that. To be honest, I am very glad to see a major Western company putting in the effort to make a CG film that isn't aimed at children.At points the film slows down to a laboured chug as some characters are developed. These moments are somewhat forgettable when the next action sequence comes along and amazes you. Trust me, they are amazing. Some complain that the movie isn't true to the poem and the whole story, to which I say well Frank Miller's 300 is based on such a story, yet takes many liberties, and I would put this movie in the same vein as this. It doesn't set out to be a perfect rendition of the poem.Basically this is a very entertaining, adult movie with a bit of God of War about it, which is a very good thing. Definitely worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Wow!,"This I have to see in 3-D. I am hoping to get out of my little town, to to a big city and do just that.Beowolf the movie is BASED on the classic tale. It is not the SAME as the epic.

""You are Beowolf--slayer of monsters and hero. I will hear no more."" For people who like Scooby Doo, Beowolf won't do it for them.

Nicely told story despite its visual flaws,"A monster Grendel is terrorizing the kingdom of king Hogarth. The vile beast must be slain and lo and behold, Beowulf, the great hero, comes with his men and he slays the monster by ripping its arm off. But the monster has a mother and as it also wants to revenge the death of her offspring, Beowulf must kill her as well.Beowulf is well written and well told story. It has a solid soundtrack and some pretty bad ass action scenes as well some nicely twisted sense of humour. Yet I can't give it more than 7 out of 10.The main reason for this is the way the movie has been made. The CGI looks great and the the makers have managed to bring a great deal of atmosphere to Denmark. But the characters seem lifeless and the animation seem very awkward in some places and there are even a couple of scenes in which the animation is plain bad. Ray Winstone does a good voice job, but there are some characters whose voice acting is plain and uninspired. Yes, I'm talking about John Malkovich here. And Anthony Hopkins ain't in his A game here either.But as I said it is very well told and written story. I especially liked what they had done with Grendel. He's not just some brainless monster, but a pathetic, twisted shell, who is in constant pain. Even though he does terrible things you can't but to feel sorry for him because of the sins of his parents.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Cheap thrills from the digital demon dollar tree,"Reviewers rave about dolly shots impossible in live action, groundbreaking motion capture technology and previously unseen surface texture, but what's the point? Everybody goes on about how difficult it was to make this movie, and what a technical achievement it is. How come nobody ever asks why you would want your movie to look like a video game in the first place? Flames don't look one bit like flames, and the sea doesn't even come close to the real thing, let alone the wooden expressions and clumsy moves of the characters. Even the blue demon fire looks fake, no small feat given it has no counterpart in the real world. But the similarity with video games doesn't stop there. ""Beowulf"" is one long string of teenage macho fantasy dripping with blood, sweat, semen and megabytes. Except maybe for John Malkovich as a misanthropical early Christian, recognizable only by his wailing voice, it's a disgrace for everyone involved. I guess they needed the money.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
one of the best film adaptation for a long time,"This was a great movie and I would say one of the best of the year. This is a great addition to already great year for the movies.

The screenplay is very well done and the directing is pretty good. This film does have a slow pace but that kinda fits with the story. I saw this movie in 3-d and that made the movie a little more fascinating and I think you should see it in 3-D.

How the horrendous can also be beautiful,"The epic poem called Beowulf was probably written in the 8th century in Anglo-Saxon dialect and it tells the story and prodigious adventures of the hero of that name, King of the Geats of Jutland. These adventures are narrated now in this good movie in an admirable way full of powerful and beautiful images (even if sometimes horrendous) and movement. The story is told more by images than words and some of them are really breath-taking. The legendary atmosphere of tales of High Middle Ages is very well presented. This story of heroes, monsters, warriors, witches and ordinary men is very well told indeed in all its aspects. One of the best movies of this kind.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Like watching dead people act.,"I went into this movie totally cold, and there were no beginning credits... it wasn't until the end when ""directed by Robert Zemeckis"" popped up when everything clicked. It's like the awful POLAR EXPRESS all over again, with more of the same creepily realistic 3D Animated characters trying to sub in for real actors. With this movie, they get dangerously close to convincing (in some shots), but there's still something not right. The characters are beautifully animated and detailed, but lacking the life that real human actors would have... instead looking like a bunch of reanimated corpses interacting with each other. The effect is interesting in that it's a momentarily unique visual style (as SIN CITY and 300 were) but unsettling and overall quite useless and underwhelming when the big action sequences look just as cartoonish and fake as anything from CGI fest films made over a decade ago.The plot is pretty awful too, with a decent though padded and drawn out first half that follows the book fairly well. About midway through, the film drastically changes direction and adds a whole 'nother act which is boringly paced and has a few plot ""twists"" that anyone should see long before they are revealed. Actually, the whole second half of the movie is a virtual remake of Scorsese's LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ with Beowulf instead coming to a crossroad decision involving a lusty maiden....which brings me to Angelina Jolie. What is so damn irresistible about her? She returns as basically the same gratingly abrasive character she played in Alexander, same awful vampire accent and everything. Hey scenes are awfully steamy and erotic for a PG-13 rated film, not that I have anything against it, but I wouldn't be too thrilled about my kids seeing it. The gore is also quite needlessly grotesque. As much as I like seeing people getting rended and disemboweled, this film crosses the line especially with Grendel's appearance and actions. A whiny rotting zombie/ogre exposed eardrum that throbs is not something I'm particularly excited about seeing.Also, why would a dragon have such a puny heart? And what was that life-size Academy Award doing lying on the beach?",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Stunning 3D, incredible hubris","My wife and I saw this yesterday at the IMax in Sydney, Australia. The 3D was for the most part well done, although there were a few parts where the point-of-view was unrealistic and clearly put in just to show off the 3D effect.What really grated on me was the script. The hubris of the screenwriters to think that they can improve on a story that has endured for more than 1000 years. I suppose they are banking on most Americans (indeed most viewers) to have never actually read Beowulf. It's a shame. The lower budget ""Beowulf & Grendel"" actually did a much better job.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Sick...,"Worst movie of the Year... easily and by miles! If you want something like this, switch on the Playstation. Especially after 300, this one doesn't even push the boundaries technically. What's wrong with Zemeckis? But then, this will be good for his purse... and his purse only! I've been to a theater with approx. the core target group and everybody was moaning with disappointment. Warner's managed a mega start here in Germany, but I am absolutely sure BEOWULF will be an excellent example that you can buy the opening weekend... but then go nowhere by word of mouth. The strategy was clever though: Madame Jolie naked! Well, don't get fooled (oops, is that spoiler alert now??): you won't miss a thing.

CGI Work in Progress,"A lot of the audience's problems with The Matrix Reloaded, was the fact that the CGI was too cartoonish for a film in which it is supposed to be realistic. Personally, it didn't bother me in The Matrix Reloaded and I thoroughly enjoyed the film.In Beowulf, the CGI is so close to realistic that I found it detracted from the film because I felt it was very off-putting. The CGI was trying too hard in my estimation. Every character was neither cartoonish or real. Other 3D generated films past (Toy story etc.) have stuck to keeping the feel of the movie more cartoonish.In other elements, the film was interesting. I enjoyed it. It was very far from great and well above bad.I think a mixture of CGI and Real life might have been served better - for the movie to look more authentic.

The only way I can describe this movie and studio is like this.. it would be like relating it to a city that had a multi million dollar budget to do something great and deciding that they would spend all of their money redirecting all of the sewage to every hospital in the city and piling it up in front of the building.

Entertaining movie and definitely better than expected.,"Motion capture movie making is of course still in its very early stages. It shows some potentials for the future of film-making but it's not really good enough at this moment to make a great and convincing movie with. Still the most convincing computer animated movie was ""Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within"" and that movie proved to be so costly that the studio went bankrupt soon after the movie its release. Who knows, maybe in 10 years from now it will be perfected and people will be able to make this type of movies faster and cheaper and above all also better. I'm actually looking forward to the day they start making movies with the likenesses of already deceased actors, complete with voice impersonating techniques. Wishful futuristic thinking or the future of film-making? Who knows, time will tell, although I'm sure that there always be need and demand for actors and 'normal' film-making, so all those crew and actors wont ever have to go back to school to learn a different profession.""Beowulf"" is already a big step up from Robert Zemeckis his previous motion capture movie attempt ""The Polar Express"" but still it also suffers from the same problems. It still remains hard to bring the right emotions to the screen on the character's faces and their skins look way too smooth and perfect to consider the look a full 100% realistic. And overall the movie really makes you think at times why did they have to make this movie completely computer animated? Couldn't they had done basically just as good with live action movie making techniques with live real actors in front of the camera?Overall the look of the movie is good but at times it still feels as if you're watching a cut scene of a Playstation game. Especially during some of the action sequences. Of course the beauty of computer animated movies is that you can go just as far and over-the-top with its action as you want to, since there are no limitations to its possibilities. Notmally I'm not a big fan off silly over-the-top action in animated movies but in this case it didn't bothered me since it seemed to suit the story and the character of Beowulf right.It also makes this movie more or less look like a 'children's' movie, which ""Beowulf"" definitely is not. While it looks seem to be made for the younger ones, the story is definitely one for adults. And also the movie features quite an amount of graphic violence.But of course a movie is not all about its looks. The story of Beowulf seems like a pretty entertaining and strong story on its own. However this movie gives you the feeling that it isn't giving you halve of its story. At times the movie makes to big leaps into time, which makes you wonder what happened in between. It was as if they ran out of time or money or both halve way through the production of the movie, which forced them to cut a large portion of its story. It therefor isn't the most coherent movie to watch but this only becomes more of a problem in its last part. The most part of the movie and its story does entertain but it also knows to build some more depth and brings some layers into the story, that focuses on the nature of mankind. It doesn't all work out and not as effective as it could had but the right intentions for it are definitely there.Some of the possibilities of motion capture movie making already shows in the look of its characters. Ray Winstone is a far from muscular or heroic looking actor but thanks to the wonders of technique he looks like the perfect super human with amazing strength. On the other hand some actors look the same way as they do in real life, such as Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Brendan Gleeson and Angelina Jolie, which again in a different way also shows the possibilities of computer animated movies.Still I hope that Robert Zemeckis will also return to 'normal' film-making again. His last 'normal' movie ""Cast Away"" already dates back from 2000. Don't forget that this is the guy that once brought us the Back to the Future-trilogy, ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"", ""Forrest Gump"", ""Contact"" and the earlier mentioned ""Cast Away"", among many other great movies. We need some more movies like that Robert! He already however is working on another motion capture movie at the moment, ""A Christmas Carol"", based of course on the famous Charles Dickens novel.Nevertheless ""Beowulf"" remains a perfectly watchable, entertaining movie, for in between to watch.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Fantasy taken a step to far,"As I had not looked at the cast list for this picture I had know idea of who the actors where going to be. But as soon as I heard there voices I recognized immediately who I was dealing with Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich and Ray Winstone. All famous actors with a great body of work behind them.So a question came to mind, what is actually the point of such a movie? I would rather see the real thing rather than a performance capture animation of great actors. The whole point of watching actors is the relationship we create with their characters.Beowulf simply does not allow you to fall in love with the Actors because of their lack of soul. Dead eyes and facial expressions really block you from creating that relationship that is so necessary for full immersion into the movie experience. - PCLI mean you can take fantasy a step to far.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good visuals and a decent enough story make this worth watching,"Beowulf is not the greatest film ever made. In fact, it is probably not the best 3D film ever made, but it sure was entertaining. The acting for the most part was rather good, and the 3D visuals were a pleasant surprise.Based very loosely on the ancient poem, Beowulf (Ray Winstone) must fight the monster Grendel who has been terrorizing a town and murdering people. Afterward, he must face Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie in an enticing role) and years later a dragon. This movie can be taken as a metaphor on life and many of the things we all go through at some point in our lives. One of the most prevalent involves the sins of the father and how those sins can lead to more dangerous things in the future.The story in the movie is not great, but it works well enough in a movie like Beowulf that is 100 percent computer graphic, and actually looks good. The characters, especially Anthony Hopkins as Hrothgar and Angelina Jolie as Grendel's mother, were almost identical to the people playing them in real life. The scenery surrounding the characters was also splendid, and the creation of Grendel almost tops that of Gollum in Lord of The Rings. I really felt for Grendel (played perfectly by Crispin Glover). Instead of making Grendel the horrible beast that he was in the poem, the writers and director made him into a sort of tragic creature that we all pitied.Not much else to say. Beowulf is definitely a movie that entertains until the end. It may not be the best movie you'll see all year, but it definitely isn't the worst.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

In my honest opinion, I felt that this movie tried too hard to beat out a movie that came out earlier this year, 300. With CGI effects abound and great fight scenes, the overall movie seemed lacking in some areas and too overbearing in others. I would recommend this movie to others with a warning: expect nothing but hope for the best.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Bad CG, Butchered Story.","A lot of things have been said about Beowulf that are entirely undeserved. Amazing, a masterpiece, the best movie of the year... Beowulf is none of these things.When this movie came out, it was recommended to me that i avoid it, because it was not worth the money. I should have listened. They should have also explained, that it was not worth the time. Allow me to explain. I am aware that this film is entirely CG. It was made clear to me within seconds of it. The poorly textured skin, the bad motion capture, the poor fluid dynamics, everything about this film stuck out like a sore thumb. Perhaps i noticed more because visual effects is what i do for a living, but even with that, no other film i have EVER watched (and i am not exaggerating) has EVER given me a worse case of filmmakers sickness. Many movies i have watched where the CG is noticeable, but its never brought me out of the story to this extent where i can't even pay attention to anything else. And don't get me wrong, i was still about to excuse it, hoping i would look it up and find a 10 million dollar budget, or perhaps less. But no, this movie cost a whopping 130 million. All of which was p√Æssed carelessly down the drain.The creators say it was a CG masterpiece. It was not. I've seen students that make better work for their first character design portfolio. They could have bothered to use normal maps or bump maps to create a more realistic skin textures, especially considering the amount of skin shown. They didn't. They supposedly used next gen motion capture. I was surprised to find they even used it at all. They could have done better with a decent animator and some blend shapes. With that kind of budget they should have used Realflow, with simulated fluid dynamics instead of the cheap wave displacements that don't even interact with the characters in the water. they didn't even use a Fresnel shader on the water, it was so freaking amateur. the only decent work was done in the design of Grendel and the sea monsters, and that was in imagination, rather than detail. None of the characters had life to them, the recoil of limbs, a sense of tissue, recoil, anticipation. The animators straight up didn't know the 12 basic principles of animation.Lets remember, this is 2007. We can't bash something that was done 7 years ago can we? Yes, we can. The incredible hulk came out a year later with only 30 million more of a budget, and a hyper realism that put this movie to shame, like child's play. Assassins creed II came out just 2 years later with considerably MORE CG elements, 3 cities worth including a variety of landscapes and only a 30 million budget, less than a 4th of what this movie cost, and rendered it with a considerable amount of detail, reflections and depth of field IN REAL TIME that came close to what this movie accomplished with offline render farms, of a major studio. Just recently watchdogs was released, with a budget of 68 million and graphics that pretty much beat Beowulf to a pulp, also in real time. And lets remember, these are video games we are talking about. They have poly counts to worry about, and part of that budget went to programmers, and level designers, there is absolutely NO excuse why Beowulf should have created the garbage it did with the budget it had, and the 4 or so locations it even dealt with. What, you can't even hire a dynamics expert? You're really going to burst a frigging piece of wood into a mist of stock footage splinters rather than the more realistic approach, 3D prefracturing and hard body sims? I could do that with just 100$ and the action essentials pack and it still would look better. You're frigging kidding me here.I could go on all day about the graphics, terrible blood hits, that weird gold coating Angelina Jolie--Angelina Jolie? Seriously?--but you know what, lets address what else is wrong with the film. For one, they completely ruined a classic short story. The dialog is so corny. The characters are all f*cked in the head, and they're not even good caricatures of scumbags, they're just plain unbelievable. And when i say unbelievable i mean those characters could not and would not exist under any circumstances and if they did exist and you put them into a room together they would not behave as such. One moment the dude is kicking his slave the next he is talking about honor and glory? Or the drunken king who's clothes basically fall off and then the next minute he's a fighter and a hero and then the next he's a poor man begging for help? I mean make up your mind godd√•mn it. And the worst part is, in the story he's nothing like that. Beowulf doesn't f*ck Grendels mother either. And she's not pretty. And Grendel isn't a whiny little b√Ætch. And i'm not sure he even speaks. And there's this whole part they left out about ever hero trying and failing, and this epic battle as Grendel's mother drags Beowulf down under the lake that i was really hoping to see, instead the dude just basically jumped in the water and then hopped out in the underground cavern all Mario like, like he doesn't even need to grab ahold of something and pull himself out, he can just swim jump. Its f*cking stupid man. I hate you people. Next time the producers have millions of dollars to p√Æss away, give it to me. Or maybe flush it down the toilet. The toilet would find a better use for it.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Amazing movie!,"First of all, this movie is amazing. Period! Unlike some of the people who have commented, I do CG/3d graphics myself; and let me tell you, this movie is a masterpiece! The amount of work that must have gone into Beowulf absolutely shames even great CG movies like Shrek.I remember reading Beowulf as a kid, being fascinated by dragons and legends. The legend, the original Beowulf, is dry reading for all but the most devoted. Yes, it has action and intrigue, but you'll need patience and an ability to digest old style prose to appreciate it.This movie distills Beowulf into an accessible and modern adaptation which is beyond compare.Some people think the CG aspect works against the movie. I beg to differ! It enhances it completely. Things that would be impossible or awkward to do with live actors is seamlessly done with CG. The action sequences are incredible and unlike any other movie. Even Lord of the Rings, a great master piece with amazing fight scenes, doesn't have anything even close to the final battle in Beowulf.I saw the regular ""2d"" version, and it was great. I cannot comment on the one enhanced for blue/red 3d glasses, as they usually give me a headache to wear.Criticizing this movie for poor CG is a show of incredible ignorance. I applaud the effort by the team behind this movie. It's a monumental achievement! If only I could be so lucky as to work with talented people like the ones who crafted this movie. I noticed, in many scenes, the utter attention to detail that went into making them. Things you may ordinarily not think about, but which stand out to those who deal with CG on a regular basis.It's true that the people are not 100% real. It IS a CG movie. People do have a slightly waxy look to them, but it actually enhanced the movie for me. After a few minutes, it really worked to help suspend disbelief, because the whole world is complete. Everything looks like it belongs. No green screens here. No wires to remove. No compositing CG into ""live"" footage. No, it's all done seamlessly and it works on so many levels.The story itself is simple enough, but also engaging. I can imagine the only people turned off by it must be film critics who are too stuffy to enjoy the good things in life.Yes, an action filled fantasy adventure is not for everyone. But neither is ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Yet, you don't see people who are not a fan of that genre try and tear it down. The fantasy movie genre has too many real life trolls, unfortunately.For everyone who was ever a kid, and anyone who doesn't mind extremely well done CG, watch Beowulf, you will thoroughly enjoy it!",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""What's new Beowulf""....or  LORD OF THE GEATS","It was the early 8th Century A.D. when BEOWULF was penned. It was a time of massive change for the Anglo-Saxons, Danes and Anglo-Celts of Britain and the various Viking tribal kingdoms, East and West in the surrounding sea swept Danish kingdoms. The times of pagan ritual and heroes were morphing into the Medieval Christian era. It was also a time of upheaval, with the old ideological authoritarian structures crumbling, leaving room for literary creativity. Compared with what was to follow, it was a mini-renaissance. Then, dead time ruled up until at least the 14th Century when Chaucer came on the scene, along with the new times which were brewing underneath the slow but sure decay of the Christian Dark Ages.So, BEOWULF the literary work, reflects a newly forming 8th Century A.D. Christian message which is also wrapped up with a lot of Viking era, pagan lore, including the existence of monsters like Grendel, who according the the epic poem, was a descendant of Cain, the brother of Abel, sons of Adam and Eve.In ""Beowulf"" the movie, matters are different; but still very exciting, pregnant with change. These are our times, on the edge of climatic upheaval and political turmoil which certainly rivals and probably surpasses that of the 8th Century era. But now, epic must change in both form and its content. No longer an epic poem, ""Beowulf"" has become the 3D movie. Grendel is still a monster; but not descended from Cain. No, unbeknownst to all, Grendel, the monster is descended from Hrothgar, King of the Danish tribe known as the Scyldings.This twist in the tale gives rise to a variety of opportunities to turn the original ideological intent of BEOWULF's author on its head, for Grendel's mother is none other than the ever enticing Angelina Jolie...I mean, when she wants to be, she's an irresistible Circe.In the original BEOWULF, our hero of the Geats (a West Danish tribe), does race Breca through the ocean for five days straight and he does encounter difficulties with sea monsters; but in the movie, Beowulf is also seduced by a monster turned a kind of beauteous mermaid.Such is life in a sea of change and when our filmic Beowulf lays eyes on ultra-attractive women, he is slain and eventually lain. And from his loins spring.....well, in the original epic poem, Grendel is outfoxed and beaten by Beowulf who confronts Angelina Jolie's child, naked, without armour in that great mead hall, Heorot! True to the spirit of the Viking Danes (both East and West--Geats were West Danes) and of BEOWULF the original, Herot is the place where lustful heroes and wenches frolic and feast and drink, not only the honey-based mead, but also those tankards and tankards of ale. Grendel is spoiling the fun by coming to Herot to slaughter and feed--on warriors and maidens. Shame. So, it's Beowulf to the rescue, all naked and shiny and strong like a bull. When Grendel feels the power of Beowulf's grip, he knows that he's met his match.In the poem, Beowulf slays both Grendel and his mother, an appropriate entry into the staid, stagnant world Medieval monkery. In the film however, the slaying of one becomes the laying of the other and very importantly: lies, betrayals and in their wake, the slow death for ancient heroism a la Odysseus prevail, as Christianity rises and the once meek, weak, double-dealing, fratricidal Unferth becomes the personification of a sadistic Christianity in the power saddle, slouching towards the Dark Ages.But wait...lustful loins, heroism and dragons will have their day! And the father will eventually be re-united with his son and the spirit of Grendel's mother will live on as she faces noble Wiglaf, Beowulf's comrade in arms, breast deep from the waves at the end of the flick.See this movie in the 3D version. And don't quibble too much about the cgi effects. Just enjoy your time in the ale hall. Long may Heorot stand!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Uniquely entertaining,"I gave this movie a rating of 10 stars because of it's entertainment value. The graphics are great and it tells a fine story. The eyes seem a little ""off"", but if that's the worse thing that happened, no worries. Did anyone else out there fall in love with Weedlove? He was Beowulf's right hand man. Something about him was magical. He was brave, honest, caring, and fiercely loyal. Lots of great actors in this...Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winstone, Robin Wright, John Malkovich. I watch it every time it comes on and I see something new in it each time. Some love it, some hate it. I love it and appreciate it for what it is, total entertainment.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, if you can overlook the juvenile aspects","First off, I can't believe I was charged $3.25 for 3D glasses when I could have just brought my own. Ugh! Anyways, I enjoyed ""Beowulf"" much more than I thought I would. It has a slew of flaws, but it's still good entertainment. Some of the animation bugged me because instead of thinking ""this is Grendel's crazy monster mom,"" I kept thinking ""Oh look, it's a cartoon big lipped Angelina Jolie!"" Also, it seems like the filmmakers wanted to go for an adult demographic with this animated adaptation of the epic poem, but it misses the mark by being chockful of juvenile humor and moments. Despite these distractions, it's still a good ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mesmerizing!,"After initially being put off by the motion capture technique used in this movie, once I settled into it I was riveted. I've always loved the Beowulf and Grendel story and although this is not a literal interpretation of the classic epic poem, it is thoroughly entertaining on it's own terms. I went in the theatre knowing nothing of the cast, save that Angelina Jolie (fantastic dragon lady!) was in it and was pleasantly surprised to find the likes of Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich and Robin Wright Penn sharing the screen. I will not even reveal who played Grendel, because it was such a treat to discover this at the end, in the credits. I found this version of the story to be the absolute best I've ever seen even if the director did take certain liberties in the retelling. I appreciate the fact that the director was able to evoke my sympathy for pitiful Grendel even as I was revolted and horrified by him. He is rather a Frankenstein monster for the medieval set; didn't ask to be born, but there he is. I cannot possibly spoil this movie for anyone which I will do if I keep writing. Hie thee to the theatre posthaste and see this mesmerizing film!",,Anonymous,Animation
"Good, but not for everyone","Let me start by saying this: This movie is not for everyone. A lot of people will fall in love with this film and a lot of people will smite it to the depths. First, let me start with the 3D aspect of it. In my opinion, it looked like one of the Shrek movies. It's not necessarily a bad thing, but it can prove to be a distraction at times. The previews do not really do this film justice, as it is a lot deeper than just ""let's kill Grendol!!!"" Grendol is a pretty sick and twisted being, however, and was one of the more interesting characters. Another part of this movie that strikes me as odd is the fact that it can be laugh out loud funny at times, which seems out of place. I enjoyed the movie wholly, though, despite some flaws. It is not the greatest epic of all time, but far from the worst. All I can say is to go out there and see it for yourself. It is worth the $9 and everyone will get at least something out of it, whether it is the deep, underlying themes or the thrill of seeing some guy that is animated like Shrek getting ripped in half.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Look at what we can do!,"I watched the Director's Cut version of this; I understand that the only real difference is in this not being censored. Nothing else is added or removed. I did not see this in 3D; I can imagine that portions of this are more impressive that way, but it also seemed to get excessive at points. That's the main problem with these things; those making them get carried away, forgetting that CGI is a tool(like numerous others available to film-makers), and show off the technology, and far too many reward them with ""oohs"" and ""ahhs"", neglecting to take into account if they remember how it was on the whole, afterwards. The camera flies and does tricks like a well-trained pet, and a good deal of them are superfluous to this. With that said, this does set and maintain moods, and it certainly is visually impressive. The eyes are dead, as has been pointed out. This has gorgeous ""sets"", art and design. It feels like a realistic depiction of the Vikings(*no horns* on their helmets, that was made up by Christians to demonize those not of the ""right faith""), with plenty of crudeness and raunchy details(and yet it doesn't come off as hostile towards them... well, not only that). This uses old English words and phrases some, and even a little of what is apparently the actual language spoken at the time. Yes, the accents are pretty atrocious. I don't really know the legend, so I can't say how close this stays to it. This is a fun ride, and it makes sense to animate it, since it is an adventure(as opposed to A Christmas Carol, a story that was never ""epic"" or fast-paced). It is action-packed, and the fights are awesome. There is a bit of ego-stroking, which is logical enough for a myth taking place in that period and environment. That explains the eye-candy for both genders, as well(Jolie is *hawt*, whether it's literally ""real"" or not). The cinematography and editing are excellent. This has marvelous music and songs, too. It's engaging and thrilling, and doesn't overstay its welcome(certainly not by much). Dialog is well-written and well-delivered. All in all, I'd say at least a single viewing, if it appeals to you. There is a lot brutal, bloody and gory violence, occasional sexuality, infrequent moderate swearing and a little nudity in this. The 2-Disc DC DVD holds six featurettes(that I will review on their individual pages here on the site) and 11 and a half minutes of reasonable additional scenes(note: all in pre-vis state, not completed), and comes with a comic. I recommend this to anyone who can imagine enjoying it. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Demonic MILF,"If you like faithful adaptations of literary classics, then you'll hate this movie. If, on the other hand, you like mindless violence, eye-popping 3D special effects, and Angelina Jolie (herself something of a 3D special effect), then you'll enjoy this movie. Zemeckis and co. have sexed up Beowulf, freely inventing infidelity and paternity issues that wouldn't look out of place on an Oprah episode. (Don't tell me you never wondered who Grendel's FATHER was.) There is some philosophical mumbo-jumbo about the coming of Christianity bringing an end to the age of heroes and monsters, but this is just undergraduate b.s. to fill screen time until the next fight scene breaks out. Not quite as ludicrous as 300, but not from want of trying. The mocap animation makes it look like the world's most expensive video game. Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich are also in this big budget B-movie, looking rather sheepish; this may be the greatest waste of acting talent since CLASH OF THE TITANS.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
More a technological marvel than a coherent movie,"Meh. I had low expectations going in, and it couldn't even really meet them. I saw it in 2D, and though the visuals were very impressive and at times stunning, there were too many instances where it seemed obvious that they were going for the 3D 'look' (basically, any time something flew at the camera). The backgrounds and sets and creatures all looked terrific, but the human characters were nowhere near realistic and just seemed to be rejects from the Shrek movies. I feel they should have used real actors, no animation, with every else CG - something like what 300 or Sin City did. As a result, I couldn't be simply wowed by the images.The story has potential, but fails on the execution. I do like what they changed from the poem; the whole film flowed better and it got interesting right in the middle with regards to Grendel's mother. Unfortunately, the ideas the film brings up are never really fleshed out, and before long there's another incredible action scene to distract us from the plot. The acting is pretty bad, not only because the animated characters can't express emotion, but the voices are bland and have trouble getting around the clunky dialogue. Read the poem (and the excellent novel Grendel by John Gardner) if you want to think, see this if you want to be entertained.It's not terrible, but it's not an overpowering experience like it's been made up to be. The action scenes aren't that impressive, and they're made even less so by the fact that it's all animated. It's more of a showcase for this new technology then a coherent, interesting movie, though it does adapt the poem well. It's a fun watch, and should definitely be seen in theatres, but that's about it.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf barks and sometimes bites beautifully,"I went to Beowulf because of the animation and Anthony Hopkins. Here's what I got: A beautiful piece of art spiced with the voice of one of the best performers in movie history.The story is a wonderful piece of lore. Too bad that masterpiece has to compete with another masterpiece, which is the CGI. So you have the classic story working against visual splendor. What a weird thing to happen. It was not bad, I gave it a 7, it was just almost irritating. I was dodging things thrown at my face and blood dripping into my eye. I lived to tell about it though, thank God.Here's the problem with the CGI. The faces often didn't stay the same. It wasn't a matter of facial expression, they just changed so it looked like more than one person had his/her own impression how the face should appear. It wasn't a major problem, it was just noticeable. BUT, one big problem with the CGI is they still cannot make a beautiful woman look like a beautiful woman. Sure they have no problem getting Hopkins' aging wrinkled skin right but they still make young women look like plastic Barbie dolls. Yes it sounds picky and probably petty but it is a fact. They will get it right one day I am sure.As far as they have come with CGI, this movie deserves credit for its historic achievement. I applaud everyone for a job well done. But I want to say, they just need to learn to stop trying to overwhelming the viewer with art so other aspects are not drowned out.See it for the CGI and you will not be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Bloody good Beowulf,"I admit that when I first saw the preview for this years ago I thought it was made with real actors although it seemed not quite right. So I saw it in 3d when it was in theaters and I saw it recently on my TV. The graphics still hold up extremely well today (2009) with some of the most life-like computer characters I've seen not only in terms of likeness but in terms of acting. It should be since advanced motion capture technology was used extensively with the real actors including facial expressions. The process is interesting because it allowed a wonderful character actor (Ray Winstone) to play a buff hero like Beowulf although he's middle-aged, not particularly in shape and basically looking nothing like the hero. It allowed a fine eccentric actor like Crispin Glover to play the very physical role of Grendel, the monster, and actually give it a tormented pitiable yet menacing presence. As for the other more famous actors, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright-Penn and John Malkovitch, they are quite recognizable, almost in an eerie way, yet not quite the same. The highlight for me was Robin Wright-Penn in the role of the queen. Her sad facial expressions shone through despite the virtual avatar.The story is basically the Beowulf legend retold with a few creative liberties taken here and there. It's the foundation for many other stories and the prototypical warrior hero. At first glance, it seems rather simple but it's told really well and it has a mythic otherworldly quality to it. Beowulf as a character has a nice character arc and shows personality although he's not the most likable fellow, more of a macho boastful jerk actually. The action scenes are thrilling and filmed with angles and camera movements that are often surprising and original: sometimes not possible in real life. I especially enjoyed a long sequence where Beowulf fights naked yet his ""member"" is artfully hidden throughout. On occasion, certain scenes show that they were trying to impress with the 3d effects and it makes things look artificial on TV (ex: guard poking spear at Beowulf's head). At their best which is most of the time, the computer graphics are almost totally photo-realistic. At their worst, especially for secondary characters, they make us think of the human characters from Shrek. The monster designs and animations are wonderful and impressive with particular credit going for Grendel. So all in all, I think that although Beowulf might not have the most emotionally involving story or the most relatable characters, it's still quite entertaining and exciting today and you should have a very good time watching it. It has lots of dismemberments and bloody killings so people allergic to that should be warned.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A sumptuous visual feast,"In the ever evolving medium that is the motion picture, director Robert Zemeckis has thrown down the latest gauntlet in the arena of visual wonder with his computer animated adaptation of the epic poem Beowulf. Released in IMAX 3D, REAL-D 3D and standard two dimensional projection simultaneously, Beowulf is nothing short of a eye-popping marvel that proves a sumptuous feast for the eyes. The fact that it is not a masterpiece in other areas, but still a decent entertainment, does not dull its ability to provoke wonder for the audience.Alternately an adaptation and a deconstruction of the tale most of us have had to tread through, to some degree, in grade school, Beowulf opens in Denmark in 507 AD, where King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has emerged victorious from an ongoing conflict with a neighbor. Reveling in his Mead Hall, Hrothgar and his people are attacked by Grendel (Crispin Glover) a rather pathetic, yet powerful creature who's ears prove sensitive to sounds of merriment. Hrothgar sends word that he needs a hero to defeat Grendel, and Beowulf (Ray Winstone), a warrior in search of glory, answers the call for help.He fights Grendel and eventually finds himself face-to-face with the creature's mother (Angelina Jolie), where he makes a deal with her that proves to be his undoing later in life. The film's final act finds Beowulf, now the King of Hrothgar's lands, fighting a dragon that is praying on the populace.Beowulf, is, first and foremost, a film that is designed to be looked at admiringly. Zemeckis had previously worked with the performance-capture animation technology for his 2004 Christmas epic The Polar Express, which was an equally impressive visual achievement, but Beowulf is definitely the superior on this front. From the detailing on the character's skin to the vistas and environments that the story inhabits, Beowulf is an impressive achievement in animation. The decision to attempt to replicate reality, to some degree, does place Beowulf in the unenviable position, unlike animated features that adapt an approach that chooses to stylize their environments, of being easily compared to the ""real world"", and in that respect, it does prove difficult to not occasionally come up wanting, or sometimes cause the characters to have a plastic look to them. But the very detailed nature of what is on display overcomes this limitation and Beowulf does not disappoint in the visual category.Outside of the visual splendor of the production, Beowulf exhibits traits of drama, action, comedy and tragedy in mixed degrees. The screenplay, by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, isn't afraid to have a little fun with the proceedings, featuring some cheesy, yet humorous dialogue, not to mention an extended sequence in which Beowulf strips naked to confront Grendel because Grendel will not be facing him with any weapons or clothing. This leads to scenes where Zemeckis has to choreograph the action so that Beowulf's privates, computer generated as they would be, are obscured by objects and environmental elements, such as fog. Beowulf is a film that is not afraid to play it a little loose.At the same time, Beowulf slowly builds a strong emotional undercurrent that takes hold in the last third of the film, and examines the frailty of heroes, the accuracy of tales of adventure and conquest and the weaknesses of men in general. While the material is not quite as emotionally resonant as it might be with real actors, Gaiman, Avery and Zemeckis do manage to leave you thinking. Much like post-modern horror films such as Scream, Beowulf wants to not take the epic tales of heroes at face value, but also look at the reality underneath and the cracks in the armor.It is difficult to judge the performances in a film such as this. The actors ""filmed"" their scenes themselves on a empty stage covered in tracking markers, so the actions are ostensibly theirs, but the images have been adjusted by the visual artists after the fact. Even so, based on what is on display, Winstone is appropriately full of vigor and bluster as the younger Beowulf, and then melancholy and reflection as the older version. Angelina Jolie displays a seductive side as Grendel's mother, and Crispin Glover manages to realize a Grendel that is much more pitiable than frightening.Beowulf is just one more example of the encroachment of technology on film-making, as the lines between animation and live-action continue to blur. Beowulf is a stunning-looking production, and is worth seeing in a 3D venue if possible, with some substance beneath the surface, although it is not quite up to Zemeckis' other works. If you are looking for a film that stimulates the senses, Beowulf is it.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
A non recoverable flaw,"The storyline to this movie works very well, unfortunately that is the only thing that works well in this movie. This movie is designed using totally motion capture computers. This is a great feature when in movies like 300, lord of the rings, and harry potter were this technique is to enhance the human characters in that world. Too design a movie based purely on this factor makes the movie feel fake and robbing us of the human emotions that this technique can't accomplish yet. If your going to use human characters use humans to play those parts. Movies such as happy feet are different because not only are we expected to give these characters a cartoon look and feel but their all animals. Beowulf in my opinion would have been more entertaining if they would have made the movie with real people, and used the computers to enhance the film",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very well animated,"This is an interesting file to see, a little slow developing but a well thought out ending. Little kids I would think find this to be a scary movie with some of the action sequences but should be fine for the older child. The animation makes this worth to see. It is almost life like. I had to stay till the end and see the credits, and the faces match up with the names. Be sure to buy a big bag of popcorn, if you like popcorn cause of the slower scenes till the movie really kicks in, then you better put the popcorn aside or you might be so into the movie like I was and choke on a kennel.

"Not a fan of this kind of CGI, but story twist pretty good.","CGI with LOTR and 300 was entertaining - not so much so in Beowulf 2007. Of the 4 recent Beowulf movies (within the last 8 years or so), I have seen 3. I have not seen the 1999 ""Beowulf,"" but have seen The 13th Warrior, Beowulf and Grendel, and Beowulf - 2007. I have enjoyed each of these in their own right, as I did this one; however, the CGI use threw me for awhile on this latest version.The main distracting element was that some characters' images seemed more ""real"" than others. Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) Queen (Robin Wright) seemed more like an X-box character than even a CGI-like actor depiction (Ms. Wright was best in Forrest Gump). Anthony Hopkins, on the other hand, came across fairly well (except for some audio synch and wooden movement glitches). It might just be that Wright had trouble acting (voice and movement) for this style, but this contrast was distracting between not only those characters, but with regard to others within the film, as well.The additional story element was unique, and indeed, rescued the last part of the movie for me. These Beowulf twists (in all the movies I've seen) make for some interesting story-telling, and this was no exception.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not entirely bad,"Once every few years the poem of Beowulf and Grendel is made into a film. Some get aired on television, some make it to the cinema, and some get edited so that they work well on the IMAX format. This one falls into that last category.The story is so old that it is known to almost everyone. It is the classical tale where a hero comes to save the day by defeating a demon that has been terrorizing the lands for some time. It's also the story of the hero that makes a most dreadful mistake.So, story wise there is nothing new here. What makes this Beowulf different from the others that have been out there is that this one features a few things that make it work well in IMAX theaters. It also differs from most others because it uses a sort of CGI acting method where real actors get smudged into the CGI instead of the other way around. It works out well enough, looking more or less like an adult animation film.Most of the effects are done well enough, only a few are of the toe curling bad stuff that makes for films like Jumanji All in all, not quite the worst to be in the cinemas this year.7 out of 10 demons from the other world",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"This film had so much potential,  but it missed in nearly every category.","I've never walked out of a movie before, but I did for this one; about an hour in. (I kept thinking it would get better... but it didn't. It just kept getting worse.) Anyway, here's why you shouldn't waste your money: The animation was the only thing this movie had going for it. Yes, the animation is stunning. However, just because you can animate gore to look like the real thing doesn't mean that you should. I don't like horror/slasher movies, and I had to cover my eyes for about a third of the movie that I stayed for. I wasn't expecting an animated film to be unwatchable, that's for sure. Another thing; I wouldn't consider this move terribly appropriate for children; especially those easily frightened. Definitely see this one first and bring the kids next round if you feel you're willing to do so.Number 2: The script. Here's a hint: Animated movies should never resemble grungy cheap late night specials. The dialogue was stiff, cheesy in places and overly vague in others; even the good vocalics of the actors couldn't rescue it, and there were way too many of those moments where you just feel embarrassed for the actors-- not because you're supposed to, but because you wonder what having participated in this film will do to their career for the next couple years. Even having studied the story in depth; there were quite a few moments where I felt if I hadn't read the book, I wouldn't have any idea what was going on.Number 3: The monsters.What the heck? Grendel's initial attack wasn't even so much scary as obnoxious and over-the-top gory; he was more like a fifteen-foot tall Gollum than a true monster. This was the only part of the story done with a touch of subtlety, the filmmakers did succeed in allowing you to feel sorry for Grendel. Then there's Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie. I'm sorry, Angelina... I just keep imagining her sitting next to Brad Pitt at the premier with something bigger to be embarrassed about than the split in her leather pants. I'm sure the first time the audience sees her on-screen will appeal to some moviegoers but it just added to my uneasiness with the movie. Not only that but the inexplicable accent and linguistics she shares with her son. The audience can only pick up a word here and there.Number 4: The rest of the cast. Even a good actor can't rescue a bad script or a weak storyline.And I'm sure there's more I missed, but right about the time Angelina Jolie comes out of the water for the first time, and the guy five seats down says, ""oh YEAH!"" I'd decided I'd had enough. Time to go.Unfortunately we stayed too long to get a refund, but at least we got re-admittance tickets for another movie at another time. Do yourself a favor and wait til next week, then go see something good.I give it a two because it is a beautifully animated film. But that's the only thing about it I liked.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Classics Comics, but the pictures move and they're in 3D","Neil Gaiman started out writing plots for graphic novels (the ""Sandman"" series, followed up by ""Good Omens"" and other text novels that play with occult themes). That sensibility is plastered all over the screen -- not a shot that wouldn't fit on an EC comic book page (including the ones in which Anglina Jolie's character is on screen). Great Literature it's not -- you won't hear the rhythms of the original saga nor will you hear sparkling dialog, and you won't see depth of characterization. But you will see feats of derring-do and well-directed visuals and some remarkable examples of applied compute-power (though why the artists gave Robin Penn Warren's Queen the lips of Merrill Streep is beyond me).

Two Hours of Tiresome Dialogue and Cross eyed CGI Characters,"I saw the 3D version. 2 minutes into the movie I'm jolly watching the 3D effects. I'm loving it! 5 minutes into the movie it's dawned upon me that the whole movie is CGI effects. Huh? I don't recall that being obvious in the previews. Perhaps I should have watched the trailer a little closer. 10 minutes into the movie I'm trying to get over all the cross eyed characters. I'm trying to get over the character staring into space like they are blind. Next it just gets worse with tiresome and endless dialog. Essentially very little happens and there is a lot of talking. Several of the CGI characters run around as idealized graphic renditions of the actors. There is a lot of needless nudity that doesn't show any body parts that would be deemed taboo. 15 minutes into the movie I was debating whether to walk out or just sleep through it. I saw most of the movie, I just quit caring. This movie is the worst piece of garbage I've ever sat through on the screen. I did catch a little snooze, so I won't pretend to review the plot. I just did not care. I experimented with taking off the 3D glasses to see if the 3D was a distraction. I disliked this movie so much, that I didn't care if it was blurry or not. At times the clunky CGI was no better than stop motion filming. I was reminded of the movie ""Clash of the Titan"" and I was remembering how much better that movie was.I wouldn't let a dog watch this movie. Don't waste your time on this. Don't rent it.

Severely underrated,"This is quite an exciting film with riveting plot and characters. The animation style actually augments the quality of the film as it allows for some fantastical and fast-paced sequences that could not be done in live-action. The characters are all unique with their distinctly strong personalities and voice acting. I haven't read the original poem yet so I can't comment much on the changes, but from what I know, this film is actually an improvement as it fills in some gaps, turns Beowulf into a more human figure and intertwines the fates of the humans and monsters to show the cycle of causation.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Dull and soulless,"I can't believe that Robert Zemeckis did actually direct ""Beowulf"". Of course Zemeckis has never been a cinematic genius like Spielberg or Cameron or Lucas, but he was always reliable and imaginative. If anybody during claimed that Zemecki had been asleep during the making of this movie I'd believe it immediately.Because ""Beowulf"" is a prime example of a dull movie. It's incredibly kitschy and presents a cruelly simplified rendering of an old myth. The so-called characters are as lively and appealing as wax figures. Others seem to made of plastic. Thus they they completely fail to evoke any emotions - or at least not the emotions desired by the filmmakers. Watching those unbearable digital equivalents of Anthony Hopkins, Crispin Glover, John Malkovich, or Angelina Jolie with their soulless eyes is painful. I would have preferred to see the Simpsons in this movie rather than those digitally generated caricatures.Yes, there is some interesting camera work, some nice scenery, some clever idea. Which doesn't save this movie for me at all. Not to mention Alan Silvestri's score that I found quite tough to endure.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
More than just a good 3-D film--it's a good film period,"This review is mostly in response to film critics. Rarely have I seen reviewers become so uptight and unable to engage a film as with ""Beowulf."" Most reviews have been positive, but with a superior back-handed complimentary attitude. Writers acknowledge the great 3-D imagery, the fun action, and, of course, a nude (kind of) Angelina Jolie as crowd-pleasing elements, but they are never fooled by this low-brow Hollywood entertainment; not for a moment. And they must mention how movie is different from the book--the near-incomprehensible 1400 year-old book. Shocking.In response, I say yes, the 3-D animation, the lively action, and the weirdly nude-but-not Angelina Jolie are fun, and they should be, but they are never tacky or unintentionally cheesy. These elements supply the surface gloss to a story dealing with deeper business. ""Beowulf"" examines dimensional characters dealing with dark demons, both literal and internal. It deals with a cursed land ruled by cursed kings, who attain and keep power through black deals forged from black souls. It shows loud angry strength, and quiet chilling loss. And it conveys all this through animation. Director Robert Zemeckis presents all these themes and thoughts and ambitions through animation, which is a real achievement. For so long American animation has been relegated to the genre of children films, instead of acting as a platform to explore all genres. Beowulf stands as the first American major release to warrant a PG-13 rating (it should be higher actually) and deal with adult concepts and characters. This alone heralds a special and much needed change in film-making.All this is not to say ""Beowulf"" is some challenging think piece, or that it even tries to be. Of course the film is not as deep as the book, or maybe even a well-written college paper on the book. But give it credit for trying to be more than some empty-headed 3-D gimmick. It risks and achieves more.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great animation, good characters, and a dull, predictable plot.","""Beowulf"" is not at all what the trailers portray it to be. They make it look like a nonstop action scene. Where there are a lot of action scenes, and they all are done very well, this movie is actually quite slow moving, and has very little plot for the long time it fills.The plot of ""Beowulf"" is an amazingly simple one. A creature kills many men during a party, and the king needs a hero, so here comes Beowulf. Beowulf slays the beast, but can he kill an oddly seductive animated Angelina Jolie, or will he give into his primal instincts....not a hard one to figure out. I'm not going to go too deep into the plot, simply because I don't want to spoil anything.The movie is split into two separate times, one a bit earlier than the other. The first half of the film was really enjoyable. I liked the characters I was being introduced to, the action was fun to watch, if not just to show off how much money they spent to make it look this good. The dialog was mildly amusing too. The second half was boring and predictable and led the movie nowhere. Where in the commercials it looks like this movie has nonstop action in many sets...it doesn't. The movie is mostly localized inside the King's mead hall, where much of the action and all of the drinking takes place. It was good that it took place in one area almost the entire movie because it gave the audience an intimate feel with the area, but it also never let us see what beautiful 3D CGI world that could have been created. The animation was lush and detailed, but that didn't make up for lack of story.""Beowulf"" could have been a grand and heroic tale, but instead was merely interesting animation, well choreographed action scenes, and a whole lot of nothing.My rating: ** 1/2 out of ****. 106 mins. PG-13 for animated nudity and violence.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowoof,"This is a dog of a movie. I wasn't put off by the CG or Beowulf's bare, digitally rendered ass. No, what I did have a problem with is that the first hour of the film could have easily been summed up in a two to three minute minute montage. Instead, what we got was a pointless exercise with barely emotional characters, incredibly loud screaming and lots of pointless scenes of Beowulf sitting around doing nothing. In short, there is action in the movie to be sure, but it is very little. There is just far too much talking and not enough doing. Beowulf is not the deep and intriguing character he was portrayed as in the books. In this movie there is very little we know about his background. I don't think anyone will find themselves excited by seeing a naked CGI man jumping around fighting with a giant troll then meeting with Angelina Jolie, who is naked except for some gold paint. As for the climax? Well hopefully you were wise enough to not ignore my warning and not go see this mess. It's certainly not the worst movie ever by a very long shot, but considering it's potential, it could have been a lot better.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Senceless and absolutely pointless!,"I go to movies to see masterpieces - stunning and eye catching artwork. This is exactly the approach the director Robert Zemeckis tried to use, but he failed miserably at it.We all love the movie 300 because every other shot was beautifully done. All the violent fight scenes were stunning to watch - every other camera angle was a piece of art. Now Beowulf on the other hand had senseless and disturbing fight scenes. The first scene consisted of an 8-9 foot monster who randomly, for no apparent reason started killing drunk towns people in a pub. There was one part where this monster ripped a body in half with his own two hands. I was hoping to enjoy this film, but instead I was not having fun. Why would you have fun when your watching senseless and pointless violent action scenes? In 300, you see heads falling off, but it's enjoyable to watch it because of the amazing style. Every kill in 300 was beautiful, and every kill in Beowulf was just sad.I also find it important to point out that Beowulf, the main character is naked half the movie. He fights that 9 foot monster in the first scene with absolutely nothing on. Talk about awkward. Then there was Angelina Jolie who was absolutely nude the entire film. She said in an interview that she was so nude that she refused to let her husband Brad Pitt and her children to ever see this movie - although every other man will be rushing to see this movie just because of her.The 3D Motion animation was a good idea for this film. The precision of the characters was amazing due to the electronic pegs places on the actors faces and limbs to get the movement and look accurate, along with special lights to get the perfect shape. The three main reasons they created the movie this way was so it would be easy to integrate the characters with the CGI monsters and background, (I think they learned from the Hulk movie where they used real characters and a fake CGI Hulk. Man was that unrealistic!) They also did it this because Angelina Jolie was pregnant during the production, and having her nude the whole movie with a massive stomach ruins the mood. The final reason for why they used this Motion Animation method was because of the MPAA ratings. If this was with real people, this movie would be rated NC-17... instead with it being all CGI, it was give a 14A. Allowing a larger audience to preview the film mean more money.The acting was pretty good. Anthony Hopkins was very good, along with the guy who played as Beowulf. Every other word Beowulf said was in a really cool yelling voice. ""I...AM...BEOWULF!!"" ""I...WANT...CHICKEN SOUP!!!"" Anyways, if you were to see a movie, go rent out 300, or if you already saw 300, go watch it again. Save yourself the money.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beautiful Neil Gaiman script not so good graphics,"I do not understand to this day how this film is not considered one of the best fantasy films in the history of cinema.Beowulf does not only take us on a trip to a fantastic adventure, but it takes time to speak of power and the cost men are willing to pay for it. This is not a simple shallow movie with monsters and fantasy clich√©s, it's instead a film written by Neil Gaiman, who is an expert in Norse mithology and the great themes which ancient mythos explore.Alas, the graphics of the film are not the best, however it may be like a comic book that does not have the best artist, but that does have the best story to tell.Do not take this film for granted and make sure to watch it in the dark, with good sound or headphones as you submerge yourself into the Middle Ages.

"Wonderful Story, More-or-Less Wonderful Movie","I saw this movie today, the day it opened here. And had very mixed feelings about it.The story, and the script undergirding the story, is to me the best part of the movie. The execution of the script was to me partly good, partly not so good.I think it's the animation that most disappointed me. Maybe my expectations were staked too high based on pre-release buzz. But I'm really just mystified at those who rate the animation nearly perfect. Human faces and human bodies looked like comic book animation to me, except in those sequences in which either darkness or distance, or both, managed to obscure things enough to achieve a vivid genuineness that did indeed give me great pleasure.Outside views of the Northern Danish snowy fastnesses were uniformly delightful, IMHO. My very favorite sequence was that with the dragon at the end of the movie. What a wonderful sequence. And the end of the movie was true Northern/Norse-mythic in content and execution: I loved it.Acting was minimal but adequate for character depictions in a broad, sweeping mythic movie like this.All in all, though, the story ... the amazing mythic story of Beowulf ... carries this movie and gives it what is to me a deeply satisfying telling of a tale that deserves to be told again and again and again.Now if I can just get to see it in IMAX ...",7.0,Anonymous,Animation

I could have enjoyed it, the plot was decent even clever and interesting but the face figures were so flat one was constantly jolted back that one is looking at a cartoon.And again, the animation was jerky at times and too flippant in its' disregard of gravity in the action scenes to keep one involved.

"Sinning also by the lack of a greater development of its characters, ""Beowulf"" disappoints in his photo-realism animation, in action sequences and to entertain the audience","Robert Zemeckis can't exactly be considered a director up to par by standards. Perhaps the Lithuanian-born filmmaker is one of Hollywood's most versatile filmmakers, as well as one of the most risk-takers in projects. His work is diverse, including the classic Back to the Future in 1985, the amusing ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" in 1988 (a film that would reveal the director's appreciation for animation and special effects) and, finally, his greatest achievement, the success of public and critics, Forrest Gump of 1994. On that list, however, we can still include failures, such as the terrible remake of The Witches
released in 2020.In certain aspects, ""Beowulf"", whose screenplay was written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, presents good changes in relation to the original poem, as in proposing a justification for the events of the third act of the poem and for the lack of action of the monster Grendel before King Hrothgar, but, in general, it also fails to become particularly interesting as a narrative.This deviation created by Gaiman and Avary, as already mentioned, brings some advantages from a structural point of view, especially with regard to incidents narrated after an ellipse of five decades. Furthermore, the Beowulf imagined by the duo is more human (and therefore flawed) than the impeccable hero of the poem. Boasting and arrogant, the protagonist doesn't hesitate to expand on his exploits each time he narrates them again, also revealing an incredible marketing side by insisting on shouting his own name every ten minutes. However, if he loses part of his greatness in this way, on the other hand the warrior gains a more defined arc, since he only really becomes worthy of our admiration (and the beautiful Queen Wealthow) when he starts to value glory less and becomes humbler, recognizing its own fallibility.And this dramatic arc is more than necessary in Beowulf, since, as an adventure, the film is not the most interesting, paling before other more modern epics such as the trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings"" or even the universe full of of imagination from the ""Harry Potter"" series. On the other hand, the visual freedom made possible by the motion capture technique and the virtual scenarios is exploited to the fullest by director Robert Zemeckis, who throughout his career has been fascinated by ingenious camera movements and new technologies - and here he does, in a single shot, a reference to two separate moments from his great ""The Polar Express"" and ""Contact"": when we see a mouse get picked up by an eagle which then flies away from Hrothgar's hall of celebration, we are seeing a recreation of the shot of the first film's flying golden ticket and also the magnificent introduction of the second, as we move away from Earth into the depths of the universe. In addition, Zemeckis includes a frame in which his ""camera"" is placed below the ground, facing the action in a surprising counter-long shot that has already appeared not only in ""The Polar Express"" but also in ""Revelation"".It is regrettable, however, that the filmmaker ends up exaggerating his excitement with the possibility of moving his camera around any space, since he ends up investing in movements that exist only to explore the technique, not presenting any narrative function (as in the moment when he performs a tracking shot and passes through the narrow space between two pieces of wood) - something that takes the viewer out of the film by calling his attention to the artificiality of the technique. In the same way, aware that the film would also be shown in 3D, Zemeckis abuses the shots in which one or more objects are thrown towards the viewer, which, once again, sounds just like a technical concern, not caring about the story needs. To make matters worse, the director bets on a disastrous scene, diluting the strength of the fight between Beowulf and Grendel by subjecting the hero to the ridicule of fighting naked while various objects strategically hide his genitals.Although the script has good fluidity, the lack of more creative action scenes can disappoint those who expect electrifying moments. Of these, the dragon fight tries to be the pinnacle, but Grendel's first attack is more efficient. Without a doubt, watching the movie in 3D format should be more fun. In the conventional version, shown in most cinemas, the scenes in which the three-dimensional effect is provoked are clearly perceptible, with spears and swords pointed in the direction of the spectator, stones and pieces of wood flying from one side of the screen to the other, people being thrown and spinning in the air until the fall, and so on. Not to mention Zemeckis' traditional shots, in which the camera flies through the sets, usually following an object, which should benefit greatly from 3D. But this is a factor that should not be considered in a critical analysis of ""Beowulf"" as a cinema. It would be, if the film had been made only to be seen with special glasses, as if the technique were intrinsic to the narrative. It is not. Therefore, everything that can be taken advantage of is just an attraction, as if the feature were an amusement park ride. Thus, anyone who goes to a conventional movie theater can feel like they are on a roller coaster without a cart.Featuring a wonderful production design that is also mirrored in the creation of fantastic scenarios and virtual locations, ""Beowulf"" is an animation for adults, since, in addition to the violence (several humans suffer terrible deaths and the hero appears disemboweling several creatures), the sexual connotation of the plot is obvious at several points, reaching a climax in the scene in which the delicious creature with the face and body of Angelina Jolie shamelessly caresses the hero's sword, transforming it into a liquid that runs down his hands. Hands (Beowulf suffers from premature ejaculation, it seems). Refining the technique used in ""The Polar Express"" as well as the exceptional ""Monster House"" (which he produced), Zemeckis casts an admirable cast for his new experiment with motion capture - or, as the producers insist on saying, - performance capture, as the devices allow the smallest subtleties conceived by actors in the studio to be transferred to their digital versions. Thus, we can clearly perceive all the mannerisms of Anthony Hopkins' interpretation of King Hrothgar, who also physically resembles the actor, while Ray Winstone's powerful voice and movements can be used in the construction of Beowulf without, with that, the hero have to present the British's rounded physique.On the other hand, ""Beowulf"", in some ways, represents an even greater disappointment than ""The Polar Express"". The photo-realism sought in the characterization of the characters has evolved a lot, without a doubt, but it is still ironic to see that the Grendel monster is much more convincing than the humans, who should look (well!) real. As a fantasy creature, you are more impressed by it than by the warriors, who are nothing more than simulacra of people. The weightless movements are still there (the scene where they ride is laughable), the dead looks (they should blink more) and the rubbery texture of the skin. Except when there is a close-up and the animators can focus on the movements of the lips and facial muscles, as well as highlighting the pores and hair that cover their faces, humans seen in more open shots look just as real as the humans from "" Shrek"".This blend of fantasy and reality generated by motion capture gives the film an aura of veracity and works as an excellent artistic choice for the feature. Zemeckis demonstrates competence in working with his actors in this respect, also making the dubbing (original in English) follow the pace of the characters. Some of the greatest lessons from Beowulf lie in the idea of guilt and myth. The guilt of being weak to the point of giving himself body and soul to the sin of lust in exchange for promises that could not only cost his life, but the lives of those he loved. Let us remember the phrase of the priest after the village was consumed by fire: ""the sin of the fathers"". The guilt that consumed the young hero to the point of claiming that he died a long time ago, even though he remained physically well... in terms of myths, understood here as guides to behavior, examples to be followed that go beyond generations and that function as essential structures for the formation of the human psyche, Beowulf is neither the brave Achilles nor the cunning Odysseus. He is just a man, liable to mistakes and vices, consumed by his passions. A man who seeks forgiveness and redemption. At most, the example not to be followed... However, which hero managed to complete his journey without even a single fall?Sinning also by the lack of a greater development of its characters (only Beowulf shows a small growth, although his right arm Wiglaf, lived by Brendan Gleeson, also proves to be captivating), ""Beowulf"" gets to be confused in relation to the intentions of secondary figures, such as the poorly used Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn), the almost disposable Ursula (Lohman) and the undefined Unferth, embodied by John Malkovich with such ambiguity that we continue to doubt the subject's sincerity even when he is really interested in helping the hero - something that, again, I doubt was the director's intention. In addition, Unferth is used as a crutch for the writers to throw the growing influence of Christianity on the story, wasting a subtext that would certainly enrich the narrative if it had been explored more carefully. Exciting in its final act (when Alan Silvestri's great score surrenders to the grandeur required by an epic), Beowulf is a film that is worth more for the visual experience it represents than for the story it tells - but at least it made me realize that the poem might be worth rereading one of these days.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

BeoWolf,"We all know the story of the boy who cried ""wolf."" Beowulf, certainly called it. I was expecting a movie that was at least bearable. For the second time in my life, I walked out of a theater (the first being Osmosis Jones). This film was morally insulting, degrading to women, an insult to Beowulf, and visually assaulting. The possibility for beautiful cinematography was ruined by over-done animation, leaving me feeling nauseated, and ultimately fleeing the theater. I do not look forward to the new age of animation. It was clever when Polar Express came out--now, its just annoying--film films, animate cartoons. Don't mix the two. Not that undoing animation could save Beowulf. An oozing Grendel did nothing to help this movie's case. The blatant grotesque nature is abhorring, and leaves the viewer feeling visually assaulted. This films out look on women and their historical role is not only far from entertaining, but insulting and demeaning. The romance between Beowulf and Hrothgar's young wife makes women appear to be lacking in virtue and moral capability, contributed by more subtle comments, such as the village women, and Beowulf's comrades' behaviors. Ultimately, this movie will not stand the test of time. It will slip between the cracks in the sidewalk into the sewer where it belongs.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

Some versions are too far in the ""left field""; yet other versions or views can enhance the story.

Also, Angelina Jolie gets to play a seductive mother.Unfortunately, the movie relies too much on the GCI gimmick (with a video game look) and many well-known actors.The version I watched is the director's cut and Blu-ray.

Also some of the movement animation, e.g. characters pulling a heavy cart, is worse than average. Budget problems?? The plot lacks depth, in particular in describing the inner struggles of our hero, Beowulf. Too much muscles and effects and too little brain in the making. Some of the main characters lose credibility because of this. Angelina Jolie, doesn't need to do much acting as the water demon, but the effect is still stunning, in particular if you have a secret crush on Jolie...

Poor version of an epic story,"I have seen and heard (radio dramas) many versions of this story. I even was the TD and sound engineer on a NPR release of Grendel. I have great respect for Neil Gaiman and yet, this is by far the worst retelling of this saga. Maybe Neil's writing was butchered by the editing of the production, but the beauty of the prose was absent. The drama between Beowulf and Unferth was lacking. The ending seemed to be just an afterthought.Now the animation, an attempt at photorealism, was pathetic in its artistry. Why spend so much time, effort, and money to have Angelina's character look exactly like Angelina? What is the point? What is the intention?

Approaches Great,"24 November 2007. Theatrical animation technology has finally reached the dilemma point of having to push ahead towards replacing live action film or retain its distinctive animated nature. Not since the ill-fated FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN (2001) has animation taken the realistic leap into recreating real life forms. Unfortunately, while the creative innovations are used here, they are used inconsistently, with glimpses of the great potential that animated technology can have in delivering an amazing cinematic experience. The qualitative inconsistency between the male and female characters where many of the male characters have rich, densely, layered human appearances, most of the delicate females seem artificial and incomplete for the most part. Even the Angelina Jolie's character, sometimes sumptuously rich, will in the same scene alternate between a realistic image of a creature to just a caricature. The plot outline also has a number of weaknesses, particularly how the Queen's character was not realistically portrayed either she had contemporary morality of faithfulness that didn't match that of the times or would accept later the sharing of her husband. The recovery of a special, cherished item was also mysterious. While there will fabulous animated scenes that clearly justified animation, there were also several scenes that just seemed awkward in the use of animation. The spawn creature was also not fully developed and its relationship to its maker wasn't fully captured on screen. This movie does deserve credit for being a morality tale that isn't what the American audience is used to. Unfortunately, the potential of animation was touched but not fully executed to its greatest effect. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
We'll see,"We're seeing it tomorrow, but just a few points here. First, the tagline, which all by itself reveals that the writers didn't read the original. There is no ""pride"" in Beowulf, nor is it a curse. Beowulf is, in fact, self-deprecating. There are no lies about achievements, or greed (Beowulf gives the reward he was given to his king, and keeps none of it).There are perhaps ten words describing Grendel, not enough to know what he looked like (he had scales and a claw, and that's about all the author felt we needed to know).There is no sex or seduction. Grendel's mother is repulsive, she does not try to seduce Beowulf, he does not strip. He kills her, beheads the corpse, and swims back to his thanes. Period.I'll let the commenter get away with calling Beowulf a Viking, although he was a Geat. Still, close enough, I suppose.I'm not at all hopeful. In fact, I'm sure I will despise it. Everything I have read, including this comment, tells me the writers have no respect for the original, and have turned this into a roller coaster for 14 year-old boys.

"Looks and feels brilliant, a real experience... shame i didn't like it","I wasn't too sure what to make of this film when I saw it. I think maybe it's one of those that you have to watch twice before you fully understand it. It is true that is looks amazing. That is to say the animation is really something. It's done quite obviously in CGI but in such a way that it really suits the dark mood of the film and the story. It is almost worth watching just for this reason. The characters actually look like the actors portraying them, bringing a new purpose to the job of voice-over. It's unfortunate then that I didn't like it that much. Obviously Beowulf is a classic story and making a film such as this was inevitable. The problem is that doing it in animated form kind of dumbs it down a little. What I mean is I'm not really sure who this film is for, the dark story and horror elements (Beowulf is essentially a horror story) make it for adults but the animation says its for young teenagers. If it wasn't animated the amount of blood featured in this film would no doubt make it a 15 certificate. The result is a film that doesn't really know what it wants to be, some films can get away with appealing for both audiences but Beowulf doesn't quite seem to pull it off. The voices of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins and (dare I say it) the addition of Angelina Jolie are fun to listen to and suit their characters perfectly. The overall result is something that is fun to watch but becomes boring for both audiences about halfway through.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

I believe having done the movie with a standard shooting with some CGI effects would be much better. I am saying this because all the work of redoing the actor's faces would be unnecessary and it would seem more real.I cannot say much about this film, only that I did not like it because the way the story was told was very confusing, and the movie is very hard to watch.I expected more of the director of ""Forrest Gump"" and ""Cast Away"", even though the cast of this movie does not include Tom Hanks.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

A must see in my book.,"Grand and EPIC do not even begin to do justice to the masterpiece that is Beowulf!!! Magnificent! This movie has it ALL! It is a poignant touching cautionary tale that will lie on your soul. The script is perfectly adapted and keeps a fast pace. Beginning to end this experience is a THRILL ride of event and twists. The CGI is so amazingly real it is awe-inspiring. Most of the time you forget that it is even CG. If anything it was *more* real than live action, in that the monsters and humans were perfectly integrated and so you never notice any special effects. It provides a continuity the film would not have had in live action. I have seen many realistic CGI films but this is an entirely new level. The hardest part is eyes. Anthony Hopkins has a way of expressing with his eyes like few actors do. Certainly, I expected, that would be lost in the CG. It was not. The pores on the skin, the sweet, the facial and body hairs, the control overt lighting and shadows was spectacular. Even though much of the lighting was candles that flicker the lighting was believable and realistic. Nothing less than astonishing! I would forget it was CG until things like Grendel the monster with no skin would show up all bloody a dripping mucus and puss. Then I was thankful I never encountered such a foul being in real life. Did I mention, don't take the children. I even had the opportunity to see the 3D version. The realism of a man getting impaled by the chandelier and the blood flying right at your face in 3D makes it even more graphic. On the other hand, the realism of Angelina Jolie's breasts popping out of the scene in 3D on several occasions was ... well, breathtaking. She was however, more than just eye candy, she voiced the role spectacularly. All the voice talent was phenomenal Ray Winstone reminds me of Russell Crowe's performance in Gladiator. This is much better yet in my opinion. At one point King Hrothgar says ""The Gods will not do for us what we do not do for our selves. What we need now is a HERO."" It takes a super hero of super heroes to be a Danish Viking Legend and the voice and the character of Beowulf (Ray Winstone) work together, pulling of shear authenticity in an unbelievable fictional character. How do you compliment the acting when it is CG, well I must because Hopkins is still a master. I ramble on¬Ö so I will not get into the story now, but you will be touched by the innocence of a grotesque monster in pain, stunned by the beauty of the monsters mother, appalled at the state of man who becomes monstrous, moved by the heart and courage a man who chooses to right the wrong he did, and most importantly you will be WOWED by the movie Beowulf!

"Too scary to be for children, too childish to be for adults.","This is obviously not a family movie. The mature jokes and songs, and Grendel's appearance indicated that this movie is for adults only - that it is not meant to be as (for instance) Stardust, but to be a clearly violent epic movie for the fans, but sometimes it felt as if there was a joke behind the scene. But no, there wasn't. There are some particularly awful scenes, made to seed the feel of epicness but result in nothing but a weird joke.The story was alright, it developed right and was interesting to follow. However, in a movie of human (and demon) relations accented, it is imperative to have humans act the talk-scenes. Computer graphics CAN'T replace human mimics especially in the tensed emotion scenes. I do have to admit I watched this movie on 2D, perhaps it looks better in 3D, but the computer graphics somewhat degraded this movie, adding a bit of comicness, which clearly doesn't fit in a movie like this.The story was near perfect. It was quite obvious of the result in the beginning, but it's normal in these movies. The battle scenes were also thrilling and the creators have done a great job there. However, computer graphics awfully degrade this movie, I dare even say stealing an award or two, human emotions and mimics can never be fully replaced by computer and I had hoped Zemeckis knew that.It's an entertaining movie for the epic adventure film fans, but will seem completely unacceptable for the rest. It could have been much better.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Finally a great fantasy film. I could have done without the CGI, though.","If you haven't seen it, you should. It is a brutal hero story, one that does justice to the ways of old (as I can only imagine them), when Christian morality was something that was just emerging in Northern Europe and the glory was that of the warrior heroes, living through and for their skill. The plot is also more like the original Beowulf than most adaptations I've seen. It even beats The Thirttens Warrior (The Death Eaters) in darkness and quality.The CGI, while clearly well done and cool technically, was a bit of a distraction and for that only I was prepared to rate it with an 8. Until I realised who the actor that played Beowulf was and I understood the subtle ploy of the whole computer generated actors. If you don't know who the lead actor is yet, please try not to find out until you finish seeing the film.Bottom line: a must see!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Warning: IMAX 3-D made me nauseous,"However, I loved the movie and the 3-D was 85% of what was enjoyable. I think a ""flat"" version would be flat.Most of the excitement comes with the 3-D images coming at ya. I had to keep from reaching my hand up to touch the bubbles (or whatever) seemed to be floating in the air right in front of me.After about 20 minute, I started to feel ooky, so took off my glasses and closed my eyes for a few minutes. Had to repeat this several times. But I'm proud to say I made it thru the 1:55 movie length without barfing.It's now 2 hours since I left the theater and I'm still slightly nauseous.However, other people weren't bothered.

I think you have to find out exactly where your head needs to be so you don't see double images -- then pin your head to the back of your seat and DON'T MOVE IT!Another warning: it's pushing the limits for a PG-13 movie.

"Don't expect the poem dressed up in CGI flesh, expect an adrenaline rush, but not  much else","This is an entertaining movie with well produced special effects. However, don't go expecting to have a reasonably accurate introduction to the poem or to satisfy your desire to dig a little deeper into you're Anglo Saxon Heritage and If your child is reading the poem as part of their school curriculum this film will confuse, not help them.The narrative of the film differs greatly from the poem, changing the place and people to which key events happen. Yes the hero is called Beowulf and he's a Geat, if you know the poem, don't expect too much more than that. Most of the key themes of the poem are either turned on their head, given little reference or ignored completely. For instance, the poem carries the themes of brotherhood amongst warriors and of not turning to dark sacrifices and superstition to find relief from your troubles, but instead to Christianity and to the determination to succeed against all odds.This movie in fact frequently finds opportunity to hammer home another theme, i.e. 'This new religion' Christianity being the cause of the peoples sadness and sorrows. In the Poem Beowulf was a Christian, but in the movie only the jealous, cowardly Unferth is portrayed as following this 'new' religion. Since this narrative and theme are nothing to do with the poem. I presume these changes are to suit the opinion of the film makers who created the movie.That aside, if like me, you enjoy a bit of swash buckling and monster mashing, this movie delivers. However, based on the constant exposure of naked torsos and the sexual undertones of the movie and the violence, it really cannot be seen as a genuine attempt to treat the legend with respect. It is a commercial venture aimed at achieving a box office smash. Peter Jackson would have trodden more gently on the bones of the great hero and still made a movie that was manifestly better.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Hollywood slayeth another classic,"""Beowulf"" has survived countless translations, adaptations, debates, interpretations, and readings, and it finally has reached the Silver Screen. Promoted with a beautiful series of posters and a couple of mystifying previews, I wondered whether it would be a successful production.Successful is a matter now of perspective and interpretation. If the film brings in the dollars, it will be clearly referred as a hit. On the other hand, purists and other more discerning individuals may have a bit of a problem with some of what's going on here.In this version, there are some points to admire, including a rather sharp technical 3-D version that highlights some of the production values. There are also a couple of amusing moments, in addition to many rather puzzling changes to the original text. In particular the aversion of the main characters to anything resembling clothes. There are moments when the audience might even wonder about the sexuality of the characters, and Hollywood managed to get a PG-13 rating for this movie.Video game addicts might find some fun in the rather loose adaptation of the classic poem, which is now devoid of soul and engaging action. There are some amusing moments when we see a very thin plot involving a mythical hero and a few rather pesky monsters, and their bewitching mother.Sadly, the action is few and far in between, with most of it happening because the audience gets to exercise their neck muscles avoid being picked or poked at with the many objects Zemeckis managed to ""place"" in front of the camera to showcase the 3-D effects. There is very little memorable in the film, with so much wasted acting talent. Winstone, Wright Penn, and Hopkins are among the casualties of a program that has improved somewhat since ""The Polar Express"" but still manages to show the characters as if they had way too much mead... It looks like stuff is way to powerful to ever lose that glazed look that was spooky in ""Express"" and is rather distracting in this movie.""Beowulf"" is not a classic or a thriller or a very entertaining film. It's another pretty package that fails to deliver what in essence is a timeless tale of the eternal conflict between good and evil. Yet, I do understand that Angelina Jolie's looks is definitely a terrible thing to waste, and was Beowulf Greek? I thought this was a Nordic legend...",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cartoony Violence, Not Poetry","""Beowulf"" has superhuman levels of brawling, which I should have expected from any version based on the story. The violence is somewhat more extreme than I was expecting. It's still comic book or cartoonish violence, lacking the poetry and epic grandeur of language I was hoping for. Instead, the character Beowulf grandiosely declaims a lot of bragging speeches.Somehow, I thought the writers would invent slightly more plot. I was hopeful when John Malkovich's treacherous character showed up, but he wasn't much of a subplot. The monsters are truly amazing, though, and Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie, is gorgeously inhuman. I won't give away the plot twist that Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary wrote to extend the story, except that they could have developed it more. I liked King Hrothgar, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, and he had more of an emotional range than Beowulf, the hero's, character. I'd give this a 6-7 out of 10 -- enjoyable and worth the money, but not required viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Movie for the Uneducated,"Frankly, the movie would be fine if it did not claim to be Beowulf. The film was entertaining if I had not known that the story was not only a little bit interpreted but flat out changed. The makers of this film bank on the fact that most people who see it will have no idea of the true story of Beowulf and will never take the time to see how much of a botch this movie is. Call it something else and change a few names of characters and you could have claimed it was a brand new idea. If you go to this movie, go knowing that it has little to no reference to the actual poems, and after seeing it take the time to read the story as it was written.One final comment, to a person who was heard saying, ""What a wonderful and original story!"" Beowulf was written 100s of years ago. If writers want credit for writing a story, they could at least title it themselves and sell it based on their writing, not based on the fame of the name ""Beowulf"".",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Brilliant,"OH MY GOD. wonderful. Just wonderful. Fun movie on the action/gore stand point. Great exploration of acceptable sacrifices for great power. Go see it. In 3D if possible.I re-read Beowulf two days before I saw the movie. Like so many of those pre-Shakespeare stories, it lacks the . . . interior dimension. There's no discussion of how anyone is thinking. That's the movie's biggest departure from the poem; we know how people are feeling. We know who's willing to make deals with the devil. Well, with with a naked Angelina Jolie. Um. We know why people are willing to make deals with the devil. With a naked Angelina Jolie. Um.And then there's the dragon.And naked Angelina Jolie has a very powerful tail.Gaiman's Beowulf is a fascinating re-telling of the first extant story told in English. The oldest stab we have in English on what it means to be a hero. What it means to stand between the firelight and the darkness and wipe the blood of something inhuman from a sword.On what it means to be a member of a civilization.And Angelia Jolie rises from the old archetypal waters.Go see it.

Beowulf 2007: 6/10,"I felt that Beowulf was a decent movie. The movie was depicted in a different way than the book is written in certain ways. For example, Grendel's mother is depicted as a monster type character in the book, but in the movie she is depicted in a sexual way towards Beowulf. I thought this was kind of weird. Grendel himself also looked a lot different than I imagined, and I think when I say that I can speak for a lot of people.
I also would rate this movie a little lower bc of the animation, which made the movie seem more like a video game.
Aside from the cons, I felt that overall many aspects of the book were included in the movie and the movie was not too much different. For example, most of the characters from the book were included in the movie and the basic plot of the book was the same as in the movie",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf in sheep's clothing?,"Hmmm, an exciting proposition. The director of some of the most enjoyable films of the last three decades in Zemeckis, the writer of some of the most original material in the last three decades in Gaiman, a crop of talented and award-winning actors and a source material so strong that they've been talking about it for a thousand years or so. A winning proposition? You'd think. But, overall, only Gaiman held up his end of the deal for me (neatly covering over the less than cinematic portions of the original text) as this all came together in an oddly flat and somewhat pointless exercise. I think maybe the much vaunted motion-capture performances were what turned me off, as I felt no connection or sympathy with any of the characters. Oh, it was all beautifully rendered and all of that malarkey, but I like my special effects to have a point and I'm not really sure what the point of mo-cap is. It took the heart out of this piece anyway (like tearing the heart from a fabled dragon), leaving a pretty but pointless two hours behind. Oh, quick footnote: Grendel, as portrayed by Crispin Glover, is an absolute show-stealer, and is almost worth the price of admission alone.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
To Have A Pure Glory,"It is not a story about a hero who fights monsters and defeat them, it is a story of a man who seeks glory. While this journey he had to pure his soul from the eager to gold or any other passion, from any promise the devil or ""himself"" can make in order to distract him from his cause, that what makes the story of 'Beowulf' still told not because of 'Grendel' or his mother. In this case 'Beowulf' let himself get tempted by 'Jolie' the mother of all monsters the 'human soul', the result of this temptation led to his end. So the story goes with every hero. I am not sure but this is what I understood from this movie. Despite its beautiful meaning it could have been directed in a much better way, I cannot see the reason why 'Robert Zemeckis' did not make it real life than virtual. But still deserve to be watched.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great visuals coupled with an 'ok' story ...,"I saw Beowulf in IMAX 3D and the opening images were pretty amazing. However, as the story went on, I began to wonder if the effects would make up for a not-quite-so engaging story. My answer is ... not really.I'm glad I saw it, but I take out the 3D effects, I'd drop the rating to a ""5"". If I take out the rich visual details, I might drop it to a ""4.5"".The one thing that happens with great animation and effects is that after a while, you kind of get used to them and they fade to the background. That's what happened here. What one is left with are the characters and story.I can't speak for anyone else, but I really didn't relate to any of characters. Given that the story is based on a poem, it's clear why the characters might be very limited.The same is true for the story. I can see how it stems from a good tale, but the story was delivered in only a ""slightly above average"" manner.The positives are all about the effects: great 3D effects, great action scenes, stunning backgrounds and fantastic facial details. The people behind this aspect of the movie did an amazing job. I also applaud the filmmakers in finally introducing some animation material that goes clearly beyond a ""G"" rated audience.If you're a 3D enthusiast, you need no recommendation - see it! For everyone else, my recommendation is to see only the 3D version and only if you enjoy great visual effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Who would like to experience the film however in its whole splendour, it should absolutely make certain that the respective cinema plays the film in digital 3D or directly directly into a IMAX cinema opens themselves.

"Interesting take on the ""classic""","This movie is not a faithful rendering to the book; in fact, I don't think it was meant to be. Instead, the producers wanted to make a story about stories, how stories were made and told. Some people criticize this movie for distorting the ""classic"", but we must remember that the book was itself a nexus between oral poetry and written text. Much has changed: Beowulf changed from something spoken and heard to something that you can read in your room (or back then, a manuscript in the monastery). And now Beowulf is something you can watch on the big screen.So this movie is about how myths are told and passed down, from one storyteller to another, from the book to Hollywood. Zemeckis is pretty good at mixing genres and poking fun at them, for example Back to the Future III. This movie does just that - it makes fun of the search for the ""authentic"".Great cast - most of the characters are able to escape stereotypes, they have subtle personalities and it's interesting to see how they change through the movie. Beowulf is sort of a bully-like hero, and you actually feel sorry for Grendel, who unleashes his attack, Revenge of the Nerds style, on the human frat parties. Malkovich did a great job, interesting intermediary between being pagan and Christian. Angelina Jolie plays Grendel's milf, quite creepy.I enjoyed this movie (for the above reasons), even though it might scare little kids and disappoint the Old English Literature (Beowulf-is- written-by-Homer-or-Shakespeare) fan club. But hey, watching a movie is supposed to be fun: thinking is optional.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Beowulf"" - Zemeckis-style...","Admittedly, 2007's ""Beowulf,"" the latest adaptation of the classic Old English epic poem with no known author (and is very often required reading in high school), is not a film I paid very much attention to when it was first released two years ago. Home video has been very kind to this picture, however, since it received mixed reviews but was a huge box office success (it earned well over $150 million during its theatrical run) when it was released, due in no small part to its groundbreaking performance-capture CGI technology - improved significantly from director Robert Zemeckis's earlier ""The Polar Express"" (2004).But let's be honest with ourselves: this is not your father's ""Beowulf."" I don't remember the exact details of the epic poem from English 12 my senior year in high school five years ago, but I do not recall that it was a dark, uber-sexy, ultra-bloody affair and treatise on the dangers of pride (this review is based on the unrated director's cut of the film, not the ""PG-13"" theatrical version). Differences aside - major and minor - Zemeckis's ""Beowulf"" is not a bad film, but a different one from what most of us are probably used to reading about, whether in school or for pleasure. In fact, ""Beowulf"" is a ridiculously entertaining film, even if it is prone to slowing down during its quieter moments, and the performance-captured animation is nothing short of beautiful and breathtaking.In 6th-century Denmark, King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) kingdom of Heorot is being terrorized on a nightly basis by the hideous demon Grendel (a frighteningly effective Crispin Glover). To the rescue is the fearless Geat hero Beowulf (Ray Winstone) to battle Grendel and restore peace & tranquility to Hrothgar's kingdom. (Winstone's Beowulf is significantly different from the one in the poem; he's no longer the perfect ""hero,"" but is instead flawed and is much more believably human. He's also prone to strong lapses in judgment when he lets his pride get the better of him.) Those who know the story know the rest of the film's events - Beowulf eventually slays Grendel, and does battle with his mother (Angelina Jolie) and becomes king of Heorot himself, now married to Queen Wealtheow (Robin Wright Penn). And lastly, there is the costly battle with the dragon that comes to terrorize his kingdom a few years later down the road.""Beowulf"" is a breathtaking action-adventure fantasy epic. It looks fabulous, and is appropriately dark, violent and sexy, everything a revved-up Hollywood adaptation of an ancient work of classical literature should be. The animation is advanced enough that it does allow for the characters to express believable amounts of emotion and even display facial expressions. And it's easy to tell who's playing who, since the characters do somewhat resemble the actors playing them, except of course the frightening, hideous monster that is Grendel. That was a brave performance by Crispin Glover, I'll tell you, who manages to make such a ravenous creature sympathetic by making him appear as a misunderstood outsider who is disturbed by the noises coming from King Hrothgar's mead hall and only goes there in an attempt at trying to get some peace & quiet. He's no longer the soulless, evil monster that we might remember from the epic poem, but simply a misunderstood monster-child who's trying to get some sleep, but the greedy, noisy humans who live nearby won't let him. I'm quite surprised that Crispin Glover hasn't gotten better work over the years.And there is also a healthy dose of sex appeal to be enjoyed by members of both sexes. Considering that Ray Winstone looks nothing like his animated on-screen counterpart, the film's animators can be forgiven with taking some creative liberties with the actors. (And Angelina Jolie, presumably the sexiest woman in Hollywood, is certainly enjoying the you-know-what out of her 10-minute cameo here as the seductive, ultra-sexy Mother of Grendel, who eventually manages to seduce Our Hero Beowulf. The movie is certainly worth the ticket price alone just to see her in the nude, with gold body paint covering up her most private of parts, about an hour into the picture. Does anybody know for sure if she was really naked in this movie?)Considering the movie was co-written by comic book artist Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary, I expected the script to be a little bit better. And what I mean is the tendency of the film to slow down toward the middle. Some of the changes that they made to the story can also be forgiven, but it also gives the viewer the impression of how much they were trying inject modern-day religious (read: Christian) themes into the story, which I can't even remember being hinted at in the original epic poem (but then again it's been a while since high school). The character Unferth (John Malkovich) becomes a vocal proponent of the then-new Christian faith and his suggestion early in the picture that King Hrothgar and others pray to the new Roman god is just one prime example of this. It goes to show the viewer the type of modern-day slant the filmmakers were trying to put on the picture.Robert Zemeckis is still one of Hollywood's most valued dealers in groundbreaking special effects-laden spectacles. Even if his ""Beowulf"" is a mixed bag - but a significant upgrade from ""The Polar Express"" five years ago - it is an entertaining film, a ridiculously entertaining and ultra-sexy/ultra-bloody film. If you can, I'd highly recommend watching Zemeckis's director's cut. With this version of the film at least, even though it's got more bloody violence and greater sex appeal, you get the feeling that this is the complete film, and the real story that Zemeckis was really trying to tell, short of the ratings restrictions on the picture.You'll either really love it or really hate it; I think I'm somewhere in the middle.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
The Grendel wants his neighbors to turn the music down!,"Great 3-D animation, good to see the first story ever written in the English language to graduate to such a high degree of technological incarnation. Some of the 3D computer shots actually looked like real pictures of real people. I definitely recommend the movie, and it was entertaining, but it did not follow the original story all that closely, which was a bit of a disappointment for me.Also, the first half of the movie seemed a little odd to me. It really seemed to me that the Grendel was like a person who had noisy neighbors. Ya know? Like, have you ever had neighbors who played loud music at all hours of the night? And all you wanted to do is sleep, but they are partying all night long and you can hear them, so they keep you up? And you just get to a point where you are so frustrated with them and you want them to just shut up, so you bust down their door and start biting all their heads off? That is pretty much how the first part of the movie plays out. And then, after the Grendel kicks everybody's ass and kills the party so he can finally get some peace and quiet, he leaves kind of like, ""Keep the music down or I will come back again and kill you all!"" I've had neighbors like that, so I totally understood where the Grendel was coming from!

So he, his right hand man Unferth (John Malkovich), young trophy wife Wealthow (Robin Wright-Penn) and miscellaneous others settle in for a season of non-stop partying, apparently going on and on until the break-a-dawn.That is until their non-stop boisterous ructions disturb the aurally challenged local 16 foot tall fairy tale creature Grendel, who lives in the mountains a distance away.

The story is apparently a well worn classic, though not one I had heard of until this release, but to me it still seemed quite straightforward and just a little lacking, like a basic Aesop fable stretched to two hours. I loved looking at Beowulf, but after a while I stopped enjoying watching it quite as much.Final Rating ‚Äì 6 / 10. An animated film purpose built for adults, albeit nerdy bookish ones who harbour dreams of Vikings and fantasy creatures. And give me the CGI Jolie over the current real life iteration any day.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Lives up to the hype.,"I saw ""Beowulf"" in IMAX 3-D... and at the risk of sounding like a teenager, I just gotta say: it was, like, totally awesome! Not a life-changing experience, mind you - and I'm sure the 3-D would've been more effective if I'd been in the center of the theater - but no matter how you slice it, this is one of the best movie events of the year. Although it's possibly just as good (and certainly cheaper) if you see the regular 2-D version.The CGI is better than ever, although you may not be able to forget the film's animated (which could be by design - it's nearly aware of its own legend status) and you will certainly NOT forget that it is PG-13. ""Beowulf"" never devolves into anything dirty - there are some metaphors and double entendres (kids won't catch these; some adults in our packed theater clearly didn't) but there's nothing as offensive as what you'd find in a rated-R comedy. There are a couple of bare male rears and a pseudo-nude CGI Angelina Jolie for a minute or so... which didn't look very realistic. It was like an extraterrestrial's rendering of the perfect woman - beautiful, yes, but artificial (which would make sense, story-wise). More like a drawing from an anatomy textbook than a living human.There's some good humor, and the action is simply unbelievably cool - this is one area where the 3-D might have played a major part. Take my word for it - as in ""300"", when it comes to manly men doing manly things, this movie lets it all hang out and does its fair share of earning its violence rating. Grendel is horrible, pitiable and looks amazing - as does the dragon. The battles are as epic, swooping and visually eye-popping as the best parts of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy... you simply need to see for yourself. Just keep in mind that this is all about legends, glamour and exaggeration, and you'll have a total blast.9/10 -- a big BIG recommend.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Good but they didn't go all the way,"I watched this movie on DVD on my laptop and despite this enjoyed it. I suspect the CGI would be much more impressive on a big screen and doubly so in IMAX but I could appreciate it even on such a small screen (squashed as close to my face as possible I might add). At times the effects really are stunning, usually when there is not much movement. When the characters are jumping around or riding horses I found myself unimpressed by the realism. Faces and bodies are, however, on the whole amazing and given some of the models quite breathtaking.Another negative for the film is the wide variety of accents (usually bad). Weird combinations of Scottish, English, Irish and Scandinavian really baffled me, the most bizarre choice for me being that of the Beowulf himself who has an accent that belongs in 'Snatch' or 'Lock Stock..'.The story is loosely based on legend I believe and is in itself quite interesting. The monsters are .. monstrous especially Grendel who really made me squirm! The action is watchable and refreshingly quite believable. The dialog is a bit naff in places but not on a grand scale as in other hero action movies (a positive?).Anthony Hopkin's performance and the presence of Alison Lohman and a surprisingly hot version (given that I don't rate the real version that highly) of Angelina Jolie made this overall watchable. In my opinion they failed to go all the way with it though, and some of my supposedly more artistic and less boyish friends would probably hate it.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Very Sad Attempt,"I had some hope for this film but within the first ten minutes those hopes were completely dashed. The dialog seemed to have been written by 14 year old boys. The ""naughty comments"" were so sophomoric I wondered if I was not watching Porky's 12 instead of Beowulf. The Characters were one-dimensional and their motivations were not only childish, but at times didn't even make any kind of logical sense. I sort of expected this from the trailers, but I was hoping for at least a decent visual movie. Sigh.The CGI in this film was worst than a lot of video game cut away scenes. The hair looked painted on instead of flowing like hair should be. The characters had a very small range of expressions and the design of the film was mostly lacking. All in all visually it was dismal.Last but not least, the story. I don't know if a lot of this film didn't end up on the editing room floor, but the story was not only sophomoric, it was choppy and badly cut.Sony should really question their commitment to computer animated film after this abomination.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf returns to the big screen in a new format.,"""The mother, the hag, she's not my curse. Not anymore.""I think the decision to go entirely with computer animation for this adaptation of Beowulf was a good one. Sure, a live-action movie with practical effects or a mixture of CGI could have been good, but I think the movie stood out more this way, than it would have, otherwise.The animated models look remarkably like their voice actors (you can easily tell who they're based upon, if you didn't know beforehand), and some of the backgrounds and settings are still quite impressive, a few years later. But, that's not to say that the the visuals don't¬†still fall prey to the usual problems that arise when you try to do realistic human animation. Some of the facial expressions look odd, the movement of the characters occasionally seems very jerky and artificial, and almost every pair of eyes looks soulless and dead. As I said, those issues are certainly not unique to Beowulf, but they are here.As for the rest of the movie it's a good action flick that has some humorous moments and enough blood and violence to make it appropriate for teenagers and up. The story really only covers a few events, and there's not much here other than the battles (which are certainly entertaining) and a few talky bits. Don't expect much more than that, and you'll be content.¬†I actually think that Beowolf would have benefited from being made with post-Avatar 3-D technology, but even in 2-D on your TV screen, it's a fun adult adventure.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Flat, cold take on a classic story.","Beowulf - From the maker of Polar Express Roger Zemeckis and writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery (who I'm still sore at for sinking the Silent Hill movie), we have Beowulf, a hero archetype come to life, well sort of. Everyone is layered densely in CGI, and the film exploits the usual weaknesses and strengths of CGI. It's awesome when used to show sea monsters being slaughtered (highly reminiscent of the God of War video game, and if a movie is made of that too, this is likely the formula that will be used) in some fairly cool bloody ways, but just cannot show human emotion as well as the real thing.A monster Grendal (name inspires terror doesn't it?) whose sole power is being bat-s*** hideous (not scary, just really ugly) looking and sole-weakness is slightly stupider that that of the aliens in Signs, comes to town and wreaks havoc in an apparent desire to make the story interesting. Beowulf stops him relatively easily in a pretty cool fight scene, and the rest of the time we have to listen to some mildly boring dialog and some awkward character decisions. Best line? ""There have been many a brave soldier come to taste my husband's mead.""John Malkovich's character beats a cripple at least twice with a stick and repeating in a monotone that the boy is spilling mead, in a scene I'm pretty sure was meant to be comical but comes off as cruel. Why? I didn't really sympathize with anyone. It's too cold in this fantasy world. The CGI gimmick kinda worked against them there. Robin Wright Penn was pretty bland as both eye-candy and in acting. Anthony Hopkins fans should avoid this as his character is frankly embarrassing. Crispin Glover ""plays"" Grendal the same way that Hugo Weaving did a voice-over for Megatron in the Transformers movie earlier this year; completely unrecognizable through a mask of effects to the point where anyone could've played the part. The only person well cast (typecast?) was Brendan Gleeson, as Beowulf's sidekick. Oh, and Angelina Jolie, as seduction itself in as close to a nude-scene as fanboys will get now that she's got all her kids going to see her films.It's got a cool bit with a dragon at the end, but what does it all really matter when I don't care about the characters? Beowulf has an interesting story and one or two decent action scenes, but is mostly forgettable. a C+",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
"""Beowulf"" is a visually stunning movie-going experience, but a so-so movie.","""Beowulf"" may wow audiences with its bombastic re-telling of an Anglo-Saxon epic, but it's too preoccupied with visual indulgence, sweeping camera movements and flat characters usually reserved for elaborate video game prologues. Oh and it's in 3D.""Beowulf"" is a pretty straight-forward story: The buff and boastful warrior Beowulf (""played"" by Ray Winstone of ""The Departed"") must fight and defeat the demon-monster, Grendel (Crispin Glover), who is terrorizing King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) realm. Beowulf later must face the monster's mother (Angelina Jolie) who is an even more terrifying and powerful monster (and Lara Croft look-alike).Competing for your attention are big battles involving heroic and sometimes naked warriors, oozing monsters and fire-breathing dragons, not to mention the over-usage of a semi-nude, digitally-enhanced, gold-covered female demon with a square-ish face reminiscent of bee-stung-lipped Jon Voight, all offering feasts for the eyes and not too much for the brain.Well, that's not completely true; the movie does have a weighty message regarding humanity's pride, lust, and greed, and the consequences that follow when indulging in temporal pleasure for temporal glory. A power-wielding, gold-dripping and naked Barbie doll version of Angelina Jolie sums up the temptation toward these deadly sins when she offers Beowulf everything he's ever wanted.Amidst all of the dragon-slaying and jock Nordic rabble-rousing, the blood-curdling cry of 'the sins of the father' rings loud throughout Beowulf's kingdom years later, calling him to face up to his past sins (see Numbers 23:32). I think director, Robert Zemeckis, along with co-writers, Roger Avary (""Pulp Fiction"") and Neil Gaiman (""Stardust), try to convey a simple ""pride goes before the fall"" message, but their message is lost in all the visual lasciviousness.Speaking of pride, ""Beowulf"" isn't a likable character come to think of it. He's a haughty fool, strutting around exaggerating his mighty feats of monster-slaying and frequently declaring ""I am Beowulf!"" at the top of his lungs. I wonder if he's ever met King Leonidas of Sparta? For the young male target audience, ""Beowulf"" pushes the limits of a PG-13 movie, getting away with much dismemberment, disembowelment and semi-nudity. Zemeckis' clever misdirection emphasizes gore, butts, and boobs under the veil of the movie's unrealistic blend of animation and weird, live-action, motion-capture technology, also used in Zemeckis' previous film, ""The Polar Express"" -- another movie with interesting visuals, dead-looking 'actors', and a somewhat boring story.Not that ""Beowulf"" is totally boring. While I could've done without Beowulf's need to fight in the nude against Grendel, the ""RealD"" experience allows for in-your-face effects like pointy swords, monster tails, guts and slobber, and yes, even Beowulf's butt. However, ""Beowulf"" is very self-conscious of its 3D world, spending a lot of time floating through prickly forests and damp caves, portraying illusions of depth while reminding us of how fake everything really is.I wonder how interesting the visuals would be if it weren't on a big screen and in 3D. If you've ever seen ""Spy-Kids 3-D: Game Over"" or have experienced the 3D shows at Universal Studios, you'll know what I mean. The effect wears off after a while, and you just want something to blow up or get killed so you can stay awake.The movie was a visually stimulating experience, but I couldn't help but think of ""Shrek 4-D"" and how it was almost better because it was shorter. ""Beowulf"" may draw comparisons to films like ""300"" and ""The 13th Warrior"", but only as a reminder that these movies do a better job of wowing us with the use of real people and stronger stories.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
""" Nordic Sages  which told of Men of Iron and Fire Breathing Dragons ""","From the far off lands of Ice and snow comes the fiery tale of a dark land, courageous men, sultry beautiful women and fierce monsters which assailed their cold barren world. This early fable arises in the 6th century A.D. and related a historical Saga of a time when a mythical monster called Grendal, terrorized the Land of The Vikings. Each night when the Danes would decide to celebrate with drinking, dancing, loud songs and boisterous merriment, a gigantic lake dwelling creature named Grendal would invade their Mead-Hall and began killing the men inside. The murderous spree would nightly reoccur until all the men were dead. A ghastly event which continued until the exasperated King finally offered his kingdom to any man who would kill the monster. This movie is called "" Beowulf "" and is based on that particular Nordic Saga. Ray Winstone plays Beowulf and is convincingly believable as the Icelandic hero. The film is a wondrous, action-pack movie and sure to entertain all who see it.. For those seeking excitement in a fantastic, dramatic and dark film, you've found it. It's got all the elements of a black legendary story complete with a fire-breathing dragon. This and a fine cast which includes Sir Anthony Hopkins.

I am Beowulf!!!,"This is my very first review but of course not my first movie. I've seen it in 3D and it looks great that way. That said a movie is not becoming better when more effects are thrown in. This counts for the beginning which is a little dull. Sure, the movie needs intro and you will be drawn into the story once the monster arrives but the beginning is more to enjoy the first effects of the 3D glasses. 3D adds to the movie but in my view 3D has not to be the future of movie watching. Story and the way it is presented should be the main factor at all times. So when the monster arrives the movie begins and it's entertaining to the very end. I like computer generated movies and Beowulf is crafted very well. Motion Capture is an excellent method but the only thing I did not like were the stiff mouths of the woman characters. They were talking as if they had a visit to the dentist. The sympathy you will get for Beowulf will be mixed. He is not a flawless hero and he is quite full of himself but I like these kind of hero's as they stand above the average hero characters in other movies. This plays a main aspect when his weakness appears when confronting the mother of the monster. I think I would be weak too at the point when ultimate beauty seduces you! It's a mature movie and the sexual oriented scenes are not overdone. Beowulf has a body that wants you to stay away from Mac Donalds the next time and Angelina is the ultimate perfection of woman shape. Also if you want to see Anthony Hopkins bum then here is your chance. I don't believe the real actors would go that far but it is all done with taste. The last scenes are spectacular but the movie does not end with full closure. All in all the movie is good and entertaining!",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Ummmm, Yeah.......","You should see this movie, but only if you have too many brain cells and you need to kill a few of them in the most excruciating, gruesome, torturous, and most of all, insulting way possible. They took a literary masterpiece and reduced it to celluloid vomit. Really awful CGI (I don't know what those atrocities at the ends of their arms were, but they occupied the same space that hands would on a human being); the graphic work looks like it was done by a bunch of pre-pubescent boys given excellent rendering software, and absolutely no training in its use. The audience was laughing at the absurdity of a really awful movie trying desperately to take itself seriously (think ""Anaconda""). Aside of a nice dragon rendition, and a nifty fight scene between Beowulf and Grendel, there is absolutely nothing to recommend about this movie, and those two bits were ten minutes out of two of the most painful hours I can remember suffering through in a theater. A root canal would be more enjoyable. Pathetically bad doesn't even begin to describe it. The storytelling was low grade Jerry Springer at best. A complete waste of a talented cast.

"""Beowulf"" isn't really ""Beowulf""","As other people have noted, the story in ""Beowulf"" is quite far from the content of the original poem - so far, in fact, that I feel it was misleading to call this film ""Beowulf"" at all. Whereas, say, Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is essentially faithful to its source material, this film twists the source material so far that it becomes substantially a different story.In fairness to the film, it does explore some interesting themes. One theme is how legends tend to grow and become distorted in the re-telling, as the legend of Beowulf is shown becoming distorted in the re-telling even during his own lifetime. And corollary to that is the idea that people tend to believe what they want to believe; although Beowulf offers no direct proof of the witch being dead, for example, they want to believe it and so it becomes accepted as part of the story. Also noteworthy is the theme of a hero sowing the seeds of his own downfall.That being said, I feel this film reflects too much the skeptical point-of-view of modern times, where we tend to receive heroic tales with skepticism and doubt about the real motives and motivations of those involved. Compared to the original character, this Beowulf seems not only flawed but downright devious, and I think that treatment doesn't do justice to the character. Also, the cartoonified style of the film didn't appeal to me personally; since the point of the film seems to be to treat Beowulf as a flawed human being with conflicted motivations (more like one of us ordinary people than a legendary noble hero), wouldn't a realistic film style be more appropriate? That style might work for a film like ""300"", but here it was distracting at best and jarring at worst, reminding me too much of a video game.And what to say about the witch depicted by Angelina Jolie - so different from the witch of the poem that she's almost an entirely different character? The titillating semi-nudity is so gratuitous that it's almost comical, right down to the strange detail of modern-looking high heels (in the 6th century A.D.?) That sort of thing makes me wonder if this is the sort of film that's trying to do too much at once - pandering to the lowest common denominators of taste with crude violence and sex while simultaneously trying to deconstruct an epic poem; maybe that's just too tall an order.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Turning one of the oldest stories in history to this centuries latest in pure action-adventure.,"My Take: A thrilling summer movie blockbuster.BEOWULF is perhaps the oldest story that Hollywood still takes pride in making. Remember the very memorable battle between Beowulf, the monster Grendel and the monster's mother? And the moral that pride is the curse? Well, its Hollywood's proudest pleasure to give you the new BEOWULF, the new motion-capture animated baby from the father of the craft (or at least the one who uses it the most), Robert Zemeckis. Although BEOWULF still has those emotionless-eyed motion-capture drones and has a big dose of silly dialog, BEOWULF is an ideal model of an action-packed summer movie adventure. Filled with thrilling moments and heart-pounding battles, BEOWULF is an action fans playhouse, and if your home entertainment system's built for the job, this is a real killer on DVD! On the basis of script, however, Zemeckis still hasn't found the perfection. The dialog is made up of the cheesy old-English dialog that's bound the produce a giggle. Although there are real intentional humor in the film, some are still on the verge of camp. The scene where Beowulf fights with the monster evenly by being naked is still hilarious.On the action however, Zemeckis is one heck of a carnival barker. Moments of thrills and excitement are at an abundance. From the moment where Grendel breaks through a feast, entirely shot in darkness, is often chilling. Then of course there's Beowulf battling the monster and even a large dragon in the end (and this is a PG-13). That's pure Hollywood, and that's pure action entertainment.Ask for the actors, we have Ray Winstone as the brave but foolhardy Beowulf (with help from a macho model double), Anthony Hopkins plays the drunken mad Hrothgar, Robin Wright Penn is Wealthhow, Hrothgar's (and later Beowulf's) wife. But Angelina Jolie stills stands out above the rest, baring it all (well, his animation that is) as the monster Grendel's (voiced by Crispin Glover, by the way) mother, vowing vengeance when her monster child was killed (the scene where she emerges all gold, with high heels will just crack you up).The movie's a great example of how a cheesy old sword-and-sorcery flick can become the next best action movie coming out for the summer. It's a lot of fun and I doubt you'll be bored.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Great fun!,"Spectacular animated action scenes turn the ancient epic poem Beowulf into a modern fantasy movie, while motion-capture technology transforms plump actor Ray Winstone (Sexy Beast) into a burly Nordic warrior. When a Danish kingdom is threatened by the monster Grendel (voiced and physicality by Crispin Glover, River's Edge), Beowulf--lured by the promise of heroic glory--comes to rescue them. He succeeds, but falls prey to the seductive power of Grendel's mother, played by Angelina Jolie... and as Jolie's pneumatically animated form rises from an underground lagoon with demon-claw high heels, it becomes clear that we're leaving the original epic far, far behind. Regrettably, the motion-capture process has made only modest improvements since The Polar Express; while the characters' eyes no longer look so flat and zombie-like, their faces remain inexpressive and movements are still wooden. As a result, the most effective sequences feature wildly animated battles and the most vivid character is Grendel, whose grotesqueness ends up making him far more sympathetic than any of the mannequin-like human beings. The meant-to-be-titillating images of a naked Jolie resemble an inflatable doll more than a living, breathing woman (or succubus, as the case may be). But the fights--particularly Grendel's initial assault on the celebration hut--pop with lushly animated gore and violence.

"Disappointed, Disgusted, Depressed","A misunderstanding as to the fundamental nature of this movie ruined it for me from the opening scene; I had been under the impression, as were the three people I saw the movie with, that it was to be either (largely) live-action, such as the Lord of the Rings, or CGI-assisted, such as The 300, when in fact the film is entirely animated (I was frequently reminded of Shrek, an unpleasant comparison at best given the epic nature of the Beowulf legend). Some of the characters appeared decidedly cartoon-like, and the range of motion, activity, etc. was definitively so (the film was most strongly reminiscent of Shrek in this particular aspect, but the individual characters were frequently of no higher quality than the major ""normal human"" characters who share said green ogre's adventures). Additionally, the creators of Beowulf seem to have been a bit confused as to their target audience, with moments straight from Disney-type film antics sprinkled liberally throughout moments of both male and female nudity (often up-close) and the graphic detailing of people screaming as they burn to death; the final rating of PG-13 strikes me as being a frustrated ""average"" of the film's content (only modern-day 'foul language' is conspicuously absent). Major plot scenes are dominated largely by a ghastly, overdone running gag of almost-but-not-quite spotting Beowulf's ""third leg"" (a reference made in the movie itself, as well)... before something inevitably -- and in a most contrived manner -- obstructs the view. Once or twice might have been funny, if a bit inappropriate; more than a dozen times in a scene is downright ridiculous. Beavis and Butthead would've stopped laughing by the time Beowulf's writers are finished not-quite-flashing you. A much better, purer, more epic version of the movie could have and should have been done, with real actors and well-written dialog.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Win Beowulf's money,"There come times when tales are retold for modern audiences. Not only that, but to tell it in a way that it is almost a new story. And that is the result here in the CGI 2007 version of Beowulf.The story was changed in such a way that the original hero Beowulf loses his edge. Instead of killing Grendel's mother, Beowulf spares her and gives her a son. Much like the king, that Beowulf came to save, did before him. And so he lies about it the rest of his life. Which makes the character less interesting because it doesn't stick to the epic.The CGI is rather well done. The action was good as well as the acting.

Beowulf: A great animated movie!,"I must say that it made a long time that an animated movie has had me captivated that much. In fact, it made a long time I had SEEN an animated movie. However, Beowulf had me really captivated. I must say that I admire Robert Zemeckis' work on this movie. The animated characters looked so real that I was thinking about real actors at some parts of the film. Though many characters(like Angelina Jolie's and Anthony Hopkins') were a bit unrealistic, however, their faces were actually recognizable. The battle scenes are kind of like in 300. My only negative point is that there is a few long scenes that last 20 minutes instead of 10(which would have been perfect).Beowulf is a great movie with a lot of great animation. If you are searching for an action movie, then you won't be disappointed with Beowulf. However, don't bring the kids along!!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Robert wants to show you his new toys,"Robert Zemeckis has a new toy. Two new toys, actually. After fiddling with cartoons and archive footage in ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and ""Forrest Gump"" respectively, he's now using motion capture digital technology rather than film. But he's done it before so this time he's going to use it with 3D. Unfortunately, I watched this at home. So the film is left to stand on its actual merits, rather than its gimmicks.That's a shame really, because watching the film I could sense that in full IMAX 3D this would have been bangs-for-your-bucks, jump out of your seat fun. Whenever he has the opportunity to, Zemeckis throws things at the camera and moves it in such an incredibly fluid manner that on a really, really big screen it would thrill. Unfortunately, all I was left with was the narrative.The film's problems start early on. The opening is garish and, without the benefit of the 3D, overblown. It sets the tone for the rest of the film rather well. The characters chew their way through the dialogue before the first attack from Grendel, which has so much violence that it puts Tarantino in the shade. It is a miracle that this film, with all of its blood and guts, not to mention essentially full on nudity, received a PG-13 in America and a 12A (it's British equivalent). Don't let anyone younger than 12 see this film.It is a full quarter of an hour before Beowulf arrives. He receives extremely little time for development, which is the same for all of the characters, but this film isn't really here for that. It's a cheap thrills picture, and Zemeckis delivers them by the barrelful. But, many of them, whilst grand on scale, have something wrong with them. Beowulf's first fight, for instance, is done as an Austin Powers gag, with the nude Beowulf's manhood being covered with helmets, spears and swords. What would Freud say? There are strong points. Winstone, in his CGI form, is very good as the lead, Angelina Jolie turns up as Angelina Jolie and does very well, whilst Sir An-TH-ony Hopkins seems to be enjoying himself a lot. However, the quality of the CGI is astonishing. There are a few things that look dodgy, such as the horses and the fire, but at times it is photo-real even if the artistry of the animation and the creation of the images are nowhere near those of ""Ratatouille"" which was released in the same year.However, there are weak points, most of all John Malkovich, who is so wooden that he is largely indistinguishable from the large cross he waves around. But the real problem with the film is that it isn't really a film. It is a bunch of gimmicks, designed to thrill rather than entertain, and now that it has passed away from the 3D screens it will not last.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
good computer graphics but doesn't stay true to the poem,"The computer graphics in this film reminded me of a video game. They are good and look realistic for the most part. And since you aren't dealing with real actors, it made the fighting scenes a little more adventurous. I thought the sexual jokes weren't needed, I mean they are cartoon characters.In the movie, Beowulf is ready to accept King Hrothgar's challenge to kill Grendel. Grendel looks more human in the movie than usually depicted in other films. So, Beowulf fights him naked for some reason, because that is not in the poem. So, there is always some strategic placed object when showing Beowulf from the front or a dark shadow. I don't get why they had him take off his pants. He kills Grendel but then is seduced by his mother, whom is voiced by the beautiful Anjelina Jolie. Her character is drawn to resemble Jolie's face. He makes a deal with the mother, and is given the Kingdom. Some how the a charm was placed on Hrothgar and he kills himself. I don't think that was in the poem.One day, Beowulf's son shows up in the form of a dragon. What!!! How does that happen. So, the last part is him battling a dragon.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, I recommend it if you like adventure movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Failed epic falls short of 300 standard,"Beowulf wants badly to be an epic movie, with its heroes and kings, its wondrous vistas, its dragons, and its evil demons, and it certainly is a pretty fair film. It's sort of a combination of 300 and The Polar Express and leans heavily on CGI effects to sell itself. This usually works, but as with Polar Express the facial expressions of the humans look more like a snazzy video game than anything approaching realistic.Most Americans learned about the tale of Beowulf in high school, about how the young hero slayed the creature Grendel and became a legend. Here, Beowulf's tale is expanded and clarified; what really happened when he strode into that cave to take on the murderous demon? Turns out that Grendel's got a mom, and she's not the forgive-and-forget kind, and before you know it, Beowulf's sliding down a slippery slope of his own device.Voiced by Ray Winstone, the youthful Beowulf and his band of warriors arrive in Denmark to slay the beast that's been terrorizing the towns. King Hrothgar (Anthony Perkins) has offered half the riches of his kingdom to whomever can lift their curse. Grendel does come, and after slaying some of Beowulf's men (including biting off a head and chewing it), he's finally taken down by Beowulf himself with his bare arms - but that's just the beginning of Beowulf's troubles, as Grendel's mom is a bit unhappy.The voice characterizations are top notch. It's good to see the gifted Winstone get some work as the hero, because he doesn't really fit the mold of matin√©e idol; he's more of a craggy, rough-looking character. But here, he's as smooth as Russell Crowe, thanks to the wonders of CGI. Hopkins is his usual Anthony Hopkins self (sorry, I mean Sir Anthony), lending gravitas that a king should have. Jolie, it should be noted, was a bit unhappy with the resulting CGI for her role, which showed perhaps a bit more skin than the actress had intended to have shown. (Sure, it's not actually her body, but it looks like her, so...) But she's silkily cruel as the water demon out to avenge her son. Offering stout support as always are Brendan Gleeson and John Malkovich, as Beowulf's right-hand man and the king's top commander, respectively. Robin Wright Penn is merely okay in a rather important role as the queen; amazingly, she doesn't look nearly as gorgeous as the real-life Wright Penn does.But it's the CGI of the humans that I found a little off putting. Rather than looking seamless in a pseudo-comic-book style, as in 300, the people here look a bit creepy, as if they were originally created to appear in some cheesy 3-D porn. I mean some cheesy Flash animation. As with the earliest Pixar films, the animation of humans just doesn't look right; with The Polar Express (directed by Robert Zemeckis, as was Beowulf), the people looked almost creepy and lacked a large range of expressions.Beowulf is an exciting action movie and contains plenty of intense, well-animated combat scenes, but it falls a little short of being the technical marvel or full-bore sweeping epic that it wants to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
A remarkable gore fest.,"All over the world, fans of the God of War games want a movie based on the adventures of Kratos, with all the specific elements: gore, vulgarity, nudity and battles. Bloody, bloody battles. Unfortunately there is no God of War movie. But Beowulf is closest thing we have.Beowulf is an old medieval poem about a Northern hero, Beowulf, who came to help the people get rid of menacing monsters. And that is pretty much the story here. Grendel (Crispin Glover), a demon with sensible ears, turns a grand feast into a blood bath. King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is in luck: a man who calls himself Beowulf (Ray Winstone) and his men arrive, claiming that they can defeat the demon. After a hard-earned success, Beowulf has to face an even greater challenge: Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), while his influence and power grows.The plot has little to no subplots, is linear and very solid. That's not the problem of the movie. The problem is that it doesn't manage to impress. Yes, it's based on a legend, but that doesn't mean it could rival the Lord of the Rings. Certain elements are keeping Beowulf away from the 5 star milestone.First of all, the voice acting and acting are great, the actors are well-known, no complaints. BUT there still are two actors who stick out like a sore thumb - Malkovich and Jolie. John Malkovich plays Unferth, a Rasputin-like counselor of the king, who is at first sceptic about Beowulf. He's so stiff, I don't know where to begin... Then there's Jolie, but here it's not about acting, but about choice. She just isn't right as Grendel's mother, I couldn't buy it. I was like "" Lara Croft is confronting Beowulf?"". There are tons of actresses who could have had the role. By the way, since when do medieval demons wear modern-day shoes?But the most obvious oddity is the full CG. Everything is CG, from actors to landscapes, and honestly, it looks incredibly well - photo-realistic, superb effects, fabulous animation. But you still know that it's artificial. They went to such lengths to animate and create everything, when they could have just used the REAL actors and just made it live-action. Okay, this isn't a flaw, it's the director's style and whether you like it or not - it depends on taste.The movie is full of gore, nudity, epic music, great acting and marvellous effects. Unfortunately, the plot development, several flaws and two actors are pulling it down.Final Verdict: Awesome. The should make a game based on this...wait...Final Score: 3.5/5 or 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why waste so many great effects?,"I was excited at the thought of a film that was not limited, in anyway, by stunts and fight scenes. However while enduring the ""action packed"" film, it was apparent that the realistic effects had become so realistic that they had incorporated the real life limitations. Accept for a few moments of excitement the film lacked the over the top and adrenalin filled action that being completely computer animated would have allowed. The story itself is a great legend..however with the huge amount of changes to the tale it is barley recognisable. This is a film you should see if you want to check out the amazing similarities between the actors and their animated characters, however if you want a good film, with action and a strong story.....take a trip to blockbuster and rent the original Beowulf! a much better film.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
WAY better than i thought!,"I don't know what this guy is talking about...just because a movie isn't constant, mindless, bloody action doesn't mean its boring. If you want a movie like that go see 300 for the 60th time. Beowulf is far superior to 300 in many ways. Better characters, better story, better everything. And just because this movie isn't an exact copy of the original Anglo-Saxon poem doesn't mean its flawed. The original poem is a legend based on factual events. The sheer fact that the story is over 1,500 years old means that it has been morphed and skewed thousands of times compared to the original. The acting was excellent, the plot was an interesting and original interpretation of the poem and it was very entertaining all the way through. I'll agree that this movie was kind of cheesy at some parts but I thought it was necessary to show Beowulf's enormous ego and his tendency to stretch the truth when telling of his exploits. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants to see an entertaining, fun, and well-done piece of cinema. I'm not saying this is the greatest movie ever, but it FAR surpassed my expectations. Don't listen to the joker above me...please.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Still prefer The Thirteenth Warrior,"The movie was overall good but i still liked the Thirteenth Warrior better. yes even though the thirteen warrior doesn't exactly follow the Beowolf story as well as this i found it more entertaining. Beowolf's CGI though for the most part was excellently done with a few minor exceptions. i felt that i needed more from the actors though, some of them were a little lackluster. Still its an OK movie. Yet, it would be one to take little kids to in my opinion. the movie does involve a little gore even though its ""cartoonish"" i still think that the little kids would receive nightmares from it. i haven't had the chance to see the 3-d version but for me this is a one time watch in the theater.overall go see this movie at least once but if your not that hyped about it i'd wait for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Water Demons don't wear high heels,"This movie is pure trash. The CGI hasn't aged well, and, other than getting to see Angelina Jolie nude, (with no nipples!) there isn't much point.

Beowulf and Grendel was a better movie, good live action filmed in Iceland where the weather was as important a character as the cast.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
An awesome CGI adaptation of the epic,"Beowulf's epic story is among the oldest in English literature, and only two films have adapted it: ""Beowulf and Grendel"" and this incredible CGI animated film. To choose which is the best Beowulf film, I chose this one. This film is truly an adrenaline-rusher, with marvellous casting and visual effects. You know, the CGI looked almost like live action, but I know it's CGI; it's in the hair.Queen Weathlow captivated me when she enchanted Beowulf in the film. They seemed like a charming couple at first, but as the story progressed, I began to question their relationship. I also love it when she sings. I still think it's an excellent film. That's all I have to say.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
Reasonable but i prefer normal 2D,"Looking at the crew Beowulf was bit of a disappointment they had Robert Zemeckis as the Director (Forrest Gump and Back To the Future). Roger Avary as the writer (Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs). And of course one heck of a cast Ray Winstone,Anthony Hopkins,Robin Wright, Brendan Gleeson,John Malkovich and of course Angelina Jolie. Main problem with the film is the 3D i mean it looked like Shrek. I strongly believe they used normal special effects like what they used in Lord of the Rings. Parts of the story line are a bit mad for instance the swimming race at the start was incredibly stupid another mistake was that these men were Danish but all everyone had eider Welsh,Irish or Scottish accents none even close to a Danish accent. Beowulf had some stupid ideas but Robert Zemeckis did a good job but not good enough to give it a high score but good enough for a reasonable score.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
alright but not grate,"Just this minute got back from seeing a free preview of Beowulf and OH MY GOD! This is a cracking film and I highly recommend everyone goes to the cinema to see it (it's a cinema experience for sure!). Not only that, but it's 3D (which I wasn't aware of) or rather the all new 3D (no more red/green glasses). Everyone in the audience was given what looked like cheap-ass shades, but they did the job wonderfully and fitted snugly over my regular specs.As for the movie, the plot was tight and well scripted, the voice acting was great (Ray Winstone rocks), the action was breathtaking, some of the CGI was unbelievably gorgeous and the music and incidental sound was great! The only downside for me was some of the CGI. It seemed apparent that given an unlimited budget, this movie would have looked phenomenal in every scene, but unfortunately the budget wasn't unlimited and it shows in a number of places. Nothing looks horrible, but you can tell that they had to pick and choose where to go for high detail. The movie also suffers from the age old, it's creepy because it's almost perfect.As for the 3D, apart from an awesome intro, nothing seems to be done just to exploit 3D, it's all very natural and adds an amazing level of detail to the movie. The depth of vision you get is truly breathtaking in parts.Quite honestly I wasn't expecting much from this movie having seen the trailer, but I was blown away.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Uneven,"Though familiar with the story on which the film was based, I was lost on several occasions or merely lost interest in the plot line. Use of unintelligible dialogue only served to confuse the telling of the story and the fleshing out of the characters and their motivation. The various British dialects, faked or otherwise, did not help with the Viking characters actual or mythological.The film does not compare favourably with the 2005 live action story ""Beowulf and Grendel"" filmed in Iceland. The animation/graphics were innovative but it got stale quite fast. I guess I expected more especially from a rather stellar cast like Anthony Hopkins, Ray Winston and even Angelina Jolie. Could have been better all round!!",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't Waste Your Money,"Please, everyone, don't even bother going to a movie theater to watch this ""thing"".

BTW this is the first movie i ever give a classification lower than 5 points, so you better believe me this ""thing"" is just too bad, and don't take your kids to see it either, the so called ""hero"" spends all movie ""austin powers"" naked and every time there is a battle you can see blood everywhere.

Interesting Twist,"OK. I wasn't expecting that the epic would be true point by point to the original and certainly wasn't expecting all the CGI treatments. However, I liked the twist on the original saga with the themes of greed, lust and power, all of which drive the political mechanism in culture and society. The perspective then becomes one of power corrupting, as both the old and young kings fall prey to the inner weakness of power, fame and glory. Beowulf's redemption is gained through self-sacrifice; his predecessor and successors' are left ambiguous and the mother as archetype of lust, greed and power remains eternal. Nice touch. Lots of fun things with Malkovich, Gleeson and the ever wonderful Tony Hopkins. Crispin Glover, although hard to recognize under all that CGI, is his usual competent self and the lasses, Robin Wright Penn and Alison Lohman are beautiful and sexual-- and then, there's Angelina Jolie who steals the scene each time with her dark, seductive beauty. Winstone with his Cockney toughness comes across well as the vulnerable hero and the battle scenes are wonderful albeit, a bit intense. So, if you want to read the original, for gosh sakes read Seamus Heaney's masterful translation rather some of the older stodgy versions. But, if you just want some great entertainment, see this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Another performance capture from Zemeckis,"I like Robert Zemeckis as a filmmaker. Who framed Roger Rabbit and Forrest Gump were excellent and Back to the future was creative. Yet he has become obsessed with performance capture. I think it looks rather silly, like it does not know whether it is live action or animation. After his children's' story The Polar Express, Zemeckis takes on the Dark Ages Poem Beowulf, casting Ray Winstone as the title character. Winstone acted, but his appearance is changed to make him look more buff. Incorrect portrayal of the ancient poem's story, (I guess Zemeckis was counting on no one having read the poem or understood it) and the performance capture has made strides, but still fails as a dramatic medium. I wish that Zemeckis would have chosen literacy over visuals here.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Beowulf,"Beowulf is an animated film based on an old English poem thought to be written between the 8th and 11th century and nobody has ever known who the author was and people still do not know, but the poem has become very popular throughout the years and has been the basis for other films as well. The film is animated using a technique called motion capture where the film's directors would film action and things in motion by the film's actors and later animate it over with 3 dimensional animation. The same technique was used a couple of years ago in the film The Polar Express also by Beowulf director Robert Zemeckis. The film takes place in late 500 AD in England and is about a village that is terrorized by a monster named Grendel who frequently comes to the surface of the Earth and kills whoever is being merry and making music. King Hrothgar sends for a warrior named Beowulf to slay Grendel and after doing so, Beowulf soon becomes king of the land, but a lie that he has covered up with his famous battle will soon come back to haunt him and the kingdom. I think because of the animation and visual style of the film and also because it's story and action sequences that people will compare this film to this year's earlier film 300. While I gave 300 a pretty favourable review on this site mostly because of the visuals I felt that the visuals were better than the story and film itself, but luckily Beowulf uses great animation and visuals along with a truly exciting and entertaining story. Beowulf is a beautiful film to look at because of it's animation and I thought the story was full of action and excitement which was enough to capture my interest for the film's length. I have always been into mythology and stories of that kind, so for that reason Beowulf also intrigued me even more and I think that today there is a large audience into the sword battle and monster films, so I think this film should appeal to many and with it's great pace it will surely entertain. The only thing I had a problem with in this film was a few lines of dialogue that the screenwriters put in that were unintentionally funny in a crude kind of way when I don't think they were particularly meant to be, so for that reason I don't think those few scenes really fit in and I noticed the audience laughed like I did at said moments, so I knew I wasn't the only one with this complaint. Those lines and scenes just didn't suit a serious film like this. However this is only a real mild complaint while the rest of the movie I enjoyed immensely because of the fascinating story, the non stop action and the visual beauty of the animation. This is one of the best animated films of the year so far and I think if people were to ignore those few scenes and lines of dialogue I mentioned above then they should be in for a good time as well as a visually stunning experience as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
My Review on the Movie,"The movie ""Beowulf"" is based off an old English poem which is also known as ""Beowulf."" So which is superior? That's up for you to decide. The movie is full of action and medieval humor.But this review will consist of my opinion and my feelings on the movie. I have read the story of Beowulf a few times, and when I first saw the trailer for the movie, I was a little disappointed when I saw then Grendle's Mother took the shape of a human, let alone a seductive one. When I entered the theater, I was hoping that would be the only thing different from the story. Alas, I was wrong. The movie is almost a mockery to the actual story. Granted that it was action packed, and in some places humorous but it just didn't feel the same.Another thing I'd like to point out is that, like the story, this movie's target audience was guys, with the fighting, the glory, the riches and so on. However that doesn't mean it was without things that would draw in women too. There were plenty of scenes with young, fit men wearing nothing but a headband (The sex organ was always blocked by fog or a cleverly placed object). There was also a naked Angelina Joline (or at least a digital version of her) for the guys.On a personal note, I request that nobody should mistake me for somebody who approves of sex being a way of drawing in audience. Because I don't approve of it as it is demeaning and a clear sign of bad writing.So I'm going to wrap it up here and give my final opinions. If you're a person who loves ancient literature and are hoping to see the story of Beowulf acted out on screen, you may be disappointed. If you wish to see this movie so you don't have to read the story for a book report or whatever, this movie will lead you to a failing grade. But if you're looking for an action packed movie, with a good story, this movie may be right for you. While I was disappointed in how the movie was so different from the actual story, I do feel the did a decent job on their version.So from my point of view, I give this story a rating of 3 out of 5 stars, but that's mostly because I was looking forward to a visual version of the ancient tale of Beowulf, only to be let down.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
This movie is nothing but bare asses,"Robert Zemeckis. When was the last time he made a masterpiece of film-making? Ah yes, it was 14 years ago when he directed Forrest Gump. That was his one accomplishment in life. Unfortunately, it was also his only accomplishment as a director that is still revered to this day. Beowulf however is a cinematic disASSter. Yes, Beowulf is a CGI character and he gets naked to fight a giant screaming monster. Doesn't that seem a little gay to you? Then I guess to compensate for all the bare asses in the film, Zemeckis tries to make it up to us by having CGI women's boobs flop around. As a heterosexual man though I have to say that I feel more shame than pride when seeing a CGI woman's boobs. This movie is certainly not appropriate for audiences under 13, or even under 86. It's more appropriate for those who have boob and ass fetishes. Beowulf features lots of people dying quite horribly and in many gruesome manners. The sound may have been louder than it was supposed to be, but the screaming was so obnoxious and loud it made me want to walk out of the movie, and that's exactly what I did! It may have action but the majority of it takes place in a hall with a bunch of drunken and obnoxious patrons, it feels claustrophobic to me. They made a noble attempt to have the CGI look real, but it looks horrible, looks fake and I can't help but think about freaking Shrek. The movie is not character or story-driven. Hell, it's not driven at all. There is nothing to this movie. If you really have to know an account of the story of Beowulf, then go do yourself a grand favor and read the freaking book instead please. I can guarandamntee you 100% less bare asses and boobs in the book.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Hybrid of Live Action And Animation. But Is It For You?,"A $150 million budget. A realistic Healthow voiced by Robin Wright Penn. An even more realistic Hrothgar voiced by Anthony Hopkins (BOBBY). John Malkovich (BURN AFTER READING) as Unferth. Ray Winstone (THE DEPARTED) as the dominating Beowulf. And the sexiest woman alive, Angelina Jolie (WANTED) as Grendel's deceptive mother. I mean, what a cast! This is what great films are made of. And the realism of the computer animation in terms of how they resembled the actual actors was astonishing ...which begged a pretty big question: WHY NOT SIMPLY FILM BEOWULF WITH LIVE ACTION AND NOT ANIMATION?! Cost was probably an issue, but with the $150 million budget I think they could've done a fine live action film. In 2005 Icelandic director Sturla Gunnarson proved it could be done with his very nicely done BEOWULF & GRENDEL starring Gerard Butler (300). With comparable run times (103 minutes to 114 minutes) and Beowulf & Grendel's much lower budget (I believe it was around $75 million), it can be done and done well if you have the inclination. But, for whatever reason, director Robert Zemeckis (MONSTER HOUSE) decided to shoot it this way.It may sound as if I'm bashing animated films in general, which I'm not. There are some really great ones out there (FINDING NEMO, HOODWINKED, etc.), so animation can be pulled off if care is taken to present it as such. But with Beowulf, it seems they were trying to mix live action with animation in order to produce some sort of hybrid ...which simply didn't work for me. It might for some and that's fine, but, if you're going to show realistic characters that look like the actual actors, why not simply do live action? It's so maddening! It was nice, however, to see some care taken with the source material (namely Neil Gaiman's reimagining of the epic poem by the same name). Beowulf had some shady dealings and it was refreshing to see this brought out in the story and not simply showing him as some flawless hero.Still, if you're into animation, this one might not work for you. Or if you're solely a live action fan, this one might REALLY bug you. So beware. You've been warned.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Visually impressive and enjoyable fantasy,"A well rendered computer generated fantasy inspired by the epic anglo-saxon poem Beowulf, from which it derives its title. Pedants will argue over the deviations from the classical text but, frankly, I couldn't care less.The voice acting is generally very good, although it takes a little while to get past some of the accent choices, and it's easy to become immersed in the film and become less conspicuously aware that your watching CGI.It's not a film without its share of minor frustrations either. Robin Wright Penn's portrayal of a jaded, world-weary queen did not translate well to her computer generated character on screen, which seemed annoyingly bland and wooden among an otherwise very charismatic cast.Overall, a very enjoyable movie that is worth watching.Note: Although most computer generated PG-rated movies are child-friendly, note that this is PG-13. It is dark and blood-splattered in places. This may not be a good film for younger children.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Flawed but enjoyable,"I was not familiar with the story of Beowulf before I saw this movie, so I really have no qualms about what was changed in the story (since the tale itself had undergone through many changes though the centuries anyway).The main problem here was really the animation. It distracted me from the movie, and that's the last thing you want as a film-maker experimenting with FX. Like so many, I felt like I was watching a really long cut scene from a Playstation 2 RPG instead of a movie. Actually, ""Final Fantasy: Advent Children""'s animation is a LOT better and that came out first.I get the idea, this is an experiment in motion-capture and CG effects, but it did not do this movie any favors. However, once you give up and accept the movie as it is, it's a lot of fun. It's not for little kids though, as there's a lot of violence, but it's all so unrealistic and exaggerated that you don't really care.And at times, this is a bizarre film. Sometimes the characters speak in Old English, in others with Scottish accents, and in a very funny scene (but completely out of place), the vikings sing songs using modern (and offensive) slang. So this movie is clearly not for purists.The one great thing that this movie had was the music. Alan Silvestri did a great job here, and the soundtrack is worth buying. From the opening theme to the Queen's lovely harp chanting, the music is awesome and worthy of an epic. Unfortunately this is not the case with the rest of Beowulf. It's a fun action-fantasy story and an enjoyable experience, but instantly forgettable.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Eyes with no expression and  the first pair of stilettos,"The 3D effect is fantastic, and only for it, it's worthwhile to see the film in the cinema. The worst thing by far is the fact that none of the characters' eyes have any expression. They look as if they were thinking, looking at the background instead of the person they are talking to. It took me too long to get used to it in the film. The flames and the seashore also suffer from looking as it they were made ten years ago, technologically speaking. The camera angles created, give great fun to the 3D effect. Angelina appears to have grown a pair of stilettos that don't fit at all in the film, and I did find over the top how many times they childishly hid Beowulf's ""talents"".",6.0,Anonymous,Animation

Not much of a story really and they seemed to drag what little there was out just to fill the time and make it long enough to show.

"Entertaining, Insightful, Impressive, Beautiful, but also Cartoonish","I really enjoyed watching this movie, as did my wife (who normally doesn't gravitate towards an action/adventure genre).Most of my comments will have already resonated with other's commentThe Good:Well paced with balanced character development for a PG Action Adventure. Insight (not necessarily historically accurate) into the Beowulf poems, but definitely stays in the spirit of the myth. Nice addition - showing Beowulf as a fallible hero. CGI is amazing - esp. in 3-D as long as your eyes can adjust. Some scenes, particularly the Viking ship scene, might even send a shiver up your spine. Good use of Norse (or Olde English?) in critical places throughout the movie..The Bad:* Not enough Angelina :-) although her character, when she(it) appears, is very striking with her ""suit"" of liquid gold.The Ugly:* While the main characters like Beowulf and Hrothgar seem to have had MUCH attention paid to the detail of their CGI generated faces (esp. the male characters who look just like their reality counterparts), the more minor the characters seemed to get, the more they looked like they came out of Goth version of Shrek. Also, they apparently decided to use the same algorithm for the motion of ALL the horses in the movie - which made them look comically mechanical - straight out of a video game.Conclusion:Although the violence borders on over-the-top, it's still a great movie to see with your older children. It may inspire them to read the original poems. It might have worked better as a series of movies in a chronicle series.This film generally ONLY works well because it is done entirely in CG. A live action version attempting the same effect would be entirely ludicrous. Its a testament to how far CG has come just within the last six years since ""Final Fantasy""",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A visual experiment that hasn't aged well,"It feels like some kind of sacrilege to give a negative review of something written by Neil Gaiman, but in my defense, it's not the script that lets this movie down. The story is classic mythology, and if it has stood up for a thousand years it'll stand up today as well - but the visuals. Oh my God, the visuals. I remember this was marketed as revolutionary when it came, and I'm sure it was, but now it just looks like a video game, and not a good one either. I keep getting taken out of the story by the weird way people move, or the Shreck-like faces. The studio probably wanted to make something both cheap and fresh, but today, not even ten years later, it's ridiculously dated, and a live-action movie would have been a much better idea.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Despite all the Gaiman gore and humor, Beowulf surprisingly still feels empty.","Despite all the Gaiman gore and humor, the Robert Zemeckis-helmed Beowulf surprisingly still feels empty. The still-evolving CGI effects should not be blamed, since the first two installments of Shrek successfully delivered the warmth necessary to emotionally connect with its audience.Beowulf is a famous epic poem set in Denmark about the warrior Beowulf, who paints himself as a larger-than-life hero. He successfully defeats the monster Grendel, who has been going on a killing spree, however, beautiful women like the monster's mother is his ultimate weakness.Big stars like Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn and Anthony Hopkins headline this movie. But even with that and all the digital 3D hype it's brought (the level of detail is amazing, the blending of what's real and CGI is almost undetectable), what makes it still feel flat? There is nothing specific to pinpoint except for a ""feeling"": that the time spent watching it was not worth it.Also, while the horror portions were indeed frightening, more shocking is how the film was able to get away with just a PG-13 rating despite all the violence, gore, nudity and adult themes. Probably because it was mostly animated, but even when the animation was so close to reality? Just strange, that's all",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
Vikings attacked by computers rather than monsters,"I had extremely mixed feelings about this latest adaption of ""Beowulf"". Is an archaic, wild'n'rough Viking epic the ideal subject for a glossy computer animation movie? I don't think so. The totally artificial look of everything (some actors looked as stiff as puppets, especially Malkovich and R.W. Penn) understandably lead to comments such as ""it's a trailer for a video game, just too long"". To be fair, there was a lot of effort put into some departments. I liked the music by Silvestri, the macabre story elements (probably courtesy of Neil Gaiman), some impressive fights and monsters. Grendel was suffering so much you'd almost sympathize with the critter. He bites heads off to make that feeling go away ;-). Angelina Jolie was so well animated they must have taken a lot more time on her than other characters (I understand that perfectly, guys). Anthony Hopkins was excellent once again, and his role had the depth missing in most others who either hack, slash, run, burn or scream. For all the violence, the rating seems to mild, by the way.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
The first movie ever to really celebrate 3D. WARNING: this rating only applies to the 3D version,"My expectations for this one were very low. I expected a crap story, crap performances, crap CGI for the faces, crap action. To be short: I just expected crap. I went with my girlfriend and the only reason we went was because we, or rather I, had some faint hope some people would finally have realized the true potential of 3D cinema. We missed the last show in the only Imax theater in Holland and I thought I'd missed the opportunity to see Beowolf in 3D. Yesterday my girlfriend took me to the cinema as a surprise. When it turned out we were going to see Beowolf for a moment I was (quite) scared it would be 2D. I was much relieved to see the 3D 'diving goggles' at the entrance (and what a dive it would be!) It turned out that the 3D release not only applies for Imax, but also for digital projection systems. We were in the theater with only 5 people, the three others being youngsters that started having 'fun' making hand-shadow figures on the screen and talking about where those funny glasses were meant for. I was preparing for a worst case scenario. A few moments later everyone was captured in one of those rare enchanting cinematic experiences, that come only once a decade (I didn't ask the youngsters, but judging by the fact that there were no further attempts to make us aware of their presence, they must have found out what those funny glasses were for).To be honest the 2D version probably wouldn't get me writing a review or giving a top rating. Alas there was not the same depth in the story and characters as in the picture. But the story and characters were involving enough to enjoy in their own right. And the 3D isn't just a gimmick added to upgrade a mediocre product. This movie is made to be 3D and the makers showed art and craft. Who cares if the excitement comes as much from the SFX as from the story. Beowolf 3D is an adventure with an extra dimension. Go see it, or rather experience it, if you have the opportunity (exept if your sensitive to violence).Note: Some time earlier I saw the latest Harry Potter in Imax 3D and it's 3D experience wasn't nearly as stunning as this. Here the glasses and 3D image didn't diminish the picture quality in any way. I don't know where the difference comes from, but I guess it's a combination of qualities of the movie itself in the way it was made (motion capture digitized afterward), projection type (digital/celluloid) and of the used equipment of the theater (projector, screen, glasses) Hope you will be/were as lucky as we were.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A different kind of epic,"Note: the version that I saw was the Director's Cut, not the theatrical cut, and it was not in 3D.Finally there's an epic that stays true to the roots. While told in a linear fashion like most epics, director Robert Zemekis has decided not to Hollywoodize the structure. Instead he leaves the story just as it is, and by doing so he gives his version of ""Beowulf"" a slightly unique feel. Instead of an adaptation, ""Beowulf feels like it was directly lifted from the page.King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) has a problem. His kingdom is being terrorized by a hideous monster called Grendel (Crispin Glover). So he sends word out to any hero who will be willing to kill the monster. Beowulf (Ray Winstone) answers the call.I have not read the epic poem, but the movie doesn't feel like a movie adaptation, it feels like a movie come to life, which is interesting, since this movie is completely CGI. If you don't understand what I am talking about, watch Hollywood's previous endeavors of putting epic poems to film (say ""Lord of the Rings""). When done well, the Hollywoodization can work (""Lord of the Rings"" again). But if you pay attention closely, the trilogy and ""Beowulf"" FEEL different.The acting is solid. The actors know that this is not the place to showpiece their thespian skills, but all of them do what they are required. The most interesting performances are Angelina Jolie as Grendel's Mother, who is as creepy and mysterious as she is beautiful (she still looks strikingly similar to her human form), and Anthony Hopkins, who is helped by the animation to move much more freely than he probably can in real life.Now the big kahuna that is on everyone's mind: the animation. It's great. While it's brilliant in some places, it's less so in others. The detail is amazing, but some of the faces don't look realistic (especially Wealthow, the queen). In actuality, it looks very similar to the ""Shrek"" movies, only a lot more detail is apparent, and it's less cartoonish.The success of this is hopeful. Maybe in the near future, animation won't be limited to family friendly movies, because as proved by Zemekis, animation provides a lot more freedom, and there are plenty of things for audiences over the age of 12 that only animation can provide.",7.0,Anonymous,Animation
Pretty awful,"I realize I am way too old for this type of cartoon movie (I'm 58) and steered clear of it upon its theatrical release, partly due to the dismal reviews. My 30-something nephew insisted I watch it with him on his gigantic HDTV in Blu-Ray format, so i did. For the most part. l was zoned out before it was over. so he pulled it and put in IRON MAN, which eventually had me running for home as that definitely was not Tony Stark up on the big screen. Back to BEOWULF: the story is one of our earliest hero legends, about a warrior who slays a great monster, named Grendel. This cartoon movie loosely follows that story. It is difficult to watch, in a way very similar to POLAR EXPRESS, and was at this moment I should have realized it was a Robert Zemeckis flick. Robert, when will you stop screwing around with the imagery in your movies and just tell a decent story? For an adult, unless that adult is of a juvenile mindset, the film will be virtually unwatchable. It's all motion capture and green screen. I thought the hero should at least have been played by Sean Bean. This Beowulf looks remarkably like Bean but doesn't sound like him, as ""it"" was actually played by the guy who played Golum. There's plenty of gore and blood, which I always appreciate, but even that was way too cartoonish. For simple minds only.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Laden with fantasy and stunningly real CGI, Beowulf only falls when it rises to not meet its own challenge","When Beowulf started, and the irresistible, deep and booming soundtrack began, the first thing I said to the person next to me is was: ""are you sure this is an animated film!"" (that's until Ray Winstone (Beowulf) appears).Beowulf begins as any epic tale would. It lays out the cold, Norse, setting and the characters in a plain, simple fashion. Then the battles start. In fact, Beowulf only really begins 20 minutes in, when Grendel, a hideous giant, kills many people in a food hall in the presence of the king (Antony Hopkins). The King orders that the hall be closed and sends out a message stating that anyone who can slay Grendel will get riches 'beyond their wildest dreams.' Eventually, Beowulf, a warrior with oily muscles and a London accent arrives, and claims he will ""kill your monsta'!"" A battle scene between him and Grendel commences, which seems a repeat of the first battle, apart from Beowulf is naked. This is a weird and miss-fitted scene, as it falls awkwardly between the line of comedy (Beowulf has sausages, wine glasses, poles, swords blocking his private parts throughout in order to maintain a 12A (PG-13) certificate), and violent action. Beowulf eventually kills Grendel , but this angers another beast in the far mountains, his mother (Angelina Jolie).After this, the film climaxes for 40 minutes, bearing the heavy promise of deep, moving scenes and great, energetic action scenes. But it's not to be, as the film slows down instead, tediously crawling along all its CGI frames, before a quick action scene is slapped on the end.Its a real shame, after all, as Beowulf seems to miss the point in the second half. Its missing the heart that was brooding in a deep, potentially show-stopping cauldron, and settles for a film that bears nothing particularly memorable, but leaves good feeling in your heart afterwards.",6.0,Anonymous,Animation
I hope this is not the future of movie production.,"I love the story of Beowulf. I spent a semester studying it. The movie doesn't unnecessarily butcher the story, but I was really surprised at how much I hated this movie.Why does everyone look computer animated? This just takes away from the movie. I wasn't sure which actress was Robin Wright Penn until more than halfway through it. As my husband commented, it looks like this was made by the same people who did Shrek. It wasn't consistent with the tone of the movie to make the characters cartoonish, and I don't feel like it was necessary for special effects. Everything they did as far as special effects was stuff we have seen mastered without completely making everyone a cartoon.Really, this movie had great potential. I am seriously disappointed.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Just Needed To Be More,"Visually unique and a good back bone of a story still weren't enough to make the movie any better than average.A great movie will pull you in and make you feel the emotions of the character and make you invest in the outcomes.

Tedious,"Anyone who sets out to write fantasy (and that is what Beowulf is) should find a copy of Ursula LeGuin's essay from ""Elfland to Poughkeepsie"". One of the points she makes is that characters in such tales should NOT speak like contemporary Americans--they should not use slang or phrases that will distract the gentle reader (or viewer) from the fantasy universe.Lots and lots of bad written fantasy suffers from reading like an adventure lived by American teenagers in costume; the really foul stuff even uses contemporary slang. Some of it sells quite well to an unsophisticated readership.Watching Beowulf was misery, because it was full of Americans delivering their lines like Americans in costume. I just could not believe these were Nordic guys living the Northern Thing, with dragons and swords. Most of the characters were completely unconvincing, as were their wigs.The dragon...o dear gawd...reminded me of the dragon Ollie from Kukla, Fran & Ollie.I stuck it out to the end, but it was painful. Much of it looked like it had filmed the first time the actors tried out their lines, and that they had not yet rehearsed together.It takes more than action scenes and CGI to make a movie worthwhile.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Stocking shredder....read below for details,"To say that I was keen to see this movie is an understatement. I had to take a bus, subway, commuter train, cross the border to Hong Kong, take the KCR, the MTR then finally a shuttle bus just to see this movie in IMAX+3D+ English.So was it worth it? Well I can say this movie was so exciting that my friend went in with perfect stocking and by the end of the movie they were full of holes (and I am a perfect gentleman, so it was the excitement of the movie and not me that did it).Beowulf is an old English poem (which is in fact a Germanic language) and often talked about but few people have read it (those that have generally don't seem to like this movie, but...given the sort of people that read only English poetry this is not surprising).Anyway, Beowulf (which I believe means Bear Wolf) must first kill a monster named Grendle, and having done that must also kill it's mother. This second element makes Beowulf stand out in heroic epics and provides the meat for the re adaption of this story.This movie is based on the poem and the legend, it both tries to add realism and humanity to the characters as well as confront the nature of heroism.What do we end up with is this.1. A well made and interesting story that works both as a classic tale and modern (or post modern) epic. 2. A combination of amazing animation for the faces and really terrible animation for the movement (seriously it is like watching the original supermario brothers act). 3. The best dragon ever...personally I have never been satisfied by the dragons in movies, but finally I have found one that I like. 4. A movie that is made for 3-D, I don't think the 3D is worth it, but I doubt that the movie would stand up to a 2D viewing. Plus 3D is fun, especially when it looks like monster saliva is going to land on your lap.My final comment is this, it is an exciting modern tale based on, but updating a classic tale.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Cutscene, not film","Well,I consider myself as a fan of the old Nordic sagas, and the movies based on them, like the Excalibur, or the 13th Warrior. So I looked forward to see this movie with great interest. Apart form the films, where the visuals cover the weaknesses of the script/directing, the script here is very good. Based on a millennium old tale, actualized by professionals: and the promise is kept. The visual experience, when we talk about action and scenery, is simply stunning. Even on a screen at home.However when we talk about closeups, the whole thing just falls apart. The eyes are dead, and improperly used, the mimic is awful. This renders the actors(?) to puppets, and eliminates the whole humanity from the film. I do not understand, why such great actors like Anthony Hopkins, or John Malkovich let the producers to use them. What makes it more annoying, that the film industry is after 300, or Sin City, or even Shrek, where the balanced mix between technology and reality had been worked out just perfectly. Why fails here? There is one exception, the figure of Grendel. Despite his complete inhumanity, the only ""acting"" is performed by Grendel.The overall feeling was that I'm watching an enormous cut-scene from some slashing computer game, and in minutes I will have control over the characters, and can start my own adventure. A twisted way of ""immersion"" I would say. So if you like nice CGI generated action and scenery, go and see it. If you are interested in the plot, wait for the book. If you are interested in the plot visually, I recommend the 13th Warrior, or the Excalibur.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Astoundingly Stupid,"I try to avoid coming down too hard on dumb action movies. They are what they are, and in general, they work fine at being dumb, loud, and entertaining. Not Beowulf. In all honesty, I went to the movies to see a rip off of 300, and it's exactly what I got, albeit with even less quality than ripping off 300 implies. Whether or not it diverged too much from the original Beowulf story, it's a horrible movie. The dialog would make George Lucas blush, the animation, while at times brilliantly done, makes all its characters look like wax dummies, and the story made me want to scream at the screen for being so dumb. In the grand tradition of idiotic epics like the book Beowulf (that's right, I said it. Just because it's old doesn't mean it isn't basically the medieval equivalent of Power Rangers), this movie made my brain cells cry out in pain. Aside from being a dumb actionfest (which really wouldn't be that bad), it felt the need to pretend that it had any sense of moral ambiguity and nuance. Rather than accept that it's a really bad movie and revel in it, it goes into self parody territory with the sheer volume of pseudo-meaningful BS. It's like a movie made by the 14 year old metalhead who thinks that he's the most brilliant human being alive for listening to Dream Theater. It's just a bad, bad movie that thinks it's something better.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation

"A must see, but only in 3D","Went to see this movie in a regular theater without 3D and it was really bad, so I went to the customer service center and asked them if my wife and I could pay the extra and go to the 3D IMAX.

The story was the same but the visual experience was completely different. This was by far the best 3D movie we have ever seen. My wife kept grabbing my arm as spears and blood and guts kept flying at us. If you are going to pay money to see this movie in a theater, then you have to see it in 3D. Otherwise don't waste your money. They should have never let this movie be released without 3D. Without 3D this film is just like a bad Saturday morning cartoon.

A very pleasant surprise!,"Take it from me. This is not the type of film I usually flock to see. For one thing, it's animated. I'm not one of these adults who likes to flaunt about being a kid at heart. Call me close-minded, but I prefer seeing REAL people with REAL facial expressions. Second of all, ""fantasy"" is not exactly my favorite genre. I'm a big advocate of realism in movies. I'd much rather watch an indie film where characters sit in cafes and bars, and just ramble on about the mundane details of life than watch the next special effects spectacular. Until this day, I haven't seen one ""Lord of the Rings"" film. Normally, the minute I see anything too out of ordinary in a film, my mind starts to wander and I become disconnected from it.Therefore, I'm pleading with people--please, please, please go see this film! I don't normally go on and on about a film's special effects. To me, what's the use of effects when...they look like effects? Watching ""Matrix Reloaded"" is the equivalent of watching two coats of paint dry in my opinion. ""Beowulf,"" on the other hand, is one of the few films I can think of that uses special effects for GOOD! The animation is absolutely incredible. There are moments in the film where I forget I'm watching a piece of animation, because the characters are soooo lifelike. I know I complained previously about animated characters not showing a range of facial expressions. Not in this case. It's incredible how the emotions of the real actors were able to get converted into animation. It's so complex that I wouldn't be surprised if Anthony Hopkins gets an Oscar nomination for his performance in this film.I will preface that I saw this film in 3D. I'm sure the regular version will be enjoyable as well, but Robert Zemeckis took full advantage of the 3D technology, truly making you feel like you're part of this world. This is not like back in the days when occasionally you'd see some creature's arms stretch towards you, and that would be the extent of the 3D. There's a moment where Beowulf is about to get his crotch impaled, and I found myself almost gasping (I'm a guy, of course). It doesn't hurt that we get to see a very lifelike replication of Angelina Jolie strutting around almost naked during her every scene.Now, for all you parents out there, DO NOT take your young ones. I find it funny that the movie is virtually being promoted as a kiddie flick. If this were R-rated, I would classify it as a hard R. I can't come up with any sort of explanation as to why this gory, gruesome film was awarded a PG-13 rating, other than....it's animated. I guess you can get away with a lot more with animated violence. Don't quote me on that, though. We're treated to such images as a monster getting stabbed in the eye and a heart getting torn out. Yet a movie with 10 uses of the F-word gets an R-rating. The MPAA is on crack. It's official.If I have to make any mild criticism, it's that Robin Wright Penn's character looks a bit too cartoonish and flat. Ray Winstone has a great and powerful voice, and lends it well to the main character. I just find it funny that his character was the only one that had no resemblance to him. His character is tall, muscular, and handsome--the exact opposite of the real life Winstone. I liked the performances for the most part. Some have said that John Malkovich was pretty awful. I disagree. I thought he played a great heavy, as he always does. I suggest everyone checks this movie out in theaters, though. As big of a cinephile as I am, I don't usually urge people to see films on the big screen. To me, if a film is truly great, you can watch on your laptop or your I-Pod and still enjoy it just as much. ""Beowulf"" NEEDS to be seen on the big screen. It is not just a movie. It is an experience!",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
3D the way it was meant to be!,"Look, if you want to see a film that will literally put you into a world of dragons and fantasy, look no further. Watching this movie in IMAX 3D will go down as one of the most memorable movie-going experiences of my life (at least up until now anyway).The acting is great, the CGI is absolutely unreal and more lifelike than Zemeckis's Polar Express which suffered from Dead Eyes Syndrome in its characters. The 3D puts you in the action like no other film up until now. All of the main action scenes are fantastic, especially Beowulf's battle against a dragon. The movie is pretty funny (even a bit silly at points) and very enjoyable. Some parts were a little weak but nothing so bad that it detracts from the whole. Alan Silvestri's score is top notch with a great main theme.Oh and Angelina Jolie is rendered to look absolutely stunning in this film.

Go see the other movie.,"You probably know a few things about Beowulf ¬ñ firstly, that it is based on an Anglo-Saxon epic and involves monster-slaying, mead-drinking and a hero who lusts for power; secondly, that the movie is 'performance capture' animated, and is available in 3-D; and finally, that it features a stiletto-heeled, lizard-tailed, mostly naked Angelina Jolie, looking better than she has in years. All correct.There are a few things, however, that you SHOULD know. Above all, the movie is terrible. My two major gripes are the animation and the script.The animation leaves the characters lifeless, occasionally cross-eyed (what happened to Robin Wright Penn?) and often out of proportion, destroying any compelling reason that there may have been to FEEL for the hero or the others; they are simply too far removed from any notion of humanity to engage you or suspend your disbelief. Pixar has shown us that animation need not remove a human element from cinema, even when dealing with monsters, bugs and superheroes - and films like 'A Scanner Darkly' have animated actors without destroying their energy or nuance. This is a poor effort. As far as the 'technique' goes, anyone that has seen 'Final Fantasy' or has played a video game like 'God of War' will hardly be impressed by the novelty, and there are plenty of proficient animation and gaming studios in the entertainment industry that have developed better fare.The script is appalling, lacking in both depth and variety and no doubt contributing to the lifelessness of the characters. Most of the movie is delivered in a monotone of ye-olde inspired whispers and growls, and none of the characters appear to care about each other at all, judging by their dialogue. There is no subtext whatsoever. There is absolutely nothing to suggest that Unferth (John Malkovich) has a private motivation, or is actually thinking about anything at all when he throws a menacing stare at the camera; there is nothing given to the audience beyond 'too many secrets' to suggest Wealthow's (Robin Wright Penn's) furrowed brow conceals either a troubled heart or a brain; and for all reviewers have harped on about the script being camp and/or kitsch and/or satirical, I could not think of a single moment to validate any of the three interpretations, save for Angelina Jolie's stilettos, which are clearly absurd (and gave my packed out theatre it's only laugh for the whole two hour runtime). It's all truly woeful, not to mention boring.Look, I don't always go to the cinema and expect to see a masterpiece. I went to this movie because Angelina gets naked and I was promised plenty of blood, guts and excitement. I got nothing, apart from Angelina, and a little violence. On a parting note, the 3-D adds absolutely nothing to the experience; as far as I am concerned, it is a pitiful gimmick and will hopefully die quickly before too many film makers latch on to the idea.I could not possibly recommend this movie to anyone, particularly if you enjoy movies or have played an action-adventure video-game in the last four years. Do yourself a favour, and see something else. Two stars ¬ñ one for Mrs. Jolie, and the other for a briefly convincing scene between Hopkins and Winstone. That's it.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Plastic work.,"I'm so mad at Robert Zemeckis. A supposedly great movie adaptation turned out not-so-tasty because of the total use of CGI. I was puzzled, why would he want to introduce full CGI into the film ? Yes, when the movie begin, the movie's visual is sweet at first sight. After so long, you'll get tired of it. Most of the time the characters looked plastic and dull, which eventually provokes no emotions to the acting/story at all.

Tragically Lovely,"The tale of Beowulf was told in an epic poem by an unknown 8th-11th century author. It tells of Beowulf, a Geat (Goth) hero of what is now known as Sweden, and his three equally epic battles with Grendel, Grendel's mother (known here and there as the Black Queen of Midguard), and an unnamed Dragon (thought by some to be the Midguard Serpent).While this film tells the tale somewhat differently than the author's original interpretation (the author, for instance, lays the hero to rest beneath a sacred mound), it tells Beowulf's story in a way never before told...with an obvious love of the tale itself, a love of the medium in which it is delivered, and a love of the artistry herein employed.This is a lovely Friday/Saturday night's viewing, as there is something for everyone: While some scenes are not suitable for children, they will be drawn by the awesome animation quality, men will (no doubt) enjoy the raucous behavior of the men and the monsters, and women should identify with the plight and innate dignity (even in the face of what some would consider shame) of the Queen.

Unwatchable CG dreck,"I found this film to be virtually unwatchable. It is nothing more than a sequence of ""gee! see what I can do in CG"" scenes. There is nothing here that enables the viewer to identify with nor care about the characters, and that is a fatal flaw in an epic adventure if not in most movies/stories in general.CG and visual effects can be useful to enhance the movie experience and/or to help tell a story that might otherwise be impractical to film as real action or settings. However, CG or animated characters are very difficult to identify with unless the actors, writers, and director focus extensively on creating an emotional tapestry that pulls in the viewer. Without the latter, a film devolves into a mere series of images and scenes that will have little if any impact.Beowulf makes the mistake described above, and it is clearly reflected in the flat performances of the voice actors. Despite having a cast with several A-list and award-winning thespians, all of them sounded like they were reading from scripts. I don't doubt that they found it difficult to bring the ""story"" to life in their own minds given the complete-animation format, and the director clearly did nothing to address this fundamental problem.As computer game, Beowulf might have had a chance, but as a film it is a complete waste of time.

"good movie, BUT---","the storyline was good, special effects, outside the main characters were awesome, BUT ------the use of animation for the main characters stripped the movie of any emotion - using the real actors for the main characters would have given this movie much more heart - I could muster no empathy for anyone, except maybe for Grendel - and i think that's not who i was supposed to feel sorry for - although the movie strays from the original text, the added insights should make for more a more tragic hero, but i found this not to be as the hero was so ""plastic"" -if this is the look of movies to come, ill stay home and watch them on TV -",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
excellent CGI flick with great performances,"I came across this flick due two reasons, the first one is very simple, it's cheaply to catch on Blu Ray these days and this is one you must see on Blu Ray. Secondly the director, Robert Zemeckis isn't an unknown name to me. He produced a few flicks in my genre, Bordello Of Blood (1996) and The Frighteneres (1996) and he went further towards Thi13ten Ghosts (2001) were he started to use CGI, it went further to Ghost ship (2002) notable for the opening sequence, full CGI. So it became clear that CGI was his thing, and even now as a director he's going for CGI, this flick and his latest one Real Steel (2011) are full of CGI. Beowulf is even a full CGI flick. Still he's most notorious with directing the Back To The Future trilogy.People who follow me on the Web do know that I'm not a CGI lover, it's so cold and especially in my genre (horror) it doesn't work at all but here it does work. It reminded me of Final Fantasy (1994) were the faces of the actors were digitally disguised. But Beowulf actually even had a good script.Even as it looks that you are gaming still you get involved into the characters and you are in the flick from the start. What also works is that once Beowulf is becoming a king things move further with the lie of Beowulf. It's funny to see that if it would have been made without CGI it rather would be a gory flick because the CGI blood do flow frequently. I wont recommend it to everybody but if you are into mythology then this is your thing or if you like fantasy than pick this up.On the part of the acting, they were all very believable and so many geeks were waiting for the mother of Grendel to appear out of the water to see her (Angelina Jolie) attractive figure. I liked this flick more then the Comic flicks that are out there because our hero has some dark secrets and isn't what he seems to be.

computer animation at it's worst,"I'm writing this comment mainly to inform those about to go see the movie about one important fact - the whole thing is COMPUTER ANIMATED. And utterly poorly at that.I had somehow missed this little fact before I went to see it, and as the titles left the screen and the action started, I was more disappointed than I can find words to describe. Instead of an hour and a half of LOTR-style fantasy, what I got was something more akin to watching my nephew play one of his online fantasy computer games.Computer graphics are fine. If used in good taste, and for the right reason; in the modern cartoon style of for example Shrek or Ratatouille, or as enhancement and backup of real-life action, as in the aforementioned Lord of the Rings.But why someone would choose to make an ENTIRE movie in the plastic, lifeless, stale, computer game-like style of Beowulf, is utterly beyond me. The computer models are made as likenesses of the real actors. Or perhaps superimposed somehow over real footage of them, I don't know. But the result is some sort of bastard mix of computer animation seemingly mixed with real life action, that I don't honestly don't understand how anyone can find entertaining in the least. It falls completely in between two chairs - it's neither good enough to pass for real life action; nor does it go ""all computer"" and make use of the tool that computer graphics are, to it's full artistic potential.It just looks bad. And meanwhile, you know that the actors are doing their job behind those computer model likenesses, which is beyond frustrating - all that hard work gone to waste behind Beowulf's tasteless, artificial exterior. Having some people act out the script with their characters in World of Warcraft (a online fantasy roleplaying game), and just taping that, would have been cheaper for the producers.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Animation at it's best...,"Let me start by saying I am well read in the original Norse tale of ""Beowulf"" and ""Grendel"" and am a proud Swede. I have never been so excited to see a blockbuster action flick adapted from a book in my life. I went and stood in line to see it at the IMAX in 3-D. The theater was packed and the crowd was in great spirits.As soon as the movie started, you are like ""Wow"", is this really animation? I mean, you know its fake, but the close ups and detailing is really amazing. Hopkins was super classic as the drunken king too. Instantly the movie kicks into action when Grendel shows up. The movie then introduces Grendel's mother, looking hotter than in real life and does a great job of tempting everyone.My only problem with the movie is it gets a little boring in the middle. I understand the reasoning, but I think it could have been adapted better to keep the audience more interested.All in all, great movie and I can't wait for the DVD!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Be gone, oh rotten movie!  Hollowman and Alien vs. Predator! - you have company.","Remember when your English teacher in high school or college told the class that one of their assignments was to read Beowulf? Not exactly the most popular work of literature. Really, how many people out there actually had, or have, any interest in reading Beowulf? Be honest. It would not be unreasonable to say that Beowulf is not on the list of the world's most popular literary works. Yet Hollywood, in its infinite quest for profit, decided that this is the kind of story that can be transposed onto the big screen and that there is an audience for this kind of story, with its heroes and villains and monsters and ... well you get the point. So Hollywood concocted this movie, part science fiction, part science fantasy, part epic and COMPLETE JUNK. Welcome to the world of special effects. After watching this movie, one can reasonably ask: Why have actors? Why not just special effects and who cares about the story? If the story is idiotic ... who cares? Just throw in some special effects. If the dialog is laughable? Who cares? That can be cured with special effects. If the plot is ridiculous, again, who cares? Special effects can do the trick. There are scenes in this movie that provoke outright laughter. If this movie accurately portrays the level of civilization in Europe circa 6th century A.D., then it is a miracle that people actually survived. If you believe this movie, then the people, particularly the men, were actually uglier than the monsters, except, of course, for Beowulf who, of course, is an Adonis while all the other guys are a bunch of overweight gin-guzzling jerks or skinny sniveling dorks who are too stupid to do anything except let themselves be kicked around or sacrificed for the hero, who, of course, has sex with beautiful women. This raises another point: In the 6th century why are the men so ugly while the women are so beautiful? It's like their two different species, with the men being like links between Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal Man (except of course for Beowulf who is perfection personified - duh!) and the women being more like a bunch of giggling Aphrodites than poverty-stricken 6th century females just trying to survive. (I wonder what kind of odors women emitted in the 6th century? After all, bathing was not one of their priorities.) What about the female of females in the movie, the super-Monster, who is also a mother, yes, A MOTHER, played, surprise, surprise, by Angelina Jolie! Some super-monster! There are mothers and there are MOTHERS and Ms. Jolie plays A MOTHER!!! If Ms. Jolie's mother character is supposed to be a monster, than bring her on because any monster that looks like the beautiful and talented Angelina Jolie is the kind of monster that one should have at home, or at work, or wherever. One other point: There are parts of this movie where certain characters speak a language that be best described as gibberish. It would have been helpful if those parts of the movie had included subtitles. Then again, maybe the entire script should have been in gibberish. As a matter of fact, this movie would have been far more interesting if the entire script had been written in Old English - without subtitles. Why have Beowulf speaking fluent English? Why have Beowulf speaking at all? What it comes down to is this: this movie is pretentious junk that tries to be part Hamlet, part Troy, and even part Alexander (the latter two not the greatest movies but light years better than this waste of celluloid) but actually is a hyped-up pseudo-cartoon version of a medieval story that probably no person has read in its entirety in maybe a thousand years but which someone in Hollywood believed could be transformed into something that today's contemporary audience would buy, meaning (must it be said? Yes!) - SPECIAL EFFECTS!!!! - and in 3D!!!! Hollywood made 3D movies in the 1950s - for kids and back then the movies cost a quarter and nobody made any big deal about it. Now 3D is supposed to be something special. Yeah, right. Leave Beowulf in the the book where he belongs so that the lone person who decides to actually read the book can use their imagination to visualize the story instead of having to rely on Hollywood's version - which is crass, banal and guided not by the quest for artistic excellence but by the quest for the almighty buck.This movie is so bad that it makes Phantom of the Opera (movie version) seem like a 10-star classic. You can take special effects just so far, but special effects cannot replace a story, no way. This movie is about phantasmagorical events revolving around themes such as heroism, selflessness and other high personal virtues. Okay, but the movie approaches these themes by catering to the lowest common denominator of intelligence to dramatize these points. If Beowulf is the best example of English literature from the Middle Ages, then the middle ages were the dark ages indeed.Now here's an idea: Why not take Godzilla, King Kong, Rodan, Mothra, the Giant Mantis, the Predator (with the infra-red vision and the a-bomb strapped to its arm)and the T-Rex from Jurassic Park and put them on an island with Beowulf and see what happens? All special effects. NO STORY NECESSARY.Anthony Hopkins's presence in this movie is a travesty, a joke. It's not his fault. It's a gig and a paycheck, and he didn't create the role, he just acts it. But to have this fine actor going about half-naked would have been like Hamlet going about with his pants down while engaged in a soliloquy. Please, be gone, oh rotten movie, go to DVD-land with all the other forgettable rejects.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Not a bad retelling, but why animate it?","With motion capture all the rage in Hollywood these days ‚Äì blame Gollum ‚Äì director Robert Zemeckis and his cronies have been keen to adapt the CGI technology for their own needs. BEOWULF follows hot on the heels of the same director's POLAR EXPRESS and a new adaptation of the age-old Anglo-Saxon poem about a hero battling a terrible monster.As a keen follower of the literary Beowulf, I was eager to find out how the story had been adapted from the original. The good news is that this is the complete version, including flashbacks to Beowulf's swimming challenge and the climax with the dragon. The bad news is that the stuff with the dragon has been linked to the earlier Grendel story via a whole new subplot. Clearly a consequence of the desire to tie up loose ends in favour of neater storytelling, but I didn't think it was required.Nevertheless, Neil Gaiman's script is above average in paying homage to the original. As for the mo-cap, I'm not so impressed. For me, this film looks like a cartoon, albeit an expensive, 3D-style cartoon. The look of flesh and hair is spot on, but the eyes are dead and soulless, which means even the hardest-working voice actors struggle to breathe life into their on-screen creations.Zemeckis isn't a favourite director of mine. His emphasis is always on the superficial, and this film follows a straightforward action-adventure template by providing plenty of spectacle and not a lot of depth. Although it misses out the bit with the dragon, I found the Gerard Butler starrer, BEOWULF & GRENDEL, to be a much more atmospheric and engaging adaptation of the heroic poem.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

simply hilarious,"i couldn't even watch the whole thing on HBO - i was too tired to waste my time any longer. most negative comments complain about ""not following the storyline of the poem"". well, I haven't read the poem. and the movie still is a great disappointment. the plot and the dialogues are far worse than the version from 1999 with Cristophe Lambert (a movie with a 3,6 rating and deserving it) the only good thing about the whole experience: a few touching lines from Grendel. Beowulf himself was so damn hilarious. And naked. Almost all the time. For no obvious reason. The ""shadow"" covering his genitals - common means to hide inappropriate sights in anime for example, is frustratingly misplaced in a realistic 3D. If they were so ashamed, why not give him a pair of viking pants. The dialogues were incredibly lame and funny, like they were written (and performed) by nerdy 13-year-old gamers trying to burlesque Manowar. Grendel's mum was also hilarious. I still can't imagine why in the world did Angelina say ""yes"" to take part in this. Or Antony Hopkins. Or Malkovich or any of the other great (and not so great) actors starring in that ridiculous excuse for an epic movie. Anyway, I was talking about Grendel's mum. So... alright, she was ridiculous (and 3D-made Angelina doesn't have even half of the sex appeal of the normal ms. Jolie.) She had high heels, alright. Coming out of her bare feet. Can you possibly imagine just how funny that looks? Anyway, soon after the appearance of the gold-painted reptile known as ""Grendel's Mother"" my patience was exhausted and I switched the channel... If something grand and really worth watching happened afterwards: than I beg forgiveness for writing this... But, honestly, I really doubt that.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Great modern retelling, perhaps dating itself with CGI","I've seen this movie a few times now, I love the Norse mythology style and I must admit I've not read the poem.Directed by Robert Zemekis, the man always goes hard on all his projects.

(Though she has said it's not her body in an interview in the past). Sure the uncanny valley aspect maybe hinders this film and the CGI looks a tad dated by today's standards(2024) but you just need to embrace it for what it is.

Not so good for a movie like this.,"I personally want to say a few words about Beowulf, after I've seen it earlier today. I was pretty curious for the content of this movie, from all the things I heard about it. I knew it had this strange sort of style, where it was somewhere in between real life persons and 3D game model figures, but that wasn't my concern. The fact is that I did not even like a single part of the whole story, except maybe for one of the last scenes, where there was finally some action going on. The rest of the movie was just pityful in my opinion, not even close to what could be seen in many other movies, even of the same subject.

The Flawed Hero,"This was a fun movie in 3D at the IMAX theatre. I've watched it a couple times since, and it's still good, but not quite the same. Director Robert Zemeckis was obviously familiar with the tech as he had already done 'Polar Express', which was amazing in it's own right. The animation is very well done for the time, and the voice acting is excellent. Ray Winstone specifically, was very convincing as the hero warrior Beowulf.A gorgeous soundtrack combined with compelling visuals helps the viewer feel immersed in the viking mythology. It stays fairly true to the poem, aside from a few tweaks.Ultimately Beowulf is just a man, albeit a great man, but flawed nonetheless. He is not immune to human nature, and must face his demons head on. Beowulf's demons may be a bit more literal than the rest of us though, which makes for an entertaining story.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why is it animated?,"Beowulf is like the biggest question mark to me, purely as watched the movie and looked back on it the one question that was constantly on my mind was simply ""Why is it animated?"" I can understand why the Polar Express is animated even though yes you could've just made it in live-action and not much would be different, I can understand Christmas Carol being animated, but I for the life of me cannot comprehend what was the thought process behind the decision to make Beowulf animated. There was no real reason to have the movie be animated and nothing about it screamed for it to be animated, the movie could've simply have been made in live-action and nothing would be different, aside from Ray Winstone as Beowulf but that could be fixed through casting, I've often joked about how the possible reason for the movie being animated was that Zemeckis was too damn lazy to afford actually sets, props, costumes, make-up and extras that he was just like, ""You know, let's just do it all in animation and have our few main stars play multiple roles and be done for the day, I mean, honestly who cares anymore?"" I just couldn't get invested with the story, characters and action because I was just too damn distracted, baffled and unnerved by the animation of everything. The animation is right there in the uncanny valley, having a lot of character designs meant to look almost exactly like the actors playing the characters, with the exception of turning Ray Winstone into a beefed up action hero and Crispin Glover into a monster, which returns to my main question ""Why is it animated?"" If you're going through the trouble of trying to make a lot of characters look just like their actors and have them perform mo-cap to portray said characters, why couldn't they have just made the movie in live-action instead of hassling with animation? So yeah, I didn't like the movie, the only thing I did like about it was Alan Silvestri's score, but even then it didn't really do much to enhance my viewership of the movie, it made me listen to the music on its own and imagine a movie I would've liked to see along with music.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

boring and predictable,"Its really seldom that a movie is as predictable as this one. You already know the whole story of this picture if you saw its trailer. The rest is hardly more but a lot of chatting and a little fighting. And - thats it ! No sub-context, no story twists, no comedy, no irony, nothing.And the new technology of making movies is awful. Its tolerable if human skin looks rather like marzipan. But its a huge problem when most faces are simply lifeless and unnatural. Even the main characters faces ! The only exception is Angelina Jolie, because she's the only one who kept mostly her original face.Another thing which really nerved me was the absurd prudery of the movie. We see a man fighting naked, but somehow there is always something in the way that hides his penis. We get Angelina Jolie all naked, but she has breasts without nipples. If the creators of the movie didn't wanted to show naked people, they should have just kept their characters dressed, instead of such embarrassing trickery.No recommendation.

worst film this summer,"I must say, although I did not read the poem (at least not entirely, but the rest only in a summary), this was awful. If you have seen the preview, well, the heavy metal music is missing, otherwise it would at least have been a good music video clip.Others have already spoken about the literary quality of this video clip (ie. it's hardly related to the poem), and you will only enjoy this one if you are willing to see a 100-min animation sequence as if cut from a computer game, waiting for the part when you can make something happen. This was boring. Anything the characters say is quite dull, and the action is so average that you are forced to notice the lengthy scenes without content. I have seen the German version, so I cannot comment on the words being in plain English (ie. not like the poem), but it was certainly not worth listening to these - overly predictable - developments.The action, if that's what you want to call it, hardly makes up for the weak storyline (only the showdown I didn't regret watching, therefore 2 out of 10), mind you not of the medieval story but this Zemecki clip.

Revered by all as a Hero, Beowulf is the sort of movie that inspires one to cast aside all fear and doubt and just go for it!Stunning visuals, amazing script, and impeccable dialogue combine to bring to life an old poem about Good vs Evil, but with evil usually being of man's own doing. Ray Winstone (its sad that he isn't as optimised in other movies) was such a treat in the voice and character of Beowulf.

See it in big screen 3D or not at all,"Wildly uneven on every level retelling of the ""classic"" poem.I saw this first in 2D and the following week in 3D. I really hated it in 2D I liked it more in 3D If you must see this see it in 3D. The action set pieces, 3 battles with Grendel, the sea monsters and the dragon castle attack are spectacular (though the Grendel attacks are kind of dull). The 3D viewing will explain why you have a constant moving of the camera-endless tracking shots that serve no real purpose except make you go ""ooo and ah"" in 3D. It will also explain why you have these really bad perspective shots like a sentry's lance in your face. The 50's and 80's 3D craze had some odd shots but nothing as awkward (in 2D) as those in this film.The script is uneven. There are lots of moments of hysterical satire and hysterically bad lines of dialog (this is a movie you can laugh at and with). When the film isn't in motion the film often stalls in long long winded scenes of dialog that are just plain awful.(And yes it is possible to know what Neil Gaiman wrote, especially if you've read his paycheck comics and watched his earlier film adventures). Clearly the script was suppose to be a joke, but Zemekis didn't seem to notice and filmed it straight removing much of the humor along the way.And thats the problem. Zemekis insistence on doing this as motion capture because ""it would cost too much as a live action film"" is what ruins the subtleties the script might have had (and is pure horse hockey since all monster and action stuff would have been CGI anyway). First off the most of the character animation sucks. The characters are pasty faced non-emotive automatons that go threw the motions. I felt I was watching the road company of the background characters from Shrek 3. The technique pretty much prevents any sort of real performance with the exception of Ray Winstone and Anthony Hopkins.(John Malkovich gives a performance but its so bizarre as to classified as a knowing joke). Robin Wright Penn's character-vital to the story- is so stiff (in every sense of the word) that it looks embalmed. The animation is often worse than any big budget computer game, and worse than whats coming out of Japan or out of many film studios effect houses.Another major problem (especially in 2D where the visuals don't distract you from the many flaws) is the damned choral score which is repetitive to the point of making you want to commit suicide. Its ten times worse than any video game ear worm you've ever heard and been scared by.There are some great sequences as I said. the action scenes are spectacular with Beowulf's sea battle and dragon battle being the very very bloody highlights. They are the reasons the film might have a life on DVD and cable, since flat or 3D they are way cool.Two other points I think I should mention.First clearly there is something wrong when this film is PG13 and Tekkonkinkreet is R. Grendel is far more bloody and sexually (both straight and gay) in your face that the animated film from Japan.If you want to see the effect of a big studio on the ratings board this is it. Honestly many ""bloody"" horror films don't have this much blood. The fights in this film are bloody and disgusting and make you wonder about the ratings board.(This is a really really bloody movie) Secondly anyone else but me feel that Grendel is throw back to the old days where mentally or physically handicapped people were to be locked up in the attic and feared because they were different? Come on strip away the monstrous size and fact that by the time we meet him, Grendel has gone insane from being locked in a cave, he is a ""special needs"" child gone bad. Its sad.When I saw this is 3D I was less critical because of the visual effects but it still didn't make it really a batter film, just one where the flash hides the flaws. So as a 3D film the effects will make the action scenes enough of a thrill ride to get past the deadly slow talky bits-so it 6 out 10 as 3D As a 2D film where nothing is in your face and it all looks odd 3 to 4 out of 10, with a couple of great action scenes that are great regardless of flat or multi dimensional. Unfortunately the talky bits make it very tough going with out the gee whiz of the 3D.Lastly, this and the 3D process are being hailed by some as the future of movies; If this is the future of movies we all deserve to go blind.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's a cinematic marvel!,"I hadn't heard anything about it at all until the other day, when Angelina Jolie and Anthony Hopkins swooped in for the premiere. So I kinda knew it was computer-generated using virtual motion capture for the acting - which I had a bad feeling about because I really hated The Polar Express.But I needn't have worried. The actors looked like the actors - hell, forget computer graphics. That *was* Angelina Jolie rising out of the water, as sexy as ever. Even if she did have a scaly tail and impossibly beautiful (if spherical) breasts covered in mud. The sooner cinema gets to the point when you can take home your own computer-generated 3D model of your favourite character as you leave the auditorium, the better. Seriously, the friend I took with me had no idea the acting was computer-animated. She knew something was slightly off, but she assumed it was a side-effect from the blurriness of the 3D IMAX format.Over here, it seems to have been given a 12A rating. Which is so wrong. The first minute lulls you into a false sense of comfortableness, before it's all blown apart in five harrowing minutes of gore, up close in CGI.Once I got home, of course I had to look it up on Wikipedia. And while a lot of it did seem to have the Hollywood treatment, I was surprised at how much of it had been ""changed"" from the original story. Then again, the original tale has probably been augmented a lot (to say the least) over the years...",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
all effects  - no substance,"Considering the amazing acting skills assembled, Zemeckis has managed to suck any talent out of the actors and dispose of it..I adored 300, and was really hoping this would be in a similar vein. I watched Beowulf from DVD on a wide screen TV, but I don't think a cinema screening could improve the lousy content.There are times where the characters in the midground look like poor quality plasticine, and not all of the special effects work.There is an amazing translation of Beowulf by Seamus Heaney, and a CD exists of Heaney reading his work. That is powerful and emotional.On the contrary this film is utterly crude and bereft of creativity.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

highly detailed 3D graphic animation with an excellent soundtrack,"I went to see Beowulf in 3D tonight and am very impressed. Superb big screen highly detailed 3D graphic animation with an excellent soundtrack.The visual quality is easily on par with any of the IMAX 3D films. Even the very dark scenes work well. Being fully digital too means that there's not a blemish anywhere in the projection. The glasses fitted comfortably over my prescription lenses and it was easy to forget they were even there (something you could never do at IMAX.)I hadn't even heard of Beowulf before this film was released, so I'm not at all sensitive to any deviations from the supposed traditional folklore.There's lots of gore and even a few tits and bums. Enough pecs and abs - no where near the overkill in ""300"".There's one extended scene of Beowulf preparing for a nude wrestle with the monster - and all sorts of props appear strategically placed to obscure Beowulf's manhood - very reminiscent of Bart's nude skateboard scene in The Simpsons Movie.Beowulf worked for me as an action drama - and earned extra points for being such a state of the art 3D treat. You also get to see, and be impressed by, the 3D preview for ""Journey To the Centre Of The Earth"" (a live action feature starring Brendan Fraser).Well worth the effort for this rare cinema experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation
A legendary story suffers a legendary butchering,"I'd like to start of and say that the film gets 3 stars for the visuals, and 1 star for Angelina Jolie being naked the whole time she's on screen (a whopping 10 minutes at most). Everything else makes this incredible epic look incredibly bad. Whether it be horrible thick accents, tiresome dialog, undeveloped characters, or the horrible translation from story to screen, Beowulf takes the cake as the most disappointing film of 2007.We all know the legendary tale: Beowulf answers the call of King Hrothgar to kill the monstrous Grendel, only to incur the wrath of Grendel's mother.The plot itself is weak. It suffers from boring scene after boring scene, each revering Beowulf as a saint, though this movie transforms the epic work in a way that makes Grendel more likable. Kudos to Crispin Glover for creating a wonderful Grendel. His cries are so real and full of emotion. You're going to feel Grendel's pain. Glover and Angelina Jolie, who plays his mother, give the best performances. Jolie's accent is a little weird, but it works and she's definitely one of the better villains of 2007. I liked Ray Winstone as Beowulf, it worked, but his performance is underminded by the royal screwing his character gets in the script. Anthony Hopkins is really entertaining as the drunk Hrothgar. I hated John Malkovich in this film. How can such a fine actor become so annoying? His accent was horrible. There were no Danish accents in the entire film. There's Scottish, Welsh, and even Greek, but no Danish. In a movie set in Denmark. Nice one, Zemeckis.The visual effects are definitely wonderful. No doubt about it. Zemeckis is the master of this kind of animation, but he forgot to add a plot. I liked the finale, and the landscapes were beautiful. Beowulf deserved an Oscar nod for this department. However, the big problem I had was that the movie tried too hard to make the audience remember it's in 3D. We know it's in 3D. We're wearing these stupid glasses. Zemeckis, you failed. You've succeeded, however, in turning a literary masterpiece into a cinematic disaster.4/10 --spy",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
Woeful Beowulf creepy for wrong reasons,"While one can be impressed with all the gee-whiz technology that went into the making of ""Beowulf,"" in the end it gave me the creeps for the wrong reasons.The video game, talking avatar feel of the CG was disturbing in the sense that it made me think of cheesy wax museum figures or department store mannequins coming to life after hours.Another unintended creepiness of the film stemmed from the fact that evidently Zemeckis and company felt that people would be titillated by the gratuitous use of video game-flavored sexual references. Maybe hormone-raging adolescents who enjoy AO-rated Playstation games get a kick out of that sort of thing, but an adult would have to really be in a bad way if digitized breasts and buns turn him or her on.The fact that animated CG is such a planned, thought out, painstaking, technical process further gives the nudity and sexual overtones a rather deliberate, pornographic air that is repulsive.A bad decision from the start, one has to ask, why go the CG route? If the goal is realism, then why not a film with real actors and settings? Instead, one is left with the impression that this was intended to be an exercise in showing off and boasting, ""Hey! Look what we can do now!"" Or, in other words, they make a film likes this simply because nowadays they can. And yet, in spite of all the technical sweat and tears, the human characters still end up looking unnatural and unconvincing.In addition, the Grendel character, who looks like a cross between Gollum and the mummy from the Brendan Fraser movies, tears bodies in half and bites off heads, but the video game gore splattered everywhere is also unnatural and not convincing enough to elicit any kind of shock or horror.I also had the impression that the CG technology process overruled the subtle and sensitive nuances that make great films, and watching the special features portion of the DVD confirmed that impression. The actors, out of costume on their virtual, sterile stages, and therefore out of their natural element, appeared to be going through the motions while the director seemed satisfied that one take was good enough, since anything that might be lacking could be added in later by computer artists and technicians.With regard to the script, I am not troubled by the fact that it took liberties with the original myth. What does trouble me is that once again we have an example of a story in which we are suppose to identify with characters simply because they exist, without any substantial character development being breathed into them.Hence, we are to root for Beowulf not for any number of admirable character qualities, but only because the script says he IS the hero of the tale. Or perhaps because he is relatively less repulsive than other characters in the story.A sad waste of expertise, money, technology...this kind of CG may work for ""Shrek"" or something like ""The Polar Express"" that are intended to be pure, unrealistic fantasy, but it is still not yet ready for subject matter that is intended to be taken seriously. And ""Beowulf"" makes me wonder if it ever will be.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
"Wahhhhhh, you can't have style AND substance, it's just not possible!","Nobody seems to think that a movie can look good and have substance, so when a visually stunning movie comes along there's all of these people that whine about how its all flash, no substance no matter how much substance there actually IS ::cough:: Sin City, 300 ::Cough:: Beowulf is full to the brim of visual goodness, and its also full to the brim with mature, intelligent themes and a wonderfully complex not-so-typical lead character.This is by no means sugar coated in any way, and pushes its PG-13 rating pretty close to the breaking point.I love that they didn't make Beowulf some uber sexy thing that the girls would swoon over, instead we got a physique that fit the character instead of played off women's fantasies of a swashbuckling romance novel hero.I've read some comments that the movie ""drags"" in some places, which simply isn't true if you're actually listening to what going on and not just waiting for the next action sequence. Apparently if nobody is bleeding, the movie is dragging...ugh.I've also read comments that the eyes are ""lifeless.""

Impersonal.......................I felt trapped in a video game,"I really enjoyed this interpretation of Beowulf. The plot, story line, and flow were great. I probably would have given the movie an 8 or so if they would have used humans. Although we've advanced amazingly in technology and ""digital enhancement"" the characters movements were still robotic and unnatural in my opinion. I didn't really pay that much attention to the trailers on this movie and was shocked that it was ENTIRELY digitally generated with voice-overs. If you're going to pay the actors to do that, why not let them act? Personally, I thought the computer generated version of Robin Wright Penn as Wealthow was creepy looking and did her a great injustice for she is much prettier than the hollow-eyed computer version. Don't even get me started on what I thought of their version of the troll.... Overall, I was extremely let down with the movie because it was all computer generated.

"""Beowulf"" is a Christmas present","I saw ""Beowulf"" in 3D and I think that anybody interested in this movie should do an effort to see it in that format. Near home it was showed in 35 mm and I had to drive about 50 miles to find a theater where they showed it on 3D... And I don't regret it at all! The 3D effect is fully enmeshed with the developing of the story, and the plot is so dynamic that you have little time to think things out, you just let yourself go and enjoy the wonderful images. Maybe the plot does not follow the original literature sources, maybe you'll find a little too many nude and sexy ingredients sown here and there to drag you into the film, OK, but... who cares? The important thing is that during the whole duration of the film the only thing that matters the viewer is not to lose any minute of this magic. I think that Robert Zemeckis has created a treat for the movie fan, a premature Christmas gift that I will always remember with gratefulness.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
Madame Tussauds goes to Hollywood.,"First of all, and this is a point that was so annoying that I never really got to asses all the other aspects of the movie, the movie is digitalized or animated. For some unknown reason everything in the movie was covered with a layer of animation. This means that you never saw any acting going on. For a comedy this might work but for a movie with both tragedy and drama this is really a very unwise decision in my humble opinion. And why in heavens employ expensive actors when you are going to cover their appearance with digital effects? How they really acted or chose to interpret their character we will never know and in order to like this movie you have to be indifferent towards this. I cannot hide that I was at first quite confused and then right after very frustrated when I realized this. The animation effect was furthermore very, very amateurish. It is difficult to asses whether the animation guys on purpose had chosen to distort the facial characteristics of the actors but either way this was what happened and that was also very annoying.There isn't very much I can underline as positive. The Vikings are being portrayed as a gang of drunken and obscene imbeciles and Beowulf is the bragging hero who like to walk around naked.If you are considering spending your evening with this movie I would strongly advice against it and instead recommend Shrek 3 to you; it has trolls, heroes, dragons and animation too and on top it has a lot of humor...;-)Regards SimonPs.

Must see!   IMAX 3D best or DLP 3D,"8.5-9 out of 10. According to Reelz Dailies: Phenomenal. Rotten Tomatoes: 72%. I often see a movie twice - once for first impressions, again for what I might have missed the first time. I liked it even more the 2nd time. When I got out of 11am show, people were already in line for 1:45pm show. It was all I could do to keep myself from buying another ticket.OH YEAH, definitely worth seeing in 3D, and the IMAX 3D is superlative. Does the movie/story work? A resounding yes. You don't have to know the classic story, and if you do know it ¬ñ it's interesting to see the changes the scriptwriters made. The first half is a little slow because it's setting up the last half ¬ñ which is a more than satisfying payoff. The movie asks: what is a hero?, what is a monster?, what is human? It's very moving, and I had a few teary moments.My highlights: starting with the IMAX 10-second countdown, sheet of water in the opening credits, the running joke early on, Grendel vs. Beowulf fight, Grendel's mom, the DRAGON ¬ñ best I've ever seen. The final action sequence must be seen to be believed. I did get the epic, heroic, bigger than life feeling. I felt the same feelings like when (dating myself) I watched Steve Reeves' Hercules movies, Jason & the Argonauts, etc.Angelina has limited visual screen time, a little less than John Malkovich, but she is present throughout the movie either with her voice or characters talking about her. And her character is as key to the story as Beowulf. At the first sight of Angelina emerging from the pool (a la Marlon Brando in Apocalypse now and many movies since), the 75% male audience were moaning and cheering. It was really quite funny. With every reveal from her face to her breasts to her torso to her pelvic area to her heels and finally to the whole digital Angelina, dripping in chocolate gold, the fanboys reacted. Her face is Shiseido-ad perfection. Angelina's performance was spot on, literally pitch perfect. Totally seductive, not evil, it's her words as much as her appearance that mortal men find impossible to ignore. It's their souls they willingly hand over as she exploits their weaknesses and becomes the agent of their downfall. (I thought that this must be what anti-Angelina haters believe Angelina the person to be.)Sir Anthony is magnificent as always, Ray Winstone heroic, and Crispin Glover as Grendel is as pitiful as he is monstrous. Brendan Gleeson, Beowulf's second in command, gives a wonderful performance. Beowulf looks nothing like Ray Winstone, Grendel's mom looks totally like Angelina, and we recognize Sir Anthony's & Malkovich's faces & voices but they have different bodies from their own, Robin Wright Penn & Alison Lohman look nothing like themselves.It was like looking through those toy stereoscopes (can't remember their names ¬ñ senior moment). Then it became naturally 3D like our real world. The switch from 2D to 3D is going to be like the change from silent movies to talkies. The motion capture is about 80-90% there. Some of the characters are a little stiff and not realistic, others Like Angelina we could swear was real not digital, galloping horses need improvement.I think these are awards worthy: animation, stirring musical score, sound, production & costume design.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

"IMAX 3D Experience : You may figure out the story 1/2 way, nevertheless the effects are awesome","This is good movie and reminds me those orcs from those RPG games we used to play in the basement and The Lord of the Rings. I also think they could have made this movie bigger. The story has a good message honesty, bravery and choices in life. One must always make a choice and live with it for the rest of their life... be it lust, love, sex, fighting, lying, etc...The CGI reminded me of the Final Fantasy IV Movie. A couple times during the movie I actually felt as though I was there, (of course the actors are a little big because of the huge IMAX screen). Take for example the stormy boat voyage or the one scene with a lantern in the top left corner. B.t.w. I think sitting position has a little influence on your final experience. We sat on the left side and further to the back, but to be honest, at the end, once the place cleared up and the credits where still rolling, I moved closer to the front (ie. First row of the second section) and the experience felt a bit more enveloping. If you've never seen a 3D movie, do see this. The entire movie is 3D and beats the 10 minutes of 3D effect which came out this summer in Harry Potter.I gave it 8 out of 10 stars. Angelina Jolie is mesmerizing in her role as an evil seductress. The male actors give a comforting recognized voice. Unfortunately, I believe the lip movement was a little off from the voices at one point. The music is superb with not too much techno mixed into the classic sections. I personally believe music should stay in the background and in this case there where only a few instances where it shines... with it hidden themes. I'm no expert but the folly sounds didn't always seem quite on par with the actions. Finally, if you're the type that likes to lean your head on your companion, the 3D IMAX version may not be the best version for you. This is because the polarized lenses only work when you keep your head straight. Enjoy and watch out for the flying blood, arrows, arms, gory, arrows, spears, and great effects. A good movie to hold hands and experience an extra palpitation!I wonder what a 3D movie with the only setting being that, and imitating, of a theater play would feel like!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A film that smashes elitist pessimism to a pulp!,"Wow. I am in complete awe over this film. What's even more awe-inspiring is the level of nay-saying towards it by a select number of elitist morons. Let's start from the beginning.""Beowulf"" follows the story of a hero - whose name escapes me - and his fight against a monster or two that threaten his would-be kingdom. That's about as accurate the film is to the actual work of literature it's based upon. The sexual innuendo is heavy. The action is over-the-top and fantastic. The characters aren't as rich as they could be, but there are plenty of successful exchanges between them to prove effective.Instead of a tale preaching blind, gallant, honorable heroism, the film touches on some serious critiques over the danger of such ideas. Man is flawed and imperfect. Even great men - men of legend - have elements attributed to them that are appalling. This isn't an original theme by any means, but it rings out hard and true in the film. It rings out so true, in fact, that it seems to have shot over the heads of the demographic of ""high-end"" individuals, their ego-driven pessimism focusing on all of the ""trendy"" elements that were added to the film, giving it some spice and flare.Much like the Lord of the Rings films, ""Beowulf"" dances gracefully between pseudo-realism and outright fantasy. One second, our hero is . . . stressed . . . being grazed against a cliff-side on the back of a dragon - a second later, he is pummeled so deep into the ocean that any real human being's vitals would burst under pressure. Such a deep-sea venture does little more than ""stress"" our hero once again. I found it wildly entertaining. Questionably subjective viewers did not.Take my advice. Don't go into this film expecting a loyal adaptation of the original. Don't go into this film expecting something as mindless as ""300"", nor as carefully-woven as ""The Lord of the Rings"". Go into this film expecting something lavishly clich√©, yet unique and compelling (with a LOT of social undertones that many people don't seem to get), and that's exactly what you'll get.It's heavy. It's over-the-top. It's very well-done, and brings to light some ideas that not enough 'mainstream' films dare to approach. I enjoyed it very much.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
a film that overdoes itself and relies too much on its special effects,"""Beowulf"" was a sore disappointment for me, especially since I was expecting so much more from a talented director like Robert Zemeckis (Back to the Future, Forrest Gump, etc). His recent medieval monster movie based on an old English poem of the same name, is a messy, under-developed, poorly written, and over-reactive high-budget film that unfortunately descends into schlock. It revolves around a hero named Beowulf who likes to hunt and fight monsters and is out to fight a creature called Grendel, who has developed a sudden and unfavorable habit of attacking a local kingdom. Grendel has a sadistic mother, yet another opponent for Beowulf and his men. It was a very fine idea that could have been wonderful and glorious, but is boring and sometimes disturbing.Visually, the movie is an extravagant treat. The special effects, though not convincing at all times, are plentiful and compelling. The 3-D models that substitute in for the actors during impossible-to-perform scenes are convincing, the monsters look real, and so on and so forth. But like I mentioned in my summary, the movie relies too much on its visuals and not enough on substance. The character of our story are weak, boring, uninteresting, too simple to be compelling, and oftentimes very irritating. While there were some good performances from Ray Whinstone and Anthony Hopkins, it didn't really help any.So if character development is poor and visuals are good, does that make ""Beowulf"" a film that can just be enjoyed for what it is? Sadly, no. It still lacks substance that is present in numerous, much better mindless action movies of the same genre and order. There is not enough action for a two-hour mindless action movie, and some action sequences are completely preposterous. Such as the idea of a naked man doing somersaults through the air while fighting a monster. Or sliding down the belly of a sea monster while slicing its belly open and pouring impossible amounts of blood into the water. Overall, there are many preposterous moments in the film that devoid us of any entertainment value. It almost seems comical, but is too perturbing to be even that.In the end, ""Beowulf"" is a major disappointment. Even under command of a talented director such as Robert Zemeckis, the film can not work out. It begins as weakly and strangely as it ends.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Livening up the Anglo-Saxons,"Sturla Gunnarsson's film version of this Anglo-Saxon poem and legend a couple of years ago robbed the story of its legendary elements. Since Beowulf is a national myth freely blending the magical, fantastic, and historical, nothing very memorable, or even appropriate, came out Gunnarsson's well meaning effort to make it brooding, ""historical,"" and ""realistic""--except that he did capture the overwhelming gloom of much Anglo-Saxon poetry.Robert Zemeckis has done a new version, vivid and full of life, gore, and occasional humor. To achieve this effect he has used motion capture technology, with improvements over the previous feature to use the effect, Polar Express. He's also enlisted some rather famous actors, and the movie's been shown in regular format, a 3-D projection with the old glasses bit, and I-Max.All of which turn the tale into something fabulous, perhaps a bit kitsch, pretty entertaining, and the most ridiculous PG-13 movie ever. It's extraordinarily violent; but then, so are many traditional children's stories, myths--and national epics (the Iliad and the Odyssey aren't sweet little nursery tales; but that's the point: nursery tales aren't sweet).In the 3-D version I saw, as in the old days of 3-D, which never did catch on, spears and drops of blood and pebbles spew constantly in your face. We'd be dead or maimed if our mugs were thrust so close to such events. But after a while you get used to it. You adjust to the motion capture imagery too. It makes sense for legendary characters to have an artificial gloss. The point is there's no naturalistic way to render the Beowulf story.This movie has done well at the US box office. Some have compared it to a computer game, and it's certainly comic book or graphic novel material in the Zemeckis version. But the result is surprisingly effective, and despite some jarring elements--most people may just remember a naked Angelina Jolie with an odd accent, and maybe Crispin Glover covered in gore and spore and magnified to fifteen times a man's size, as Grendel, the monster.A highly computer-enhanced Ray Winstone (provided with a super-nautilus body) plays Beowulf, the Geat who comes to slay Grendel for Hrothgar, leader of the Danes. The story opens with the great ""mead hall"" where the early Scandinavians got drunk and swore oaths they later were held to. Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) is a drunken, fat old man with a young wife Wealhtheow (Robin Wright Penn); he's nonetheless extraordinarily brave. When the monster Grendel, a misshapen, outcast creature, comes to kill many of Hrothgar's men in the hall, Hrothgar stands up to him boldly--and survives. But the next day he closes the hall and goes into a period of grieving.When Beowulf comes along offering to slay Grendel and boasting of his prowess, he is challenged, primarily by Unferth (John Malkovitch)--an interesting character, unappealing, cowardly, but a useful foil for Beowulf whom the hero ultimately forgives and in the film version turns friendly. Unferth accuses Beowulf of exaggerating his prowess in a swimming contest. In the movie, Beowulf is a liar several important times. This is not exactly the way the story originally went, but writers Neil Gaiman and Roger Avary have embellished the original in interesting ways.The most obvious one is Angelina. ""Grendel's dam"" (an animal term for mother) as the poem calls her is never clearly described--certainly not as a big-breasted, bee-sting-lipped naked babe. This is certainly a lively element, but a pretty distracting one. Beowulf has to battle Grendel, then his mother, and then, later, a great dragon. Arguably the dragon is even more distracting, since it's a huge, spectacular, golden creature. But this makes for an appropriately grandiose climax.Grendel is pretty weird looking, a little too grotesque and disgusting and not monstrous on a heroic scale as the epic poem implies, but naturally Crispin Glover does good things with the character, making him a pitiful as well as scary figure.Scholars argue endlessly about the meaning of various elements in the story; a big issue is how strong the Christian element in it is. As someone who studied the original pretty closely at one time myself, I was impressed at how well this movie brings the story to life. It doesn't seem to have appealed much to the critics. But the ancient bard who spun out the original poem was not an art-house filmmaker. Yes, it's kitsch; yes, Angelina's a jarring element; and yes, the various accents are a dreadful mixture. But anything that leads people back to the oldest English literary tradition of all and gives it popular appeal again seems pretty worthwhile to me.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Terrible Adaptation,"This terrible adaptation transforms the lyrically elegant morality tale of a warrior-king who dooms his people to oblivion because of his own quest for fame into a butt-kicking action flick. Beware! Anyone watching this horrendous adaptation as a short-cut to reading the book for a class, the changes that have been made are arbitrary.For example: - Grendel's mother is NOT impregnated by Beowulf in the poem. Nor is she the beautiful naked Angelina Jolie -- she is more akin to the reptilian title character from ALIEN.-Hrothgar is NOT the father of Grendel. Nor does he commit suicide by leaping from the parapet after giving his crown to Beowulf.-Beowulf becomes the king of the Geats (southern Sweden) not the Danes as he does in the movie.-Beowulf does not marry Hrothgar's widow and then sleep around with the castle wench. In fact, in the poem Beowulf neither has an heir nor marries. His fatherlessness is a source of regret on his deathbed. His cellibacy contributed to his image as a Christ figure.Though the animation is well-done, and the direction and editing contribute to a fast-paced film, the utter disregard for the story is appalling.",3.0,Anonymous,Animation
Captures an Essence,"Having never read the story before, I came into Beowulf not knowing exactly what to expect. However, within the first five minutes, I was sold on the ambiance of the picture. Robert Zemenkis creates a mileu of a beautiful yet unforgiving snowy landscape that sets the tone for the story, (the same kind of dark ambiance one can expect in Harry Potter). I came in expecting excessive spectacle, ( like 300), and granted, there was some, but not in excess. The 3-d effect was a also a welcomed addition. The only thing I grew weary of was the lack of development in Beowulf character, whereas they stereotyped him as a Leonidas like hero, brawling, boisterous, and full of hubris.

Nothing too complicated.The pix-elated toss fest that was observed this evening could have been avoided. With the money they spent a hospital could have been built, lives - real lives could have been saved. A revolution perhaps? or just simply not contributing all that poisonous gas (produced when running all the computers and other technical gadgetry) into our fragile atmosphere. Al Gore.. where are you when the world needs you most? Having said that.. to put it simply - it was a crap movie made about what appears to be a good Tome.Why? Why was it made? Why was the only perk seeing Jolies computer generated lop-sided breasts... and even then, no nipple.With or without the nipple - it still sucked.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
Absolutely mind-blowing,"If there is anything I like about animated movies like this is the prospect of watching unseemly things being done with a perfection. I mean, where else would you get to see Angelina Jolie in a full-frontal shot with the camera strategically pausing at the .....ahem..... points of interest....... and don't go telling me that the movie witch ain't Angelina.....'cause there can't be two women in the world with such delicious lips......lol.Anyway, the movie seriously takes up the benchmarks for 3D-animated movies, 'cause now that we've seen this, we're going to ask for CGI that is better than this movie and then some more. The plot is tightly woven and historically correct as far as I have researched on the backgrounds of this historical character. The CG has slipped off its realistic approach at some points but that is understandable with the budget constraints, but still, there are some points where you wish the animation was a bit more realistic.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Wow! That was really tough....,"Before seeing this movie I was, like many of you, excited to see it from the ""amazing"" visuals we all saw in the previews. Unfortunately that 20 second clip was ALL that was good in this dreadful movie, and to be honest they should have just kept it to that 20 seconds instead of wasting 1 1/2 hours of my life. I should have counted but I think there was a total of 20 lines per actor in the whole damned movie. There couldn't have been more awkward moments between characters because of a lack of dialog and good acting. To say that you simply didn't care about any of the characters is an understatement. Does anybody even know what Malkovich's character was there for? I mean holy **** people!

It's close to what I thought it would be,"It's just not for me, I guess. I never read the poem, but I was in the mood to watch an action packed fantasy flick. To be honest, the only real surprise it was not as lowbrow as I originally thought. However, this post 300 CGI circle jerk is still pretty bad. This barely qualifies as a movie with bad digital effects that looks more like a video game then a movie. There are some talented actors that are wasted here like Anthony Hopkins and Ray Winstone doing some voice work. I found this hard to watch and take seriously on any level. The action sequences and acting is very overdone to the point that it becomes extremely grating and corny. This was supposed to be highbrow, but for a mainly lowbrow audience of teeny boppers with a love of fake looking action sequences and even faker special f/x. As a movie I thought this was slightly better than 300, but that's not saying much as I walked out of the theater halfway through that piece of crap. This seems to be made with that audience in mind, so if you like that type of thing (movies that look like bad video games) you might get some enjoyment out of this. For me, Beowulf was a complete waste of time that I could have spent seeking better entertainment.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

"Heroes, Ego's, Temptation and Redemption.","Went to see this at the IMAX in Waterloo, London. Great fun to watch-made all the more so by meeting Beowulf himself- Ray Winstone, who had sneaked in with his wife to catch the film on a relatively quiet Monday afternoon.Sorry Ray- I had to get a photo! The film opens and after a few minutes of settling into the ""3D"" format (initial camera tracking/panning shots appeared a little blurry to me), the movie set its stall out quickly.Grendal, the genetically deformed ""monster""-spawn of the union of a water demon and a man, is tortured to the point of self-harming by sounds of revelry and fornication coming from the drinking hall of King Hrothgar. The creature is great- not traditionally scary or cool-looking, ala Alien or predator, more a melting pot of the Fly crossed with gollum on steroids! Grendal is closer to Karloff's sad & misunderstood monster in Frankenstein, than any evil incarnate. However, he wrecks a terrible blood-thirtsy revenge on the men and women of the town. This was a superb, grotesque and horrific slaughter-brought to life by the huge IMAX ""3D"" screen. Beowulf enters the fray, travelling from overseas, seeking glory and reward. Inadvertently, his ambition is sowing the seeds of his own destruction at the hands of the only mortal who can defeat him- himself. The boastful, but likable portrayal of the young hero is captured wonderfully by the unrecognisable Winstone, as is Hopkins King Hrothgar. Angelina Jolie has never looked more sensual- and all in a CGI/motion capture movie!Beowulf defeats Grendal-but at what price? Will The temptation into the Faustian pact between Beowulf and the beasts mother be his undoing? Will he realise the true cost of his actions?The final battle with the Dragon is superb!The original Epic story comes from a 3000+ lined poem from England-as early as 700A.D. and contains many of the key emotional elements of human-kinds greatest strengths and weaknesses.PLUS POINTS: The 3D and the motion capture CGI is getting better and better- not much of the dead zombie eyes in this. Brutal, action packed set pieces. A solid story. NEGATIVE FACTORS: -The naked Beowulf's genitals being covered in every shot by furnishings, foreground etc, ala Austin Powers- should have left him with his wolf skin pants on! -The animated horses were poor in terms of capturing their motion- seemed a little unconvincing. - People moaning about it doesn't look totally real! Get over it- it isn't!One thing I have to say, just because this is in essence an ""animated"" movie- does not make it ""Walt Disney"" by any means! To suggest kids younger than 12 (even if accompanied by an adult) can see this is crazy! The censors should be ashamed!",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
For what it is - it's really pretty good,"This is simply the best 3D film that I've ever seen. Although there are a few times where they still are playing with the technology which are extraneous and distracting, on the whole the 3D experience is well integrated and used to bring out the action in the film. Some of the shots in the hall and in caves were excellent and subtle uses of the technology. The final breathtaking battle scenes were less subtle but effective uses of 3D to generate excitement and bring out different points of views.What's great about this film is that the parts that you expect to suffer in a CGI movie - acting, plot, characters (think the later Star Wars films) are actually surprisingly strong. The performances are good, closer to the level of LOTR, than Attack of the Clones. Most surprising was how intelligently (relatively speaking- remember this *is* Hollywood) the plot was treated. The beginning of the film is based on the original Beowulf story and they cleverly justified this by having the story preserved in the songs (and recited in old English in one part) which is how it comes down to us. The ending which is new, while tacked on for the effects, was still, IMO, in keeping with the mood and atmosphere of the English classic.And did I mention the CGI and 3D effects?Pay the extra to see it in IMAX, the sound and 3D are worth it and make sure you sit far enough away from the screen - if the entire screen isn't in your field of view things can get blurry.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Longest Video Game Trailer Ever,I am not sure what possessed any one to make a cg movie of Beowulf other than a potential market of profit. The market being 12 to 20 year olds that are video game players. That particular market is rip for money.The story is well known to many so nothing new there and the cg work was 20 years old at best.I am an avid video game trailer watcher and love many of them and this movie was not even close to being as good as any video game trailer i've watched.I am also a lover of anime and this movie is well below the average anime movie never mind the good ones.I'm having trouble believing any one could have enjoyed this film but if you did your luckier than i am because you have something to enjoy and i do not.,5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Why call this Beowulf?,"Wrong name for an average movie. I lost track of all the embellishments about 30 minutes into it, turned it off after Beowulf met up with Grendal's mother (in her lair). To name this ""Beowulf"" is ridiculous. Will there ever be a film that actually tells the story of Beowulf? No. Not as long as films are made to please the ignorant masses. This flick is about making money - not about making film or telling a proper story. Pass, unless you weren't interested in seeing the story of Beowulf.Well, IMDb needs some more lines of text. I mean, really, when a movie completely removes the air from your pool toy - what can you say? After the film ""Beowulf and Grendal"" totally let me down, I thought this one would be different. WRONG! This one was probably worse. I could go into detail about every single embellishment, but other reviews have done that already. My biggest complaint was that Beowulf wasn't nearly big enough. He should have been huge, like the biggest man on earth. His arms and chest should have been massive. In the real story Beowulf held Grendal by the hand during their entire battle, then he literally ripped Grendal's arm off. Ripped it off with sheer strength. And what happened to the firesnakes? Didn't Beowulf have to swim through firesnakes to get to Grendal's lair? Nevermind. I'm sure this is enough text by now. Read some of the ""Hated It"" reviews to see all the ""mistakes"" this film made.",1.0,Anonymous,Animation
Superb Nietzchean Revision of Beowulf,"If you have read the Beowulf, the book Grendel, and some work by Nietzche ,especially, Genelogy of Morality, then this script will surely be of great satisfaction to you. If you are hoping for the uber-Christian hero of the original epic you have come to the wrong movie. The movie alters the elements of the original story, casting all the main characters and events in a light that is not early-Christin propaganda, but instead a decidedly unchristian interpretation.As to the visual effects, i thought they worked very well sense a CGI creatures in most movies tend to stick out like a sore thumb. With the whole movie as a digital rendering the actors and monsters at least seemed to exist within the same visual field.I am very surprised that this got a PG-13 rating as it is sexually explicit in many ways and graphically violent in even more. I would certainly not recommend taking younger children to the movie.In summation this movie was an intelligent action film that had developed and flawed characters, and was not afraid to ridicule itself and its genre from time to time. Ingenuity of Visual Effects, Intelligent Plot, unique adaption, humor, and good pacing made this movie well worth seeing.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beowulf: Monster slayer from Stepney,"Started watching this movie again last night. Got as far as 'Beowulf's' line: 'I will kill your monster!' delivered by actor Ray Winstone in an outrageous 'Cockney' accent. All that was missing was 'Orrite Guvnah?' at the end. 'Beowulf' is one of those movies you wish was fabulous as it's such a great story and great cast including Sir Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie and John Malkovich, but on top of Winstone's 'Cockney Beowulf' the cgi renderings of the characters (apart from the Gollum-like 'Grendel') are woefully wooden. Also, the delivery of the lines by the other actors, even the usually compelling Malkovich, is as wooden as the cgi rendering of him. He looks like a deranged version of Max Wall. Zemeckis (who also made the equally terrible 'Polar Express', again using all cgi) should have used live action and green screen a la 'Lord Of The Rings'. For the next remake, I hope Peter Jackson picks it up, then it would be a fabulous movie... as long as he recasts the lead.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Strong Soild film that may be much better then most think...,"Beowulf is a motion-cap adaptation of the epic poem and is here to show off it's glory. The cast is racked up with people like Ray Winestone, Robin Wright Penn, Anthony Hopkins yes; Angelina Jolie. The story is about Beowulf attempt to fight and defeat Grendel and then later he must take on Grendel's Mother who wants some hard-core revenge. When the film opens it seems to be a very average film via effects but when Beowulf arrives the film beings to look much better. A scene in which Beowulf fights giant sea creatures left my jaw on the floor. First of all the detail and lighting is perfect then I was surprised how much they could put into a PG-13 film. Zemeckis has shown improvement from 'The Polar Express' but still does not have the 'Forest Gump' thing going on but it's very close to it. The only thing that ruins Beowulf is that the story gets a little off-beat but Gaiman and Avary's script shines most of the time. All together Beowulf is much better then 300 and will epically be one of the best films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Always a hero comes home,"While the Polar Express has become an Xmas classic in the past 12 years Zemeckis' follow-up has sort of taken a backseat (and his return to live action has been met with constant disappointment). It's a shame because Beowulf is a visually stunning film with a dark, brooding atmosphere. It may not be Xmas-y but it sure is winter-y and perfect viewing for this time of year.Based on the ancient epic poem (among the very earliest ""English"" literature) the story sees famous hero Beowulf arrive in Denmark to defeat Grendel, a horrific monster who has been terrorizing the locals. Beowulf likes to exaggerate his life and some are suspicious of him but when he lures Grendel into a confrontation his reputation is validated and he quickly becomes the reigning monarch. Many decades later Grendel's mother reveals a shocking secret and threatens Beowulf's kingdom with total destruction.This is not the family-friendly viewing of the Pole Ex. Beowulf is brutal, bloody, very gory, and sometimes hard to watch. Grendel is one of the most gruesome, ugliest monsters ever to appear in a movie but Crispin Glover's typically eccentric performance (after settling a years-long feud with Zemeckis over BTTF 2) is harrowing and sympathetic. He may be a merciless killer but it's very hard not to feel sorry for him. Themes of surrendering to wicked temptation, regret, and mortality continue to resonate to this day. In fact, I honestly cannot think of any other work of fiction that has had as much influence on literature, history, and even popular culture (other than the Bible) as the ancient poem by Anonymous.Alan Silvestri's score is, as usual, highly involving and emotional lending a huge weight to the cold, lonely feel of the movie. Ray Winstone is the perfect actor to bring a voice to the character mixing cockney charm, bravado, honor, and secret shame to what might otherwise be a hollow CGI creation.Please do not write this movie off. It seems like it still struggling to find an audience despite being one of my favorite of Zemeckis' career.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Mediocre,"I wasn't really that interested in the movie Beowulf, but i when i got a chance to see it on DVD i thought i might as well. And honestly it was a bewildering experience.Robert Zemeckis is in my opinion a fairly competent director, although not the most exciting one. Somehow it seems he's made it his ""thing"" to make special-effects heavy movies that even have effects where none are needed. I remember watching the (quite good) ""What Lies Beneath"", not realizing that almost every scene had been full of CGI. So it seems that Zemeckis gets a high from CGI (it rhymes!) and of course to each his own... But Beowulf really suffers from this. Maybe it's just me, but i can't see the point of this movie being animated like it is. You take good actors, nice-looking actors, and animate them to look like plastic versions of themselves. The effect is somewhat reminiscent of a slightly more realistic Shrek. Why would they do this? The CGI is so good today that they could just record the movie in front of a green-screen and add whatever they want, why animate the characters? This is my main problem with this movie, especially since the CGI doesn't look very good. The animations are stiff and objects seem to lack weight and substance in a way that was more common in CGI a couple of years ago.I can't say that this movie ""did it"" for me aside from the CGI either. The story has been seen many times before and it's not really spectacular any more. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's uninteresting, but it does lack something to make it truly interesting. A definite upside to the movie is the actors. There are many recognizable voices (and faces, although they look plastic-wrapped) and many of them do a fine job with the material. I have always liked Ray Winstone and he doesn't disappoint here either. Most of the supporting cast were good, and Angelina Jolie was awful as usual. I honestly don't see what she has going for her except her looks. She re-uses the Russian accent from ""Alexander"" and puts in another pathetic performance. It's impressive to get so far while being so lousy in most of what you do.Anyway, to sum things up i guess this could have been an interesting movie save for a few major flaws. We have a story that's a bit bland, characters that are hard to care about and a visual style that is severely lacking. On the upside we have mostly good actors, a good orchestral score and fair entertainment as long as it lasts. The next time around i hope they go for a more natural look, skip the CGI and work harder on the script. Unfortunately, this movie is mediocre.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beowolf,"I went to see Beowulf, expecting extravagant effects and elaborate animation. For the most part the movie had reached my expectations, however there were many elements that ultimately destroyed the movie. I walked out of the movie theater regretting seeing this film. Beowulf is just another fast-paced action movies, that very desperately tries to obtain a prehistoric element. Inevitably, the movie did not leave any traces of the old English Poem that ""Beowulf"" seem to mention. This of course was predicted, due to the fact that the makers are from Hollywood. In addition, ""Beowulf"" contained no sign of originality whatsoever. The film follows the lead of ""300,"" with the main character roaring similar phrases such as ""I am Beowulf!."" The 3D effects, ultimately did not effect the movie besides the slow- motion gore shots and jagged arrows flying towards your eyes.

The legend of Beowulf,"The Olde English poem about the Norse adventure of warrior Beowulf who battles the creature Grendel and then later his mother gets the CGI treatment from director Robert Zemeckis.To be fair CGI would give the film a better graphic representation of the poem but the CGI actors still have that dead eye visuals.The film is set in the time of pagan gods but Christianity is in the fringes and King Hrothgar's (Anthony Hopkins) counsellor John Malkovich is an early convert. However the life of merriment in the kingdom is disturbed when Grendel attacks and the King offers a large bounty to the person who slays him but the King seems to harbour a dark secret which is wife (Robin Wright)is suspicious of.Beowulf (Ray Winstone)takes up the challenge and then goes into battle with his mother (a sultry CGI Angelina Jolie) and it seems the mistakes of the past are about to repeat itself.The film is an adaptation of the poem and the visuals add an atmosphere especially the action sequences but the CGI visuals of the actors are still not right. The mixture of different acting styles looks jarring such as mixing Welsh Hopkins, Cockney Winstone and American Malkovich.The film is also portentous and actually starts to drag once the action and slaughter is finished as the screenplay had to expand the story in order for it to be turned into a feature length film.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Excellent Movie Less Action as first thought,"I don't understand why lots of people are commenting on the movie being like 'shrek' only different? There are no talking donkeys or green ogres and it isn't strictly for kids, it obviously had less action then it first looked like it would (that is why it has only received 9 rather than 10) but as a Fantasy movie it is superb. The poem of Beowulf has served as one of the key corner stones for all fantasy (even influenced LotR).Presentation: The beautiful CGI is fantastic, all the characters look amazing. Sometimes the characters have a plastic look but its never to serious (and it was done in a stylish way). People complain that you are being shown 3D just for sake of '3D' but the truth is it looks outstanding and if I had made it I would want it to be shown a bit.Story: Is a decent fantasy story and superbly presentedVoice Acting: The Voice Acting is fantastic, they use actual danish accents at points combined with other light accents which you notice but doesn't ruin the film. Ray Winstone fits the character perfectly and so does everyone else. Grendels voice is fantastically portrayed.Action: The action is superb in the fight scenes. The last one being purely amazing.Conclusion: Even though I was let down by the lack of action, the film looks fantastic but the story falls perfectly into fantasy and is what you expected (some people have said it wasn't plausible, its a fantasy film what do you expect. Are you saying LotR was?)9/10 - Highly Recommend seeing this movie especially in IMAX, Digital or 3D. It is utterly superb. Excellent Fantasy Movie that should not be compared to 300 and Shrek, its in a totally different genre and secondly 300 was a hybrid of real people and CGI whilst Beowulf is complete CGI.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation

Modern Viking Hero,"Beowolf is an entertaining action movie. I vaguely remembered the story from long ago English lessons, so I expected the film to be dull but worthy, but it was enjoyable and often gripping. The dialog is cleverly written and you soon forget you are watching animated characters. Beowolf as a hero, would not be out of place in Marvel or D.C. Comics. The film also has a sense of humor.Liberties are obviously taken with the original story so that Beolwolf is depicted as a hero with character flaws and marital problems. These these adjustments probably make the film more palatable to modern audiences and make him appear more sympathetic. The story starts with a Danish king (Hopkins) who is being terrorized by a monster called Grendel. He sends for help and Beowolf arrives from Sweden with his team of warriors. Beowolf is initially made to seem like a silly, loud-mouthed braggart, but he quickly proves he is brave and up to the challenge. Beowolf likes to fight fairly and brawls with monsters in the buff.The ""cast"" are excellent although, the accents seem all over the place. The digitalized Beowulf combines the head of a twenty-something Ray Winstone (who is fat and fifty) with the body of a superhero. Winstone also sounds like a Swede who has spent a lot of time in south London. Robin Wright Penn is a Danish queen who sounds Welsh. Angelina Jolie who plays Grendel's mother has a strange unidentifiable accent and spends most of her time on screen naked and in high heels. Her character is a beautiful yet vicious seductress who charms men by offering them sexual favors. It's a fun movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beowolf Fails Again,"The best thing about the 2007 Beowolf is the performances and dialog appropriate to the story and setting. The second best thing was the background scenery. Where the movie fails is with its silly looking special effects which were NOT enhanced by the awful camera work and excessive zoom-lens jump-about. Also, I thought the story was weakened by a lack of camaraderie among the men.Angelina Jolie is a true beauty and she did not need a ""nude scene"" where her breasts are enhanced with rubber to a 60+ size. How silly. Also, besides the rubber breasts, most of us prefer our women without over-sized scale-laden tails wagging like a T-rex. How does a man have sex with a creature like that? And why? What's the logistics of dealing with a 100 pound T-rex tail wagging all over creation? Since Beowolf does just fine with women his age or half his age he could ""just walk away"" from any woman with a questionable unsightly giant tail.Sixty years ago Hollywood excelled in making outstanding pictures in this genre. But now they lack creative talent with the maturity to put the breaks on the Whiz Kids with all the fancy gadgets that simply wreck most 2007 movies. A film like this --- almost without suspense because of continual misjudgments by the director --- will run its course on DVD in the next few months and end up in the same dumpster as a Styrofoam clam from Mickey Dee's, while the classics of 1938-1950 will be sought-out long after we are all planted in the ground.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
An epic old English poem reasonably expressed as a movie,"Beowulf is an ancient English epic poem of over 3,000 lines that is known as having been first written down sometime between 975 and 1025 CE. It is set in Scandinavia, a land of bitter cold, mountains, moors and mysteries. Beowulf is a traditional hero, coming to the aid of a king and kingdom besieged by a hideous monster, defeating it in battle and then being hailed as a hero.
When the original story opens, the mead hall of Hrothgar, King of the Danes, is attacked by the monster Grendel. Beowulf vows to kill the monster, which he does. Enraged by the death of her son, Grendel's mother seeks revenge, and in a second titanic battle, Beowulf succeeds in killing her as well.
Beowulf then returns to his own kingdom and assumes the position of king. Fifty years later, a dragon becomes enraged when a gold cup is stolen from its' lair. It emerges and begins burning everything it encounters. Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon and Beowulf insists that he carry on the battle alone. Outmatched, Beowulf is losing the fight until his warrior friend Wiglaf disobeys orders and assists Beowulf. The dragon is killed, but Beowulf is mortally wounded, and the story ends with his funeral pyre burning.
The producers take some significant poetic license with the original story, specifically in the rendition of the battle between Beowulf and Grendel's mother and Beowulf's ascension to the throne. Yet, this is another demonstration of how the old epic poems of heroism can be made into quality modern movies.
It is unfortunate that Beowulf is not given more attention in K-12 English classes, for it is the northern European equivalent to the Iliad of Homer. With this movie as an educational aid, it will be much easier to generate interest among the students in this key element of Western Civilization.",10.0,Anonymous,Animation

The problem is that when you are not directors, is behind a monitor, you can write what you want, reaching even to write untruths. On the Internet everything happens often, most of the films are rejected, not because the films are produced evil but because there are few characters particularly receptive.

In research I found that the movie was going to be made using a progressing style of filming called motion capture (used previously in the family Christmas movie The Polar Express) in which movements of actors are digitally recorded and then animated over, it seemed like it might be a good idea, and the fact that the movie was being put through all sorts of editing to keep it PG-13 made me believe that perhaps this wouldn't be just another ""fit-as-much-blood-into-this-as-possible"" type of action film.Although I have to admit that the movie was entertaining and the special effects beyond belief, overall the film was disappointing. Improved as the motion capture effect was, the humans' movements were floppy and almost comical, I was reminded forcefully of the Shrek movies where the humans have overly-thick sausage fingers and sharp, unnatural movements. The only relief from these human images was close-ups of the characters faces where the detail was so rich it was almost impossible to tell if the image was real or computer generated. Real human actors would have done much better.Another setback which utterly destroyed what would have otherwise been a successfully entertaining first half was the fact that the monster Grendel, which was the main reason for Beowulf's heroics, was laughable. Given a human voice (and a whiny one at that), Grendel pitifully screams his way through the first fight in which he demolished half the population of the village he's attacking. Rather than grimacing at the fact that he tears a person in half at one point, the audience laughed at how bad his presence was. Even I found him annoying.And the rating? The most shocking part of the film was the fact that it was rated PG-13. So full of violence was this movie that a family in the theater with me left before the end of the film. As I said before, a person is ripped in half right before our eyes, twenty-something people are hung from the ceiling with their skin torn off and blood dripping down their bodies. What were they thinking when they gave the rating? I don't suggest this movie for younger brothers or sisters.Disappointing though it was, the movie, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Angelina Jolie, and Crispin Glover, wasn't a total loss and was actually pretty decent when you got past all its flaws¬Öand bad first half. The only justification for going to see it in theaters is to fully appreciate the beauty with which the backgrounds and other scenery were made.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
should be rated R,"i went to see this movie in 3d and expecting a nice PG-13 movie. But what I got was a nonstop gore-fest.I wont spoil the movie for anyone but it was really bloody. There were parts where blood would splatter on the camera it got so bad.

I just would have enjoyed it more if it was rated R or if they just took out the gore. And if you still want to see it, watch it in 3-D, the 3-d was amazing!some people complained about it being animated, I believe they wouldn't have been able to pull off the monsters if it wasn'tit was a good movie just way too gory for PG-13",4.0,Anonymous,Animation
"visually incredible, excellent animation, and epic movie.","Beowulf is the proof of what can be done with animation nowadays, a movie that seems to be acted by real people but that is actually made completely by cgi. A film that follows the same line as 300. Beowulf tells the story of the kingdom of King Hrothgar which is currently being terrorized by a monster named Grendel, help comes in the form of mighty Beowulf, it is his job to slay the monster, but with the death of the monster comes new problems to the powerful hero, the story is very interesting, with a lot of action and adventure that will leave you on the edge of your seat. The cast is just wonderful, Anthony Hopkins, John Malkovich, Angelina Jolie, Robin Wright Penn and Ray Winstone everybody with their animated character and giving stunning performances.

dumb cartoon,"Ah ""Beowulf"" great story, An Balls out Anglo-Saxon poem from long ago. Ah Robert Zemeckis and Neil (sandman) Gaiman, two enormously overrated hacks. Hence we have ""Beowulf"" the cheesy cartoon! I know, some are screaming it's CGI! Big, fat hair deal, it's animated, for the most part badly, I do give this cartoon a 5, largely because it has one kick-ass dragon! But dozy is it dumb.Beowulf, voiced by Ray Winstone but bearing no resemblance to the pudgy actor, is a conceited, boastful lying pig-ape in this cartoon who roams bout with his fellow geeks, oops sorry, Geats, offering to slay monsters and demons in return for women or gold. Yeah, what a hero. His BFF is Hamish, sorry Waflig, or some such dippy name, it's Hamish from ""Braveheart"" Honest. At the beleaguered hall of Santa Claus, oops again sorry, it's Hrothgar, voiced by Anthony Hopkins, apparently he's started drinking again. King Santa had a young queen who looks like an uncomfortable waxen cross breed between Meryl Streep and Robin Wright if she was fat and wore a bad wig. Anyhoo, Hrothgar made some mistake sand his hall is being bitch-smacked by the monster Grendel who looks rather like a knobby troll.Naturally Beobreath rips Grendel and wins the day. For some reasons no explained by this cartoon he goes to see GRendel's Mom, voiced in a Russian accent by Agnelina Jolie. Ah Good ole Bob Zemeckis, he gives us the cartoon asses of Hopkins and Winstone, but Angie? Nah, gold dipped and phony as hell. Sigh.After Hrothgar drowns in his corn flakes, Beowuss becomes king. Flash forward ma ny years, we don't' know how many, and Beo has a queen and a girl Urusla, who looks like a min-me of the queen. Princess? Daughter, no just some bitch for Beoballs to hammer at night when he gets bored with Robin, er Wealthrow, Uh-huh, again what a great ""hero"" he is! Well he's sinned big time too and that comes back to bite him in his still tight and curiously hairless rear.Ugh, there are some pluses here, some dynamic action, some rousing songs, but it's all misogynistic and dumb and well it's a freakin cartoon! It's also waay long and simplistic. Even the ending is kinda vague, though most epic poems or sagas if you prefer, were vague in their endings, i. e. GAwain and the Green Knight. Anyhoo, check ""Beowulf' the cartoon if you liked ""Brave"" pretty similar and again the Dragon is awesome!! 15yold boys may rate this much higher.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
"I am Beowulf, hear me roar...","Actually, I liked this movie. I think I would have liked it even without the 3D effects that are peppered throughout this movie. It tells a good story and sets up the plot for an energetic finale where the movie really earns its price of admission. I did find Beowulf a bit over-the-top bombastic at times (hence my summary line), but this eventually gave way as his character evolved and I was able to write that off simply as character development. That annoyance aside, I should mention something about the CGI, which was marvelous. Note that The ENTIRE movie is CGI...there are no live actors present, although the CGI characters look like their real-life counterparts in places (i.e. Anthony Hopkins' character looks like Anthony Hopkins). I found this funny since I usually associate CGI with creating brand-new fantasy characters (Grendel? Also played by an actor but nothing you can recognize), not with attempting to model actual actors. I'm not sure if I really like that aspect of the CGI...if I wanted to see Angelina Jolie somehow I expect the real thing. But that's just IMHO, and it really doesn't take away from an otherwise good movie....",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Don't let this become a sub genre. PLEASE!,"I saw this film in 3D, and it entertained me. Unfortunately, it did little more than entertained me. To be honest, it either seems like this was a style rip-off of 300, or Frank Miller's unique style is going to become a genre. Another battle based CGI historic thing isn't really what we need. It did have some originality though, with the way it seemed like it was about something which kept coming back, in different forms, usually, but it all seemed abit messy. Not only that, but it had several anti-religious messages throughout the film, and they were all kind of arrogant pagan/atheist ones. It was just generally abit of a dodgy film, and it kind of ripped off 300, which, for anyones's information, is brilliant.

Average at best,"Bad to average unfortunately. Takes great liberties with the source material (read pisses on them from a great height) but is watchable as a brainless action flick (although brainless action is really not the point of the original Anglo-Saxon text). I imagine it'll be quite a big hit at the cinema but it just didn't float my boat. The CGI was fantastic, although it failed to convey the sense of emotion that real actors would; in some scenes you are left wandering as to what the characters are supposed to be conveying by their rather bizarre computer generated facial expressions. The score has a few great tracks but is nothing exceptional. To be completely honest if you are genuinely interested in the Anglo-Saxon ""real"" Beowulf then check out Beowulf and Grendel with Gerard Butler. If you want a brainless action fest based loosely on the events in the source material then check out 13th Warrior with Antonio Banderas.",4.0,Anonymous,Animation

It's entirely in CG!,"I was surprised to find that this film was shot entirely in computer graphics--no live action. I wasn't prepared by anything I'd read, including the jacket on the DVD itself. Why weren't the producers more open about this? Did they think we wouldn't notice? The CG gave the movie an unintended creepiness-the figures looked almost alive, but not quite, giving the impression that they were animated corpses. I'd much rather see real people. In addition to the problem of the almost-but-not-quite-right appearance of people, I didn't like how much the CG allowed the producers to show. When the appearance of a monster is implied rather than suggested, it takes some of the power out of the effect.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation
a masterfully crafted CG epic,"I didn't really expect much out of this one - I mainly watched it cause there was nothing better to see in the cinema that week - and was pleasantly surprised. Perhaps it isn't very accurate compared to the original work, but tells a great legend of its own. The movie is not a typical Hollywood flick - not too many clich√©s, not too much romance - which I find very refreshing and totally appropriate for the theme. The movie isn't very ambitious in its scope and doesn't take itself too seriously, but still succeeds in creating proper setting and atmosphere. This is very much helped by the language Grendel uses - I don't know if it's actual Old Norse (or Old English), but at least the distorted pronunciation is really fitting. The CG itself is, of course, top-notch and, quite surprisingly, very realistic looking. Believe me, the trailer doesn't make this one justice - it's not only flashy action sequences and doesn't look that cartoony. Highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Animation
The CGI is a little bit too much and takes away from the story,"I remember a year ago seeing the trailer for Beowulf and to be honest, nothing seemed too special about it. I know the poem, lucky enough I never had to read it, my friends said it was boring, so never found interest enough to read it on my own. I saw Beowulf on DVD for rental and figured just to go ahead and check it out. So I watched the film this morning and honestly, I wasn't that impressed with it. The story itself was an interesting one and I think I might read the poem after all, although from what I'm reading from here on IMDb, the movie wasn't all that accurate to the poem itself. But my main problem with the film is the CGI, I know this is a fantasy type of film, but Lord of the Rings was able to pull off a fantasy type of feel with a live action film. The bad looking effects just take over what could've been a great epic film.Hrothgar is the king of his Denmark land, but there are demons that are attacking him and his people. He and his soldiers are not able to defeat the demon, so they send for a hero. Thankfully a hero is on his way, he is called Beowulf, I like to call him Beobuff. He has come to save the day with his men and they do succeed in killing one of the demons. Unfortunately, the demon's mom does not take this so lightly and offers Beowulf a deal in exchange for a new son. But things take a dark turn when Hrothgar knows a little more about the woman/demon who wanted a son.Beowulf is an alright movie, seriously though, would I recommend it? Not really, the story was wonderful and magical, but the way the film was made and the cast was not what I would've done if I created the movie. I think it would have been a better idea to use unknown actors, because we have these incredible actors who are aways a pleasure to watch on the screen, but seriously, on Beowulf, this was not their film. The CGI is way too over the top and looks very fake, I didn't enjoy the ""eye candy"". If you read the poem, go ahead and check the film out, if you haven't, you might not get into it.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Breathtaking and weird,"Two years ago ""The Polar Express"" was released and it was done entirely in 3-D motion capture. The result was amazing landscapes but the people looked glassy and their eyes were soulless and lifeless. Two years later the same thing has been done for ""Beowulf"" and this time the result is even better. The landscapes, people, and creatures all look better than real life, but the eyes still look soulless, which is why the motion capture idea will never fully work. You can never animate that look in our eyes, that little twinkle, and since they can't it takes away from the realism. That being said this movie is stunning, amazingly well done, and a man's movie. Sure, girls will like it, if they like seeing a guy battle eight sea monsters, simultaneously flying from monster to monster. So this is defiantly for us geeks. Another sequence features Beowulf battling a dragon for a good seven minutes, and it is one of the best action scenes this year. Geek-out time!Though there are many battles, some parts in-between do drag, all you can think while the characters chat away is, ""How are they going to blow me away in the next scene?"" And they always do, ""Beowulf"" will fry your senses. This is not the ""Beowulf"" you remember reading though, the only thing that remains the same is Beowulf battling Grendel.And the character of Grendel is a huge achievement. He is so grotesque and yet at the same time you feel pity for him. Props to the designers for making a creature that beats even Gollum of ""Lord of the Rings"". Ray Winstone as Beowulf does a great job making a regularly bigger, older guy into a muscular warrior all thanks to CG. And of course there is Angelina Jolie as Grendel's serpent like mother, and that's all I'll say. And when you see it, be sure to see it in 3-D, because unlike other 3-D films released lately where they fry your eyeballs, this one doesn't hurt your eyes. And it is so cool seeing snow and arrows fly in front of your eyes, and buckets and buckets of creature blood that dump all over you.Battles, monsters, and Angelina Jolie, what more could a guy want?",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Not even going to bother,"Okay, i haven't even seen it, nor do I intend to. I guess my commentary is that I wouldn't pay 8 bucks to see a cartoon.

The man hanging off a clock face in a 1930's movie is REALLY HANGING ON A CLOCK FACE! The job of the director was to make us think that the actor was in peril...it helps get us into the escapism. But a cartoon? We now have special effects that can make us believe men are fighting dragons, that orcs are marching to our walls, that elves are shooting bows....whatever....but to make a cartoon just seems a cheaper way of getting my 8 bucks.

Interesting movie,"This movie is worth seeing if you're curious of what 3d animation can give these days.Technically speaking, the camera angles and shots are amazing, and the characters are almost photo realist. Actually, I'd say they are, the only glitch in the photorealism of this movie comes when the different elements are integrated together (environment, characters, particles). But it's way better than what you can usually see in todays short motion animated movies.The story itself is a legend, so it's got the structure that you'd expect from a legend. A monster, a hero, both fight and then we move on.Interesting part is that they threw a little bit of subtle humor, so this movie doesn't pretend to be too serious, yet it preserves the mood usually seen in the dark ages movies.If you have the opportunity to see it in 3D, give it a try, the close shots on the characters face are worth it ;)",8.0,Anonymous,Animation

Beowulf: A Lot of Butts and Guts,"The movie version of the epic ""Beowulf"" has been released, and it's actually pretty good. For those not familiar with the plot of the ancient Old English poem, it involves the exploits of the hero Beowulf (voiced by Ray Winstone) and his fights against the demon Grendel (Crispin Glover), Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), and a dragon. The animation in the movie is fantastic. The design of the Gothic castles and snowy backgrounds looks great. The fight scenes are very intense and well-animated, especially the climactic battle with the dragon. ""Beowulf"" uses a CGI-animation style similar to ""The Polar Express"", creating lifelike character models and emotions. However, although the main characters are lavishly designed, the characters in crowds or in the background look very dull and robotic. The film's script, co-written by Neil Gaiman and Roger Avery, is very well-written, and adds depth to the rather two-dimensional story. The film gives explanations to Grendel and the dragon's attacks, and their origins. The movie touches on themes of identity, true heroism, weakness, and the price of immortality. It also adds humanity to the characters, showcasing Beowulf's arrogance and lust for power, the jealousy of the king's adviser Unferth, and Grendel's pitiable self-hatred, among others. This retelling of the legend differs from the source material in many ways, for the better and the worse. Quite a few changes have been made to the plot. Deviations from the original work include some of the dialogue, the portrayal of King Hrothgar as a drunken party animal, the amount of time that takes place before Beowulf's battle with the dragon and the relationship between Beowulf and Grendel's mother. Though these differences may bother some purists, the changes to the plot really help add to the story, sort of like ""The Lord of Rings"" movies. Overall, the film is a great adaptation of the tale of Beowulf. With a great cast, excellent animation, very cool fight scenes, and a few well-made changes to the plot, this action-packed adventure is not to be missed. A quick word of warning: ""Beowulf"" should not be rated PG-13. It barely manages to keep within this rating because it is animated, but it should be rated R for the gratuitous blood, gore, violence, and nudity. Many scenes, especially ones involving Grendel, are pretty gross, so be warned if you're squeamish.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Poor Grendel,"Robert Zemeckis has done a respectable job with his version of the oldest tale in literature, BEOWULF, the legendary story of one man who would rid kingdoms all over of the most heinous and foreboding evil. I truly wish however that his telling would have remained accurate, and not been produced as a Hollywood spectacle. But with all that aside, BEOWULF was no slouch.The story is simple: a giant monster attacks King Hrothgar's hall, killing nearly all his men, and Beowulf and his rugged brutes come to his aid. One or two subplots are noticeable, but they really don't matter since the story never firmly holds true to its source. There are huge monsters and huge cleavage abound, and truly this is what makes Beowulf memorable, though the needless cleavage and sexually driven female characters take away from the film's stoic nature.If I was to see this film again, it would be for a couple reasons, and no, not to see Angelina Jolie covered in gold again(which was pretty nice to look at), but rather for the incredible finale with a towering golden dragon, one of the best in the history of cinema, and the stirring, incredible and emotional performance of Crispin Glover as Grendel.Grendel's pain and inability to live in a world that wouldn't see him otherwise was the best attribute of the film, and I found myself stricken as the poor beast was brutally cast down. The voice Glover lends is filled with so much realism and heart, that the anti-hero that Grendel soon becomes is hopelessly taken away far too early. Aside from the dragon, Robert Zemeckis hit Grendel's pitiable nature perfectly.Andy Serkis has done a lot for voice/motion actors, and Glover has successfully carried the torch. I can only wonder how such inspired acting can go unnoticed by the film community.BEOWULF as a film is very entertaining with some immense action, but as far as gore and nudity, there are hardly any. Some bare butts, some pus and blood, a good amount of brutality, Jolie could be nude, but are breasts truly breasts without nipples?Definitely worth seeing for the action and Glover's fine performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
A Very Brief Review of a Very Bad Movie,"If you are familiar with the TV series, Hogan's Heroes, you know that while the show is set during World War II, it in no way corresponds with the actual war: WWII is merely the ""background"", if you will, of a ludicrous comedic romp.Beowulf is the early mediaeval version of Hogan's Heroes. Apart from the setting and the general plot outline, it has nothing in common with the poem, the age in which the poem is set, or the culture that is depicted in the poem and depicted very badly in the movie.Unfortunately, Beowulf is not a comedy, since this attempt to make a Beowulf movie is merely laughable, rather than deliberately funny. At least with Hogan's Heroes, you knew it was meant for laughs. With Beowulf, one just laughs at it, rather than being entertained by it.In a word: ugghh.",2.0,Anonymous,Animation

A noble -- but unsuccessful -- endeavor.,"This should have been a great movie, a movie on a par with Ray Harryhausen's ""The 7th Voyage of Sinbad"" and ""Jason and the Argonauts"".Unfortunately it was a costly endeavor that only succeeded in proving that an all-CGI movie intended to look like reality can't be produced yet.-- Or maybe the people who made ""Beowulf"" just didn't have what it takes. Tough to say.The main problem with this movie (in addition to several lesser problems) is that it isn't realistic enough to convince the audience that it is not CGI, and it isn't stylized enough to make the audience glad it isn't just plain old reality.Add to this the fact that the story is often dull (and it's never really great) and you've got a disappointing movie.

We have VFX from an older generation and the stories do not attract us very directly.The action scenes were good.

This movie also has Anthony Hopkins and John Malkovich. very good story and this film flowed well. I didn't really get bored.

The animation is beautiful and the acting good, but otherwise it doesn't even follow the original writer's plot line! The live-action version with Christopher Lambert is actually better.

"+5, but -5","I had previously read the book in my English class. So I was already familiar with the title and the story line. It really irritates me when a movie doesn't follow the book. However, this was originally an oral tale passed down through the generations. During that time the story most likely had been altered. So this time it was interesting how everything turned out. I was impressed with the animation. At some parts you couldn't even tell it was animation. This is why I gave it five stars.However, this is where I subtracted five stars. I thought it would be cool to see it in 3D, but the 3D effects were not very good. The stuff that was supposed to ""pop out"" at you didn't seem to at all. The snow falling was about the only thing that the 3D worked. The other thing, There was a lot of nudity for it to be a PG-13 movie. About half of the movie, there is images of naked men. Even though it only showed the backside, I thought the movie would have been a lot better without the nudity; It was completely unnecessary. There were sexual references but no sexual content. The nudity was not sexual at all.There was a comment to the Christian religion that I particularly didn't care for. If people of other religions get angry about Christians ridiculing their beliefs (not that I ridicule other people), then they have no right to do it back to us. It makes both sides look bad. But that's just my take on the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
Modernize the myth,"It seems to me that movies that tell ancient stories are in general taking on a more modern approach to telling them. Some may think that may devalue the original story, however it's up to us to decide how much such stories are changed before they are written down in the first place. My point being that stories are changed through out the ages to better fit the societies they are told in. To appreciate the story in its ""original"" form or should I say, the form it was originally written in, you should no doubt read it and get a glimpse of the kind of myth that compelled people of that time and place.I always try to view stories like this for their metaphorical meaning and the value of what's being told. In this version of the story the hero has to battle with and finally overcome what I would call his own demons in order to ""be set free."" The end I believe is a symbolic representation of the temptation that looms in the background of all our lives. This is why this movie stands out for me. It is a classic representation of the trials and tribulations that we all have to face. Even if it does not follow the original, it is still a good story.",8.0,Anonymous,Animation
Old English Poem Turned Into Full-On CGI Feature,"Ray Winstone is turned into a semigod here, who would have believed that? Well, BEOWULF makes you believe. This is the adventure of Beowulf, a hero warrior that arrives to help King Hrothgar whose under attack from a hideous demon. This is a huge step forward for CGI-animated movies, as its ambitious scale helps the depth of this vision come through, there aren't any look-at-me-compositions here, only subtle choreography. The intimacy of the story is largely confined to three locations, and the plot revolves around terror-from-the-mountains, but all eyes are on Beowulf, as supposed to. And director Robert Zemeckis allows the third act of the movie to grow, giving it a true heart and soul, as we see Beowulf as the King of the Land he once came to save from monster Grendel's merciless attacks. Now, he ain't the man he was, he's filled with poignancy as he realizes what it really takes to be a true hero. BEOWULF is entertaining throughout, and it's off course candy for the eyes - still, at times its rather po-faced and too much for its own good.

A very boring film,"It has battles, but no action, - just MOVEMENT.The lines are not dialogue, just WORDS spoken.There are no characters, but carton figures.Very rarely I wish the movie would end faster. Usually, almost every time I don't want the movie end, ever, but this one made me doubt my bigger-than-life passion for cinema.Like Tarantino says there are films and movies, and films are for those who don't watch movies. Well, I base my definition on that, but in my interpretation it's ""a film is a boring movie"", so Beowulf is DEFINITELY a FILM.Nice director, cool writer, big studio budget - one could expect more.",5.0,Anonymous,Animation
