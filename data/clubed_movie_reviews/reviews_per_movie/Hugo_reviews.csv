An ode to Cinema,"Since its release, I've been confused why Martin Scorsese made this film. I knew very little about it of course, only that it was an adventure movie about an orphan boy living in the walls of a Paris train station. It certainly doesn't sound very Scorsese-like.However that is merely the framing for what is an ode to the earliest days of cinema, and in particular one of its true pioneers, Georges Melies. With references to ""Arrival of a Train"" – one of the world's first films by the Lumiere brothers, Melies's ""A Trip to the Moon"" and many others, this really is a treat for movie fans. Yes on a very basic level it is a children's movie, but really there's far more here for adults. Scorsese wonderfully juxtaposes his most technologically advanced film yet to demonstrate the genius and inventiveness of cinema in its earliest days.There are fine performances from the two children, as well as Ben Kingsley as Melies and Sasha Baron Cohen as a determined and love struck station inspector. I actually thought that Helen McCrory stole the show as Melies' wife Mama Jeanne.I never got to see Hugo in 3D, but the blu ray version looks truly sumptuous, with some breath taking imagery of early 20th century Paris. The film does tailor off significantly towards the end, with Scorsese seemingly unsure of what to do with the final act once the children had solved their mystery. What comes before is truly magical though and this film gets a big thumbs up from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable and visually beautiful,"I watched this movie without any expectations and with an open mind. I thought it started off kind of slow but once you realise what the story is about, you really enjoy it. Having been a film student, I particularly liked where the story was going. I watched a great number of Georges Méliès movies during my studies.Hugo has great cinematography and I loved the themes of insecurity and doubt and the idea that creative people sometimes need a push in the back from someone else in order to realise what they're worth. Hugo is a very original story, although it does not always feel very coherent. I remember being left with a feeling that some questions were left unanswered and some details didn't quite add up if you really thought about them.Hugo had a Frenglish steam-punk feel to it that generally doesn't really appeal to me but that often surprises me in a good way (a bit like the professor Layton games). I would certainly recommend this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A simply glorious ode to early cinema,"It has taken me a long time to get round to watching Hugo, but I am so glad that I did. This is a wonderful and simply glorious ode to early cinema told through the eyes of Hugo (Asa Butterfield), an orphan who after the death of his clockmaker father (Jude Law) ends up living in the walls of a Parisian train station charged with winding the station's numerous clocks.Hugo's only link back to his late father is through a majestic mechanical automaton, a sort of tin man which his father had been restoring in his spare time. As appears to be the way with all tin men this one is also missing a heart, but this time it is a heart shaped key which Hugo is convinced if he can find will unlock the secrets inside. This leads young Hugo on a dangerous but adventurous search which often lands him in the clutches of either the local shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley) or the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). Help is at hand though from the shopkeeper's god daughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) and as the two join forces they soon discover they have more in common than they thought.In Hugo, Scorsese has produced a truly magical tale which sucks the viewer into the screen via the innovative use of 3D so immersing us within the dynamics of Parisian life and the wonders that take place within the walls of the station. Butterfield is perfectly cast as young Hugo, a curious young boy determined to survive in a hard and cold world which constantly seems to deal him a bad hand; you simply can't help but love him. Moretz after a slightly shaky start soon finds her feet (and her accent), Kingsley is excellent, especially as the story develops and there is strength in depth from a top notch supporting cast including Emily Mortimer, Ray Winstone and Christopher Lee to name but a few.Hugo's strength however is in its story, which effortlessly unfolds in front of you with real grace and elegance. Scorsese's love for the history of his craft and his desire to share this tale of early cinema is evident in every frame. Whilst it may not be the most historically accurate portrayal of cinematic history it has a true and good heart which beautifully captures the essence of what is cinema.Some people have criticised Scorsese for creating a children's movie that is inaccessible for most children. I strongly disagree on this point. To me Hugo is a classic children's movie which works across all age spectrums, much in a similar vain to Spielberg's ET. In a world of Woody, Buzz, Jessie and meatballs that fall from the sky (which don't get me wrong are all fabulous in their own right), it is refreshing to see a children's movie of old. It feels like a magical Christmas movie to me, perfectly accessible and enjoyed by all.Hugo is fully deserving of the many accolades that it picked up during the awards season. It is a wonderful and engaging film which I will show my children when they are a little older and I am certain they will fall in love with cinema in the same way their father need did so many years ago.Review by Will Malone www.maloneonmovies.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Martin Scorsese's Love Letter to Cinema,"Martin Scorsese's HUGO is a family movie that will probably only cater to a niche crowd: people who appreciate movies as art (e.g. cinema snobs, though I use the term endearingly). I'm not saying it won't appeal to the general masses. It's still an interesting story, wonderfully acted, and packed with talent both in front of and behind the camera. But let's face it: this isn't your average movie, it's a love letter. Scorsese has been a vocal supporter of restoring old movies in hopes they'll be saved from oblivion (rightfully so) and this movie, based on a children's book by Brian Selznick, is his method of beautifully pleading his case before millions of people who've probably refuse to watch black and white movies on the basis that they're, you know, black and white (yes, I know those sorts of people). HUGO is a film meant to bring out attention to the movies long-forgotten and remind us of the magic behind them, told through the adventure of a young boy named Hugo Cabret. Hugo is an orphan whose father died in a museum fire, and he lives behind the walls of a Parisian train station. When he's not busy with his job of keeping the station clocks ticking, Hugo spends his time repairing an old automaton his father rescued from museum storage. An encounter with a curmudgeonly toy store owner and his granddaughter Isabelle will send Hugo on a journey to repair the automaton and discover its long-hidden secrets.As I mentioned, this movie will only really appeal to certain people. Scorsese fans might be put off by the fact that this film is a family-friendly adventure; it doesn't exactly fall in line with Scorsese's usual subject matter. The family crowds will probably enjoy it, but younger children will likely be put off by it's slow pacing and lack of excitement. It's not so much an adventure as a journey of discovery, and little kids might not find themselves too involved in the story. My own daughter (4, going on 5) gave it an honest try when we sat down to watch it and made it 40 minutes or so before she fell asleep. Unfortunately, HUGO will probably be one of those films that fades into the background (if it hasn't already) and find most of it's loving coming from the film school crowds. The movie incorporates a loose interpretation of the life of Georges Méliès, a stage magician and an early innovator in world of cinema who realized the potential for the new medium of storytelling. At a time when most ""movies"" were just real-world situations recorded to celluloid (such as the famous train pulling into the station), Méliès created fantastic stories and mythical tales to entertain, filling his films with special effects and dramatic costuming. The movie focuses on the fact that so many of Méliès' films were lost over time and the tragedy of these classics from one of the earliest, most important filmmakers, ceasing to exist.Scorsese makes his message perfectly clear in the final half of the movie, which happened to be my favorite part of the film. Ben Kingsley is Papa Georges (Méliès) and, in the film, he is a defeated man who mourns the death of his legacy following World War I. Kingsley is perfect here and the highlight of the movie. The children in the film, Asa Butterfield and Chloë Moretz, do a serviceable job but, as is usually the case with younger actors, their performances come off as forced and wooden most times. Even Moretz, who's performances I freakin' loved in KICK-ASS, doesn't feel real here. Maybe it's just that Scorsese isn't accustomed to working with younger talent and wasn't able to bring out the best in them, but it's a shame because the two of them are the key players in the movie. There's a handful of other minor roles filling out the film with talent: Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, etc. My favorite would probably be Sascha Baron Cohen (yes, Borat) as the station inspector. With his Doberman patrolling by his side and the frame providing support for his bum leg, he was almost cartoonish. I loved him, and he was more than capable of toning down his usual eccentricity. HUGO is a movie with a lot to love, even more if you're a cinema snob. I really enjoyed it, but a slow first act and weak performances from the kids mean it's far from perfect. HUGO has my full recommendation for anyone who might want a glimpse into world of a true film-lover.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonder for Any Cinema Lover,"In the late 20's, in Paris, the orphan Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a lonely boy that lives hidden from the cruel Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) behind the walls of the train station, keeping the clocks working. He survives stealing breads, milk and other nourishment from the station stores. Hugo's father (Jude Law) was a watchmaker that had taught Hugo how to fix clocks and gadgets and died in a fire in his workshop. Then his alcoholic Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), who is the responsible for keeping the station clocks working but vanished months ago, brings Hugo to work with him.Hugo is trying to fix an automaton, the only memorabilia he has from his father, stealing parts from the bitter and cranky owner of a toy store, Papa George (Ben Kingsley). However it is missing a heart-shaped key to make it work. Hugo believes that the robot possesses a last message from his father. When George holds Hugo, he takes a notebook from the boy with the notes that he is using to repair the automaton.Hugo follows George and meets his granddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), who is raised by her grandparents after the death of her parents. Isabelle befriends Hugo seeking to live the adventure of her life. When Hugo sees that the girl has the key that he needs, he brings her to his hideout and the automaton works and draws a poster from 1902 George Méliès' film ""Le voyage dans la lune"". Hugo and Isabelle continue to research about the filmmaker and they find a hidden secret about George Méliès.""Hugo"" is a wonder for any cinema lover, with a great tribute to George Méliès. Martin Scorcese delivers his best film after many years, with a wonderful story of a boy that fixes machinery and ends fixing the heart of an old man.It is unbelievable that users without any cinema culture give low rating to a film that is a great homage to the silent movies, with many references along the story. The boy Asa Butterfield, from ""The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"", gives another excellent performance and the girl Chloë Grace Moretz, who has a lovely smile, shows a fantastic chemistry with Asa Butterfield.It is intriguing that at least three movies nominated to the Oscar 2012 have points in common: ""The Artist"" is a film about the transition from the silent movie to the spoken films; ""Hugo"" is set in Paris in the late 20's and has references to actors, actresses and directors of the silent movies; and ""Midnight in Paris"" is also set in Paris in the 20's. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Invenção de Hugo Cabret"" (""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"")",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
HUGO was like watching a dream.,"""If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from, just look around. This is where they're made.""Hugo Cabret's story was told so well that it felt like you were right there with him on his stunning adventure.For those unfamiliar, this is the story about a young boy named Hugo. He lives inside the walls of a train station in Paris in the 1930's. His father dies, leaving behind a mysterious automaton that, when fixed, can write. Hugo makes it his mission to fix it, believing that it will reveal a message from his father. With the help of an eccentric girl named Isabelle, he tries to uncover a magical mystery about the old man at the toy booth (Isabelle's godfather) and enchanting early films.I had been looking forward to this film for a very long time, and I was not disappointed at all. I was a bit unsure about the 3D at first, but it turned out to be superb. Every single object became part of the story, and the audience became immersed in this beautiful world created by Martin Scorsese and Brian Selznick. While every member of the cast was brilliant, there are two in particular I'd like to point out.First, Asa Butterfield as Hugo. He carried the film with perfection and gave a truly incredible performance. His acting was very natural--you could hardly tell he was acting! He did an amazing job of bringing life to a complex, lost, sad character. Asa is one of the most talented young actors I've ever seen; a very likely Oscar nomination in his future.Last (but certainly not least) is Chloe Grace Moretz. She is another young performer that never fails to amaze me. Chloe nailed the British accent and brilliantly portrayed a bright, energetic Isabelle.This movie has it all: beautiful visuals, super-talented cast, magic, love, heart, feeling, emotion. Best Picture Nomination for sure, and quite possibly others. Overall, this movie is a must-see. It was the most enjoyable theater experience that I've ever had. The entire theater broke into applause once it ended. This film has something for all ages, and it's really something special.Especially if you love adventure, mystery, wonder, and have a bright imagination, you will fall in love with this film just like I did.""Come and dream with me.""",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, accomplished and fun","There must be something unifying in our globes collective consciousness, as 2011 saw two films that looked back at the cinematic past. Strangely, it took a French film maker, Michel Hazanavicius, to release a movie that pays homage to early, silent American cinema (The Artist). Conversely, Martin Scorsese, a well-known cinephile, delights with his love of early European silent cinema, in his often beautiful 'children's' film, Hugo.Set in 1930's Paris, the main focus of this cinematic love is the work of the first movie magician, Georges Melies. We are introduced to Hugo (Asa Butterfield), a young man whose father left him a automaton after his death. It was a project that they worked on together, but never finished it. Hugo's main mission is to get the object working. As an orphan, Hugo hides in the rafters of a train station, maintaining the clocks that his drunken uncle used to do. After befriending a young girl, Isabelle (Chloe Moretz), he finally gets the automaton working, and it opens up a mystery that leads to the forgotten cinema of Melies (Ben Kingsley), now working on a store in the station.The film shows love for silent cinema, and particularly the magic of Melies. Sacha Baron Cohen's station inspector is occasionally funny, and his character seems to be filtered through both Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouseau, and Jacques Tati's Monsieur Hulot, but he just doesn't seem to really progress at all, and feels almost like a filler character. Scorsese, like Robert Zemekis and Bob Gale before, reference that iconic Harold Lloyd moment in Safety Last! (1923), as Hugo hangs from a clock face.Like so many others who speculate about the choices of Oscar nominations, Hugo, I feel, is not a contender for the best picture Oscar. There were some far better films produced in 2011. That said, the film is beautiful, accomplished , and often fun. Also, the resurgence of interest in a forgotten father of cinema, is completely touching, and leaves a warm feeling in the heart. Unfortunately, I did not see this in 3D; as far as I am aware, Scorsese uses it to brilliant degrees, so perhaps this would have made the experience perfect (despite the fact that I care not for the dimensions of 3.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Treat For Movie Buffs,"Like many, I suspect, I went into this film ready to be dazzled by the cinematography and a rare, nice clean story by Director Martin Scorcese. I wasn't disappointed although I found the story lagging in a few brief spots. Cutting the film another 10 minutes might have solved that. Having said that, though, a month later I'm all ready to view it again!To me, the most interesting and amazing scenes were not involving the two young main characters and the railroad station, but the ones in the last 30-or-so minutes which dealt with very early films and how they made them. It was incredibly colorful and an education to film buffs everywhere. Anyone who loves movies and appreciates the history of the art should love the last part of this story.Meanwhile, the bulk of the story still offers many great sights and sounds and I have no quibbles with any of the actors. Youngsters Asa Butterfield (""Hugo"") and Cholë Grace Moretz (""Isabelle"") were both about 13 when they made this and seem to have good careers ahead of them. I didn't recognize Sacha Baron Cohen as the station inspector. He was great in that role. As for Ben Kingsley, when is he ever bland?This is one of those ""family films"" that can be enjoyed just as much - and probably more - by adults. I wish Scorcese would make more of this kind of material.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
3D extravaganza,"Was it just me or did the 3D budget get spent on the opening sequences? The first 5 or 10 minutes had me smiling and dodging, almost had to swish my hands in front of my face just in case but as the story grew into place I don't really remember things popping out anymore. It was a fun story none the less, and informative too for any fan of the visual arts. Travel back to a visual experience only glimpsed today in the older architectures of Paris. Then travel back again as the characters explore a mystery with clues tied to a previous era of art and invention. All in all a fun story to watch if you are in the mood for something light iced with a 3D visual flourish.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful film for cinema fans,"Someone compared this movie to a Hans Christian Andersen tale and I think this is about as good a comparison as it gets. Some people find it boring and painful, others are mesmerized and inspired by the story it tells and the way it does so. In short, if you prefer Disney's version of the little mermaid story, you will likely be disappointed by Hugo.On the other hand, if you like the attention to detail and the not entirely happy endings of Andersen's classic short stories, you will probably find that Hugo is a captivating film that is hard to describe in a few words. It really lives in a lot more than three dimensions.If you also happen to be a cinema fan, you will love it even more. What is a cinema fan? It's person that appreciates films for more than just their entertainment value. The way movies are made, the different layers of audio, visuals, emotions, symbols, the photography, the standout supporting casts, the way you can predict the cliché moves sometimes, but love it anyway. We love the good movies, like the bad ones, and films like Hugo make our hearts sing.One last note on the use of 3D. I usually avoid 3D versions of movies because that feature has not yet proved itself to be more than just a gimmick. In Hugo's case, it is still partially true. I watched it in 3D and the opening sequence in the train station as well as a couple other select shots were exceptionally staged for 3D. Aside from that though, you get used to the effect and thankfully, it's the story that stays in the center of attention, followed by beautiful cinematography, characters, and 3D is trailing humbly behind. If you have the opportunity, watch the 3D version, but you will not really love it in 2D any less.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Pleasant, but unfortunately too modest and lacking ambition","Tackling 3D for the first time, I think Scorsese has hit the ball out of the park with Hugo, his film was gorgeous. Unfortunately he forgot to give us a compelling story.Hugo is a noble film, but it is never quite sure what kind of film it wants to be. It is a little too mature to be a kids movie, yet it's too cartoonish to be an adult movie. One minute, it is played as a fantasy in the kind of world where the moon is bigger than the Eiffel Tower, and the next minute the film is played realistically; a serious biography of one of cinema's pioneers. Indeed Hugo's best quality after it's look, is its educational factor. How Ironic it is to be watching bits of hundred year old George Melies films on a cinematic format that was almost invented yesterday. The photography was diverse and spectacular, the characters were charming and quirky, but in the end, the movie just wasn't compelling enough.I went in expecting to laugh and cry in all the right places, and I didn't. I guess that's more Spielberg's terrain; Scorsese is much colder than that of course. Hugo is pleasant, but it's not a great movie",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stunning.  The best 3D to date,"Saw it today in a sneak preview today at the Director's Guild in LA. James Cameron who was there professed it's a masterpiece and the best 3D to date. And he's right on both fronts. The film is exquisitely crafted. The cinematography and set design is likely going to take home a couple gold guys. It's a film lover's dream movie. As with many of Scorsese's films, it's an inspired film history lesson along side of being a dreamlike children's fable. A really unique combination that will work for the film enthusiasts and discerning family's with kids. Maybe a bit long for broad audiences with very little kids, but the images are so enchanting, it should win over most everybody. Sasha Baron Cohen is a brilliant and hilarious standout as the twitchy constable. It should be very well received just on the 3D alone.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Long Live Scorsese,"A film adventure in every sense of the word. I was propelled into Martin Scorsese's cinematic mind in a film he made for his 12 year old daughter. Everything about it speaks of love of cinema. I wept, I must confess it right here and now. I really wept. Not just for the humanity of the story but by the heart and mind of the man behind the camera. This is the same man who gave us ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"", ""Goodfellas"" Every detail enriches our experience. Dante Ferreti's production design is, monumental, costumes, photography and Howard Shore's score are, quite simply, breath taking. I'm running out of superlatives and I haven't yet mentioned Sacha Baron Cohen, priceless. There is moment in which our young protagonists sneak into a movie theater and sit in amazement watching Harold Lloyd hanging from the clock. For me, to see Lloyd in the big screen as part of Martin Scorsese's latest dream, is the highest and most moving point of my movie going year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Cinematic Wonder,"Martin Scorcese's new film, Hugo is one of the best cinematic experience, I've had in years. The 3D is just simply astounding and the best I have ever seen in a movie. The visual effects, cinematography, art direction, just technically superb. Finally a smart, awe-aspiring family film, which are really rare nowadays. A definite surprise coming from legendary director, Martin Scorcese, who's known for movies with a lot of swears, violence, drugs and other adult-themed subjects.The acting was really good and completely convincing. Asa Butterfield delivers a very committed performance as Hugo Cabret, and he shows a lot of promise in his future career. Chloë Grace Moretz, also gives a fine and respectable performance. Sacha Baron Cohen is surprisingly very effective as Station Inspector. Ben Kingsley gives the best performance in the whole movie, he is just superb and deserves some recognition. Overall, the whole cast was top notch.Eyes may be the window to the soul, but movies are the projection of our dreams, according to ""Hugo"" that is. Martin Scorsese's first attempt at a children's film might be over most of their adolescent heads, but this founding member of the ""Movie Brats"" might've just concocted a delectable cinematic treat that speaks to most film lovers' surrealist commitment to the big screen. In retrospect, it works, and this enchanting flick is one of the best of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Heartwarming Film for All,"It is clearly evident in Hugo that Martin Scorsese has made this to be a very personal film in its design. No effort was spared in visual effects, production design, or cinematography. The visual effects are exciting and awe-inspiring, especially for those dazzled by color and intricacy (read: children). The production design is incredibly immersive, inviting us into an incredible new world. The cinematography is very good as well, capturing all the actors' emotions with pristine clarity. The film itself is very warm and heart-warming all around, making it very inviting and easy on the eyes.The visual dazzle of Hugo draws the viewer into a heart-warming story about an orphaned boy searching for his father and a retired filmmaker searching for his former passion. The crossing of their paths will change both of their lives forever. This story is well-conveyed by Asa Butterfield and Ben Kingsley, as the chemistry between the two only adds to the impact on the viewer's emotions. The supporting cast is just as good, adding dimension and liveliness to the movie.The only criticism I have of Hugo is its length. It feels like a very long film even though it is only 125 minutes. This dragging feeling has a chance of alienating most of its potential audience: families. However, Hugo is a film that even the most stingy of critics will like due to its emotional journey and warm, inviting character that allows all to enjoy it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful!!,"I just returned home after seeing Hugo on opening day and if I can describe this film in one word, it would be beautiful. This film has inspired me in ways that I can't even begin to explain. It's been a while since I've seen a film that spoke to me as personally as this film did. I'm a fan of Martin Scorsese and he's crafted a beautiful ode to not only cinema but also imagination and in a way, it celebrates all the things that help us escape. The world is a scary place and everyone goes through pain and suffering but if you just try and learn to dream, find your voice and not be afraid then you would be surprised what could happen.I love how this film tells the amazing story of pioneer filmmaker Georges Melies who many of today's directors such as Steven Spielberg and James Cameron owe everything to. I love his films and I own a box set of his work, it's wonderful to see more people be introduced to him and the magic he created that continues to capture the imagination of many.So if you love the cinema and magic then I highly recommend this masterpiece. Hugo is really something special I think.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Martin Scorse's not quite so but almost magical tribute to Georges Melies and early cinema,"'Hugo' may not be among Martin Scorsese's best, but only because films like 'Goodfellas', 'Raging Bull' and 'Taxi Driver', to name a few, are so good and among the best films ever made. Even when Scorsese was not at his best, he was still vastly superior to a lot of directors at their worst.There is a huge amount to like about 'Hugo', but it is also easy to see why it won't be the cup of tea of some people. For me it was an uneven film, that had many moments where it achieved what it set out to do and others where it didn't, and it is this unevenness that to me that makes 'Hugo' so polarising, loved by some but despised by others.Starting with the numerous positives, the production values are just exquisite. While my vote for the Best Cinematography Oscar that year would have gone to 'The Tree of Life', 'Hugo's' cinematography is still some of the most beautiful of the year making it one of the year's visually striking films. The set and costume design are both clever and a feast for the eyes, likewise with the 3D effects (some of the best 3D effects personally ever seen in a film, and actually propel the film rather than distracting from), and the lighting also does nothing to hinder that.Music is haunting, emotive and whimsical in equal measures, and Scorsese shows here how talented a director he is. It is clear that the project meant a lot to him and that he had a lot of love and passion for paying tribute to Melies and early cinema. One also has to give him credit for do something different from the norm, the three big ones being the film being adapted from a children's book (a first for Scorsese), his first use of 3D and having a family that isn't the Mafia.Along with the visuals, what is also note-worthy is the last thirty minutes. Whatever quibbles can be had with the rest of the film, this part of the film is very nostalgic, thought-provoking and extremely heartfelt. The script doesn't always work but has a lot of philosophical and historical insight, is emotive and does provoke thought in places. There are some good performances in the cast. Asa Butterfield is understated but never cold or a blank in a role that is not as easy as some think, and Chloe Grace Moretz is bright, energetic and charming. Christopher Lee's screen time is limited but it was still a pleasure to see him, a great example of an actor who can do no wrong. Best of all is a superb in every way Ben Kingsley, one of the most experienced and mostly consistent actors who can be relied on to give his all and he does here.Granted, 'Hugo' is not without its problems. The film is perhaps too long and the pace definitely could have been tightened with a little trimming. That way, some of the storytelling's pacing wouldn't have felt as erratic with the first twenty minutes jumping around to rushed and sprawling effect and while mostly attention-grabbing parts in the middle drag and meander story-wise.Also could have done without the subplot with Sacha Baron Cohen. That took up too much of the story, and saw some laboured and forced humour (mostly the humour doesn't work) and Baron Cohen overacting so wildly he comes over as more silly and annoying rather than funny and a threat. It may have been an attempt to bridge any gaps but to me it just felt out of place, self-indulgent and jarred too much with everything else. There are numerous cameos from talented actors, but most of them have barely anything to do, so much so you forget that they were even in the film (Jude Law being a prime example).Concluding this review, less than completely magical but almost. A lot is done right but the film also could have been done better. Not a great film but there was a lot to like and still ended up appreciating it. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Valentine To All Movie Lovers,"Without spoiling, consider a motion picture whose last 30 minutes are equal to the last 4 minutes of Cinema Paradiso.

Some Thoughts...,"This is a tough one to break down. The movie was brilliantly shot, but I must say that it seemed to fail at ever fully creating the majestic mood it was going for. The pacing made it very tough to become completely engaged in the first half of the movie. The second portion did take it up a notch and add something to the film.It mainly felt like he made this film as an excuse to tell the origins of film, or at least through one persons life.

"Brilliance, wonder, magic, heart, a bit of everything.","So I saw this film today, and I was blown away. I'll admit that the trailer didn't impress me much, and if you do come out of it thinking that Hugo is just for kids, it's not. It's so much more than that. I had heard of Martin Scorsese directing a 3-D picture, but I didn't realize it was this very adaptation. The book was a wonderful experience (go read it - the pictures within are like a film by itself!), and I can't believe I didn't think the 3-D medium would work for it.Absolutely brilliant. From the very first scene, you get a sense of how Scorsese is able to tap into the charm of 3-D - the essence of it - which is so easily lost amidst the abundance of films that get slapped with the 3-D label, but in a less cash-greedy industry need not warrant the extra surcharge. Scorsese takes his time to immerse the audience in Paris, in the train station, in Hugo's everyday surroundings that may seem almost ordinary to him by this point but for us, it's a whole different world. At times I forgot I was watching a live-action film because some of it was just so vibrant (yes, even with the automatic dimming of your 3-D glasses).The cast was wonderful - Asa Butterfield as the main lead, has got such expressive eyes that you feel the hurt when he thinks of his father (played by Jude Law), which is very often. Chloe Moretz partners him very well as a fellow adventurer, and of course, you've also got: Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Helen McCrory, etc. to round out the characters.It's such a fantastical but genuine story that you can't help but fall in love with it, I think. Scorsese has brought a boy's dream to life but also written a love letter to film-making. I won't spoil anything outside of the trailer for fear of diminishing the magic, but I needed to write a somewhat coherent review to get my thoughts down, and hopefully persuade more people to watch the film! There's heart, there's magic, there's wonder, there's enjoyment, there's a little bit of everything for everyone to love in this. Some parts had me misty-eyed with the wonderful score and the ode to the joy of film.And I know the mandatory 3-D will deter people but this film is one of those rare ones (and at the moment the only film so far this year that I can think of) that extols the virtue of 3-D. I WEAR GLASSES SO I HAVE TO PUT 3-D GLASSES OVER MY OWN PAIR AND I WASN'T ANNOYED AT ALL - IT WAS WELL WORTH IT. So I'm speaking for that crowd right now. I know there are plenty of us out there! The genius of Scorsese strikes here, so pop in and have an adventure. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese's first movie for kids is a Masterpiece,"I attended the DGA screening over the weekend, followed by a Q&A moderated by James Cameron. Cameron's first words (after correctly referring to Scorsese as ""maestro""), were ""I thought we'd just geek out over 3D for a half hour, but having seen the movie... it's a masterpiece."" I brought my ten year old daughter, who sat -- if anything -- even more transfixed than I did. Every single image is arresting, the use of 3D is perfection itself, the story is engaging and thrilling and heartbreaking and uplifting and I never wanted it to end. If only it'd be three hours! All the performances are excellent, including the kids. Great British actors appear in roles with only a line or two, but it helps lift the movie into the realm of Instant Classic, and Sacha Baron Cohen brings nuance and heart to his humorous role as the Station Inspector. On the way to the car my daughter asked if we could get the blu-ray when it's available, and I had the same feeling as well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The D in 3D stands for dimensions,"What Martin Scorcese has managed to do is add story dimensionality to a family film that has 3D technology. Some of the dimensions he's included which don't always make into Hollywood blockbusters are an imaginative and original concept, thematic unity and resonance and deft homage to film itself, in the story of Georges Méliès, French film pioneer.Saw the film in an advance screening and we were among the many there who were obviously not standard family film consumers. This being a Scorcese film is likely to bring lots of adults to Hugo and I would think many of them, like me, will feel the film stands up as entertainment for all age groups.I especially enjoyed the resonance and intricacy of the theme of clocks, clockworks, animatronics and ""the ghost in the machine""--our fear, in the post industrial age that perhaps we are just a rather complex machine, rather than a divine creation. This is all beautifully rendered cinematically. I doubt the little ones will be bewildered while older viewers can pick out levels and layers in the film.Good fun and visually interesting throughout. The 3D is used in service of the story. I hope Hollywood is watching and notices that special effects are only special when they get the heart of the machine working, like Hugo's little man.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good for the kids, not so much for adults who've seen the classics","This film gets a lot of praise, and while it is well done and surely entertaining for the younger audiences, anyone who has seen a fair number of films besides the usual latest pop stuff at the theaters will recognize that every single thing about the film is taken from earlier movies.

Why Hugo gets my vote for Best Picture,"I'm a latecomer to Hugo. I only took it in a few days ago, in February of 2012. I'd seen a trailer for it last year. My recollection of that: ""Well this looks sorta fun.. another kid's story they hope will also appeal to adults. Probably another Disney/Pixar type thing, but with live actors plus 3D this time. I enjoyed Cars, Toys, Inc., etc. I'll take it in if I find time.""Then last week a buddy said, ""We should see this movie Hugo. It's getting all kinds of nominations."" I needed a push to drive somewhere to see a kid's movie just then, but ultimately we met up for a (cheaper) Saturday matinée. With no great expectations, I kindly lowered my 3D shades when told to. It took me awhile to figure out where they were going with these frankly stunning, snowy, fairytale-like shots skimming over 1920-something Paris. The camera eventually led us into a gigantic and bustling central station, romantically old-fashioned to our eye, yet golden and sparklingly with-it in this, its glory day. Fashionable Parisians were scurrying around shops and boarding steam-billowing trains. We're following a wide-eyed, clever but sad boy, Hugo, played by a quick, intuitive young actor, perhaps akin to Daniel Radcliffe as we first met him as Harry Potter. By no means his twin, but with the same, or perhaps even more striking innate sense of confidence on a movie set. We watch as his loving father dies and leaves the boy an orphan to fend for himself as a thieving stowaway in this brick monument to technology. His watchmaker father has left him an old and forgotten museum piece to finish piecing back together. It's a 90% scale mechanical man made of tin, cams and gears. From the kind but very curious expression on its face, it's clear that this over-sized wind-up once must have performed some miraculous feat, but what? I'll leave you with that as far as storyline goes.Just prepare yourself for the least expected.Although Hugo is in part about a young boy's struggle to solve a riddle, what he discovers is far beyond mere kid's stuff. It's a shockingly beautiful lesson on so much you likely don't know about man's sheer delight in –and need for– unfettered imagination, creativity and our ingenuity and tenacity to make magic become reality. On one level, children can love it, but quite honestly, the truly magnificent depth of field you'll grasp and the exhilaration you'll feel having lived on earth awhile, will be lost on youth, but is shown as a gift for each of us to pass on to them.Though no filmmaker, I was born in the heart of Hollywood, so perhaps the magic of moving pictures is in my blood. Nevertheless, this cutting-edge tribute to every step mankind has achieved in cinematic art and technology, our drive and creativity to surpass that which has gone before stunned the living daylights out of me and brought streams of tears to my eyes. See Hugo immediately.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A little over hyped!,"Preliminary reviews suggested that this was a masterpiece but upon seeing the movie I found it fell short of that lofty appraisal. The story is very good but the movie runs too long and has stretches of boredom, especially when trying to develop subsidiary characters. The movie picks up every time Ben Kingsley appears but Asa Buttererfield disappoints in the lead role as I found that I was watching him act rather than being caught up in his character. Chloe Grace Moretz and Emily Mortimer are very good in their roles but Sacha Baron Cohen is over the top in a uneven performance. I am not a fan of 3D and this movie could have done without it, although I must admit there are some incredibly wondrous 3D effects but there are also a number of scenes where the 3D is a distraction.I would suggest that this is not a ""kids"" movie but one for those at least 10 and over. This is not a classic movie but still rates (in my opinion) a 7 out 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Engaging, Wonderful, Entertaining","In 50+ years of film-going this is one of the most engaging movies I've ever seen. What ought to be said about it has already been said by other reviewers, so I won't repeat. I was mostly curious as to what people who DIDN'T like it found to criticize. Glancing through their comments, the principal objection seems to be that it was ""boring"", which leads me to wonder why someone who COULD think this would have wasted their money on it in the first place?So, as a useful guide, here is a list of movies that were awarded 9 or 10 stars by reviewers who gave Hugo 1-star. If you tend to like the following films, there's a good chance you'll be wasting your time on Hugo. For anyone else, I hope you enjoy it at least half as much as I did, which will be a lot: Enter the Dragon (2006), Puss in Boots, Hunter Prey, Spartacus: Vengeance, The Crazies, Skyline, Hannibal Rising, The Mayor of Hell, etc. You get the idea.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo,"Hugo is based upon the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. The film is a period piece film, taking place in 1930's Paris, France. Fans of director Martin Scorsese may also want to note that this is his first time directing a family film and also one in 3D. The film is full of enchantment and lots to behold and wonder at, so I feel that if I was to give too much away it would spoil the film, so I suggest you look elsewhere for a plot synopsis, or even watch the film's trailer. I found a lot to like about Hugo, but there were also a few things that I had problems with as well. First the good. The film looks great. Normally, I am not a fan of films in 3D because I find that they look fake and it just feels ever so much more like you are watching a computer program, or video game and does not feel real in any way. The visual effects in Hugo are all extremely well done and they look believable and give the film a great look. Every so often a character's face may look a bit askew when trying to capture it with the 3D background, but that does not happen too often and for the most part it looks great. The whole film looks great from it's visual effects, costumes, set decorations, make up and cinematography. It's a wonderfully authentic and dazzling piece of eye candy that also looks and feels of 1930's Paris, France and has all the charm and beauty of the city as well. The acting here is all very good from everybody. The whole cast is very talented and they all do a great job in their individual roles. The adults are good and the kids do a great job here as well. The story to the film is very original and for me I was quite intrigued as to how and where the film would go and I was pleasantly surprised. It has a little bit of everything from fantasy, mystery, comedy, science fiction and is even an open love letter to a certain art form that if you see the film you will know what I mean and I think that reason alone is why film lover Martin Scorsese made the film in the first place. The film enchants with it's visuals, keeps us interested with it's adventuresome and likable characters and the different magical and mysterious things going on. The film is marketed as a family film, but I can definitely see adults appreciating the film more than children, but older children may find something here to like as well. Now on to the few things I had a problem with during the film. I thoroughly enjoyed myself during the duration of the film, but there were times when the film did feel a bit long. It's not an overly long movie at two hours and seven minutes, but there are certain scenes that do drag on a bit and after the film is over it somehow feels like the film was much longer than the running time I just provided you with, even though it is not. Also, I did like all of the characters in the film, but I felt that there were too many subplots going on during the film that took away from the main story. It's not that they were not interesting, but they didn't have all that much to do with the central theme, or message of the story and ultimately just made the film longer and this is in parts where it began to drag, so I would have to say some of the additional stories were a little unnecessary. Had they been trimmed down, or edited a bit, or maybe found a different way to incorporate them into the film it could have worked, but as it is they don't. Those are probably my only problems with the film and while I still liked it a fair bit and admired a lot about it, I can not honestly say that it is a great film, or one of the year's best. Still there is a lot here that I think movie lovers will admire and get a lot out of, so I still recommend Hugo and it is a nice feel good film, especially appropriate now in time for the holidays, so I would still recommend it, but for me it had enough flaws to prevent it from being a masterpiece, but it is still definitely worth seeing even if you have to pay a little extra for the accompanying 3D glasses.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""If you ever wondered where your dreams come from, you look around. This is where they're made.""","Upon seeing the trailer for ""Hugo"", I wasn't overly impressed. The blaring emphasis on 3D made me worried it was more spectacle than substance. Still, it was directed by Martin Scorsese, and had Ben Kingsley in it, so I decided to put aside my fears and go see it anyway.Am I ever glad I did! This is a sweet and gentle tale, full of unexpected warmth and depth. It is the story of Hugo Cabret, an orphan and keeper of the clocks at a train station in Paris. His only connection to his deceased father is a broken-down automaton the two were repairing before his father's demise in a fire. When Hugo is caught stealing parts for the automaton by the old owner of a toy shop in the station (Kingsley), his booklet of sketches related to the curious mechanical man is taken from him. Attempting to retrieve it, he meets Isabelle, the goddaughter of the aged man. Together, they begin to unravel the mystery behind Kingsley's character and help bring his true identity to light. (It shouldn't be that much of a surprise to anyone with knowledge of early film history that has a chance to look at the cast list here on IMDb. Does the name ""Georges Méliès"" ring any bells?)Asa Butterfield does capably in the title role, and Chloe Grace Moretz shines sublimely as the precocious Isabelle. Of course, Ben Kingsley gives a terrific performance, powerful and poignant. He plays a broken man anguished by the shadows of the past.These three are the central figures of the film, yet the side characters are handled equally well. That really struck me. A lesser filmmaker might have let such characters come off as just caricatures, especially in a children's film. Scorsese doesn't allow for that to happen. Richard Griffiths', Frances de la Tour's and Christopher Lee's characters are all skillfully imbued with humanity so that the audience feels for them and seems to get to know them in spite of their short periods on screen. Even Sacha Baron Cohen's silly Station Inspector is more than a one-dimensional figure. In between his cartoonish antics and chases after Hugo, he is shown to be painfully shy, pining desperately for the affections of an attractive woman who sells flowers. We learn also that he was wounded in World War I, and that it was his days growing up without love in the strict environment of an orphanage that so embittered him towards the world. He is not merely some comic antagonist tossed in for the sake of slapstick. Instead, he is a fascinating and well-developed character in his own right. One feels compassion and pity for him, and hopes he will have the courage to speak up and win the heart of his love, that their quirky relationship will blossom into romance.In short, this is a simply lovely film. There has been some uproar and befuddlement over the director of such films as ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Goodfellas"" making a 'children's movie'. I must admit I was a little abashed myself upon first hearing it. But ""Hugo"" shows that a so-called children's movie doesn't have to be inane or infantile. This is an intelligent and wondrous work – never sappy or banal. In part a tribute to the magic of cinema, it reminded me why I love motion pictures so much. With its richness and nuance, ""Hugo"" should appeal to children and adults alike. I realize that saying sounds a little clichéd, but in this case I have faith in the truth of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For The Love of Movies,"Hugo is known as Martin Scorsese's first film that is suitable for all ages. In the trailers and movie posters, some may think it's just another Family/Adventure film. But it's more than that. Hugo is Scorsese's love letter to movies. Bringing back the classic style and showing why movies are magnificently wonderful. It's an extraordinary Scorsese film. The performances are charming and there are plenty of sweetness in them. Everything else is spectacular. Hugo is a reminder why we watch and love movies.But Hugo is not entirely about movies. The main story is about an orphan boy named Hugo Cabret who manages the train station's clocks and steals machine parts to fix his father's automaton. The film is introduced in a classic style. An exposition to the characters with little dialogue. While the plot goes, there's the life of Georges Méliès. Both stories of Hugo and Méliès are told together. But the first half is about Hugo. Last half is about Méliès. Both in the middle. Their stories are told in a strange clever way. But it has plenty of emotions and wonder.Asa Butterfield is good as Hugo. His performance is better in the emotional moments. Chloë Moretz always gives a lot of personality and soul to her roles. Her and Butterfield are simply charming. But the best goes to Ben Kingsley. He's always been a great actor. He's just wonderful as Georges Méliès. All the credit definitely goes to Martin Scorsese. He expresses his love to cinema movies and shows its history. It often explores its eye-candy spectacles. There are fun silent comedy and romance from the minor characters.It's all recapturing the old style of movies even without making it black and white or using old fashion score. 3D is usually used for large scale adventure films or action movies but Hugo used it to show its spectacular visuals and it works great. The production design is splendid. Same goes to the music score. Everything you see in this film is just gorgeous.Hugo is for the people who love movies. But the center story is really about a kid who can fix stuff and wanted to be a part of this world. They just suddenly talked about movies in the second act and ends with Méliès' story. It's not a bad thing. There are plenty of love and joy here in Hugo. And it makes a wonderful Family Film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Spent more time looking at my watch than looking at the screen.,"I went to go see this movie with my mother, after reading several good reviews. I felt completely ripped off.First of all, I had to pay almost double for the tickets, as it was showing in 3D. This feels like a complete scam, because the 3D adds absolutely nothing to the movie. I would have rather watched it in 2D, since I wouldn't have to wear the doofy glasses.The movie starts out with a wide view of Paris, which is funny, because the entire movie is in English. There is not even a single character that has a French accent. An English film set in Paris is borderline offensive, if you ask me, and is the first reason why I felt insulted by the film. Did Martin Scorcese not respect his audience enough to be able to read subtitles? Watching characters speak English and then pronounce French names and cities felt silly and slightly offensive.Another major problem with the film is that there is not a single solid performance out of any of the characters. The actor playing Hugo was visibly shaking throughout the entire movie, and did not sound convincing at any point in the film. Chloë Grace Moretz's performance was the worst of the film. Every time she spoke she talked I wanted to leave the theater, because her tone sounded so mushy and overly-emotional. She also had an expression of exaggerated excitement throughout every scene that felt very unnatural.I can almost excuse the actors' performances, however, because the dialogue was god awful. I felt like I was supposed to be laughing at the absurdity of some of their lines, for example, Hugo often goes on stunningly dull tangents where he says things like ""Maybe I like to fix things, because I feel that everything has a purpose. If everything has a purpose, that means I have a purpose. My purpose is to fix this machine, and to find out what my father's last message was. I must fix this machine."" Honestly, a four year old could have written a more interesting script.This film is incredibly boring, mostly because it's plot is set at a crawling speed. Something will happen, and then it will take the characters 30 minutes to stop talking about it. I also felt that many scenes were added just to take up time. For example, when Hugo is running from the inspector with the automaton. This scene is nearly 10 minutes long, and adds absolutely nothing to the film.Do not waste your life by sitting through this movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
An elegant and enchanting film that appeals to the child in all of us.,"From it's very first page, Brian Selznick's 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' (2007) promised to be no ordinary work of fiction. The award-winning book was a gorgeous pastiche of words, illustrations, photographs and movie stills. It begins with a series of beautiful pencil drawings that transport us through a busy Paris railway station, and towards a giant clock, where behind lurks our hero, 13-year-old orphan Hugo Cabret.This sequence is translated beautifully - and in groundbreaking 3D, nonetheless - in Martin Scorsese's tour-de-force adaptation, simply titled HUGO, which promises to be no ordinary cinematic experience, and indeed one of the best films of 2011.HUGO is unlike anything Martin Scorsese has ever directed and yet it seems like the film he was born to make. The kid-friendly source material could easily have attracted the likes of French filmmaker Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Tim Burton and - dare I say it - Steven Spielberg; but, like any great artist, Scorsese makes the property his own, and with his formidable talent, produces an inspiring and sophisticated celebration of film history and the magic of cinema.HUGO is a film that has to be seen in 3D. Much like James Cameron with his 2009 hit AVATAR, Scorsese pushes the boundaries of the gimmicky medium. The 3D not only enhances Robert Richardson's beautiful cinematography or Dante Ferretti's rich production design; it heightens the audience's involvement in this very poignant story and their understanding of the characters and their world.The cast is simply brilliant. Asa Butterfield, who made a solid debut in THE BOY IN THE STRIPED PAJAMAS, gives a focused and engaging performance as our title character, while Chloe Grace Moretz (Hit Girl in KICK-ASS) is charming as Hugo's wide-eyed, bookish friend, Isabelle. Sir Ben Kingsley delivers a superbly touching performance as early film pioneer Georges Melies, and Sacha Baron Cohen is a delight as the malicious, yet bumbling Station Inspector, clearly patterned after such slapstick performers of the silent era as Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd. In fact, the character's awkward romance with a beautiful flower seller (Emily Mortimer) reminded this reviewer of a similar love in Chaplin's CITY LIGHTS (1931). The rest of the supporting cast is made up of some of today's finest British talent: Jude Law, Ray Winstone, Richard Griffiths, Frances del la Tour and the great Sir Christopher Lee. Each of these performers are impressive in their limited screen time.HUGO has been labeled as Scorsese's love letter to cinema and it shows in every scene. There are homages to silent film classics ARRIVAL OF A TRAIN A LA CIOTAT (1897) and Harold Lloyd's SAFETY LAST! (1923) and, at the heart of the film, there is a fantastic montage of silent cinema, expertly assembled by Scorsese's regular editor Thelma Schoonmaker to Camille Saint-Saens' 'Danse Macabre'. But for this reviewer, the highlight of the film was Scorsese's recreation of the history and career of Georges Melies, a 'cinemagician' who employed trick effects and elaborate set designs in his own glass studio, to transport his audience to worlds of fantasy and make-believe.At a time where big-budget 3D romps featuring dancing penguins or globe-trotting Belgian reporters, raises skepticism towards the 'family' film sub-genre, HUGO provides relief. It is nothing short of a masterpiece, an elegant and enchanting film that appeals to the child in all of us. At the end of the film, Melies invites his audience to come dream with him. Will you come dream with Marty?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An orphan goes on an adventure, and we discover the magic of filmmaking","""Hugo"" has Martin Scorsese master the children's adventure movie genre. Scorsese's 2010 hit was ""Shutter Island"" where he mastered the suspense thriller by paying attention to every detail in the film. Here, the camera is in the walls of a 1930s train station in Paris where we see the inner workings of clocks, an automaton, and an orphan boy looking for a key. It's also in 3D and is about the history of filmmaking.Visually, this is a masterpiece. Easily the best 3D movie released in recent memory, if not of all time. There is seamless merging between computer-generated graphics and real sets. Conceptually, this is very impressive. As Hugo is on one of his adventures, he starts finding connections to old films. These are not just fictional films that help the story along. Scorsese is actually telling us the history of filmmaking and uses the real footage of important films. He even rendered these real films in 3D. I don't know how he does it.Story wise, ""Hugo"" suffered. It meandered a lot, never quite deciding which little adventure to start, or solve, or finish. A trick that I have learned in screen writing is to use a time frame to set the story in, a ticking clock as some might say. Ironically, for a film that had more actual ticking clocks than any other, they didn't give their story one.One has to question if this was really meant to be a children's movie. The over two-hour run time sent the younger kids crying into the arms of their mothers as exhaustion set in. And as the story moved away from an orphan boy on an adventure to the history of filmmaking, it became quite dry for the older kids. I found Hugo, our hero, to be a snotty kid who didn't even want to tell us what he was up to in the beginning, but at least the kids liked him. And I, at least, had the history of filmmaking to amuse me immensely.I don't think ""Hugo"" was just supposed to be the history of filmmaking, but the magic of it. For those of us who love films, it certainly was magical. Hugo, the young boy, was removed from discovering the magic because his little adventure was mostly solved by the time we got into it. Unfortunately, I think this removes the kids in the audience from discovering the magic of it. But the kids can have fun watching a robot while the adults are educated — perhaps that is what makes ""Hugo"" so special.Conveniently, both ""Hugo"" and The Artist"" are supposed to be the big winners of awards season this year, both were released the same month, and both have something to say about movies. After you watch ""Hugo"" and are introduced to the earliest films of the Lumière brothers and Georges Méliès, watch ""The Artist"" it picks up where ""Hugo"" left off and introduces us to stars of silent films, the golden age of Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Quite overrated, but still good for reference nerds","When I went to see Hugo, I was surprised to see the cinema almost empty. When I left, I was no longer surprised.Hugo is not exactly an entertaining film. Much of it is tediously boring, and too satisfied with itself and its references to old film.Part of the problem in this film is the 3D. It simply doesn't need it. In fact, I felt it pushed me out of the film. In this sense, Hugo is the anti-Avatar of 3D. Its worst moments recall Turner's colourization of black-and-white film, by 3D-ifying silent film. Ugh. Have some respect, Scorsese.And, while I was surprised to read about of all the true references the film made, the fact remains that if you don't know about these particular references beforehand, they add nothing to the film. It's like watching Scary Movie. Audiences (particularly audiences of film reviewers) are made to feel smart for getting all the references. But when it comes to plot and character, the film never knows what it wants to be about. Is it about reconnecting with a memory? Is it about making a friend? Is it about restoring a career? Is it about promoting silent film? It feels very much committee-made, devoid of heart, save for a metal one in the form of a key, another gimmick.There is a thin plot here, about an orphan boy evading forces out to catch him, and finding a new family, rejuvenating it.I love silent film. I love 3D film. I only sort of like, or tolerate, this film. But I wouldn't say it's bad -- just seriously over-hyped.So, my advice: DO NOT see it in 3D. But DO see it on cable.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A fantasy, a children's dream, and a very adult appreciation of a brilliant filmmaker","Hugo (2011)This would have been my vote for Best Picture for 2011, especially if you limit the voting to nostalgic visions of silver screen history. This sort of does exactly what ""The Artist"" does, paying loving homage to early movies, ""Hugo"" is so much more imaginative, filmed with overflowing ingenuity and fluidity (it is a Scorsese movie I know), and it pays respects more directly and beautifully.Yes, this really is a love letter to the first decade of mature movies before ""Birth of a Nation"" and full feature films. Here we rediscover the short cinematic (very cinematic) inventions of French filmmaker Georges Melies. Never heard of him? Well, that's why you should see this movie. At times it almost plays like a fabulous documentary (to its detriment as a movie, but to the benefit of Melies), so you do learn quite a lot about this man. And it's mostly accurate. Things that get stretched for the sake of the movie are reasonable enough.(By the way, a little known reference to Melies, charming and beautifully done, occurs in the otherwise flawed ""Klimt"" and is worth watching just for those scenes.)There is a feeling that this is a children's adventure, but even more than ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" this is a movie for adults, and kind of about adults, too. The two leading kids--a girl and a boy--are terrific but in that child actor way where they fill their roles perfectly (not like, say, the slightly older Judy Garland in ""Wizard of Oz""). The adults are not quite caricatures, and make the film have a lot of depth, but they are kept in check by the children's storytelling aspect to the whole enterprise.Whatever the limitations there, it's the filming, the sets and costumes and moving camera and special effects, always kept in check, that make the movie special. If you are interested in the also-rans of the Oscar season, this is the first to see. If you want to just have an enjoyable bit of escapist and light hearted filmmaking, this is a must. And if you are curious about Melies, there is no better place to start.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Restoring Broken Dreams,"""Hugo"" (2011) is a cinematic masterpiece that encapsulates the essence of film as an illusion. This enchanting movie delves into the story of one of the earliest filmmakers, whose journey began with the magical art of illusion. It transforms these illusions into a spectacular display on the big screen, weaving together adventure, drama, and familial bonds.The film explores the profound theme of repairing broken dreams, akin to fixing a delicate mechanism or, in this case, an automaton. This metaphor beautifully embodies the essence of hope and resilience. The movie pays homage to Georges Méliès, a magician-turned-filmmaker, demonstrating how the intricate tricks and illusions of magic can be translated into the expansive medium of film.

Dazzling Effects Capture the Eye,"I liked ""Hugo"" quite a lot, mostly because of the feast of visual effects that the film offers. The opening sequence, zooming through long-ago Paris, is exhilarating, perhaps even better than a similar flight in the otherwise forgettable ""Moulin Rouge"" (2001) by Baz Luhrmann. The story of ""Hugo"" is rather predictable and only mildly intriguing, and the acting is nothing special. However, Martin Scorsese's effective command of photography and sound leave no doubt that a master filmmaker is at work. It is well-nigh impossible to take one's eyes off this delicious screen banquet. What dazzling impact will next make itself be felt? Watch ""Hugo"" and be prepared for an amazing journey. Just don't expect much in the way of eventful storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Martin Scorsese directed a magnificent and mesmerizing film for the whole family, a love letter to cinema and preservation which he treasures, Hugo is a cinematic masterpiece","Hugo is an odd film in Martin Scorsese's filmography, in how it's an adventure drama but a family film at that. Yet it works extremely well, making you invested and interested after only minutes into the film, by twenty-five minutes I was stuck. Scorsese directed and produced the film with John Logan writing the screenplay based on the historical fiction children's book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". Martin Scorsese brings all these things; the world and its characters in a spectacular way. He directed the actors brilliantly, especially the child actors like Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret and Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle. Then the adults are played by Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Ray Winstone, Emily Mortimer, Jude Law, Helen McCrory, Michael Stuhlbarg and Christopher Lee. Ben Kingsley and Helen McCrory portrays real life figures, Georges Méliès and Jehanne D'Alcy respectively. The acting is truly perfect in this film, from the actors with smaller roles and the ones with bigger roles, everyone's terrific. The ones who stood out the most are Asa Butterfield, Chloë Grace Moretz and Ben Kingsley.In 1931 Paris, an orphan living in the walls of a train station gets wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.Why did Martin Scorsese choose this film? The themes and message, but also one specific real life figure, I think. Georges Melies, who was a pioneer in the early days of cinema who made films in every genre and made tons of films in his career before unfortunately becoming forgotten like so many other talented filmmakers back in the early days of the silent era. Melies was keen on special effects and used them creatively, creating the iconic image from A Trip to the Moon and The Impossible Voyage. Martin Scorsese who loves film and works to preserve film through his non-profit organization, it just feels this is a love letter to Georges Melies, whilst telling a great story for the whole family.The opening shot shows off the visual effects perfectly of Paris in 1931, then we get a brilliantly photographed tracking shot which is something Martin Scorsese has mastered (the restaurant scene in Goodfellas or the family gathering in Killers of Flower Moon). The cinematography in this film is excellent, so is the production design and art direction. Martin Scorsese worked once again with his long-time collaborators, Robert Richardson (cinematographer) and Thelma Schoonmaker (editor). The editing needs the same praise. Howard Shore's musical score though, what a brilliant piece of score. Simply amazing!Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars, saying that the film ""is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about-movies."" Hugo received 11 Academy Award nominations (including Best Picture), more than any other film that year, winning a leading five awards: Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Sound Mixing, Best Sound Editing, and Best Visual Effects. It was also nominated for eight BAFTAs, including Best Director, and winning two, and was nominated for three Golden Globe awards, including Scorsese's third Best Director win.This film, this spectacle, it's a masterpiece which bombed at the box office. You could say it was because of the competition with Disney's The Muppets and Summit's Breaking Dawn Part 1, but also its complications with 3D and the big budget. Yet in every way I could think of, this is a cinematic masterpiece. There's much to love about this film, especially Martin Scorsese's direction and his vision, beautiful work of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Movie About Movies,"Pros: Granted, this movie is derived from a book, which has assumedly fleshed out the world in which the story takes place. I haven't read the book, but I've sampled some of the pictures within it, and there's just no comparison between the illustrations of the book and the visuals of the movie. Coupled with the wonderful visuals is a very deeply interwoven audio track. Each scene practically jumps off of the screen and draws you right into the world Scorsese created. The majority of the plot takes place in a train station in Paris, but given how thoroughly the filmmakers fleshed out that world, you can't help but want to explore more of it.We're all aware of how Hollywood is jumping all over the 3D bandwagon so that they can charge more for admission. But there are some instances where the technology is actually a useful tool and enhances the storytelling effect. This is one of those instances. The visuals become literally enveloping and greatly aid in the effect of pulling the viewer into the story. They are neither campy and in-your-face nor an afterthought, but instead they create a fully realized world that hugs the viewer in a magical blanket. (...Did I just use the word ""magical"" in something other than a very literal sense? I'm afraid I did.)Cons: The rather sizable problem with the movie, however, is that the compelling nature of technological achievements in storytelling is completely at odds with the more traditional storytelling devices, like the script and acting. The audio-visuals are busy sucking me into a world where the story and characters are trying to push me right back out. It's a very conflicting viewing experience, to say the least. The plot is one that I really couldn't care less about, but that could be remedied with a decent script. The main character, Hugo, rarely does anything other than flash those enchantingly bright blue eyes, cry, and say things that are completely void of substance. Little better can be said for the remainder of the ensemble.The cast sports the likes of Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone, Jude Law, Sascha Baron Cohen, and Chloe Moretz, but in a vacuum, you would probably conclude that all of these people suck at movies. Moretz plays her character of a bright-eyed and bushy-tailed tyke to an aggravating tee. Cohen falls flat as the comic relief. Kingsley does an alright job, but he suffers from the same problem as the rest of the lot, and the movie as a whole, in that it's aiming to appeal to your average 10 year old. Don't get me wrong; there's a place for movies aimed at 10 year olds. I loved movies when I was 10. But I thought the median age of the Academy votership was 62, not 10. What is this doing as a Best Picture nominee?Overall: If you really want to watch this movie, I highly recommend forking out the extra cash to see it in 3D. It does the best job in recent memory of completely pulling the viewer into its world, and it's a great example for how 3D can enhance a story. The problem is that enhancing a story from ""bad"" still doesn't do a whole lot. This is another case where I get the sinking suspicion that the Academy saw a movie about the history of movies and leapt at the opportunity to heap it with praise, even if it was, in some cases, undeserved. While I gag at the fact that it also got a nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay, I give it a 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good if British accents in Paris don't annoy you,"Why is it that every single American-made ""historical"" movie that takes place outside of the English-speaking world is in British English? I get it that it makes sense for a Roman-era blockbuster like Gladiator (I'm sure I might fall asleep if I had to listen to Latin in that context).But Hugo didn't need to have Brits and Americans with their fake British accents; Hugo could have easily been, for example, the kid of an American or Brit living in Paris and the rest of the cast could have at least spoken in English with French accents (since speaking French would have apparently tuned out too many people), which is just a bit appropriate given that the story takes place in Paris.As a final thought, the mystery about the automaton was a bit disappointing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A young boy living in  a Paris train station struggles to survive and find purpose in his life.,"Even to say that ""Hugo"" is visually stunning is a tremendous understatement. It would be so anyway but with the beautiful 3D effect it really is an outstanding accomplishment. The city of Paris is shown in lovely sweeping shots as snow flakes drift toward the ground. The train station itself is an architectural masterpiece and takes on a life of its own as Hugo navigates its deep recesses with an easy finesse. The shopkeepers, passengers, and police who traverse the station daily make for excellent people watching for Hugo, who manages to find sustenance one way or another during their distractions. These efforts finally land him in trouble with the somewhat comical, somewhat villainous child hating gendarme who patrols the station. Hugo is the kind of boy who makes a normal human being want to give him a reassuring hug and take him under their wing. As you watch his struggle, you can't help but hope for a happy ending.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A trip that any self-respecting movie aficionado must take.,"Many reviewers have labelled this kiddie-friendly adventure as Martin Scorsese's ""love letter to cinema"", and quite frankly, I couldn't have put it better myself. Set in a train station in 1930's Paris, Hugo tells the story of the titular orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield – occasionally grating in his overplayed innocence) who will do anything to fix the life-like robot left to him as he believes – hopes – it contains a message from his dearly beloved father, all the while discovering how cinema began thanks to a chance encounter with a grumpy old store owner (Ben Kingsley). Although played out honestly enough, it's merely a means for Scorsese, a self-confessed cineaste, to show off his encyclopaedic knowledge of all things movie-related; and, boy, it truly is a wondrous world we've been invited into by the maestro. Complete with flawless 3D that adds tremendous depth, countless references to pre-sound motion pictures and another incredible turn from Chloe Grace-Moretz, this is one trip that any self-respecting movie aficionado must take.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Come away and dream with me""","HUGO is a strange film. It purports to be for children despite the fact that the screenplay written by Josh Logan based of the book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick has more references to words and people and events that children would not relate to on the same level as adults. It is a spectacle in the order of director Martin Scorsese with some of the most beautiful contraptions and mechanical wonders ever filmed. It seems in many ways to be an homage to the history of filmmaking in the manner in which the rather disjointed story is presented. Likely it comes across better in 3D than on the small flat screen. Not that the film is without special merits: there are many moments of impressive philosophical values, child/parent relationships, and a few comedic turns. The cast is solid if somewhat underused in this visual mechanical Parisian extravaganza spectacle, but it well worth watching as pure entertainment - and that is really OK!The story is well known: Hugo (Asa Butterflied) is a lad whose inventor father (Jude Law) salvaged a broken automaton from a museum to fix it but dies before accomplishing that: his Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a drunk, is let in charge of the lad. Hugo is soon left alone in the bizarre train station in Paris where he tends to the multiple clocks, misses his beloved father, and fends for himself by shoplifting food and a few 'parts'. He is caught by a rather glum Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who runs a toy store while bemoaning his current lack of the thrill of living, despite the nurturing he receives from his wife (Helen McCrory) and his adopted daughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who longs for adventures. In time Hugo and Isabelle become fast friends and discover the secrets held by Georges and it is through their efforts that joy and the dreams of the aged filmmaker are resurrected.There are some sidebars - an injured WW I veteran who serves as Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who dreams of the attention of the flower lady Lisette (Emily Mortimer), Madame Emile (Frances de la Tour) who sips coffee while tending her dog and attracting the attention of the hefty Monsieur Frick (Richard Griffiths), cinema devotee and historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg) who opens the doors to the mysteries that have collected during the story), and the odd Rene Tabard (Christopher Lee) who part is questionable.The cast is strong - especially the children - and the special effects are very lovely to watch. The film takes us to the land of fantasy and it is worthwhile trip. Though the film seems to be impressed with itself and the revelation of the history of cinema, it offers many pleasures. Not sure it is a DVD to buy, though.Grady Harp",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Everything has a purpose, clocks tell you the time, trains takes you to places.""","Starring- Ben Kingsley and Asa Butterfield; The Hugo, a sentimental melodramatic movie accompanied by mystery and suspense, made under the ""Paramount Pictures"" banner, directed by ""Martin Scorsese"", written by John Logan, based on Brain Selznick's imaginative New York Times best seller ""The invention of Hugo Cabaret"" is a big step ahead in the history of movie-making, for it is the first ever movie made in 3-D with amazing special effects. I was swept away by the beauty of the means used to narrate a wonderful story, of an orphan boy living secretly in the walls of Paris Railway Terminus- maintaining the clocks of the station, avoiding the constable by using his wits, who intends to send Hugo to an orphanage. There is a slight twist of fantasy - deliberate nature of Hugo and Isabelle's yearn for adventure. Hugo's father died suddenly and mysteriously, and moved on with the automaton left by his father, believing it had the key to his future. The excitement is added when two wounded people interact- actions of one lead to reactions of the other, in turn both get healed. The boy's attempt to excavate his father's message leads to an excavation of past of old shopkeeper and the first three decades of cinema history. The plot is resolved by a heart-shaped key. British accent with French layer on dialogs add to the presentation and ferocious Doberman nearly lands in your lap is a lasting 3D effect. Scorsese passionately depicted early cinema in perfect detail, also he highlights the passion of his life-Cinema and its evolution using flashback technique. It is a great tribute to twentieth century cinema, glorious past when movies were non-narrative, efforts of inventor of the concepts of special effects, use of tricks like dissolves, multiple exposure and time lapse photography. Ticking Clocks and there spare parts are remarkably associated with passing events and that each one of us has a purpose in life. Time alters the taste of audiences, it turns today's hit into tomorrow's wreck. It was a sincere effort to awaken audiences to the glory of the past. The movie screen is loaded and packed with clocks, gears, cogs and round objects – which trigger the audience to an obsessive delight of magic and mechanics and unties young and old. I highly recommend you to take out time from your busy schedules and go watch this meaningful and moving movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually amazing but has it's flaws,"This is a movie intentionally made for kids and the whole family, but to some degree it's disappointing. Adults can sit through this movie but for kids, it just doesn't seem that enjoyable for them. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese and it shows because the cinematography the editing is just amazingly done, although it seems a bit too long. But it sort of lacks in the story department and for a Scorsese movie the dialogue isn't all that great. Which is a shame cause Scorsese is made movies that are really character and story driven in the past. I am not sure if it's because he can't pull of the same feats that he can do with adult movies, but this one lacks in that. Sure the whole family can enjoy this movie but it's something so much more that it can't really be generalized like that even with the flaws. In some aspects the movie seemed to lean more for the adult audiences to the point I can see why the kids might get bored watching this sometimes. But what this is, is a vivid and refreshing fairytale that is intriguing and even a bit riveting most of the way through. The movie takes a while to understand what is going on though but the way it shows piece by piece of the story is very well done, although there isn't a lot of meat in the story. But everything else is just wonderful to watch, especially the town and the environment this movie takes place in, is almost dream like. This is a very well crafted fable experience for just about anyone that should not be missed. But might disappoint if your looking for a very good character driven movie with a amazing plot. The movie can also get a bit tedious sometimes but it did brought back a bit of the nostalgic feel from back in elementary school during story time. Since it's a Martin Scorsese film and judging by the advertisement this seemed like it's going to be a epic magical super amazing adventure which this is not. The build up sort of drags and doesn't lead to something super exciting, but the story isn't way too bad, just nothing special. Especially since for most audience, they won't know what the main story is about for over an hour, which is pretty bad since it's for kids as well. But it's far from being a bad movie and it really is worthwhile movie that is really worth seeing it with the whole family. In another words it's sort of a visceral experience, except leaning more to the visual elements than emotions. It's a good movie but if the environment was used more effectively for the plot it would have been better. So overall, disappointing yes, but still watchable.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Dream with me!"", starring Martin Scorsese","Scorsese's homage to Georges Méliès plays with one of his key sentences.As the title states, it's the vision of a grand director, while it's also a tribute to one of the visionaries of the early 20th century.

An absolutely MAGICAL film! A work of ART,"Three years ago, I picked up a book that I knew almost NOTHING about, save a couple of paragraphs of a review that I had read. That book was ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", the debut novel of established illustrator Brian Selznick. Faithful to his previous illustration work, Selznick chose to tell his story in a rather unusual fashion- using pictures and words. But ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" is far from a GRAPHIC NOVEL. It is a novel with some breathtaking sketches. When I read that Martin Scorsessee was attached to adapt the book into a movie, in 3D no less, I was actually VERY excited. I felt that 3D was the BEST way to tackle such a visual novel, and it turns out that I was right, in some ways.Scorsessee's adaptation of the novel, which went through several title changes before settling with ""Hugo"", received much praise for it's storytelling, and especially for its use of the ""overrated"" medium of 3D, particularly from ""Avatar"" and ""Titanic"" director James Cameron, who called the film the ""Best use of 3D ever."" Mr. Cameron knows his 3D, I trusted his word, and rightly so. As soon as the opening credits started, I became fully aware that I was in for a REAL TREAT.""Hugo"" is the story of a young orphan, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who lives in the Paris train station during the 1930s. He has been alone since his father (Played in flashbacks by Jude Law) was killed in a tragic fire, and his uncle Claude (Ray Winstone), a frequently drunk man who worked as the timekeeper at the station disappeared. Hugo must move throughout the train station carefully, so to avoid the watchful eyes of Gustave (Sacha Baron-Cohen), the often comical station inspector. It's his sneakiness that gets him in trouble with an aging man known as Papa Georges (Sir Ben Kingsley), who runs a small toy stand at the station. Along with Georges' god-daughter, Isabel, Hugo embarks on a journey that is equal parts remarkable and magical, and one that is filled with long- lost secrets from the past.""Hugo"" is FAR from a carbon copy of Selznick's REMARKABLE novel, but it IS remarkable in it's own right. Scorsessee and his team PERFECTLY capture the look and feel of the novel's settings, and ESPECIALLY the characters. In the end, this is certainly Scorsessee's love letter to classic cinema, and to the French Filmmakers who he truly admires and looks up to. By the time the film ended, I was left truly moved, and with the impression that I had just had one of the most MAGICAL movie going experiences of my life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually intoxicating, but still a Kid's movie at heart","Martin Scorsese has my respect for leaving his comfort zone of Boston or period pieces in his directing turn of Hugo, a family fantasy-epic. His direction is quite good, but Hugo's real delight is the technical work behind the scenes. When I started watching Hugo, the idea passed through my head that maybe this was animated film because of the elaborate way the film looked and was dressed. It has a rich costume design, jaw-dropping sets, and cinematography with color that bounces of the screen. Scorsese takes family movie clichés and fills them with blood, making them alive again in a fresh manner. I didn't find much special about the film's writing and its performances are adequate at best. Hugo, while visually intoxicating, is still a kid's movie at heart.Rating: 6/10Grade: B-",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amiable mystery. 75%,"Can't say that I was keen to watch this movie. Reviews gave me the impression that it was aimed at people who had an encylopaedic knowledge of early cinema. Did read an interview in my local tabloid with Chloë Grace Moretz where she mentions fooling the director Martin Scorcese with her English accent when auditioning for her role in the movie. That was a sort of a hook into this film for me (I have seen Chloë in a couple of other movies where some random factoid also provided a 'hook' to see the movie). In any case, Chloë's accent is probably the least interesting aspect of this movie. If you like slow burning mysteries, there's a lot to like here for you.It's the story of the titular boy (played by Asa Butterfield) who is an orphan and lives in a clock tower in Paris. He has certain items which belonged to his father. Part of the mystery is how Hugo got to be an orphan. The other part of the mystery is the relationship between Hugo's father and Georges (played by Ben Kingsley)...they seem to have some connection as evidenced by Hugo's possessions.Georges' story becomes a reverential homage to the history of cinema in the hands of Scorcese (the character of Georges was unknown to me by name alone...so perhaps cinema afficionados would appreciate this movie on 'another level' if the name rings a bell for them). There does seem to be some factual basis to the story so my curiosity is piqued as to how much truth there is to Georges' biography in this movie (concerning what happened to him after World War I)...is there a lot of fact or a lot of wish fulfilment on Scorcese's part?Performances are uniformly strong. Chloë (as Isabelle) has an element of ""jolly hockey sticks"" to her performance at times, which seems to be from another movie...if this movie has source material, perhaps this element was diluted in the movie? Wasn't so much of a fan of this aspect to her character. Asa has a very fine moment near the end of the movie where he emotes movingly (to the following person...). Sacha Baron Cohen has a major role as the station inspector where Hugo lives...often coming across as a hybrid between Inspector Clouseau and an Innitman. Some of his physical comedy is good in this movie and I guess that he may have improvised some of his lines...it seems at times that the people he is playing against are genuinely surprised and amused by his utterances. Ben Kingsley also shows many sides to his character and getting a take on his character early on his hard.A weird observation to make, but...looking at Chloë sometimes, she seemed a bit androgynous looking to me (had a touch of the Macauley Culkins to me, it seemed. Maybe she could have been framed better at times...although there is some effective 3D imagery where certain characters are grotesquely framed)...maybe she could play a boy in another movie and win an Oscar? That would certainly be a 'hook'! Isabelle certainly does have an interesting vocabulary...I had to paint the picture myself of how I imagined Hugo would process her utterances...but, again, this element of Isabelle's character is not overplayed, fortunately. Maybe Chloë was miscast, in the following sense...she is a big girl now and towers over Asa...so, unless Asa prefers more mature women...(hmm...tongue in cheek, Isabelle's interest in Hugo does come across as a little bit creepy with that height differential...not sure if any source material has an (probable) age difference like this).One pleasant surprise to me...have read in the past about the very first reactions to cinema, when it was invented...it was nice to be reminded of this in this movie...e.g. the black and white footage of a train pulling into a station.This isn't an action packed movie or a laugh a minute, but it does have an engaging story and people may get a kick out of the footage from the early days of cinema. Maybe I've got a melancholy disposition, but I could have imagined giving this movie a higher score if things took a dark turn towards the end...when Hugo is keen to show Georges something as a surprise.I saw this movie in 3D. Many times the effect is impressively realised through camera movement or framing.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A well-scripted, masteredly directed and a spectacular 3D  extravaganza that deserved to win Best Picture!","Last December I saw 'Hugo' with my friend and it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The set design is fantastic, the special effects are unbelievable, the relationships between the characters are lovable. But most of all that's special about this masterpiece is the brand new pure 3D. This film is the next step up to 3D. Cinematographer Robert Richardson did some perfectly good shots where the 3D would stand out. It really feels like your actually inside Hugo's adventure. Loads of stuff come towards you. It's actually the best 3D film I've ever seen. I thought the effect was better than Cameron's 'Avatar' and should've been shot also with Imax 3D cameras as well. Scorsese has the soul of master storytelling. An artist that's switched from violence to magic. A love poem for the magic of cinema. It brings back long-time true stories and old film clips that could've been lost. A Parisian orphan boy, a mechanical man and a bookworm girl who've been wrapped up into a mystery from his late father. The main people that worked so hard on this film are mostly Martin Scorsese, Graham King, John Logan, Robert Richardson, Dante Ferretti, Francesca Lo Schiavo and mostly the author that wrote and all of this into one book, Brian Selznick who's got an enchanted mind of clocks, mechanical men, 1930's, mystery and magical twists.

A nice film,(No spoilers here so don't worry)Took my partner to see Hugo 3D tonight we were supposed to go with some friends but decided I wanted this to be a personal film. Now this being my first written/typed review I think Hugo is a perfect film to start with as I have been so anxious to see it trying my best to stay away from reviews etc.If you have heard that this film is not for children its mostly correct I am 25 & at times felt to young but at the same time was thinking that if I had a son/daughter this would be the first film I would want them to see. If your going to take a group of children think again as they may find it boring.Hugo is a nice film you can tell that a lot of passion has gone into it. Visuals are awesome story is great and you get a bit of a history lesson too. It didn't have that Spielberg magic to it though you know like the first time you watched E.T. This was disappointing to me. I am a massive Scorsese fan & in my opinion should stick to the drama/crime as they have all felt epic and stuck with me. The 3D is good in this film as you have probably heard also but I do not care for it much anymore.To sum it up yeah Hugo is a nice film maybe not one for the kids but the 3D may wow them for the length. Performances were great. To me this is a personal film with a lot of heart. But will not really entertain you or maybe it will. Just go see it.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Word: BRILLIANCE,"Here in Richmond, we have the privilege of viewing movies in a top notch place called The Bow Tie Cinemas. Going to the movies is still an ""experience"" at The Bow Tie, and all viewers alike go just for that. Tonight was no exception to say the least. My brother and I had been seeing the previews for this movie, and from the start we both were completely awestruck by how incredible it looked from the trailer itself. Well, let me tell you, we were NOT disappointed. AT ALL. This movie was everything that a movie should be. The cast was perfectly picked, the acting spot-on, and the cinematography was beyond articulate. Ben Kingsley played his character to the ""T"", and both Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz were surprisingly splendid. I say surprisingly because the acting I witnessed from these two kids was nothing short of brilliance; something you don't witness everyday with young actors/actresses. We were lucky enough to view it in 3D, and that just made it all the better. I don't like reviewing movies just to completely summarize the movie like so many people on here do. I am reviewing it so that you can know what to expect. And what you should expect from this movie is sheer perfection. SOLID 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Forever remember Hugo,"You know that feeling when you get completely inspired?I just got that feeling and still have it now as i write this... the reason is the movie i just watched.A film for people who love films, because it is a story about the love and magic of moving pictures and how they changed the world we live in forever.I expected a great film from Martin Scorcese, I expected an adventure, and i got both of these, but what I did not expect was the depth of this movie. It successfully intertwines the tale of a boy, living alone in a train station, and the history of one of cinema's great pioneers, Georges Melies. It is dramatic and humorous at the same time , but it just feels magic.This film has a fantastic storyline, an incredible cast, heartfelt performances and outstanding production. It is so original and so enjoyable to watch. Scorcese has proved, yet again, that he can tackle any genre.A film that should always be remembered.A new Cinema ParadisoBeautiful",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
homage to the invention of movies,"This movie is a homage to the invention of movies (especially to Georges Mèliés). For all I know, much of this is available to film school students; for the rest of us, this is as good as it will ever get, far better than even serious amateur cinephiles have much chance of seeing. Hugo is a real live breathing movie, not at all a pedantic history lesson or a viewing of archival footage; but all those history lessons and archival footage are woven in.I happened to be reading a book on the history of film when I saw this, and several of the still photographs from the book came alive as fully moving pictures occupying the whole screen: Arrival of a Train, Workers Leaving the Lumiére Factory, A Trip to the Moon, The Great Train Robbery, Intolerance, and more that I didn't immediately recognize. There are also bits of early animation techniques: a ""flip book"" and a ""lightning sketch"" drawn live on stage. We're shown a library and museum of very old movie research and memorabilia and equipment, including a hand cranked projector with a a rotating butterfly shutter wheel to block the light between frames.The production is thoroughly modern, using giant realistic sets with hundreds of extras and some CGI magic. (One nice bit of CGI is watching a glass studio building age over several years in real life from proud use to derelict, very believably and all in the space of only about twenty seconds of screen time.) There's no feeling of being confined to either a sound stage or a frame here; there are believable aerial views of Paris nearly a century ago.At the same time as the film is thoroughly modern, the story ""feels"" like those very first movies: Many of the principal characters wear garish colored costumes that stand quite apart from what everyone else is wearing, reminiscent of the way some of those old movies were hand-tinted. The sets are huge and unmistakably simple, yet intimately detailed at the same time. Each bit of architecture in isolation is quite believable, yet taken all together it can only be a fantasy. Today we'd call the story a melodrama; the personalities of the principal characters are exaggerated; and there are plenty of thrilling foot-chases and sight gags. Things are not so far over-the-top as to be hard to believe, yet they're plain enough so it would be clear what the general outline of the plot is and who the ""bad guy"" is even if there weren't any sound. (Yet, there are a few things not found in the old movies too: one would never expect to find any Freudian personality subtleties in old movies, yet here they are in ""our"" movie.)What we see is a seamless combination of new footage of this movie, clips of restorations of old movies, and thoroughly convincing modern recreations of parts of old movies. The blending is always believable and realistic: For one example, many of the restoration clips are screened as movies within the movie. For another example, some of the characters in what appear to be old movies are recognizably the same as the characters in the ""new"" movie. For a third example, a few times the camera starts by showing us a bit of an old movie, but then draws back to show us the whole old studio creating that bit (including quite a few insights into early special effects).A few visual idioms are repeated to emphasize they're still current: First we're shown the original, then we're shown how it fits into a modern story. The man hanging precariously from the hands of a high outdoor clock may be the best example. First some of the characters sit in a movie theater and watch the original on the screen. That fairly long screening shows what leads up to it, with scaling a brick wall, standing on a ledge, and a bit of slapstick with a window that opens by revolving. Later, one of the characters in ""our"" movie hides by going outdoors and hanging from the hands of a tower clock we're familiar with in ""our"" movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Martin Scorcesse making a family movie,"Martin Scorsese is one of the best directors around with a talent and taste especially for Gangster movies (who could forget good fellas & Raging bull) in the 80s & 90s then came Gangs of new york & shutter island Now, Scorcesse delivers his first PG rated family movies & he delivers it wonderfully.

Wonderful,"I saw Hugo at a free screening in SF (thanks SFFS!) last night. It was not what I expected and was really...wonderful. My middle schooler and highschooler knew the story. They say that the movie was much better than the original story. From the trailer, I thought it was going to be a movie for kids with lots of 3D twists and turns. Instead, I got a beautifully sentimental story about the wonder of film and about our potential to be healed from past hurts.This really isn't a typical kid movie. I think my 8 year old and 10 year old would have liked it but I don't think they would understand what it was really about. The pacing and character development is really more like an old Capra movie than a modern Disney or most Pixar movies. My 12 year old thought it was good and I think my 16 year old really liked it. I thought Hugo was a lovely movie for anyone who enjoys film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stunning but Ultimately a Bore.,"Going into ""Hugo,"" the great Martin Scorcese 3D opus, I had not read what it was actually about. I just heard that it was a spectacular film with some incredible use of 3D, I knew it was nominated for three Golden Globes and, hell, it is directed by Scorcese.To be honest, as much as I knew it was going to be a child-friendly adventure, I thought it was some sort of sci-fi film that had a robot. Um. No.What it is is a visually stunning 3D ode to the art form Scorcese loves the most: film.The title character is not the robot...it is rather a twelve-year old named Hugo Cabret, played by an excellent Asa Butterfield (""Boy in the Striped Pyjamas"") who, after the loss of his mother and then the subsequent loss of his watchmaker father (Jude Law is beginning to pop up everywhere again....), Hugo ends up alone, living in the train station, setting the clocks as per his uncle's instruction....and uncle that disappears as well, leaving a young Hugo to his own devices.At the time of his father's death, he and Hugo were working on reanimating an automaton and thus, Hugo not only steals food, but parts as well in an attempt to finish the work he had started with dad...and in the process, opens up a ""mystery"" involving an old toy shop owner (Ben Kingsley) and his daughter (the incredibly talented Chloe Grace Morentz proving what an incredible actress she is by mastering a British accent at such a young age).And the ""mystery"" at hand is hardly one of the Bobsey Twins nature but rather leads to an admittedly educational and interesting, but not so entertaining, tie-in with real-life film pioneer Georges Melies.""Hugo,"" an obvious labour of love for Scorcese, has all the right elements, from excellent performances (yes, even from a handsome Sacha Baron Cohen) to a well-written script to an exceptionally visually stunning 3D experience. The film could very well get Scorcese a couple more Oscar nominations under his belt.But as I was expecting a film about robots and not a history lesson on film, despite the undeniable quality of the film making, bottom line?

"Has all the bells and whistles of a great movie, but doesn't deliver!","Is it the story? No. Is it the actors? No. Is it the cinematography? No. Just what is it that makes this movie so hard to sit through or not take a little nap in? Well, I am not sure exactly, but to put it crudely: its just too long and boring. It is also a bit misleading. You are expecting something magical and more fantastical. You are expecting the clockwork man that Hugo finds to reveal perhaps something else and come alive. Yet, it never really does. Its very sad to come away with a feeling like that with so much substance and so many great performances. My advice is to rent it when it comes out on DVD when you have time to pause or stop it and make a snack or go to the bathroom. Its very hard to sit through.

A 'HUGO' Disappointment.,"As i said, it was a Hugo disappointment ever. Like you'll see the trailer and watch the 80% movie with an expectation and then in the end 20% part of the movie will show you what you cant imagine, will throw you in a land full of disappointment. Well, I'm not trying to say that this movie is The Worst (with great cast, fantabulous 3D effects, visually magnificent king in that category) that I'm trying to indicate at the same time. Ah wait, what that automaton was there for? to make a fool out of us? Like, story and starting will make you feel like you're just about to land in a new narnia with Hugo and the worst part is, your expectation will even grow with the dangerously interesting pace but climax, damn it will choke you to the ocean of disappointment i swear.

Captivatingly Sentimental in the Best Sense,"I found this to be incredibly engaging. I don't know where some of the venom is coming from. When people decide what a movie is supposed to be before they see it, aren't they setting themselves up for disappointment. Also, it would seem that it also shows a lack of much imagination. I found the character of Hugo to be incredibly complex and diverse. He does have a quest. It's to get answers to questions that have defined his life. He meets wonderful characters as they slide through the masterfully created milieu of the train station. There are forces out there that could send him off to the most dismal of existences. This has all the charm of the best children's books that I seen when I go to the library. The artistry is there. I suppose if you are expecting Narnia with a bunch of pseudo-religious manifestations, you will certainly be disappointed. This is like saying that you didn't like Gone With the Wind because there were no space aliens. Also, it gave life to a mystical figure, George Melies. I remember seeing that spaceship hit the moon in the eye and thinking how rapidly the artists adapted to the invention of film. I would hope you would not be put off by the nay-sayers.

Hugo's father was a watchmaker and he has inherited his father's talents for all things mechanical . During the early scene which introduces the interior of the train station , there are appearances by characters representing Django Reinhardt, James Joyce, and Winston Churchill . On his adventures , Hugo meets with a shopkeeper , George Melies (Ben Kingsley based his characterization of 'Georges Mèliès' on Martin Scorsese) who works in the train station , a nasty Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) , a librarian (Christopher Lee) and a beautiful woman (Emily Mortimer) who has a flower shop . Hugo befriends Melies's ward, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) , and together they have a lot of adventures , one that centers around Melies and wife (Helen McCrory) .One of the most legendary directors of our time , Martin Scorsese's first PG rated film in 18 years , takes you on an extraordinary adventure full of amusement and entertainment . This is an impressive production with awesome scenarios , groundbreaking set design and over-the-top 3D visual effects , being the first movie in this system directed by Martin Scorsese . The opening track shot of the city ending at the train station was the very first shot designed and it took one year to complete , it required 1000 computers to render each frame required for the shot . Brian Selznick book's imagination is brought to life with top-notch computer generator special effects . Marvelous performances by the entire casting as Butterfield as an orphan who lives in a Paris railway station, Grace Moretz as a likable little girl who befriends and helps Hugo and of course the great Ben Kingsley as the magician George Melies .

The film displays a colorful and evocative cinematography by Robert Richardson , winning the Oscar's cinematographic category for this film meaning that he and Vittorio Storaro are the only present living cinematographers to win the award 3 times . The picture pays tribute to George Melies , in fact in flashbacks we see Georges Méliès staging his productions with lavishly colored sets and costumes. As the real Méliès only used sets, costumes and make-up in grayscale, since colored elements might turn out the wrong shade of gray on black and white film , many of the prints were then hand tinted in post-production.Emotive and imaginative musical score by Howard Shore . This enjoyable story is lavishly produced by Johnny Depp , Barbara De Fina and the same Scorsese . This Martin Scorsese movie won the same number of Academy Awards as Scorsese's ¨The Aviator¨ totaling five . Both were nominated for Best Picture and Best Director Oscars but lost out. The film also won the same number of Oscars in the same year as ¨The Artist¨ , both films examined silent cinema . Rating : Very good , better than average .

A beautiful film.,"I thoroughly enjoyed Hugo. I did think that the first hour or so was rather slow, and although I appreciated that Scorsese was trying to encourage the viewers to embrace the visual cinematography of the movie, it did take rather a long time to get to the point. However, once we began to learn more about Georges Melies, and get to see the plot coming together, I was hooked. This really is a beautiful film which I would watch again.I'm not entirely sure it would keep the attention of young viewers, despite being advertised as a family film. The content is family friendly, but I'm not sure about the pace. But, if you are interested in the inner workings of cinema and how our current film industry came to be, then this stunning film is for you!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is the sort of film that you sit down to watch and shouldn't expect to stand up from till it's all over.Every character felt real and true to me, I never felt like there was a glitch in the acting or how the characters were portrayed. Hugo as the orphan tinkering mechanic, Georges as the bitter old man who has a past he doesn't want to talk about and Isabelle the adventurer who is the one real friend in the short life of Hugo.Even Sacha Baron Cohen surprised me in this film but I've never been a great fan of his ""work"" but here he actually portrayed some talent. It wasn't all fun and games with him, perhaps he will take on more serious roles in the future as this performance was something I'd never have expected from him.Even tho this film is mainly portrayed in the ways of Oliver, the sad little orphan that does as good as he can of what he's got, it has more meat on its bones than that. It was beautifully sweet and sad. It is a story that has a lesson behind it, but that is just what we need in films however it may be slightly too long for the youngest viewers.I do recommend Hugo for just anyone, I don't have children and am an adult but I really enjoyed it myself.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The world needs fixing,"Lovely movie, with the story every bit as magical as the special effects. The acting, the screenplay, the music, the editing, all flawless. And the paradox at the core - a movie about time and temporality is also about the timeless quality of all that's important...family, relationships, the things we all long for, and then rather than leave all of the metaphors and symbols up for grabs, he dares to offer an answer, a moral answer: We're all broken. So we have three choices in life. Be someone who breaks things, be someone who fixes things, or be someone who just stands there, bemused and bewildered, doing nothing. For many years Scorsese has been doing his best to fix the problem of decaying films. With ""Hugo"" he shows how love can fix almost everything, and that yes, the world is filled with things that are broken, but that we're put here to work. See a problem?

A  perfect wind-up toy that lacks the button to bring it to life,"Before we judge an old cynic too quickly, perhaps we should stop and think whether there is a human story behind their bitter exterior, perhaps a lifetime of lost dreams. Such is the case in for Georges, the cranky toy store owner (Ben Kingsley), in Martin Scorsese's Hugo, who turns out to have a secret that he has been hiding for many years. Set in Paris in 1931 and based on the children's novel, The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo is the story of an orphan boy who lives in the walls of the train station, the Gare Montparnasse, and spends his time winding clocks, a skill taught to him by his alcoholic uncle (Ray Winstone) after his father (Jude Law) died in a fire.Shot in 3-D by cinematographer Robert Richardson, the depiction of the train station is perfectly realized, especially its feverish activity and imposing Roman statues and figures in the piazza. The boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), survives by stealing food from the station's kiosks while trying to avoid the threatening Station Inspector, Gustav (Sacha Baron Cohen). It seems that Gustav, having been raised in an orphanage himself, thinks that all boys without parents belong there. Hugo of course has a different opinion and spends his days observing people at the station.These include Lisette (Emily Mortimer), a flower seller and scholarly librarian Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee) among others. Gustav and Lisette develop a relationship, but a leg injury suffered during the war makes him a reluctant suitor, though more of his human qualities begin to surface. Hugo likes to fix things that are broken and steals parts to repair a discarded automaton with a sad face that his father retrieved from a museum's trash bin. Hugo believes that once the automaton is repaired, the machine will be able to write a coded message to him from his father. He steals one too many mechanical parts from the toy store owner, however, who keeps the boy's notebook that provides crucial instructions on how to fix the automaton.Begging for the cantankerous Georges to return his treasured notebook, he develops a friendship with Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the George's goddaughter and his wife (Helen McCrory). Isabelle loves adventure and finds a suitable partner in Hugo who likes movies and they both sneak into the cinema where a Harold Lloyd film is playing until they are thrown out. Hugo tells Isabelle that ""broken machines make me sad,"" and ponders the idea that if every part in a machine has a purpose, then he must also have a purpose in life, a wise observation. The film ""switches gears"" in its second half and becomes a plea for film preservation and a tribute to the beginning of cinema and to those pioneer directors who created an industry that no one thought would last.Film historians will marvel at the showing of silent classics such as ""A Trip to the Moon"" and the work of such luminaries as the Lumière brothers, Edwin S. Porter, D. W. Griffith, and others, though the films have been recreated in 3-D rather than restored. Through the efforts of Hugo, Isabelle and Monsieur Labisse, however, the story of Georges' secret life is revealed and his bitterness is transformed into gratitude with radiant results. Hugo is by and large a family film and, since the majority of Scorsese's films have been R-rated, this is probably his first film that has been accessible to a wider audience.Although the film is designed for children, much of the material is too adult for them and the presence of Gustav's huge Doberman Pinscher coming directly at the audience in 3-D is enough to scare even adults half to death. Perhaps Scorsese thinks that it's a good thing for children to have nightmares. While Hugo is undoubtedly a technical marvel, it feels to me like a perfect wind-up toy that has all its parts functioning perfectly but lacks the button that would bring it to life. While the performance of Asa Butterfield is certainly adequate, he is not particularly captivating and there is little dramatic tension in the film once the mystery is solved, except for a few dreams and an obligatory chase scene.Unlike such classics as The Black Stallion or National Velvet, there is little here that reminds us of childhood. Hugo and Isabelle talk and act like little adults not children. A film such as Hugo might have been better in a simple and straightforward manner, not bloated with extraneous conversations, an over-abundance of characters, and dazzling 3-D effects that ultimately do not add much to the viewer's overall satisfaction. I think, however, Hugo may become a classic but for all the wrong reasons. It will be studied mainly for its stunning technical achievements, its excellent use of the 3-D medium, and its colorful lessons in film history. When children are looking for magic, however, they may turn elsewhere.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful, Touching Homage to Film","Recently I had a conversation with a friend who noted that his enjoyment level with a film is often influenced by those he's attending said film with. If his fellow moviegoers are having a good time, he's more inclined to follow suit; if they're less than enthusiastic, so is he. I haven't found that to be the case for me personally, except when it comes to comedies; I'm probably more inclined to laugh hysterically when my cohorts are doing the same. I guess the whole ""laughter is contagious"" thing is true. But otherwise, I pretty much go my own way and my level of enjoyment is based on my personal experience. However, there have been times when I've had a moment of realization wherein I suddenly become aware that no one else in the theater is as into whatever we're watching as I am. So it is with Hugo. While I became more and more enamored with Martin Scorsese's beautifully crafted ode to film, it became abundantly clear that my friends and the rest of the audience were less than impressed. In some ways, this general disinterest from those around me may have made my appreciation for Hugo even deeper; I almost felt I needed to get up in front of the crowd and defend the film and point out its many merits. Since I did not deliver my speech at that time, I'm afraid we're going to have to cover it in this space.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) has lived an unfortunate life. When his father (Jude Law) dies in a fire, he is snatched up by his uncle Claude(Ray Winstone), a drunkard who forces him to quit school in order to take up a job repairing the clocks within the Paris train station (and thereby allowing Claude to spend his time at the bottom of a bottle). After Claude disappears, Hugo finds himself living all alone within the walls of the depot, always mindful of staying out of the sight of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). In his limited spare time, Hugo uses the skills his superior mechanical skills working on the repair of an automaton his father found in a museum attic shortly before his death, a machine he believes will deliver a message from his father. To make it work, Hugo begins stealing gears and parts from a small store and soon draws the ire of its proprietor, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley). Georges allows him to work off his debt by repairing things in the shop and soon this job leads to a friendship with Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), who happens to own a key that fits the automaton perfectly. But instead of a message from his father, the automaton draws a picture that traces back to Georges and leads Hugo and Isabelle on a journey of great discovery.To boil the plentiful elements and concepts contained within Hugo into a few paragraphs is a tough task. It is a tremendously complex film with a wide range of plots and purposes that don't always interact in the most straightforward way. It is all at once a poignant family film, a coming of age film, an adventure epic, and an extremely personal homage. The mix of genres is a strong indicator as to why Hugo is having such a hard time finding an audience. Its rating and the inclusion of the 3D component make it an obvious draw for families but the truth is, this is not a film kiddos are going to enjoy. (Case in point: the young boy sitting behind me who spent the entire second half of the film telling his mother in a not-so-quiet voice that he wanted to go home.) This is the rare ""children's movie"" that's actually made for adults, designed to make us remember how magical everything could be when we were younger. So, basically, Scorsese's take on a family movie.Hugo is a deep and nuanced film that draws you in a little more with each passing scene. It starts slow (too slow, honestly) but builds consistently to the climax that, for me at least, delivered tenfold on the promises made throughout the runtime. As the movie progresses, Scorsese seems to be asking the audience to invest in Hugo's struggles, a call to action I had no problem responding to. Butterfield provides a quality performance that peaks at the right times and his relative lack of experience is tempered quite well by Moretz, who always displays a maturity beyond her years. Their dynamic works well and Scorsese does an excellent job of relying on his young stars just enough to draw the audience's attention but not so much as to put too much pressure upon them. The supporting actors, particularly Kingsley and Michael Stuhlbarg, all play their parts with subtle flair and each does a great job of highlighting the main characters. The surrounding story lines, while a bit distracting in the early going, come together with precision to expand the film's narrative andBut where Hugo truly excels is when it delves into the world of the early cinema. A forgotten filmmaker, Georges has retreated within himself and locked away the many painful memories that came from his post-war exile. It falls to Hugo and Isabelle, along with the help of a film expert (played exquisitely by Stuhlbarg) to reawaken Georges' love of film. Scorsese uses this piece of storytelling to unveil his own admiration for the early films and the further he takes Hugo into this realm, the more enamored with his work I became. It is a supremely well- made, beautifully shot film (as all Scorsese films are) that is nearly overpowering in its personal nature. You get the impression that Scorsese loves this film and wants you to love it as well. I only wish more viewers would join me in reciprocating that love.Please check out my reviews at ieatfilms.com",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The Magic of Cinema!,"When I first saw the trailer for Hugo I was a bit skeptical. Scorsese (the incredible director behind some of my favorite films ever, including the masterful Taxi Driver) had never done film like this before, not to mention the trailer itself sort of seemed like a formulaic, run-of-the-mill family film. Boy, was I wrong.Hugo is a real film lover's film. Many have mentioned this before, but its true. Scorsese's brilliant direction, along with the great script, produce real magic here. Film magic, not often seen even in the greatest of films. The film isn't executed in the usual family-film way. In fact, I can imagine a lot of kids and their parents sort of leaving this film with a 'meh' reaction. It's not a soaring, thrilling adventure that we usually get. It is an adventure, but quite an intimate and personal one. That is where the film succeeds.I can't really say much more except that the performances are splendid, as are all of the visual and technical aspects of course. This stands out among Scorsese's filmography, and in many ways, that's a very special thing.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hypnotic experience in a City that feels like London, but is Paris.","Hugo is an almost flawless movie with one remarkable characteristic: is visually stunning. Colors, scenarios, visual effects, city landscapes, everything is so beautiful that the whole tale becomes hypnotic. Scorsese shows once again how versatile he can be, proving that he deserves his place in the Hall of Fame as one of the greatest directors of all time. There's only a few guys in this business who can get the best out of every genre, and he's undoubtedly one of them. Hugo is a magnificent Dickensian-style tale, surrounded by lovely characters that will captivate you from the very beginning, making you roll into a mesmerizing 2 hours ride. Why ALMOST flawless? Well, you can call me picky if you want, but if part of the attraction of this movie is that it is situated in Paris, then let be in French. The Dickensian touch is great and the accent of the characters is musical, but if you want to use those resources in the film, just adapt the story and make it in London, cause having all these amazing Parisian characters speaking UK English sounds really misleading. I mean, you let it go when it's an animated movie and the main character is a funny little rat, but when actors are real things are different. That didn't prevent me from having a blast, though, but it just didn't feel like Paris, it felt like London.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

So beautiful! It works wonders on everyone!,"Once again this school holidays we have another family film pestering serious moviegoers to be seen because of its impressive line-up of talent on both sides of the camera, its dazzlingly positive reviews, its boastful incorporation of weighty concepts and its self-professed widespread appeal. People eventually discard their misgivings and hop and board because they feel that they would otherwise be missing out on something important. Unfortunately, the film usually disappoints as soon as the audience begins critically examine this critically-lauded film and finds its story to rife with revolting clichés, its themes plucked from easy and overused targets, such as World War 2, and its universality entirely dependent on the younger viewers misunderstanding the true substance of the piece.For these deficiencies, the critics always make the excuse that one must re-enter that state of childlike acceptance of the preposterous in order to fully appreciate the film. However, they condemn those that do watch films in this same mindset when writing about the way they flock heedlessly to summer blockbusters. It often seems that reviewers just arbitrarily pick out one of the many hackneyed and saccharine family films and refer to them as ""heart-warming"".Hugo, however, doesn't ask forgiveness for anything. All it requires of us is two hours of our time to show all the spectacular tricks it can perform. Adapted from Brian Selznick's book The Adventures of Hugo Cabret is a film in two indistinct halves: one simple, slow and enigmatic, elevated by astonishing visuals, the other more pacey and fascinatingly complex, with more of a focus on story; one exploring the wonders of machinery, the other delving into the rich world of early cinema.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is one of the many orphans left in the aftermath of the Great War, now scraping out an existence stealing food from the shops of a Parisian train station and dwelling inside and secretly operating the intricate workings of the enormous clock tower that overlooks the busy swarm of passengers boarding the trains to work each day. He is constantly dodging and living in fear of the ruthless station insepctor (Sacha Baron Cohen), a hardened war veteran who hobbles about in a troublesome, squeaky peg leg. However, it is not the inspector who eventually catches him but the equally humourless and world-weary owner of a toy repair shop (Ben Kingsley) who catches him stealing parts for a mysterious project. He seizes searches and harasses the poor boy, who he sees as a worthless thief, finding an eerily familiar notebook of mechanical calculations and sketches in his pockets, which he confiscates. Hugo insists on having it returned to him, no matter how many times the man refuses or threatens him, and goes to the point of enlisting the help of the man's sympathetic ward Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz).It takes quite a while for any light to be shed on the subject of this all-important notebook, or indeed anything else surrounding the boy or the old man, but it would be terrible of me to reveal anything as the audience is very deliberately kept in the dark for much of the movie. As I've said before, the breathtaking 3D imagery of the vague early passages prevents the audience from drifting off or becoming impatient. Details such as the camera's swift turns and dips in a fast-paced navigation through stylistically designed cascading snow-covered rooftops, jungles of clockwork and fast-moving steam trains make every scene utterly captivating.Then, as secrets are uncovered, characters fleshed out, relationships cemented and dramatic events start to occur, the eye candy is either packed away so as not be distracting, or the audience becomes accustomed the stunning aesthetic – I'm not sure which – and the film takes flight in a very different way. As describing these climactic sections is impossible to do without ruining its effect – this is the most prevalent flaw in the concept of film reviews – let me simply say for all its teetering on the edge of toxic contrivances, it pulls through with believability and purpose. In fact, it is on these latter two qualities where it finds the common ground between the two aforementioned fields. At least in its early stages, motion pictures were among the other stupendous carnival attractions that impressed everyone with its innovative creation of a seamless illusion.Finally, as for the ensemble of accomplished cinematic practitioners, due credit must go to Martin Scorcese, who directs without losing his artistic integrity or his maturity, but still ensuring that younger audiences will have something to marvel at, and some element of the film's meaning to hold onto. His cast has been impressively assembled, and do a fine job in their roles. It is a pleasure to see Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Frances de la Tour (all who are now best known for their involvement in the Harry Potter films), the lovely Emily Mortimer, the charming Jude Law, the irrepressibly robust Ray Winstone and the monstrously prolific, now 89-year-old Christopher Lee taking on colourful supporting roles. However, deserving of particular mention are Asa Butterfield, Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen and Kingsley give terrifically sympathetic and multi-layered portrayals of two of the war's most miserable victims, and while Kingsley has put his abilities to good use, Cohen sadly often wastes his lively comic charisma trying to offend as many people as possible instead of making them appreciated in films like Sweeney Todd and Madagascar. Most importantly, our young star Master Butterfield has finally found some worthy exposure for his remarkable portrayals of troubled boys who have long lived in very difficult circumstances, but have hardly grown especially stealthy or adept at coping with their environment, and still retain an internal emotional delicacy.So, believe me when I say that Hugo is a must-see remarkable cinematic achievement for the entire family, and, best of all, you can critically analyse all you like, it can take it!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Tribute to the cinematography,"Slow paced, from time to time touching and overall deep movie. The story of an orphan kid, who lives in the Paris train station and craves to understand the purpose of his life, is more like an excerpt from cinematography's history, but presented in a charming fairytale setup.The first 3D movie from Scorsese... the benefit from using the trendy technology is controversial. The film does not have strong visuals to boast, but 3D, indeed, helps to detach the actors from the background and bring more attention to them. Upon the whole acting is solid, but sometimes the emotions are misplaced (or at least non clear to the common user).It's worth to watch the movie just to get to know the way Cinema has passed in the beginning, especially when it's created with noticeable production-value and love.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My 10-year-old son likes it as much as me. All the actors are splendid. Please watch it. I can only promise you a wonderful experience both visual and emotional. I like films with young protagonist. Because they often fill me with awe and inspiration. The make me feel young again. Hugo is such a boy. The settings of this film is grand.

Looks great but that's it,"Story that takes place in the 1920s. An orphan named Hugo (Asa Butterfield) lives in a huge Paris terminal making sure all the clocks run correctly. He gets involved in a mystery involving his dead father (Jude Law), a mechanical figure and the mysterious Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley).The first film directed by Martin Scorsese for a family audience. Too bad it's so terrible. It's boring (I considered leaving a few times), heavy handed, simplistic and slow. The plot is virtually nonexistent and the coincidences that occurred were WAY too hard to believe. Plenty of plot loopholes too. To make matters worse we have a station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who (I suppose) is supposed to be funny but just comes across as annoying. On the plus side it LOOKED great (the station and overviews of Paris in the 1930s are astonishing) and this movies uses 3D better than any other movie I've seen. It also has a message that books are great and movies are magic--two VERY positive messages for any child to hear. An extra bonus is seeing the actual films of Georges Melies on a big screen in great condition with the hand colored frames of the originals. The acting was OK and it was a treat to see Christopher Lee in a small role. But, all in all, I found this pointless and boring. It's only being praised to the high heavens because Scorsese did it.

Wonderfully Un-Hollywood,"Reading the other reviews of Hugo here at IMDb makes it quite obvious that this is a movie people either love of just don't get. So, before you decide to watch this movie you need to ask yourself a few questions. Are you a fan of Hollywood movies? Do you prefer clear or predictable story lines? Are blockbuster action movies your cup of tea? Or romantic drama's where the characters always fall in love end up together. If so, maybe this movie is not for you.However, If you are you a fan of foreign films, particularly European films, where subtle character development and a complex unfolding story is the norm, you just might love this movie as much as I did. The acting, direction, cinematography, art direction and overall production value is simply wonderful. The plot unfolds like peeling away layers of an onion. If you're in a hurry, it just ruins the experience. This type of movie is to be savored like a fine wine, not garbled down like a diet coke.Did you see Jean de Florette, Chocolate, Cinema Paradiso, Delicatssen? If you loved these, you'll love Hugo.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo: Another Mighty Has Fallen,"MINOR SPOILERS The prolific Martin Scorsese is back with another addition to his filmography. This time, however, we do not get a motion picture aimed at adults, but instead aimed at children. This new work seems to be the one closest to his heart as it is the perfect symbolism for his entire life's work.Mr. Scorsese's downfall began with his previous effort, Shutter Island. A film that is compelling for most of its runtime collapses on itself at the end when you introduce logic into what you sat through for two hours. Its best attribute is its technical prowess and the fact that Mr. Scorsese has not lost his directorial touch. You can apply the style over substance argument perfectly for Hugo.The story behind Hugo is simple: a young orphaned boy (Asa Butterfield) is fixated on achieving his dream of repairing a device that he and his father worked on prior to his untimely death. Hugo has turned the life of a thief while simultaneously operating the clocks in a Paris railway station. He meets Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley), a cranky old man who has taken Hugo's notebook as punishment, and who eventually hires Hugo to work for him as reparations. While working, Hugo becomes closer to Méliès' god-daughter, Isabelle (Chloe Moretz). This is when the film finally picks up its slacking pace and begins with a plethora of excellent visuals and two charming actors who fill the screen.That is the only praise to be leveled at this work because it is style over substance. Any substance that it may have (note: may) is overshadowed by the visuals and the over-use of 3D, where watching it in many instances is painful and uncomfortable. Why did Scorsese opt to use this technology when it doesn't suit his close-ups without causing audience members to squirm in their seats? Why did he opt to use this technology when many scenes that have too many items on screen make it difficult to discern and enjoy the format? The substance that may exist lies in the film's messages, and they are very good ones: children should use their imagination to its breaking point; finding a purpose in life is essential; and not giving up on your dreams, no matter the obstacles that pop up. The problem with this is that children are not going to care about these messages when they see spectacular imagery, such as a train crashing through the station, slapstick comedy where an inspector injures his testicles, and overlong subplots involving blossoming relationships with the patrons of the station. These images overshadow anything remotely important for children to learn and the subplots cause the film to drag even more than it already does, boring them in the process.The gravest of ills in Hugo, however, is when Scorsese goes the Tarantino route and decides to have scene after scene after scene implying that cinema is very, very important. Why would Scorsese pay tribute to an industry that at this very moment in time consists of nothing but derivative, repetitive trash? Sure, there are fun summer movies, but they aren't the bastion of art. Romantic comedies may be perfect choices for dates, but they don't make you think and spark discussion. As the much-maligned Armond White put it:""As with the preposterous celebration of Howard Hughes' Hell's Angels in The Aviator, Scorsese pretends to honor cinema history by exaggerating the importance and wonder of movies that are frankly unwatchable, only notable as historic footnotes.""Scorsese continues the trend of creating something that will not stimulate a child's mind but will instead cause him or her to only display wonder at what is on screen; he or she will not care what is in the film's subtext but what is in front of their eyes, in glorious 3D.Another mighty has fallen, and it hurts far more than seeing filmic icons such as Spielberg fall. Scorsese has a near flawless record when it comes to solid entertainment and his first foray into child territory falls flat with his exuberance of style that trumps any message he had hoped to pass along to the younger generation.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Bit Boring for Scorsese,"I had very high expectations going into this film because it was a Scorsese film, and I was really interested in seeing him do an animated film catered towards the younger audience. However, I was not impressed.I thought that the entire movie was so dull and boring that I actually napped for a few minutes here and there, just to get through it. The music is seriously annoying and so improperly placed that it becomes meaningless to the film, and the characters bring no life to the movie because they have no energy and the plot moves way too slowly.There are very little characteristics of a children's movie in here except that it is animated. It's boring, serious, and just a whole bunch of CGI with no meaning.Unfortunately, I give it a 6, because it's nothing great, but still a great CGI masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very well done & entertaining movie that won't appeal to everyone. A lot is happening throughout but doesn't feel like it. I say B+,"""Do you ever wonder where your dreams come from? Look around, this is where they are made."" Hugo Caberet spends his days winding clocks and searching for parts for his auto-man. After running into shop owner George Melies (Kingsley) and his daughter he is forced to reveal his secret to them, which sets off a chain of event that changes him and the city. I have to start by saying that this is not a movie for everyone. I really liked it but it is very slow moving and for the casual movie watcher it may seem like nothing happened. That statement may seem strange but after you watch it it will make sense to you. This is a movie that each scene builds on the next (like most Scorses's) and is hard to talk about without giving anything away but I will say that it is a movie that entertained me all the way through. I can see why the movie is up for 11 Oscars, but I will be surprised if it wins any of the major ones. Overall, a movie I really enjoyed, but again not for everyone.

The God Of Visual Effects. ♦ 70%,"That is what kept me going and then there is history of cinema. I was gob-smacked to have the history of cinema re-narrated on screen and now I have a list to watch, of the first movies.Hugo is a masterpiece, not because of the story, but because of the splendid visual effects. I was taken aback when every single sequence had the dust swaying around like I was inside the film along with the cast. And with a beautiful performance by front-runners along with great direction, this film is the right food for cinema aficionados.Now with what I did not like: the story is little shallow to be believable and with the conclusion so instantly inferring, it further attenuated the whole point. The reminiscent of old movies was absolute, but the editing is very poor. Great cinematography & CGI, but when you have an abrupt screenplay, it turns you off. To be frank, the first half really is monotonous and it is only the second part where fun kicks in & your curiosity is answered without killing the cat.BOTTOM LINE: Recommended still, because of the aesthetic value and pure cinema pleasure. The beauty of Hugo lies in its VFX, Ben Kingsley & Asa Butterfield. Sacha Baron Cohen is splendid. For it has won 5 Oscars, go have a look, you won't be disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Magic of Cinema,"How so many people didn't enjoy Hugo truly baffles me. It's quite possible that hype backlash from the rave reviews and award nominations did Hugo a big disservice. No, it's not a masterpiece; it's not one of Scorsese's best films, and in most years, it wouldn't have deserved a best film Oscar nomination. But in the very weak 2011, it certainly deserved a nomination, and, considering the competition, maybe even the win.The number one thing people ought to realize when going into it is that Hugo is not a fantasy movie. Personally, I was happy to find that out, but apparently many were disappointed. So, once again - Hugo is NOT a fantasy story, though a dreamlike atmosphere helps it straddle the line between fantasy and reality while never really crossing over. It's a fanciful adventure story, focused around a child, yes, and definitely fun for children, but by no means a children's film exclusively; most of all it's a love letter to cinema itself, most of all to the pioneers of film, and that love is what makes it so effective. Like another flawed Scorsese film - Gangs of New York - the director's unbridled passion for the subject matter makes all the difference, and it's difficult not to catch his enthusiasm.Clearly, not everybody enjoyed Hugo, but for the life of me I can't really understand why. I can see how you might find the subject matter tedious, the protagonist annoying, maybe the movie thirty minutes too long; but speaking for myself, it was so much fun and so gorgeous that I didn't want it to end. Even if you didn't like the narrative, the cinematography and the sets are beyond beautiful. This is also the first movie I've seen in which the 3D actually added something to the narrative, as it helps create that feeling of magic, that dreamlike quality of cinema, that sense of wonder that we have lost in the century since the medium was invented, and which Hugo is all about.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The second half is better than the first half,"I appreciate the fact that Hugo is a love letter to early film history, but that doesn't excuse it from being tediously drawn-out.

Smaller children will probably think this film is wonderful. Older children with any intelligence at all will probably be bored. The incident on the track with the key and the aftermath was as far as I could go. STOP THE VIDEO HERE. This is simply absurd writing... in a mechanical world full of things like trains and clocks, even allowing for 'magic' didn't get me past a place where I actually felt a little insulted to have been assumed that brainless. I'm a little shocked that Scorsese put this in the can without any real continuity scan.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hugo,"Very well done story about a fictional (?) boy named Hugo, and wanting to find out the secret behind the animatronic man he inherited from him Father. The connections lead to the mysterious man in the trinket shop at the train station. I had heard a lot about how great Hugo was, but somewhat purposely avoided to find out what it was about except hearing little hints along the way (It was a tribute to the movies! A Trip To The Moon is somewhat involved!) and I'm glad I did. Hugo is made by Martin Scorcese, clearly a guy who loves the historical background of the movies (I've actually seen, and touched his collection of films at the Eastman House Archives (no public access!) and this was obviously a labor of love for him. I enjoyed it. I wasn't necessarily OVERWHELMED by it, but it was cute, it seemed to have a bit of a ""Chaplin"" feel to it though, and may have just been a wee bit sentimental.

Scorsese's Most Magical Film to Date,"Hugo (2011)**** (out of 4)Martin Scorsese doing a kids movie? Well, not really. HUGO is being advertised as a ""kids"" movie but even though it's rated PG I think it's unfair to say that this is a movie for kids. I mean, are they really doing to be interesting in uncovering the secrets of a silent film star? Are they really going to be caught up in this story, which is fairly dark at times? I certainly hope so because this is one of the most magical movies I've ever seen but it's doubtful because the appeal of this is sadly going to be very limited, which is a real shame. The story is a fairly simple one as the orphan Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in a French train station where he's trying to unlock the mystery of a robot that he and his father (Jude Law) where working on before his death. The young boy gets help from a young Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) and the two try to find out what her grandfather, Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley) has to do with the mystery.HUGO isn't in the same league as TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL or GOODFELLAS but I think I'd call it the most magical film Scorsese has ever made and I'd probably say it would have to be one the closest to his heart. This is a remarkable love story to not only a child's fantasy but the dreams that came come out of the movies. There's several sequences where Scorsese pays tribute to a wide range of silent stars including D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, the Keystone Cops and of course Melies. Scorsese's love for the cinema is clearly on the screen here because each scene you can just see all the love bleeding over it and this is especially true in one magical moment that ranks right up there with anything the director has done. About the mid-point of the film is when Hugo takes Isabelle to see her first movie. They end up watching Harold Lloyd's SAFETY LAST, which features the famous scene of him walking up the side of a building. The reaction of the girl witnessing these is so priceless that you can't help but feel as if Scorsese captured everyone's first taste of what is cinema. There's a longer sequence later in the film where we get to see clips from countless silent films and the passion on display was so incredibly moving that you can't help but hope this film does for Melies and silent movies just what ED WOOD did for Wood and Bela Lugosi.The mystery/adventure side of the film is also perfectly brought to life with an incredible journey. The screenplay perfectly captures this alternate world of living behind the walls of a train station and the design is just so eye-dropping that you can't help but feel as if you've never seen anything like it before. Even more memorable is an incredible tracking shot early in the picture where we follow Hugo as he goes through the station. Most people are going to think of the tracking shot in GOODFELLAS but for the life of me I couldn't figure out how on Earth they managed to get such a breathtaking shot here. The story itself really makes one believe in hope, happy endings and of just trying to do what you can to reach not only your dreams but those of the people around you. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz give two of the greatest performances you're going to see from any young actors. Both of them fit their roles so perfectly that you can't help but feel as if you're watching real characters coming to life on the screen. Jude Law only appears in a few scenes but he too brings magic. Sacha Baron Cohen, playing what would have been done by the Keystone Cops, brings some terrific laughs including a hilarious scene involving a piece of his leg on the side of a train. We even get a nice bit by Christopher Lee, Ray Winstone and Helen McCrory. Kingsley turns in one of the strongest performances of his career playing Melies. He must go through so many emotions throughout the film but the actor perfectly nails all of them.HUGO also uses the 3-D to perfection as Scorsese makes sure to drag you into this fabulous world he's created. Most 3-D films are just a gimmick but there are ways it can be perfectly used and this is a great example. Just check out a wonderful bit where the Cohen character is lecturing Hugo and we get a shot of him leaning towards the child. The effect it creates is wonderful as is another scene towards the end when Melies is addressing a crowd. Heck, there's even one of the silent films that gets a 3-D effect that is very memorable.HUGO isn't going to appeal to everyone and to be honest I'm really shocked to see how well it's already done is just a couple weeks. The movie is certainly one of the most magical I've seen in terms of being a love letter to cinema and the dreams that they create. The movie is fast, funny, dramatic, sad and incredibly touching. I guess a lot of people were shocked to see Scorsese doing a movie like this but it's about the cinema and ones love for it so I really can't think of a better person for the material.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ode to genuineness and mechanics in the era of digital mixing and editing - and using them,"The movie is visually effective, shiny and has several great performances (Ben Kingsley as Georges Méliès / Papa Georges, Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle, Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse, above all), but the plot is uneven, with frequent lengthy camera stills, and too much focus on gear wheels. The main star - Asa Butterfield as Hugo Cabret - is not so impressive as his coeval Thomas Horn in the role of Thomas Schell in the movie from the same year Extremely Loud and Incredibly Close (moreover, the two movies have many common topics and values). And Inspector Gustave (played by Sacha Baron Cohen) resembles officer Crabtee from the cult series 'Allo 'Allo! - perhaps too much.With regards to Scorsese, he has made better movies, and it not very credible to long for history and ""real"" cinematography with the help of digital tricks and state-of-the-art technology.

A reminder of why I love movies in the first place.,"When I was 9 years old, I read The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. It was one of the major driving points that brought about my fascination with film. Although the movie was released in 2011 I didn't see it until much later. I have to say that Martin Scorsese was the perfect choice to direct this film owing to his own love of movie history. Hugo does not disappoint. With great acting all around, a faithful telling of the book, and a fantastic array of characters, Hugo is a terrific cinematic experience.

Scorsese's love letter to cinema,"I can't believe I never watched this film until today.

It was almost at times impossible to notice the difference.The story is heartwarming and surprising deeper than I anticipated. It all accumulates in a tear jerking heartfelt ending.Unfortunately, what held this film back for me was the uneventful and slow first act.

Hugo...3 out of 4 Skittles,"LOGLINE: Set in 1930's Paris, a young orphan who lives in the walls of a train station and works maintaining the public clocks within. After an accident kills his father (a short and memorable performance by Jude Law), Hugo works to finish rebuilding an automoton found by his father believing that a mysterious message will be released to him once it is complete.Hugo is breathtaking, but not because of the over-hyped 3D. Although the 3D is a step above the scores of other movies released in the recent 3D boom, it doesn't rely on the technique to wow the audience. Hugo relies more on heart from John Logan's amazing script and Martin Scorsese's direction rather than on the thrills to be found wearing your cheesy 3D glasses.Scorcese directing a kids movie seems like a weird move, but the master of telling intense crime dramas handles this challenge with ease. Hugo is not your usual children's tale. In fact, I'm not sure I would even label it as a children's movie. The story may go over the head of the kiddies used to seeing dumbed down garbage such as Alvin in the Chipmunks or Adam Sandler's Jack and Jill. The story line runs parallel to a time when movies were truly a magical escape, and gave the audience a live look into what dreams must look like. With Scorcese behind the wheel, Hugo delivers the same excitement as the first movies ever made.For more quick reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stunning,"In this Hollywood film (directed by the great Martin Scorsese), a young orphan boy lives in a train station in Paris where he barely gets by in the 1930s. His love of mechanical objects helps to keep his spirit active.This film is a visual treat. The sets and streetscapes are beautiful in a child-fantasy way. The 3-D effect makes them even more visually stunning. To the film's credit, it also includes the real-life story of French silent film director Georges Méliès as part of the broader story.There are times that the storyline is less interesting than the visuals - a small disappointment for a film with such a large scope. But it's rewarding overall with great assistance from child actor Asa Butterfield in the main role as well as Ben Kingsley and Helen McCrory. - dbamateurcritic",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Hugo Cabret Goes ""Nowhere"" in a Hurray!","Hugo Cabret has been so obscenely overrated by many ""Bandwagon"" Reviewers that it is sickening! Just because Martin Scorssese directs a movie, doesn't make it ""great"". He's had plenty of lousy directing jobs. But the Hollywood ""elite"" jump right on the bandwagon to justify anything that Spielberg, Scorsesse, Abrams, etc. do even when they suck. I went for the ""godly"" reviews but ended up disappointed.I saw Hugo 3D tonight and found it extremely slow and boring. After 30 minutes the lady next to me kept asking, is it going to get better. I could only nod in agreement. Being that this is tauted as Scorsesse's first family film, I doubt many families would be able to sit through this too lengthy debacle of boredom. At a price tag of about $170,000,000, your grandfather could have been given 2 months of directing lessons and made just as good a movie at half the cost. They spared no expense in making this movie and probably as much in the ""hype-up"" money spent on marketing.Better yet, Paramount should have saved 3/4 of the money and had Marty direct a real ""family"" movie. With a few of Marty's super duper camera angles, throw in 3D, some subdued lighting and dialogueless scenes and it would become a ""Masterpiece"".To show how brain dead the media gets with ""A"" list Directors, Producers and Actors....It surprises me that no one in the media made a single comment about the fact that here are all the main characters born and living in Paris, France, but none of them speak French, nor English with a French Dialect. Instead, they all speak ""Bristish English"". In Harry Potter it was understandable. Even the inspector who watches over the Train Station. How ""unbelievable"" can you get. Even Danny Kaye could do a movie in English with a Frech accent and maintain the image. In Hugo, the reality of being in Paris went right down thru the tubes. I guess the Hollywood Elite can do no wrong. I am not surprised that non of the media reviewers commented on the fact that the movie was very different from the book. If it was someone else, they would have lambasted for that departure.Nothing can justify the blatant dis-honest and subjective accolades given to this film without mentioning it's so many faults. Reviewers are calling it a ""Masterpiece"". ""3D brought to a new level - beyond James Cameron's Avatar"" What kind of falsified ""BS"" is that.Lawrence of Arabia is a ""Masterpiece"", Gone with the wind is a Masterpiece. Doctor Zivago, Ben Her, etc, etc. are all considered ""Masterpieces"". But Hugo? Not in the same class at all. For the price tag - Is the Cinematography pretty....yes. Are the sets beautiful....yes. Does it have a rather dismal feel to the movie....yes. Is the acting exceptional....NO! Ben Kingsly is good in anything he does, he is a seasoned actor and he was very watchable in this movie although somewhat despicable in the beginning. Jude Law had a ""blink"" and you missed him cameo appearance...so nothing great there. And the 2 kids, well Asa Butterball was marginally interesting. Any good Hollywood actor of 13 or 14 would have done a great job in this movie. There were so many boring moments in the movie where Scorcesse has you look at him for what feels like hours without dialog.I didn't feel any kinship with the kids characters, no energy or life in the portrayal by Asa Butterfield. I didn't even feel any sense of ""pain"" from all his loses and how he lives. Somehow Hugo's pain was less important than Ben Kingsley's. More of a coached neutral acting job and with a British Accent no less. Chloe Moretz must have been picked for her french last name, but she didn't speak french or have a french accent either. Her performance was usable, but nothing dynamic. In so many places the film needed more passion and energy, and a nudge over the top, but most were given only as a flat performance. Not sure what the had in mind with these 2 picks, other than not to have them overshadow the ""A"" lister actors. Very Disappointing performances in a story that called for much more passion and emotion. I saw the reviews on Sacha Baron Cohen....o.k.what was the big deal? He was o.k. at best, nothing exceptional. Just because he didn't do ""Bruno's"" characterization, doesn't mean he is suddenly the greatest thing since chicken soup.Hugo is very long and draggy and ends on some Scorcesseish need to expose some ""Cinema Verte"" Hollywood cliché'experience to sucker in the ""drone"" reviewers of Hollywood. Or maybe they were all drugged before they saw the movie or paid off. Personally, I like to think for myself. The marketing of this film was also played out with all kinds of games going on. Initial limited distribution, blitzing articles, ads, exposure bought just about everywhere. They must have spent as much on marketing as the film cost. can't go anywhere and not see something about Hugo. I don't agree with buying audiences.I never fall asleep in a movie so this is my first. I fell asleep 3/4 of the way through it, as it dragged on. Who was this movie was intended for. Was it made to show in a film class about what you can do with a big budget? Was it meant for adults who find long boring dialog in movies interesting, or is it simply an attempt for the director to jumble into a film a whole bunch of stuff and cram out a warm/fuzzy ""Cinema Verte-Esq"" Genre-ee"" from the old days, so that the director could pay homage to something and older people would remember the silent films of yesterday... To borrow a phrase from the Tom Hanks movie ""Big""....I don't get it!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Near perfect,"I will start off admitting that I have little to say about this film. It is an instant classic, containing many inexplicable elements that make it very difficult to give an in depth review. Simply put, it is simply heartwarming and near perfect. The only thing I can criticize on it, is the slightly whimsical dialogue; however, I'm not sure I can really call that poor, as it almost played into the atmosphere.The story is perfect. It has perfect pacing and writing, and is complimented by equally charmingly perfect acting. It's not necessarily an emotional film, but it is just so enjoyably heartwarming. Hugo is a film that you simply will enjoy whatever your age or interest. It's like Pixar. Everybody loves Pixar. And so, you will love Hugo too.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Too smart, with panache for good measure","I realized early, when the film introduced a young girl whose active vocabulary included ""reprobate,"" this would be a unique experience. I was willing to suspend belief to enter this world and discover what other smart surprises might lie beneath the brassy surface. In this age am not easily impressed with visual effects and abhor movies scripted for action sequences without substance.Without spoiling will only reveal there is meaning and purpose to every element that is apparently lost to some, so can't recommend this for everyone.

Awful...,"This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life. Boring, slow- paced, vague plot ( with unnecessary characters ), no acting ( but a lot of staring ), with false expectations of adventure ( most of them seen in the ads ), overrated ( I cannot understand the ""8"" it is ranked with, hope it decreases fast ). This should be a film about the French movie- maker pioneer Georges Méliès. But the industry decided to lure us with a promise of adventure, mystery and magic. You will get none of them. And Georges Méliès sure deserves a much better movie than this one to tell his remarkable history. Unfortunately we get a hoax. Not at all attractive to children. Half of the people in the theater got asleep while ""watching"" it. The other half just left in the middle of this movie ? Visually it is OK, with good use of 3D and some nice picture. But that's all. You will waste your money, do not watch it. Or, on a second thought, watch it if you want some nice sleep Oh, by the way.

A splendid adventure for all ages,"I watched Hugo when it was first released and just re-watched it lately. Asa Butterfield plays the titular character who keeps the clocks in the train station running. He was adopted by his uncle Claude after his Dad's death in a fire. Events seem to conspire against him, until they take a different turn into a surprising story we did not imagine. Chloe Grace Moretz plays Isabelle who makes friends with Hugo, but neither of them could imagine the part she would play in her Grand Fathers redemption, (Brilliantly played by Ben Kingsley) and also the huge impact she would have on Hugo's future.The sets and costumes are perfectly matched for the time and for the vision of the story, as are the sets. And the photography is elaborate and paints the picture perfectly. It almost has a feeling of 9 about it, a sort of steampunk feel although I'm not sure if that's intended. This was the first time I'd seen Moretz, who was about 14 at the time, and I said to myself 'She's gonna be big one day.' And sure enough she is and I've seen all her films. Christopher Lee makes an appearance too as Monsieur Labisse. Lee needs no introduction, a consummate pro actor who has never taken a bad role, or at least never acted one. I remember being scared of him as a child, but at the same time he had some kind of avuncular charm. He sadly died some years after this film.The cast is awesome. Even Sacha Baron Cohen who I dislike intensely, plays his part well and although the casting adds to the film, the direction is flawless. Scorsese had this nailed and although it's not a film to be watched every month, you can watch it over and over with a decent gap and still enjoy it. There are twists and turns to the story and yet it is told so well that you don't even realise how complex it is. This is the epitome of great story, great acting, great photography, great sets and costumes and great direction. The perfect storm of talent you might say.I gave it a solid 8 because of everything.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A Good, Feel Good Movie",I saw that Hugo had a 4.5 star rating on HBO Max so it was a must watch movie. 4.5 stars for me would be the equivalent of 8 or 9 for IMDB.

Beautiful and stunning film to watch! Great flick for the family.,"I think most audiences from 12 and under will find Hugo to be one of the best films for their age group. Outside of that age range will likely find the film to be of fantastic quality in every category. The true question for most readers is, do you like family films? Can you tolerate them? If so, rent it, buy it, borrow it, or somehow find a way to watch it. I think you will like it, if not absolutely love it. For me personally, I think it really is a beautiful and stunning film to see, and the acting is spot on. I just didn't care for the film after the first say hour and a half or so. Not that the last half hour is bad, in fact I rather liked it at first. It was after re-watching part of it, and thinking about it in depth that I began to realize its flaws. I do think it was rather predictable in ways, which is to be somewhat expected as a family film. I also can't get over the ending feeling like an attempt at becoming a shoe-in at the Oscars. This does bother me to a certain extent how it was done, and how educational it became on the start of the film industry. I hope if anything this ends up inspiring youth to be more creative as I find there to be far too few of these around today. None-the-less, still a well done film and was glad to have seen what it was all about.For my full review, visit http://visuallyimpairedreviews.blogspot.com/2012/03/hugo.html",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"OK film, doesn't deserve the hype","So I don't know what the hype is about this film. While it is entertaining there is very little else. Hugo contains a lack of emotional connection (except from maybe a child who hasn't seen a great film yet) and the climax is very abrupt and disappointing while the resolution is extended like Lord of the Rings Return of the King. Also some of the actions the characters make do not seem logical, and they took me out of the film, wondering why would he actually do that, no one in there right mind would think that. If you're looking for a film to kick back and relax to, this is a good film. If you're wanting to watch this film, like i did, because of the high ratings and the expectation that this film would actually follow through with it go watch something else.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Simply stunning to watch, but a bit of a chore to love","Martin Scorsese directing a kid's movie? You cannot be serious.That was the thought that ran through my head when I first read about Hugo, based on the children's book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick. While it seemed like an intriguing idea, I was a bit skeptical that a man who has spent almost fifty years in the business directing violent gangster pictures and sweepingly violent period pieces would really be well equipped to direct something that was directed at youngsters. Add the fact that it is in 3D, and you have the first real time I had a doubt in Scorsese.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives as an orphan rotating and setting the clocks properly at a train station near Paris post 1930s economic depression. He is caught by the local toy store shopkeeper (played by Ben Kingsley), who confiscates the sketch pad filled with inventions and ideas originally owned by Hugo's father. Hugo obviously wants to retrieve it, but there is something deeply troubling the shopkeeper. And with the help of his granddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), the pair set out to find out just what is troubling him.For all the critical praise it has and will continue to receive, it does not negate the fact that Hugo is two-thirds of a horrifically boring movie. It starts off interesting enough, but then it slows right down and barely picks itself back up. Until the subplots kicked in about the pioneering of the filmmaking medium, I had absolutely no idea where the film was going – and neither did the film. It just plays itself out without much concern, introducing characters, ideas and elements which may have proved valuable at the time, but are next to useless in the final end game. I found myself frequently questioning just what Scorsese was trying to accomplish, and found that the film was more often than not, at odds with itself. It is not a children's film by a long shot, but it is not necessarily an adult film either. There are moments of adventure and whimsy, but then there are some really dark and disturbing moments as well. It just does not know what it wants to be, and suffers as a result of it. When I am fighting the urge to pass out during one of the most highly anticipated films of the year because I am bored to tears, then there is clearly an issue.While we can blame the lack of any semblance of plot development on the source material (I have not read Selznick's novel, but it sounds like a mish-mash of ideas that barely come together), I feel that Scorsese is a talented enough director that he should have been able to see through the problems, and fix them with relative ease. He is out of his element here making his first real ""children's movie"", but his craft is just as impeccable as always. Surely he could tell that he needed to make his thinly veiled plea for cinematic restoration and preservation a lot sooner and clearer than he does, right? He clearly has a passion for the material, but the film lacks that electric feel that most Scorsese films have. It lacks that jolt, that spark that really transcends the medium, and sets his work apart from everyone else's. If you had very little knowledge of the project and left Hugo before the cinema subplot kicks in, you may not even know the film was part of Scorsese's oeuvre. It may simply look like a very gorgeous film, with some intriguing characters and a total lack of a cohesive story.But for all the story related issues, I must say that the film is very impressive to look at. The sets, the costumes, and the editing style – all of it is just as incredible as we have come to expect. Scorsese knows how to make a really authentic and meticulously designed period piece, and his work here is no different. But what really makes it dazzle and come to life, rather surprisingly, is the 3D. It is generously employed throughout the film very carefully, very rarely coming off as the gimmick it inherently is. Instead, it adds depth and a stunning realism to the film. It feels like you are in the movie, experiencing what Hugo sees and feels. It may look extremely fake when it hits Blu-ray, but there is no questioning how astonishing it looks here. Seeing the clocks in action is particularly wonderful, as is the subtle use of snow outside and dust inside. And even though it is used quite frequently, you never grow tired of it. You just sit in your seat, and wait for the next effect Scorsese throws at you.Acting is strong across the board, from main players like Butterfield, Moretz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Kingsley, to bit players who serve very little purpose like Frances de la Tour, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee and Emily Mortimer, to blink-and-you-will-miss-them extended cameos like Jude Law and Ray Winstone. Everyone is on their A-game, and shines well above the dialogue and actions they are given. Particular attention needs to be played to Butterfield, who shoulders the majority of the film almost exclusively. His plight is the stuff of wonder and imagination, and would have been simply riveting had the film's content been a bit better focused.While Hugo is a positively stunning experience to view, the majority of the story leaves a lot to be imagined. Even with the great acting and wonderful 3D, the film suffers from a horrendous element of boredom constantly. When the third act kicks in, it finally figures out what it wants to be and suddenly the film becomes the masterpiece it should have been all along. I did enjoy Hugo, but this is quite simply a good movie that could have been brilliant.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Martin Scorsese's love & appreciation of early motion pictures enables one of 2011's best films,"Hugo is a thank you letter from Martin Scorsese to motion pictures, specifically the first motion pictures and their early pioneers. Using the inquisitive adventures of a young, orphaned French boy, Scorsese leads us into a much broader and surprising area than where the setup begins. Furthermore, Hugo is in 3D which at first thought seems an odd medium from the director of The Departed, Gangs of New York, and Raging Bull. The polished result and gimmicky tricks of 3D do not resemble Scorsese's gritty and realistic cinematography preferences. It turns out; however, Scorsese is proficient in both mediums. The 3D effects in Hugo are perhaps the best I have ever seen.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a recent orphan scurrying around the Paris train station in 1931 maintaining its myriad clocks while dodging the watchful eye of the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen). Hugo's father (Jude Law) was an accomplished watch/clock tinkerer and before he passed on, transferred much of knowledge and skill to young Hugo. Unlike other fictional orphans though, Hugo is having some trouble taking care of himself. He is quickly outgrowing his childish clothes, he frequently has trouble pilfering food, and his lack of schooling is starting to show.Hugo's loitering ways and incompetent shoplifting efforts not only keep the Station Inspector alert, but they also catch the eye of Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley), a toy shop owner in the train station. Through Georges, Hugo meets his granddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), an extremely precocious girl who loves books, always tries to fit in new learned vocabulary into her sentences, and finds the orphan boy running the station clocks to be a very intriguing friend. All of this is just setup though while leading towards the true purpose of Hugo.Papa Georges is not who he appears to be. I will not disclose who he is, but film aficionados will most likely figure it out early on. Hugo's father used to take him to movies which instilled in Hugo a love of the medium as well; he considers them dreams during the daytime. The discovery, eventual realization, and reaction to Georges are the film's highlights and are what will stay with the audience rather than Hugo's exploits. Scorsese's appreciation of early motion pictures is infectious and will hopefully inspire the kids in the audience to seek out old movies and remind their parents of what once was.The characters in Hugo are truly fun to watch as they weave in and out of the train station and its hideaways. A particular highlight is Cohen as the Station Inspector. He receives some quality screen time as he attempts to professionally safeguard the station and maybe even impress the local flower girl. Moretz as Isabelle is also quite good. She shows here she may very well break out of her current child actor status and become a much more accomplished actress.Because Martin Scorsese wanted to share his affection for early motion pictures and found a great script to deliver his message, he has once again made one of the best films of the year. Both children and adults will love this movie regardless that a child is its main character or that it is in 3D. I highly recommend Hugo and encourage you to just sit back and enjoy it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Picture Bait,"Martin Scorsese would like to preemptively thank the Academy for what will likely be at least four nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Ben Kingsley), and Best Supporting Actress (Helen McCrory). Given most of the movie serves as a celebration of movie-making as an art and movie directors as artists, they don't have much choice. Also it gives the Academy a chance to dole out a lifetime achievement award to Scorsese and Kingsley (although he has done a fair bit of schlock such as ""Species""). Wrapped around the brief history of the earliest beginnings of movie-making and the self-reverential celebration of film-making is the plot from the book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". In this story, an orphan subsists in the Paris train station by stealing and spends most of his time running from the station's dedicated constable. Somehow we are lead to believe this is preferable to be sent to the local orphanage. In an interesting casting move lunatic Sasha Baron Cohen plays the socially awkward policeman. Unlike most prior roles we don't see him naked but we are invited to laugh at a physical deformity resulting from an injury sustained in World War II so he does retain some of his trademark offense. While the casting decision mixed things up in what is a very staid and stately film, Cohen's maniacal vibe is largely wasted here and the part could have been played by any number of actors. Certainly a gorgeous film and a good use of 3-D; however, even here the 3-D medium feels gimmicky. Scorsese swings for the fences with the technology and it is its breadth and Merchant Ivory grand, sweeping feel that leads to some of the problems with the movie. The chief among these lies with the slow, stately pacing which is simply dull in a number of particularly slow spots. The intrusive soundtrack often offers some bouncing bit of orchestral shenanigans during these times when not much is happening on the screen further highlighting the yawn-worthy scenes. A second major problem comes from a jarring break between the main Hugo plot and the academic salute to movie-making which starts about three-fifths into the film. By the time the history lesson ends, the return to the Hugo's battle against Cohen almost could use a recap for those who had forgotten the earlier story. In short, not a great film but with too many of the elements needed to a Best Picture nom and probably win unless the Weinsteins come up with another historical period drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Through the Eyes behind the Face,"Greetings again from the darkness. This latest from Martin Scorsese can be fitted with multiple labels and each would be correct: a tribute to the birth of movies, a case for film preservation, a children's fable, a special effects/3D extravaganza, a family movie with touches of Dickens. Very few directors would tackle such an ambitious project and succeed in producing such a magical experience.Based on Brian Selznick's (relative to the film giant David O. Selznick)children's book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", this is a story of redemption and fulfillment. Asa Butterfield plays Hugo, made an orphan when his watchmaker father (Jude Law) dies in a fire. Hugo gathers up the project he and his dad had been working on, and he moves in with his drunkard Uncle Claude (Ray Winstone). They live in the walls of a 1930's Paris train station and maintain all the clocks, ensuring accurate time. When his uncle disappears, Hugo carries on the daily mission unseen by passengers and station staff. He steals the occasional croissant and milk to survive, all while continuing the mission of repairing the automaton his dad salvaged. Hugo is convinced there is a hidden message from his father that will be revealed when the automaton is fully functioning.Hugo gets cross-ways with a station toy vendor named Georges, played by Sir Ben Kingsley. Georges is a bitter old man and has no time for Hugo the urchin. Chloe Moretz plays Isabelle, a ward unto Georges, and she and Hugo strike up a friendship. Hugo introduces Isabelle to the world of cinema ... previously off-limits to her thanks to Georges. She returns the favor by awakening Hugo to the power of books in a store run by the mysterious, and always great, Christopher Lee. All this is happening while Hugo tries to evade the grasp of the oddly dedicated and slightly twisted station inspector played by Sacha Baron Cohen.The kids' research and automaton revealed hint lead them to a film history book written by Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg). It's here that they discover Georges is really George Melies, the famous pioneer of film who developed the first special effects and studio system. If you know much of film history, then you recognize Melies as the one who brought us the 1902 ""A Trip to the Moon"". It is here that Scorsese delivers a quick recap of the origination of film, including the Lumiere Brothers, the famous clock stunt by Harold Lloyd and other silent film classics like Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin. The best portion is dedicated to recreating the system used by Melies to produce films in his make-shift studio.It is here that we are allowed to remember just how magical movies can be and how the best ones fill us with a sense of wonderment. The lines between what we feel and what Scorsese is showing us becomes so blurred it no longer matters. As Isabelle is overwhelmed in the theatre, that same feeling sweeps over us. How interesting that Scorsese's first special effects film features the man who originated film special effects. We even get a re-creation of the famous oncoming locomotive clip that caused audiences to jump. We get it in 3D in Hugo's own station!I have been extremely critical of 3D and its misuse in movies these past couple of years. It rarely adds to the movie and always dims the colors and brightness. Scorsese is a firm believer in the technology and set out to show what can be done and how it can compliment the story. While more impressive than any 3D since Avatar, I still have my doubts about the benefits. What I do know is that if you can overlook the story that drags a bit and the unnecessary 3D effects, you will probably find the film to be quite entertaining and fun to watch. Howard Shore's score plays a vital role and supporting work comes from Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths, and Helen McCrory. It's not for the youngest kids, but it will make you feel like a kid ... while reminding you that movies are the stuff that dreams are made of.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Delightful!,"I just read two scathing reviews of Hugo. I saw it last night with my wife. We clapped spontaneously after it was finished. All I can say is that I laughed, cried, and was thrilled by this movie. I believe it to be the best thing Scorcese has ever done. It was absolutely brilliant on so many levels. It was a touching story about a young boy surviving on his wits and being welcomed into a family. It was a movie about discovery. Inner discovery and outer. It was a movie about love. It was about patience. It was about steadfastness. It was about wonder and delight. It was about magic. It was spiritual and also utilitarian. In other words it covered lots of topics and levels. I had no expectations. I knew nothing about it going in. Sometimes that is the death knell of having a movie being enjoyable. It seems every time I read lots about a movie and then watch it I am disappointed. However often when I know nothing about a film I find it delightful. This was the case with Hugo. I don't see how anyone could not have been carried away by this film! It is a sad state of affairs when a humane film like Hugo garners such scathing reviews.

Hugo - 5 Stars,"""Movies touch our hearts and awaken our vision, and change the way we see things. They take us to other places, they open doors and minds. Movies are the memories of our lifetime.

But you would presume wrong. His voice has never been louder and clearer. Founded on Scorsese's lifelong love affair with the movies, ""Hugo"" is a dazzling and magical gem that embraces the very essence of film itself. You can sense an irony in how it uses the latest 3-D technology to remember the earliest existence of filmmaking, but there is a more profound explanation behind this technique:As a majestic tribute to silent films and a landmark in 3-D filmmaking, ""Hugo"" acknowledges the eternal significance of the past while simultaneously providing needed hope for the future.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/hugo-movie-review/",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A huge potential for an exceptional film.,"A resplendently sweeping opening shot that promised of an exceptional film with complex themes completely took unexpected turns for the worse.Scorsese expresses his love for his profession of film and film making and reminds us of how cinema has shaped us and our dreams in the past century. However, he chose to tell this amazing story within a lame over used and formulated context. The film was slow and at times seemed uninspired, the film's one dimensional characters and many pointless subplots didn't help bring it back to life.But I left the theater thinking of similarities with Cinema Paradiso - the clips of film so lovingly edited out and then reconstituted by Alfredo the projectionist shown to Salvatore in CP, and those of Melies in Hugo... and what a wonderful medium film is when it is placed in the hands of an artist.

I took the family to see this and we were led to believe this was a fantastic fantasy adventure ( according to the previews ) It started slow, crawled along and fizzled at the end. Although it looked fantastic, with great acting, the story was weak an none existent. My 12 year old son fell asleep and my 7 year old daughter drifted in an out of concentration.Very frustrated. The only person who gave anything to this film was Mr Baron Cohen, truly a talented actor. We always make a big thing out of a trip to the cinema to see a film in the festive period. Apart from a bit of snow there was nothing festive about this film. I am truly amazed at the promotion of this film not since the blair witch have i been duped so much, i left the theatre feeling cheated and very annoyed, with two children that were less than impressed as wellStory oh my god what story !!!!!

Very long movie and not for children,"I've just come back from the movie. I checked the score of the movie on IMDb as always I do and I had lots of expectations before watching it.They did good job in some way however it was sooooooo boring and I am sure it cannot be a child movie. I would not take my child to this movie to torture him for more than 2 hours if I have one . Probably he would cry non-stop .Ben Kingsley was acting amazing as always, seeing Jude Law for 2 minutes was unforgettable (!).Acting : Done! Special Effects: Done! Music: Done! Visual: Done! Costume: Done! Story: No way! Excitement: No way!Still I do not understand how did it manage to get 8.5 from IMDb. I did not understand ( or I do not want to) the story. I thought the movie was about Hugo, but it was not?Do I feel regret to watch the movie? Yes..All I can say if you are a French ( there are lots of things about 30's Paris - some of them imaginary- in the movie) go and watch, otherwise simply stay at house!.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
As far as pure eye candy goes the movie is definitely a cinematic joy!,"'HUGO': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)Martin Scorsese tries his hand at 3D and kids' films with this 1930s adventure. It's an adaptation of the 2007 book 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret' by Brian Selznick about an orphan living in the walls of a Paris train station trying to solve a mysterious secret left to him by his deceased father. The screenplay was written by John Logan and the film stars Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer and Jude Law. The movie should captivate most children and the visuals are amazing but it's a little too slow paced and emotionally uninvolving to hold the attention of most moviegoers I'd say.Butterfield makes an impressive leading man as Hugo Cabret, an orphan who's father (Law, who we see only in flashbacks) left him a notebook and a nonfunctioning automation with a lock with no key. Hugo now lives in the walls of a Paris train station (in the 30s) fixing clocks and gets by through petty theft. One day he's busted trying to steal from the owner of a toy shop, Georges Melies (Kingsley), who in turn steals his notebook from him (along with all his stolen possessions). He befriends the toy shop owner's granddaughter, Isabelle (Moretz), in an attempt to win back his notebook and the two begin an adventure to solve his father's secret. While doing so they also must avoid the station inspector (Cohen) who loves snatching up orphans and sending them away to orphanages.Scorsese once again masters all the technical aspects of the film (especially the visuals and the 3D is amazing) but the characters and story left me wanting more. The acting is all outstanding but I found the film just a little too emotionally distant and couldn't really relate to any of the characters that much. The heart of the film is in the right place though and Scorsese perfectly captures the look and feel of a classic 1930s kids' film. Like I said I'm sure young children will be more than fascinated by the movie but older teens, as well as adults, will probably be a little bored. It is slow paced but there's always something wonderful to look at; as far as pure eye candy goes the movie is definitely a cinematic joy!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jXu8bs0LI9A",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's Like Nothing You've Ever Seen,"Just got home after watching HUGO, and boy, What a film! I don't think there are many films that have all the qualities of a masterpiece and yet you can enjoy it with the whole family and Hugo stands on top of any movie which may be (if ever possible) comparable. In my eyes, Hugo is Scorsese himself who is paying tribute to someone who has inspired many visionary filmmakers even after his life. This is a film that you remain in your seat and witness a mystery being unfold in the most artistic way where art, visual effects, music and 3D technology are serving the film, unlike most of the never ending so called 3D flicks which are made just to be high-tech and suffer lack of story and good directing. The acting is pretty good, Chloe Grace Mortez is as adorable as ever and Sacha Baron Cohen can always make you laugh no matter how serious he tries to look. Scorsese himself pops up in a short scene for a second just to remind us who actually stands behind the camera. I'm not a great fan of him, though loved Shutter Island and the Departed, but this one is just so different. I totally recommend it to anyone with any taste in movies.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Half and Half,"Who's the audience for Hugo? With roots in the fantasy/adventure genres and a comfortable color palette for the Harry Potter and Twilight crowds, ""preteen"" seems a safe bet. But it undergoes a metamorphosis around the midpoint that fixed my posture and put the kids to bed. Not that I'm complaining.The two halves of Hugo are at odds. In the first hour, we meet Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield – the spitting image of a prepubescent Malcolm MacDowell), an orphan and wee tinkerer living behind the walls of a Parisian train station circa 1930. He lives only to wind the clocks and scavenge parts for his prized automaton – a wrecked robot with sentimental ties to his late father (Jude Law). A chance encounter with a young girl (Chloë Moretz) may be the key to unlocking the secret of his antiquated android.In the second, Scorsese taps his inner film buff. Enter French silent filmmaker Georges Méliès, whose spectacular oddball A Trip to the Moon features prominently. Hugo posthumously honors the artist's under-appreciated oeuvre, complete with stunning recreations of his avant-garde genre flicks. The also-underrated Michael Stuhlbarg plays film historian Rene Tabard, a champion of Méliès' lost legacy.Somehow, the story of a boy and his robot and the redemption of a brilliant, misunderstood artist mesh, if reluctantly. I can't feign complete enthusiasm for Hugo's by-the-numbers fantasy beginning, but loved the playful manipulation of art history it preceded. Conversely, I imagine the general audience will go for the ""Once Upon A Time,"" but neither know nor care who Méliès is. Some may walk away none the wiser to the elements of nonfiction.Unifying Hugo's disparate halves are gorgeous storybook visuals bolstered by inspired use of 3D tech. Action sequences up the gee-whiz factor, but Scorsese's most compelling use of the gimmick is also among his most subtle; touches like adding the effect to Méliès' films has the revelatory effect of making history come alive. And it doesn't carry the stink of desperation that accompanies Disney and Star Wars' conversions. As a magician who embraced every trick in the book, Méliès would have loved 3D.Another constant is the caliber of the performances. The principals are solid, and Hugo is packed with veteran character actors who breathe vibrant life into their world. Folks like Ray Winstone as Hugo's Drunken Uncle, Ben Kingsley as a shopkeeper with a secret, Christopher Lee as a kindhearted librarian, and Sacha Baron Cohen as the bumbling station inspector help even the one-dimensional roles shine.Pushing himself while pushing 70, you have to admire Scorsese's dogged tenacity. The director won his long-belated Best Director Oscar in 2007 for The Departed, which seems to have freed him from falling into an Eastwood-esque downward spiral; first with the psychological thriller Shutter Island, and now with the unabashed fantasy, Hugo. That jarring juxtaposition is just one factor in obfuscating who its audience is supposed to be.Diplomatically, the new Martin Scorsese picture aims to please everyone, but divides more than it unites. Parents may be left twiddling their thumbs during the first drama-lite hour, and kids may nod off during the second half history lesson. However, for a particular breed of cinephile, Hugo is magic – a love letter to film from a master of the medium. Scorsese's adoration is tangible – not for Georges Méliès specifically – but for artists both great and small. It's sublime. It's beautiful. But bring a pillow.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo,"This year a blossoming homage to the genesis of the film industry has progressed into raptures for film aficionados and filmmakers (two front-runners of the imminent Oscar, THE ARTIST, which I have yet to watch, and HUGO have aimed at B&W silent film and innovator Georges Méliès respectively). Martin Scorsese stews this $170,000,000 budgeted 1930s Paris Gare Montparnasse train station adventure feature in an almost immaculate way, and for the generation which may not be stupefied by Georges Méliès' A TRIP TO THE MOON (Le voyage dans la lune 1902), for sure they will worship Hugo as a pristine monumental milestone for the new era of film business. I saw it in a 2D version and plan to watch the 3D version inconveniently double-bespectacledly.Don't be deceived by its fairytale sphere, a PG rating for Scorsese is a soft ball and none like any other adult-prone masterpieces. But the thrill and tension is still copious and similar to another gem of my 2011 9-out-of-10 league THE ADVENTURES OF TINTIN, both represent the paramount expectation from a true film master to bake a nutritious meal which is able to assuage everyone's appetite, and both Scorsese and Spielberg have done that this year!Juxtaposing with fellow New Yorker Woody Allen's love letter to Paris (MIDNIGHT IN Paris 2011). Scorsese has accomplished a more imposing one to the witchcraft of the whole film system at its very beginning, which embodies in the up-and-down career of Georges Méliès, and it accompanies Hugo and us to the journey of the pure magic.The retro-setting of the train station is majestic and jaw-dropping, and Howard Shore's fluently enchanting score is the cream of 2011, but a colossal budget has impeded its Oscar's path since its lackluster box office, $61,911,429 so far (which I cannot figure out the reason why? A mishap of a Christmas season decision?) signifies that it will never be profitable and even impractical to make ends meet. And another Achilles heel is it bears zero acting nomination, which I put Asa Butterfield in my leading actor category (2nd to George Clooney so far) and he delivers his grit magnificently in his feeble appearance, as for Ben Kingsley, not as splendid as I hoped, at least he sits comfortably above Jonah Hill from MONEYBALL in my supporting actor list.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Charming Movie,"I loved this movie. The cast, characters and acting are so good. Thank you Martin Scorsese. It deserves the awards that it won, in my eyes. I have seen it twice. Totally delightful, enchanting. In every aspect it was stellar, story was layered and complex with casting and performances hitting every possible correct note exquisitely. Its set is absolutely stunning, cinematography is just gorgeous, sound tracks are perfect match.While the artist is charming, novel, and well done, the story is utterly simplistic and predictable, it was too long and became a bit tedious and for me, like most not worthy of a second viewing. The help is a lovely story with strong performances but does not approach the extraordinary complexity of magnificence on every level that is Hugo.It is a movie that needs to be appreciated for its finer aspects and deeper meaning if it is to be appreciated properly, which is noble enough but could feel exclusive to some. Hugo was one of those movies that you don't mind watching year after year. You'll hear something you missed or see something new each time. Brilliant acting, directing and overall inspiring. The movie with all it's inherent magic has won every honor that I as an artist can present to it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A classic unlike Scorcese's earlier work,"How often do you see Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley in the same movie. It happened to me in a single week. How often do you see Chloe Grace Mortez play her age. Only once and this was it. And finally, what about Martin Scorcese doing a children based movie that too a 3D one. Now that I have established it is a crazy combination packaged as a classical movie, how was it implemented is the final question. Awesome!! Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who is covering for his uncle keying clocks at a railway station in Paris. He is passionate about a Droid the last thing he and his father (played by Jude Law) worked on. Hugo meets and makes friends with Isabelle (Chloe) who is being raised by George (Kingsley) and his wife and he has a mysterious past related both to movies and the Droid living a sad life. Putting into this mix is the Station Master (Cohen) with a limp who is by the book and determined to catch Hugo and also is in love with Lisette.It is an epic story spanning decades of achievements, determination, hope and innocence. Though not watched in the format, 3D does not seem forced. Screenplay is neat, background score majestic, cinematography and editing are done in a way the filmmaker knew what he wanted. Chloe does a tremendous job in pushing innocence and maturity to Hugo's character that complements well to the story.A classic unlike Scorcese's earlier work",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magnificent steampunk meets David Copperfield in Cinema Paradiso,"Hugo is a standout. Nothing I've seen competes with the visuals on show here ... if the plot had been limited to a reading of the telephone book I'd still watch it happily. However and fortunately, and despite some of the incomprehensibly negative reviews posted earlier, the storyline was engaging and satisfying: not sophisticated and not subtle but just right for the extraordinary, magical steampunk world Scorcese has created in 1930's Paris.The evocation of the days when you could see and feel how machines worked (so, steam and clockwork) and its presentation in 3D was sublime, staggering, entrancing. The intricacy of the mechanisms, the beauty of the metal and patterns in gears, grates, railings and steps, the lighting, colour palette, size and scale were enough to make this memorable, but the extra sense of involvement made possible by a near-perfect use of 3D technology raises this to another level, a masterpiece.We were engrossed from start to finish, luxuriating in the created world while following the story with interest and hope and absorbing the film's unsubtle but moving messages about purpose, belonging and the wonder of films and illusion.Don't see this on DVD and don't see it in 2D; it's a big-screen must. I'm not normally a fan of 3d (gloomy and gimmicky) but for this film it's essential, as is the scale of a real cinema screen.Fabulous.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Clockworks, or the invention of dreams among clocks","Consider a movie about a mechanical man who draws a picture from inner heart, once unlocked with the right key.Consider this picture one of many unlocked from a box and fluttering around in a room. Motion pictures that guide vision.And consider a boy - adept at fixing things - who will have to quite literally discern the mechanisms that shape pictures into a narrative and that time beats at the heart of them. And all of this as our movie about the invention of dreams.And before we're lost in the gaudy swirl of impossible dreams, visions, movies, daredevil escapades, misty-eyed wonders, sweeping CGI vistas, nostalgic lushness, sparkling metallic gadgetry, and earthly artificiality of 1930's Paris, consider the simplest premise: a movie about an old man who even unbeknownst to him has devised the mechanics that will generate a narrative that restores dreams and hope. This is a remarkable idea in how it has been visualized by referencing cinema, one that at least in my eyes vindicates Scorsese's several missteps as of late.Oh, it is a little heavy-handed at times. A little heavy with emotion. And a little unimaginative when you'd expect it to, notably the climax on the clock. But it's an erudite work of someone who's been building clocks all his life, has mastered the art in his own way big or small, and now wants to tell you about the function of time.Now the first generation of filmmakers were actual inventors, engineers, optical scientists. Quickly it passed into the hands of artisans usually from less than respectable art: vaudeville, the circus, popular theater, the magic show. What joyrides we've had since. A more important function as it turned out, was that images drawn from thin air into a film strip had the capacity to mend and purify in novel ways. The only thing asked from us, was that we shed self and be a part of them for how long it took.Scorsese's wonderful trick is that instead of giving us fantasy that ordinarily affects with smoke and mirrors, he makes the actual plot of the film about what it means to stage the trick. This way we get to note how the thing tics, the actual function. What the mirror mirrors. In our case, several iconic images of early cinema.So, our film is about this man who first engineered illusions, contraptions for dreaming. One of these is a mechanical man, stored away and forgotten. Years later, father and son dust it out from an attic broken and work hard to decipher its mechanism. Father dies and kid goes to move inside a giant clock hovering above a train station, where tracks of life disperse the narratives. His own is an adventure that sets in motion the wheels and chains of the world in such a way as to redeem the old inventor and fix, restore the purpose of dreaming. This is given to us as the actual restoration of his films and playing before an audience, a clever wink.To think that in many quarters this has been received at face value, as a movie about kids, or as just a love letter! It boggles the mind with how little delicacy some people handle films. The famous Lumiere short about a train arriving at station is enacted at one point, and as a dream (within a dream).

Good but It Should Have Been Great,"I am astonished at the praise this film is receiving. While I am very pleased that this is bringing much needed attention to the Great George Melies and his oeuvre, I wonder if I saw the same film others seem to have.Yes, the film employs the best use of 3D to date though I wish there had been more scenes relating to Melies' cinematic work. The problems with this film is that the story takes forever to unfold and then really goes nowhere. Every moment that should have been heart tugging was really quite void of emotional buildup and anti-climatic.I appreciate the fact that this is an ode not only to Melies, but to early cinema and all its wondrous melodramatic story lines. The poor orphaned boy. The bitter old man who finally opens up his heart and home. The villain who could ruin everything for the boy. All this and more are situations that should cause anticipation, longing, and hope in an audience but due to Scorsese's mechanical approach to these plot elements they are rendered emptily. Perhaps I expected too much. A story about George Melies. The Great Martin Scorsese who not only is a gifted auteur but a great cinephile whose childhood imagination must have been rife with vivid cinematic inspirations. It truly is not a classic but a grand footnote to what cinema once was and still should be.The acting is quite uneven. The gifted Sacha Baron Cohen is off key throughout. Ben Kingsley is a great actor but somehow is not convincing as Melies. Perhaps this is due to the fact that these characters really belong in a silent film from decades past, acted by those used to methods employed due to the constraints of early filmmaking. As we venture more rapidly into our future, we seem to be continually trying to hold on to the past more and more rather than finding new frontiers to explore.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
unique Martin Scorsese movie,"Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in a Paris train station.

He was killed in a fire. Papa Georges confiscates Hugo's notebook and threatens to burn it. Papa Georges is hiding a secret past and forbids Isabelle from seeing any movies.This is one of the most unique Martin Scorsese movie. The kids are great. The visuals are gorgeous. Scorsese is doing something completely out of his realm. At first, Ben Kingsley is playing a very mean-spirited man. As the movie develops, it becomes evident that this man is broken from his connection to the movie industry. It's probably something that is fascinating to Scorsese.

Couldn't wait for it to end - so dull!,"I saw this film yesterday. I didn't see it in 3D and it seems many of the reviews below are saying that the 3D effects are good but really a film should be watchable in 2D as well if it is worth watching. I was interested for the first 15 minutes and after that it was like watching paint dry. The script was unrealistic, the acting of the two young characters was bad, but worse of all is the plot - it is barely there so the whole film is padded out with pointless little stories and scenes. Also, the whole film is incredibly over-sentimental. It is rare a film is so dull that I consider leaving a cinema before the film has ended but I seriously considered it, and several people in the cinema did walk out early so it can't just be me!

In his attempt to get it back, he meets a young girl and together they find out that there is more to this toy maker than what meets the eye. Throughout the first hour, I wasn't sure where it all was going but everything couldn't have come together in a more enjoyable or astounding way.

491st Review: intriguing but not involving enough?,"Hugo is beautifully made with some fabulous shots that show the complexity of CGI and imagination - and reconstruct in beautiful details the interior of a Paris railway station in 1930. It is a film that should be about cinema and our love of cinema, but, excepting the final twenty minutes never really engages us in that love.We sensed a lost opportunity here to create some real magic that was lost in its determination to tell the story of Hugo and not to tell the really interesting story that lies behind it. We really like the two child stars and Ben Kingsley is excellent - the fault lies in frankly spreading an idea too thin.All in all, this should be a film about why we love cinema, the art form of the 20th century so much, about how it takes us to other worlds so wonderfully, but Hugo never quite captures that sense of wonder and instead we are stuck at the station waiting for a train that never arrives.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The words often give way to the pictures and, if you allow it, the pictures will take you deeply into the story. It is good to be over seventy and have experienced movies before they became all action, movement and noise. We were educated to wait and enjoy the trip to the end. It is wonderful to get wrapped up in the world of Hugo and to enjoy the tender conclusion it brings. Thanks Martin and all the cast and crew. You should have won it all.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese's Love Letter,"Martin Scorsese has never, and will never, make a bad film. The worst you could say of his filmography is that some are masterpieces while the rest are merely satisfactory. Having said that, 'Hugo', his first foray into the world of three dimensions, is nothing we haven't seen before by any lesser director.It's being put about that 'Hugo' is some kind of magical adventure story, full of intrigue and excitement, perfect for children over the festive period. It isn't. It's not even a kids' film. It's actually Scorsese's love letter to film and nothing more. The things we have come to the maestro with – film preservation, explicating the possibility of cinema – are so embedded in the story that anything Hugo and co. say or do is rendered irrelevant. Film itself becomes the adventure.Using Brian Selznick's story, 'The Invention of Hugo Cabret', Scorsese presents us with a character – the famed Georges Méliès, pioneer of early cinema, maker of more than five hundred shorts – who could easily be Scorsese himself.Selznick's story is about an orphaned boy named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), who is made to work in a Parisian train station after his clockmaker father (Jude Law) dies in a fire. Hugo's drunkard uncle (Ray Winstone), the station's clock operator, becomes his guardian. The uncle goes off to drink while Hugo stays in the walls of the station, clandestinely keeping the clocks working.Hugo's father died unable to finish fixing an automaton. Completing this project becomes Hugo's mission. In the film, as in the book and in real life, Méliès (Ben Kingsley) lives the last part of his life bitter and depressed as a toy merchant in the train station. His path crosses Hugo's and the two establish themselves as mutual foes. Hugo finds a friend (his only) in Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), goddaughter to Méliès. The two of them set about completing the automaton, to find out what secrets it may hold. Without revealing the plot, the automaton is the thing which brings us back to Méliès.Although the story is set in Paris (we know this because we see the Eiffel tower every time we're outside), we hear only English voices. Some of the supporting actors seem nothing more than set decoration; I'm not sure why they're there. There's the standard of computer graphics we've come to expect, but youngsters will want more than aerial images of an apocryphal Paris. (I would have asked a youngster what they thought, but everyone in the audience, without exception, was an adult.)You shouldn't be too tough on kids; they've got adulthood for criticism, but Butterfield is not up to the task of leading a Scorsese picture. The same goes for Moretz (who was terrific in 'Let Me In'). Sacha Baron Cohen is inconsistently funny as the merciless train station inspector hell-bent on capturing and sending Hugo to an orphanage. You can't blame the man. He's created some of the funniest characters of all time, so it's only downhill from now on, I'm afraid. The only sequences which are interesting, if not special, are the montage sequences of film footage from days gone by.Scorsese isn't just good for giving us gangster flicks; of course he's not. He made 'The King of Comedy', 'Taxi Driver', and 'The Last Temptation of Christ'. Not one of them featured a single Italian (except De Niro), let alone a mobster. All I'm saying is there's a reason why we all want to him to keep it gangster.www.moseleyb13.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I have never been to France and so I have absolutely no personal experience to draw on. When I was at school several decades ago (but later than the 1930s date of the action in Hugo) I was always taught that the French used twenty-four hour clocks.

The lost pieces from novel are forgiven grace of gentle art of details. For the acting and circles of events, for the metaphors and delicate nuances. A fabulous work for recreate a world and, most important, its essence. A homage for a pioneer of cinema and one of great role for Ben Kingsley. The Christmas Eve atmosphere is perfect. A film as a dream. And forest of a mythical forest.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A near perfect ode to cinema, which will influence many young storytellers","Released around Christmas last year, my visit at home over the holiday season enabled me to sit down in front of the fire with my family and 3D glasses and finally catch-up with Martin Scorsese's Oscar-winning film. It could have been the morning afternoon mulled wine, but we all absolutely adored it.Based on the kid's book by Brian Selznick, Hugo is an imaginative retelling of cinematic history for new, perhaps uninitiated audiences.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the labyrinthine walls of a Parisian train station in the 1930s. He spends his days sneaking croissants from bakers, winding the station's clocks to keep them ticking accordingly and hiding the po-faced station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), who gets a kick from throwing troublesome kids off to the local orphanage.Keeping one of his father's (Jude Law, in flashbacks) most-loved hobbies alive, Hugo spends his free time fixing old automaton, swiping gears and parts from the a station toymaker called Georges (Ben Kingsley). After the crotchety Georges catches Hugo one day, the boy begins discovering eerie connections between Georges and his father, connections that lead him and his curious friend Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), to uncover the forgotten stories of cinema's inception.It may sound like a simple adventure story, but Hugo is much more than that. Behind the child angst is Scorsese' ode to cinema's first real auteur as, quickly enough, we discover that Kingsley's disgruntled shop clerk Georges is none other than cinema wizard Georges Méliès. Of course, that will mean nothing to most audiences, but throw in some archive footage of the iconoclastic 1902 short feature A Trip to The Moon and audiences of all cinephilic levels can't help but be enthralled.His first foray into 3D filmmaking, Scorsese's Paris is something to behold. It's a world painted with vivacious broad strokes balanced with steampunk locomotives and 1930s smoke. A harmonious juxtaposition of beauty and tragedy which coloured Méliès' own life.Instead of a elegiacal portrait, Hugo is an uproarious celebration of the cinema of attractions. The performances are delightful, particularly Butterfield and the ""Jennifer Lawrence in-the-wings"" Moretz. Ben Kingsley is unsurprisingly great, and even Cohen shows himself to be a competent actor outside the outlandish shock-cock films like Bruno and The Dictator.Backed up by the magnificent visuals of DP Robert Richardson and Howard Shore's swooping score, Scorsese's picture is not just an intelligent, fun-for-all-the-family fable, it's a movie which will inspire the young filmmakers of tomorrow.More reviews at www.366movies.com",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Genius Is Rediscovered in HUGO,"Martin Scorsese has a deep love for movie history and film preservation. Both passions are imbued in Hugo, a charming tale of a child's personal search that leads to a treasure of memories and redemption.At a Paris train station in 1931 a young boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives a solitary existence. The train inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lurks about looking for stray children to send to the local orphanage. One day Hugo notices an elderly watchmaker (Ben Kingsley) who sits lonely and silent. Joined by a curious girl, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the two join forces to investigate the old man and learn that there is much more to him than meets the eye. Add to this a mysterious mechanical man built by Hugo's father and known as an automaton whose cryptic writings may provide clues to the past. But how to unlock these secrets? What the young couple finds will lead them back to the old man as there seem to be a surprising connection, and through the old man, a remarkable past is rejuvenated that will harken back to the birth of movies.As the mysterious, old man, Ben Kingsley provides the gravitas to flesh out a character that at first seems dull and lonely, whose past catches up and reveals a lifetime of hope and genius heretofore forgotten by the public until Hugo and Isabelle rediscover it. The kids are well cast although Hugo comes across a bit of an oddball whereas Isabelle is a sweet girl who compliments him. Cohen, quite effective in a villainous role, is properly mean and threatening until he has a change of heart near the end, and you wish there had been more of him because his character evolves toward the end.In fact the whole heart concept permeates Hugo. There is the budding love between Hugo and Isabelle, the old man's romance in his past, and even the hint of love from a flower girl. There is the heart shaped key that unlocks the automaton's mechanism. The automaton serves as a static character, a kind of Pinocchio in scenes where Hugo talks to it in the absence of his father. Above all, it's all about a love for movies past and present.It is clear how much Scorsese loves movies in smaller, intimate scenes as when Hugo and Isabelle sneak into a Harold Lloyd film or when he shows snippets from earlier moving images. The main thrust of Hugo's plot provides Scorsese the excuse to restage classic kinescope and film clips. It's like reliving history. Film buffs will love these moments as Scorsese lovingly and painstakingly recreates early silent film. We see history and magic being made simultaneously! A minor problem with the film is that it feels a bit uneven at times, and you never feel fully engaged with the characters as much as you want to be. Hugo and his friend Isabelle should be the focus all the way, but the film seems to occasionally stray from their journey. As a couple, they are more tentative and reserved than Harry Potter and his friend Hermione in the Harry Potter series. It lacks a strong emotional center. One wonders how a director like Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton would have interpreted the story.Technical and production quality are superb. This is a fully realized fantasy world especially with the overall design and art direction and costumes within the train station and immediate neighborhood. Even the visual effects work well within the story without being a distraction.The film does works for both children and adults. Hugo in a way represents the painful and joyous past that people keep hidden until it is released by patience and love.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One in the eye for Scorsese,"My, how movies have progressed since Georges Melies time. In his age he composed and filmed good hearted nonsense in days, while Martin Scorsese takes an age with a long film to pay homage to the great man and his works with his own film nonsense. It's tremendously stylish and even lavish but mainly cgi cartoonery and with 3D made redundant on an ordinary TV set, coupled with a tortuously inane plot. Great for kids over 10 though!Young boy living in gargantuan cartoon railway terminal winding the clocks is fixated on fixing an automaton which he is apparently convinced could send him a message from his dead father. When it comes it sends the film and us in a new (old) direction and makes one wonder if his father was having a laugh. It's very well done although with a few puzzling visuals and very well acted although with a few emotional non-sequiturs, an impressive mix borrowing from Wallace & Gromit, Modern Times, and even Dead Of Night where the automaton's name was Hugo. This is a film for youngsters who might appreciate the history but mainly for adults who think they know the history. Does it work? Well, I enjoyed it as a one off, a harmless expense of two hours time but probably never to be repeated. It helps to have an appreciation not only of the history but of his works too – sadly something along with the reading of Noddy books I was never able to accomplish or miss. For me, the clock had always ticked too long.A two minute Melies or a two hour Scorsese? That is the question.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
fantastic fantasy film for those who don't take life too seriously,"Well after seeing a few stinging critics give the film a big knockdown i was almost put off seeing it, but i checked their other reviews and saw what they considered a good film and realised i have vastly different tastes to them, so i went and watched it and glad i did. At 2hrs long i was expecting it to drag more but it didn't, the cinematography was fantastic, the story itself was light but enjoyable, doesn't take itself too seriously.....i think some people have just been to see this film knowing they wont like it so they can come away complaining about how it didn't do what it said on the label So yes OK Baron-Cohens accent was a bit out of place, i'm not sure if he was intentionally doing a John Cleese impression but thats how it came across - something a bit more french and cleaseuesque would have been appropriate but after i got used to it his humour was OK. The children were a little bit wooden in parts maybe but nowhere as near as bad as frodo in LOTR which lots of people didn't mind or notice at the time - so yep we're all different and see things differently and me and my gf both enjoyed this film, not sure how it will look in 2D though.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but could have been great,"This is a good film, as demonstrated by many of the reviews below. But it could have been great. The imagery, core story and 3D features are very well done. But watching the film, I kept getting annoyed by the constant clichés and odd plot choices.For instances, why in a French setting are most of the actors English and American? The constant mix of accents is annoying. There is even a scene where they are reading a French book, but in English.There is the drunk uncle, innocent flower girl, mean inspector, odd romance between two completely superfluous characters in the train station. So many of these characters and their roles seemed like add-ons at best.Finally, I wish they had cast another kid in the lead role. I didn't find the choice to be particularly believable or interesting. I still give this film a 7/10, which tells you how good are some of the other elements, but it could have been a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Chix Chat on Film review: Lives collide in a French train station.,"Since I was not familiar with the book, I can't say that I was excited about Hugo, nor was I anxiously awaiting its release, what I was feeling was curiosity about the story's plot and how would the story be handled by Martin Scorsese given that I knew it was nothing like the films he had previously directed. I sat through the first half hour of this film with absolutely no idea where it was going, I soon saw some familiar faces playing in some key roles George Melies (Ben Kingsley), the Station Inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen), Hugo's Father (Jude Law) and amazingly Monsier Labisse (Christopher Lee). I simply applaud Mr. Lee's career, he is truly a marvel to behold, I remember as a child being scared witless by him as Dracula which was filmed before I was born, later for him to be a part of the Star Wars prequels and as the White Wizard Saruman in the Lord of the Rings trilogy it just boggles my mind that he is still delivering great performances in great films and now for my own children to see and appreciate him in these roles. Not to take anything away for the two young actors who basically carry this film, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) and Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). Their on screen interaction was very enthralling. I truly hope that they both see long and fruitful careers as has Mr. Lee. So now that I have done exactly as this film did, and have taken forever to get to the point. I will say that this was a really good story about how the lives of a famed French film maker and a young boy intersect. I did find it amusing that the young protagonists were reading a French book in perfect English, but I'm sure that bit of movie magic was for the benefit of the American audience. I was totally on edge during the scene from the movie poster with Hugo hanging from the clock hand. That scene and many others throughout this story were interesting, provocative and actually did elicit the excitement that I initially lacked in relation to this movie. This film was a visual gem, the opening scene was a cinematic treat. Even with the lengthy start to develop the story, which took more time than I thought was necessary to get to the meat of the story, this is a lovely film for adults who can appreciate the art of film making as do I. It gets a well deserved green light.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Can't Argue with Its Message, Even If I Didn't Warm Much to the Movie","Martin Scorsese takes a stab at making a film children can enjoy, and the results are.....mixed.If the entire film had been as enchanting as the first five minutes, ""Hugo"" would really have been something special. As it is, it's infused with a love of cinema, and particularly the joy to be found in discovering and preserving the history of the art form. And for that reason alone, I, an avid movie buff myself, am thrilled that this film exists. However, I didn't find myself warming to it all that much in any other regard. It's a bit slow and one-note -- the loneliness of Hugo, the little boy at the film's center, is brought home adequately within the film's first fifteen minutes, but it's another hour or so of movie before the plot progresses past that. Frankly, it's a bit grueling to watch a little boy missing his dead father for an hour. Once the meat of the film begins to develop, and Hugo and his friend discover that they are in the company of none other than film pioneer Geroges Melie (played by Ben Kingsley), the love of cinema comes practically pouring off of the screen and things improve somewhat.Still, there is a lot of business involving Sacha Baron Cohen and other denizens of the train station in which Hugo lives and which serves as the film's principal setting that is tiresome. Cohen plays his character like he's a villain from an animated Disney movie, which is completely incongruous with the rest of the film, and wonderful actors like Emily Mortimer, Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour are introduced only to torment us with the fact that they are given barely any screen time and nothing to do with the time they're given.""Hugo"" looks lovely, and if you're going to see a 3-D movie this would be the one. But I've decided I could do without 3-D. The technology supposedly brings a heightened level of realism to the film-going experience, but I always find that it does just the opposite; things looks unnatural and awkwardly placed in relation to one another.Grade: B+",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo: A Waking Dream,"Ask any film buff walking down the street who Martin Scorsese is, and they're likely to respond with something along the lines of ""living legend"" or to mention Taxi Driver, Raging Bull or Goodfellas, perhaps the occasional After Hours or The Departed. With roughly half a century of filmmaking under his belt, the director has become revered for his dark, uncompromising looks into the human psyche, often focusing on seedy or morally ambiguous protagonists. Therefore, the news that his next project after the twisty, B-movie homage Shutter Island would be a kid-friendly fantasy, in 3D no less, was greeted with understandable skepticism by the film world. Despite its enormous departure from his usual tone and material, the result, however, feels like arguably the most personal of Scorsese's many works. Joining a host of other films from this year suffused with nostalgia, Hugo is a giddy, mischievous romp through 1930s Paris steadied by the confident hand of a master who not only knows his craft inside and out but is also madly, hopelessly, infectiously in love with it.That adoration permeates through every aspect of the movie, from the breezy performances and tone to the absolutely stunning visuals and the love letter to Georges Melies and silent films, an ode that might have come off as ham-handed had its intentions not been so blatantly earnest and pure. Indeed, there is an innocence to Hugo that is all the more surprising when compared to the gritty realism of the rest of Scorsese's oeuvre. It celebrates the magic and joys of cinema with childlike wonder, allowing the audience to get swept up in much the same way that the story's two young protagonists, Hugo and Isabel, are when they sneak into a theater to watch an old Harold Lloyd comedy, the way audiences were when the first moving picture came out and viewers ducked and screamed because they thought the train in the film was going to hit them. In spite of the decidedly 21st-century technology used to make the movie (though it must be noted that Hugo boasts the best use of modern 3D in a chiefly live-action film so far, as even Avatar used as much CGI and animation as live-action), Hugo feels cheerfully old-fashioned, featuring long sequences without dialogue, including the remarkable opening sequence, and a wonderful score by Howard Shore that not only evokes the proper setting, but the entire feel of that era; you can easily imagine hearing it over a Charlie Chaplin or Buster Keaton film. Also refreshing is the strictly platonic but heartfelt relationship between Hugo, an orphan who has lived in the Paris Nord train station since his father died in a fire and has a natural instinct to fix things, and Isabel, the god-daughter of a crotchety, old man who runs a toy shop in the station. They exude naiveté but are not dumb or overly cute, treated by the filmmakers with the same respect accorded the adults in the story.Another running trend through this year in film, in addition to the strong currents of nostalgia, has been the unusually strong performances from kids or teens, from the gang in Super 8 to Hunter McCracken in The Tree of Life and Kerris Dorsey in Moneyball. Though the youngsters here aren't necessarily the most impressive entries into that list, they both hold their own against their more seasoned costars. Asa Butterfield is passable as Hugo, able to convincingly play the character as both a lonely misfit and a smart kid who has learned quickly how to take care of himself, though there are moments when his emotions feel more forced and artificial than truly organic. However, it is Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabel who shines, radiating warmth, sincerity and a charming sweetness, a performance that is a far cry from her breakout role as the foul-mouthed Hit Girl in Kick-Ass; in the year since that movie came out, she has shown incredible range and, in Hugo, only further establishes that she is one of the most talented young actresses working today. Among the supporting players, a solid if eclectic group, Ben Kingsley, who portrays Georges Melies, seems likely to attract the most accolades, but perhaps the most surprising performance comes from Sasha Baron Cohen, who suggests here that he's capable of more than you'd think judging from Borat.However, despite some notable performances and a lovely script, it is the visuals that bring Hugo to life. Normally when someone says the visuals are the most impressive aspect of a film, they're referring to CGI-and-F/X bonanzas, and it's usually a criticism, suggesting that such technical proficiency only serves to distract from uninteresting characters or a weak plot, but Hugo shows that this doesn't always have to be the case and that it's not always a bad thing when set design or special effects steal the show. The period sets and costumes are flawless, feeling authentic with a slight touch of whimsy that adds to the film's fantastical, dreamlike atmosphere, and the many shots overlooking Paris are simply breathtaking. Scorsese creates a world that feels completely real, even when it clearly isn't, so much so that there's a dream sequence that audiences likely won't recognize as a dream until it is nearly over. It is a world where magic is real and dreams come to life, and it is this sensibility that makes Hugo such a stirring tribute to not just old, silent movies, but cinema as a whole, and to the power of the imagination.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wouldn't call it a kids movie,"So I watched this movie in ordinary 2D the other day. The only reason I can imagine this film being labeled a kids movie is because it was shot in 3D.If I was a kid I probably would have hated this movie, it would've bored me to death. But alas I am no longer a child and I really, really enjoyed it.Chloe Grace Moertz, Sacha Baron Cohen and Ben Kingsley were superb. The story line was at times slow but clever and helped along by the performances of all the actors.In summary, if you at all enjoyed the movie The Expendables then do not watch this movie, if you are a child under the age of 10 also do not watch this movie. However if you are over the age of 10 and did not enjoy The Expendables or the sequel then there is hope for you. Watch it!!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
lose mom. lose dad. lose love and hope?  NO!,"there are two orphans in this movie, one lovable is Hugo, one to be easily hated, or at least disliked is the station inspector, amazingly played by no other than Sasha Baron Cohen. it takes some serious effort to feel empathy to the inspector, even when his circumstances become clearer in the course of the movie. did i say he acts amazingly? i mean it.Asa Butterfield as Hugo (14, with few achievements on his belt, the most noticeable one being The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas) is amazing, charming, kid that you want to hug and do whatever you can to make his life happier, easier, with more love and warmth. no wonder he is the chosen Ender Wiggin (Ender's Game to be released in March 2013).why only a seven? first of all, the movie is too long for its scope. 15-20 minutes should have been left on the editing studio floor, to everyone's benefit. secondly, some characters are under developed, and the losers are us. Helen McCrory is one good example, in Mama Jeanne's role, is a great actress, with strong presence and charisma. Mama Jeanne however, is a quiet enabler, allowed to do her best acting with facial expressions mostly. i wanted more, and i believe the movie would have benefited from it. thirdly, the story, while being predominantly Hugo's story, is enhanced by supporting stories of other lonely people such as the inspector, the flower girl, the caf'e's owner... all want love, most still have hope. some develop as predictably as sunrise followed by a sunset. others develop with charm and warmth that add great value to the story. i wish they were ALL treated with the same sensitivity and insight demonstrated for the few. last, some characters are too flat, with an implied hint of depth, that is not delivered on. such is Christopher Lee as Monsieur Labisse, the bookshop owner. we know there's more, but it's not there. so a good solid 7 - GO of course. GO!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical Fun,"This is a rarity - a film that both pays homage to film and is enjoyable for ALL ages. It is more of an adult story, of losing childhood and the passion which following your dreams entails, but it never feels too mature, a testament to Scorsese's determination to make a family film.This is a genre- less film, and to some degree it is Oscar bait, although it will probably fall just short of a slight more 'artistic' movie, but this movie is pure film-making in every sense of the word. One of the better movies of 2011, but this shouldn't be surprising to anyone familiar with Scorsese's versatility.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A visually appealing film but the pacing is too slow,"This film is about an orphan who tries to fix an automaton, hoping to find a secret message from his late father.""Hugo"" is visually impressive. With its fairytale like backdrop, saturated colours and beautiful lighting, ""Hugo"" looks so fantastic that it is almost too photo-shopped to be true.The story is far too slow, and not very engaging. The story contains a little fantasy, friendship and pieces of hopes and dreams. Yet, none of these elements are developed well enough to blossom into a beautiful subplot. Maybe it is because I felt bored by the slow pacing, I could not get into the worlds of Hugo or George. It would have been beautiful to see their traumatised worlds harmonise in even more scenes.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
1920's Paris comes to life,"This is a wonderful story about a boy, Hugo, who fixes and maintains the clocks in a Paris railway station after his father dies and leaves him an orphan. With the help of a young girl, Isabelle, they set about finding out the story of an old toymaker, Georges Melies, the young girl's father. In actual fact there are many story lines in this movie, many threads that are followed, and the way Scorsese ties them all together is wonderful. If I had any criticism it is that the actual story takes a while to get moving. In fact until about half way I wasn't sure where the story was going, which story was the main thread. If this was Scorsese's intention then the second half made it all worthwhile and I will certainly enjoy the whole movie on a second viewing. But I was a little bewildered for the first hour. I again commend the director for producing a wonderful movie without bad language, sex or gratuitous violence.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo (2011),"Scorsese departs from the norm with a brilliantly magical family film about a lonely boy who lives in a train station. Left an orphan, the boy is recruited by his boozy uncle to manage the station clocks, and wanders into an adventure that delves wonderfully into the charming world of early cinema. Child actors Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz provide strong and endearing performances, and Ben Kingsley is knockout as usual. Strong cinematography, script, and editing bring the whole piece together, and somehow retains an enthralling atmosphere despite the relaxed pacing of the film. A certain level of ultra-innocence is present (as expected) from a filmmaker who rarely deals with the genre. Overall, certainly one of the more exceptional films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting...,"In all honesty, I wish they never made this movie. Hugo is such a good book, that no movie could compare with it. If you think of it separately from the book, you will very likely enjoy this movie a lot more. Another problem is that most of the book takes place in Hugo mind, which can be hard to portray in a movie.The movie of Hugo does not have as much depth as the original book, but it definitely had some. The special effects were great. Hugo is such a hard book to turn into a movie, and although it wasn't spectacular, they made it into a pretty good movie that is interesting to watch. Over all i give this film a 7 out of 10. The acting was passable. Asa butterfield was the best i've ever seen him, however i wan not impressed with chloe grace moretz.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A Ribbon of Dreams,"There are only seven or eight American directors now working who can be called true artists, visionary auteur's with a signature. They are Paul Thomas Anderson, Terrence Malick,Clint Eastwood, The Coen Brothers( who I treat at a single directorial intelligence), David Lynch, Steven Spielberg(despite his flaws), maybe Spike Jonze, and above all, Martin Scorsese. Martin has done four classic gangster movies, a (flawed) musical, documentaries, a brilliant, under-rated costume drama, two startling religious epics, two brilliant biopics about gifted, tormented men, a Hitchcockian thriller, and two superb black comedies, one of which ( After Hours) almost out-Lynches Lynch.). Admittedly, He has not yet done a War Movie or a Western. ( Though I would not count out either as possibilities.) Another genre he has not touched is the children's film. He has made two PG rated films, The Age Of Innocence and Kundun, but neither could be called a kids film. Now, Scorsese has made a children's film. Even more incredibly, he has made a 3-d children's film that is also a period film, and he has hit the ball out of the park. As a cinematic achievement- indeed,as a sheer feat of human imagination, Hugo can only be called superb. This film is an beautifully designed, shot and edited tribute to the innocence and imagination of childhood, AND a heart-felt love letter to the movies. Touching, funny and extraordinarily inspiring and redemptive, this is a masterpiece from a director who can only be called a god of the cinema. I will never forget Hugo.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All I Can Say is WOW,"Director Martin Scorsese really hit it out of the park with this one. He has taken 3D movie-making to the next level. This film felt like a fairytale for both adults and children and has forever changed the viewing experience from average to spectacular. Although the film started out a little slow, I think that this is one of Marty's better works and is definitely Oscar-worthy, even if it is just for the cinematography. It kind of had that Oliver Twist feel happening but with a lot more adventure. When I saw the trailer for this film, it really did not give any indication about the content of the film and Emma was not looking forward to seeing it. I was excited just to see what was going on with the 3D. If a commercial boasts that ""if you don't see any other film in 3D, you need to see this one""; that peaked my imagination and the film did not disappoint. Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret) was as endearing in this film as he was in The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. The relationships Hugo builds throughout the film definitely keeps you interested and wanting to know what happens next. The station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) added both some comic relief and dramatic moments. Sir Ben Kingsley's character, George Melies transforms throughout the film. You could not really decide if you liked him or if you hated him, but all things are revealed in the end. It is really hard to review this film without giving away its essence, but take my word for it; you will not regret going to see it. This film felt like it was very personal for Mr. Scorsese and although it definitely had a storybook feel, I think that anyone who loves movies (like Emma and I do) has to make sure that this one is on their list of films to see. Who would have thought that Marty would be the person that takes 3D films to another dimension? Even James Cameron stated that it was the best 3D effects that he had ever seen; including his own films. I gained a new found respect for the process of movie-making in general. This film does more than just entertains, but it also gives the audience a brief education. The conductor is shouting ALL ABOARD!!!!!

The automaton steals the show,"HUGO dazzled, delighted and inspired me as Scorsese intended. Under the guise of a family film HUGO is really a plea for film preservation. It's as much about the life of pioneer filmmaker Geo. Melies as it is the child Hugo. And it was nice to see both Christopher Lee, whom I had no idea was in the picture prior to seeing it, and the young actress Chloe Grace Moretz a few short years after her breakout role in the fun though ultra violent KICK-ASS.The real stars of the movie were Ben Kingsley and Helen McCrory who play the Melies (husband and wife) during their hey day on stage performing magic tricks and making/starring in (nearly 500) films, then in later years living in obscurity never dwelling on their all but forgotten past. The automaton steals the show in parts and seemed almost lifelike, but Scorsese never crosses the boundary into fantasy. My friend whom I saw HUGO with wanted the automaton to wink at us at the end. I'm glad it didn't! Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret. While somewhat dramatized, many of the historical details in the film are based on fact. Included are scenes from early cinema, actual footage (bits of A TRIP TO THE MOON are tastefully enhanced with 3-D) from THE GENERAL, SAFETY LAST and other nascent flickers shown being watched by astonished audiences of the time.

I have no idea who reviews these movies but they have lost they're sense of smell. The acting was one dimensional and this is not the fault of the actors, this is the fault of the script. Actors are only allowed to express a single emotion throughout the entire film. There were also many seemingly useless characters in the film like the bookshop owner, the tea couple, the flower lady - I have no idea why those characters were given any time. There seemed to be three main stories but none of them were convincing or drawn out. They were superficial ham-fisted portrayals and with over 2 hours of this you have to wonder who edits in Hollywood anymore. There was a love scene to early cinema at various points which is absurdly odd as it has only the most tenuous link to the boys story - it goes on for a long time and is nothing more than a gratuitous and frankly tedious lecture - what happened to 'show don't tell' direction.The sets looked like expensive lush sets and nothing more, no relationships, no lead character but extremely poor ensemble, confusing story arc with sections of what might as well be a documentary on early cinema - all wrapped in a bow with, count them, 4 happy endings.If you want to see a good movie that inspired this extremely poor knock off then look for Cinema Paradiso and see how it should be done.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Quite an ordinary plot blown way outta proportion in a boring manner.,"I expected a lot before watching this film but was a bit shocked that I found it sincerely boring. To see a director make a film just to may some sort of a tribute to his own profession, film - making, is just not that overwhelming. I like dramas based on the human emotion, it seems this is specifically based on creating magic out of nothing. Hugo is a primeval film about machines and man at the dawn of the cinema era. I don't blame myself entirely for not curbing my apathy towards this film. It is not a bad film - it is just ordinary and very selective.Watch this if you don't mind watching a two hour long film based in early 20th century about an orphan.I have a sinking feeling that Martin Scorsese thinks he nailed crime/drama films after ""The Departed"" and won't be making a film with that bent again. He is starting doing these tributes to film making - Shutter Island for instance, what was that all about?! Yet, that is a much better, more laconic film than Hugo (Which I doubt will figure in my top 15 of last year)",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
bo ring bo ring,"This film was playing in a theater that I frequented during my childhood, and I was quite excited to see it based on the reviews I read RIGHT HERE. It was a disappointment. The robot was the most exciting character. The special effects were good-- not great. The sound quality was muffled, and many times I could not hear what was being said. The story line was pointless and boring, and I could not wait for it to end, like a joke without a punch line. I fought through the urge to fall asleep toward the end of the movie. 8.6 average user rating? You're dreaming. At least this film would be better than watching a film by George Melies.

"Hugo is a wonderful, beautiful and enchanting adventure","Hugo is wonderful and beautiful, filled with drama, fantasy, adventure, passion, excitement and mystery. This film is an enchanting grown-up movie that I loved - and my 7-year old enjoyed throughout. (There is nothing objectionable for kids, but some younger children might get bored during certain parts). Neither my young son nor I is a fan of 3D, but Hugo used 3D technology beautifully and subtly. It complemented the film perfectly. The characters in Hugo are well-developed and complex. The acting was universally excellent. The movie is gorgeously filmed - fitting in a movie that, among other things, is also about an extraordinary love and celebration of film-making.

A Movie for Movie-Lovers!,"The legendary director Martin Scorcese decided to try his hand at a children's film and did he ever succeed. Not only is Hugo a well-made, beautiful children's film, but it's about the preservation of old cinema. First off, this film is beautiful to look at. The cinematography and set designs are top-notch. This is one of the few films that 3D actually works with. The movie also has a great story which lead to a well-written script which then led to the casting of great actors who did such a fantastic job.This film, which is based on the novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", is about an orphan boy who lives alone in a Paris train station and owns an automaton. He happens to be caught as a thief by a toy store owner, George Melies. The boy ends up meeting Isabelle and together they find out who the real George Melies is.This movie is filled with fantastic acting. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are two young, fine actors. Ben Kingsley is perfect as Melies. Sacha Baren Cohen adds some old-fashioned comedy here and does it well. It's also nice to see character actors like Christopher Lee and Richard Griffiths here.Overall, this is a great homage on cinema. I became interested in the history of cinema thanks to this film. The final half-hour of this film is no doubt the best part as we see Hollywood paying respect for this guy. This is a beautiful film that deserves all the positive attention. I rate this film 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Meandering but charming family film,"With Scorsese as director and it being a big adoption of 3D by a ""proper"" director, this film made quite a stir when it came out and I always meant to watch it but somehow never did get to it. I finally did this weekend, although of course watched it in 2D and, to be honest, didn't see that I was missing too much by doing so. The film seems to have been a personal one for Scorsese as I remember him talking about wanting to make something that his grandchildren could enjoy while they were still children and in addition to this it is about a love of cinema, a love of wonder and making something that has this effect.Hugo doesn't quite produce the emotions that we see drawn from the characters within the film, but it is still a warm and charming film. The plot has the theme of making things work and things having a purpose and this is well enough laid out to have an impact and work within the narrative. The pace is sometimes a little bit too slow and the film could have been a bit shorter and tighter with a tad more ruthlessness with the editing, because it does occasionally feel like it is meandering a bit as opposed to getting where it needs to go. I did not mind this so much as I was enjoying the tone of it, but it was still an issue. Given the subject matter, I really appreciated that it never gave way to easy sentiment nor got soapy – it was honest in this way and I think a better film for it.The direction is good in the shots and movement of the camera, while the film feels like it has real passion and excitement for what it is doing, which comes over. Performances are engaging. Butterfield is really good in the title role and he works well with Kingsley in a delicate performance. Moretz was solid but left the detail to these two leads. Cohen provides some comic relief and I liked his wandering accent, while Winstone, Lee, de la Tour (!), Griffiths, Law, Eldon and others are all there to provide good small turns and add presence.Generally Hugo is a bit too slow and long for its own good but even with this it has a warm, consistent heart which makes for a charming film with good performances. It may not fill you with awe and wonder as the characters in the film are, but it is still a charming and cheering family film without a mean bone or a sentimental bone in its body.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uneven mish mash makes a bit of a mess,"It's hard to put a finger on the problem with this movie. It is watchable but difficult to get through. The pacing is all over the show. Was that the editor or the director? One minute it's a children's fantasy movie, the next it's a history lesson on the birth of cinema reading from a text book, that will go right over the heads of it's child audience. There is some stunning cinematography here, all the shots of the automaton are jaw dropping, the station too, and there's some great acting too , Chloe just oozes vibrancy into her role, conveys a sincerity and believable quality to her performance, and Asa has his moments too. Is it the script that drags them through too much filler to keep it up though, or was that the editor holding too long on that thought shot? Certainly we should expect more from Scorsese, or maybe he can only do violent adult movies, There are some really good ideas in this movie, but they don't fit together very well as a whole. They were trying for 'something' but maybe a simpler approach would have made a more mesmerising result.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brought out the little kid in me.  Simply wonderful,"I am really confused by the reasons behind some of the low ratings. This movie was just amazing. It tells a wonderful story that keeps you in your chair with your eyes glued to the screen.

I actually rented this movie long after it came out and wished I would have seen it at the theater except I'm not much of a 3-D fan so maybe seeing it at home was for the best.I would encourage anyone who has not yet seen it to watch it, especially with their young children because I believe this will open their imagination and they will enjoy this movie very much.

HUGO is a Beautiful Masterpiece,"Hugo, I can't begin to explain how much I adore this film. There are not enough words in the English dictionary to truly describe how amazing this film is, so I will do my best with the limited vocabulary I possess.Everything in this film is excellently executed. Every shot, every camera movement, every frame is a work of art in its own right. Their is a simplistic beauty to Hugo that captures my imagination as an inspired filmmaker. The story is easy to follow, but that doesn't mean it's an overly simplistic movie. The movie takes the time to explore and thoroughly develop each major character, something you don't see in a lot of movies today.Hugo has a charm about itself that isn't found in many movies today and that is thanks to the cast's performances which are all superb. The artistic visuals and music also compliment the movie's charm and overall enhance the movie the way visuals and music are suppose to. The movie doesn't focus on its music or visual effects, the movie focuses on character development. A visual effect without a story is a boring visual effect. There are no boring visual effects in Hugo.Is there anything negative to say about Hugo? I honestly don't think so. This is a very well made film with a solid script, excellent acting and beautiful visuals. I encourage everyone who hasn't seen this film to find a time to watch it. It is a must.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo is an Enchanting Film,"Hugo is an enchanting film that will dazzle the viewer with its beautiful scenes, real characters, and simple emotional story. This wonderful film reminds me of one of my favorite Italian films ""Cinema Paradiso"", as they both stir up strong emotions in a simple and beautiful way.Hugo is an orphan who lives at a train station and cares for the station's clocks. Hugo is devoted to fixing a mechanical robot (an automaton), hoping for a message from his deceased father. Hugo steals from a toy shop owner, constantly dodges the train station policeman, and befriends a young girl. These characters become an important part of Hugo's life, as he works to uncover the mystery of the automaton.I haven't been a big fan of 3-D technology, which has been disappointing in most films that I've seen in 3D. However, Hugo's 3-D effects are stunning and really make you feel part of the scenes. The director Martin Scorcese does a magical job with this 3-D medium in creating a visual masterpiece.While billed as a children's movie, this film will be more appreciated by adults and older children. The story moves slowly, but, since the movie pulls you into Paris of many years ago, you don't even notice. Overall, Hugo is a wonderful and unique film that we'll be a rewarding movie experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
NOT the classic intended....,"To begin with, Scorsese was NOT the ideal talent to bring this slight (if charming) pastry to the screen. His direct driving touch is far from the only reason that it does not gel....but it is the most important reason....(for an example of what a lighter, defter touch might have done...check out the whimsy and genuine magic of ""Midnight In Paris""...Woody Allen might also have done something with some of the actors who seem to be totally beyond Scorsese's control. I am talking of Sacha Baron Cohen in particular whose characterization is so bizarrely misguided that it robs most of the film of genuine tension (I could begin by asking about the horrid cockney accent...and the beyond asinine moment when he is depicted as sharing a bathtub with his dog WHILE WEARING LONG UNDERWEAR...((if it was meant to be funny ha ha ...it ain't))...and the attempt to humanize him with a wishy-washy romance only adds to the films prodigious length).There are also severe problems with pacing and narrative drive...and most of the big final chase sequence seems quite shockingly amateurish and slip-shod.Despite the obvious mega-bucks thrown at this (or possibly partially because it it was so grossly over decked out) much of this seems as heavy as a lead balloon...despite some appealing work from the two young stars (though Chloe is a bit too hip, mod and American)...and some of the supporting actors...My final assessment is that no matter how many awards are thrown at it...it flopped for several good reasons...including the simple fact that it was ill conceived and over produced....things that are almost always detrimental to such light pieces...It might have made a nice 90 minute animated feature...the heavy (and not too convincing) over use of CGI makes it feel like it is half animated anyway.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
All Hype - Bad Movie,"The film ""Hugo"", Martin Scosese newest film currently has cinematic reviews that were similar to his other works ""Gangs of New York"" or ""Shutter Island."" Each movie succumbed to the marketing hype of Martin Scorsese's genius, meanwhile forgetting the fact, each of these films is never chosen for a re- watch. I am a Martin Scorsese fan. This film leaves the viewer watching ninety minutes of stage preparation and bland information before the story starts; and still, a poorly comprised story at that.Hugo is prime example of a badly written screenplay with a huge budget. As other reviewers have said, it is a visually gorgeous film. That however doesn't make up for the languishing story that starts as fast as a 1930's steam engine.The entire story places misguided buildup on character points and plot lines that change over the course of the two hour film. As wonderful as it is to be given the accurate view of the everyday activities of the Paris train station workers (despite they all speak English), they were sidebars to the story. Seeing the mundane jobs of characters who do not have a place in the story takes away from the precious time Martin Scorsese had for character and story development needed to make this a good movie.My expectation is this film will always have moderate to good reviews. However, on a movie night at home, like ""Gang's of New York"" or ""Shutter Island"", viewers will choose to NOT watch a movie at all than waste another two hours of their life watching a bad movie.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you love film, you will love Hugo","Though it is based on a kid's book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, I have a hard time thinking of Hugo as a movie for kids. This isn't a movie that you scarf down like a Whopper or a Big Mac, it's a movie that you savor, that you relish, and much of that is due to what your eyes are witnessing. Breathtaking sets and masterful use of 3D draw you into the story, but I'm not sure that is enough to captivate children the age of the protagonist and title character, Hugo Cabret.There's a key scene halfway through Hugo's journey where it is explained to him that there are just some things that he's too young to understand, and I can't help but wonder if that might be true of the audience at which this very mature, very visceral journey that Scorsese has painted for us is aimed. This film moves at a rather slow pace through the first half, if not 2/3rds of the tale, but the payoff is all the greater for it, assuming you're old enough to appreciate the history being portrayed. I imagine there are plenty of kids who have seen it already who were expecting something a bit faster paced and closer to what they are used to, and were disappointed. Most of them probably don't even realize that it's actually based on (loosely, but rather accurately at the same time!) the real life of Georges Méliès, who was known as the ""Cinemagician"" because he was, basically, the father of ""special effects.""So wait, you might ask... Is this a film about a kid named Hugo, or about the early days of cinema?It's both.And it's wonderful. It truly is a love letter to cinemaphiles, and I'd rather not give away any more than that, because that's only slightly more than I knew going into it, and in my experience, the less I know about or expect from a movie, the more likely I am to enjoy it. Just know that you really should see it in 3D. I know people are tiring of it lately, but it really does play an integral role in this film, and if nothing else, your eyes will thank you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Children's Film Not Just for Children,"Like clockwork, we are all part of a much larger whole designed to connect with each other and work as one. It's a comforting thought but in a world without spare parts, what happens when you feel you've outlived your value? When you have no purpose? Thus one of the main themes of ""Hugo"" Martin Scorsese's first foray into PG territory. Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a lonely orphan living in the walls of the Paris train station circa 1930's. While tending to the various clocks around the station, Hugo also has a habit of stealing cogs and widgets from an ornery toy shop clerk Georges (Ben Kingsley). He does this to fix a mechanical atomization his father left him. What it does? Hugo has no idea. When his fathers notes on the machine are taken by Georges in comes his equally precocious goddaughter Isabelle, who helps Hugo discover the purpose of his machine.For those of us who appreciate the art of film, ""Hugo"" is sure to impress and enchant. The first thing that catches the eye is the color palate which contrasts warm reds and blue hues. Even in the costuming their seems to be very little gray or other bland tones. This creates a Paris with an otherworldly quality enhanced further with competently handled 3D and dazzlingly elaborate camera-work.The second half of the film concerns itself with a topic near and dear to Martin Scorsese's heart; film history and preservation. Homages to various films are slyly inserted and immortalized names from cinema's early era like Lumiere and Melies become an integral part of the story much to any film fanatic's enjoyment. The plot unravels at a deliberate pace and the story itself may prove daunting for some children. But those on Scorsese's wavelength will receive an exciting and elaborate history lesson.Hugo, Isabelle and Georges are linked by a yearning to be accepted and appreciated. At times they feel like Hugo's mechanical man, useless, antiquated, broken. In the end they all find what their looking for by motivating each other, in essence existing for one another which when you think about it, is a pretty good purpose.http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Starts nicely, develops into ...nothing.","This movie might be good in its 3D effect, but loses its appeal solely as a story after the first 15 minutes. I can imagine people start seeing this movie with great expectations and this feeling of: OK, story builds up- I bet I will be shocked soon or amazed, or taken into a beautiful imaginary world. Sadly it seems to be only a huge marketing campaign, which made me go see it, but it did not satisfy me at all as an adult. I would say it is a nice movie for children, but does not have that kind of magic touch as proclaimed in the trailer and the advertising of the film.Acting is of course brilliant as always by Ben Kingsley. Sacha Baron Cohen fits perfectly for his role as the Station Inspector. The two Kids played by Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz did also very well, but no good acting can make up for this weak script, sorry.

"Beautiful, Powerful, Inspiring, Touching, Nostalgic","Winner of 5 Academy Awards including Cinematography and Art-Direction. This adaptation is based off the incredible book by Brian Selznick, directed by the great Martin Scorsese, written by John Logan and includes a very great cast that looked like they came straight out of the book.The story follows a young orphan who has a full time job fixing the clocks in the train stations, while also trying to find the right parts for a machine that is all that is left of his dead father. Trying to get these parts means stealing a bunch of toys from a toyshop run by an older man and his only daughter. And thru a series of events Is apart of an incredible journey of friendship, hardship and self discovery.I love this movie so much, It is by far one of the best adaptations I have and will ever watch. I had already read the book, but Martin Scorsese did such a good job that at times I forgot it was based off a book. He absolutely did an amazing job at blending 3D with CGI and Cinematography, one of the best uses of 3D, It inspires me to get a 3D TV just to experience that again, It's that good. It also has good use of sound which it also won an Oscar for; all the sounds of the clock ticking, the trains and camera rolling are really well done if you pay attention.Acting on everyone Is top notch. Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz are exceptional and Ben Kingsley is excellent. So many people In this movie, and they all do good, even tho they don't have much time to shine, they all have a like able parts to play into a great story.This Movie is getting hate for being boring and long. I completely disagree, I thought it had great pace. It's a big story with lots to tell and if it was any shorter it wouldn't have worked I don't think. Honestly I can see a completely average viewer not liking this movie that much. But if you In any way have any respect or nostalgia for movies or filmmaking I think It's a sure thing you'll respect this movie for what it is which is a love letter to film.

dazzling visuals and a love of cinema overcome the movie's flaws,"Melding elements of both Oliver Twist and the Artful Dodger into a single character, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a homeless orphan who lives surreptitiously inside a great train station in Paris circa 1931. To assuage his loneliness and to give some purpose to his life, he fixes and maintains the station's many elaborate time-pieces - and, to survive, he furtively steals food from the local vendors selling their wares there.A life-affirming departure for the normally dark and brooding Martin Scorsese, ""Hugo"" is such a beautifully crafted work of commercial cinema that I feel a trifle ungrateful for not actually liking it more - though, more accurately perhaps, I should say that I love the final third of the film but have some reservations about what comes before. It is certainly a wonder to behold in terms of its art direction and scenic design, which together help to create a never-never world of Art Deco architecture and breathtaking cityscapes, where the surreal and the real comfortably meet - a fitting visual correlative, as it turns out, for the theme of the film. And it goes without saying that the movie richly merited each of the many awards it earned for its visual accomplishments.Adapted by John Logan from the Brian Selznick novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret,"" ""Hugo"" is at its most magical when it is reveling in and celebrating the pioneer days of filmmaking, particularly the fantastical works of magician and special effects wizard Georges Melies (""A Trip to the Moon""), who is an actual character in the movie (played by Ben Kingsley). It seems, according to the story, that Melies left filmmaking an embittered, forgotten has-been and now owns a toy booth in the very train station that Hugo calls home. One fateful day, Hugo and Melies' paths cross - and so the adventure beginsGiven all these quality elements, what then are my objections to the film? Primarily, they rest in the fact that, as a central figure, Hugo is too lacking in fire and passion to generate much interest for the audience; that the secondary characters - particularly Sacha Baron Cohen as a war-ravaged security guard - come across more as live-action cartoon figures than as real people; and that the storytelling and pacing in the first half of the film often lag behind the visual stimulation. All these work as distancing devices that keep us from becoming as fully engaged in the plot and the world of the film as we perhaps would like to - until the last third, that is.And that final third winds up making all the difference, as it brings together the movie's disparate elements into a unifying theme of fixing that which is broken - be it a mechanical device or the human heart. This theme is reflected in the film's visual motif of endless machines, both those that are functional and those that are in need of repair. And Scorsese's meticulous re-creation of Melies' classic works is indeed a wonder to behold.There is one glaring anachronism, however: though the story is set in 1931, Hugo at one point makes reference to having seen Errol Flynn in ""Robin Hood,"" a movie that wasn't released until 1938! A prescient kid, that Hugo.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Pedagogue's Guide to Film Preservation --  and Boredom.,"When I walked in the theater to see this, my first 3D film in a theater for several decades, there were eight people populating the entire theater to watch this grand homage to Mr Melies. Two people left during the film, so one-quarter of the audience walked out.I love early cinema so Scorsese was preaching to the choir with me, but as entertainment, this film falls flat. The visual wonders of the film gave way to incredible boredom. The story is convoluted and after awhile one stops caring because the film has no heart; the mechanical animations are the films heart, not the characters, who are wooden props. The sole redeeming feature of this film is Ben Kingsley as George Melies, who plays the mysterious, forlorn character.After seeing Kundun in 1997, the Gangs of New York in 2003 and now this, I think that Scorsese has lost his way. It looks like he's taken an unofficial retirement from his Italian/ gangster films that he was so good at, only to focus on trying to impress audiences with how eclectic and balanced of a filmmaker he is.He is out of his zone again and his annoying practice of preaching about film preservation comes into full bloom here, especially the scene when the book is opened at the library. It truly was vomit-inducing, as are what seem to be the paid shills who are lining up to give over-the-top praise to this $170 million clunker.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Great movie,"Hugo is a really enjoyable, easy to watch movie. It has lovable characters, like Hugo, who are easy to sympathize with, quality cinematography, and great visuals with high quality production design. I think where this film lacks is in its acting. I found that Asa Butterfield as Hugo, and Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle, were underwhelming actors at times, but I think that can be attributed to some poorly written, lines that came across really fabricated and forced. Luckily, Sacha Baron Cohen, who plays the station inspector, Christopher Lee, Ben Kingsley, and other supporting actors did a great job in their respective roles, but as Asa and Chloe have lead roles, the slightly unsatisfactory acting is quite noticeable. On the other hand, I think this film does a really good job of teaching a little bit of film history, in a very consumable way. I think that is very important because a lot of youth today might not know much or any film history, and might not normally be willing to learn it, but when that information is packed into an entertaining, family friendly movie, they might learn a thing or two without even knowing it. With that said, the book that Hugo is based on, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, by Brian Selznick, does a much better job of teaching some very interesting film history, and does a better job of telling the story of Hugo in general. This movie is great for anyone who hasn't learned the history of film, and I would recommend it to any kids or even teenagers that wouldn't otherwise spend their time learning it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Details only a TRUE master could deliver...,"i was curious enough as it it to know martin Scorsese directing a children movie, not only is it not his genre ..at all, but why would he want do it anyway? what if he messes up? after delivering hardcore intense drama, what good can he bring from a child story? well i was glad to know martin answered it all, HUGO demanded those technical details which only an experienced master can deliver. the dramatic set pieces, those steamy London rail stations, those bustling crowds just bring in the whole experience and nails it bang on!! Those nostalgic moments of old cinema even though hard to convince to younger generation it was a touch of class when he could translate this to us in such a good fashion that even we feel the urge to have been there amongst them doing things which would later have been applauded, cherished. HUGO is more than a movie, it feels more of a movie made with interest with curiosity and urge to perfect things with its rich lifelike details.It tells us the story of a boy who loves to fix things with passion.. and told by a person who loves to tell new stories and push the boundary with that same passion.

The acting was really good and completely convincing. Asa Butterfield delivers a very committed performance as Hugo Cabret, and he shows a lot of promise in his future career. Chloë Grace Moretz, also gives a fine and respectable performance. Sacha Baron Cohen is surprisingly very effective as Station Inspector. Ben Kingsley gives the best performance in the whole movie, he is just superb and deserves some recognition. Overall, the whole cast was top notch. Instead the plot alternates amazing parts with others quite boring, so it hasn't convinced me a lot. However i think it is a movie to watch at least once.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A very artistic film.,"What an incredible movie! Through out the whole movie, I was going through the adventure with Hugo and felt all the emotions he felt.Set in 1930s Paris, an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton.This is a great story! Martin Scorsese did an outstanding job directing this film. The movie was artistic and the camera angles were unbelievably amazing.The cast in the film was perfect. Each character in this film was completely different and well developed. I personally couldn't pick a better cast for this movie.I'd recommend this to anyone. It is a must see movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but Hugo's story is actually not that fascinating...,"HUGO – CATCH IT ( B ) It's really hard to describe Hugo as it's not one of the CGI children movies. It's more complicated and to be honest more mature for children. The story may involve a kid living and hiding at the franc train station but it's not for kids. Hugo is directed by Martin Scorsese and has great production value. From its train station to costumes everything is simply stunning. I must say that Mr. Scorsese has worked really hard on the detailing about the era. The movie showcases the time frame and look which we don't see that often in such aesthetic way on screen. Chloe Morets and Asa Butterfield did a fantastic job as well Ben Kingsley and Emily Mortimer. For me Sasha Baron Cohan was the best as after watching him playing and living characters like Ali G, Borat, Bruno and now Dictator. It's just so good to see him acting like a normal actor. As far as the movie goes it's a good movie but as great to be remembered. The problem with the movie is that Hugo's story is actually not that fascinating enough. It's not the kind of story we like to see for two hours on cinema. If Martin Scorsese didn't direct this, it would not have been that much appreciated. Overall, it's a good movie but I would not recommend to someone at least.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring! Boring! Boring!,"Wow! Soooo boring. From IMDb's high reviews and advertised trailers I was so not expecting that. I don't usually write reviews. Actually this is my first movie review. I simply don't normally feel I have a right to critique a subject I know so little about. I like to watch movies, but only certain types of movies. I don't keep up with directors or actors. Blah, blah, blah. But I felt compelled to write this review simply because I felt so tricked.This movie is a great example of false advertising. It is marketed as an adventure with a mystery. Yet, it is neither of those. It is not that I did not like the adventure. It is that there was NO adventure to be had. It is not that I did not get the mystery. It is that there is NO mystery there! All this movie has going for it is that it is pretty. I didn't care for any of the characters. Felt no sympathy much less empathy for anything or anybody in this movie. And FYI - I'm the type that after many, numerous viewings of ""How to Train Your Dragon"", still shudders at the scene where Hiccup swallows the bite of regurgitated fish.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You have to read the book,"The Selznick book is considered a modern children's classic. If you read it, you will see how it inspired the film. The opening paragraphs of the book are, almost word for word, the script for the opening scene of the camera soaring down from the sky into and through the railroad terminal. The book, itself, is a very unusual construct. Some pages have only a few sentences of text followed by pages that advance the story with nothing but drawings. Scorcese was very true to both the visual and textual style of the book.The film, itself, is full of great film and stage actors in small rolls that are pure gems. There is more depth to the characters than in the typical family film.As to the 3D, the director shows how it can add to the film without distracting from the art of telling a story. Some reviewers seem underwhelmed by the 3D because objects don't jump off the screen, but that's the point. It adds depth to the story, but does not drive the story. The scenes, especially those set among the clockworks, would look too busy and confusing without the 3D camera layering the moving objects. The Scorcese technique of following his actors down hallways, up staircases and through crowds becomes stunning with the 3D camera. If you want to know how good this 3D is, see it as I did, in a theater that used the opportunity of an audience with 3D glasses to precede the feature presentation with trailers for a half dozen current and upcoming 3D films. Watch those, then watch Hugo, and see how Scorcese has, as James Cameron has said, advanced the art of 3D beyond any place it has ever been.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great Movie.,"I thought Hugo was a great movie! The camera angles, the picture, the acting, the set, the STORY ! everything was just awesome. I enjoyed the movie very much and would recommend it to everyone. I thought it was great how the story slowly and mysteriously unraveled as the movie went on and how the movie incorporated a bit of history in it. I also thought that seeing all the clockwork was awesome. All the gears moving together somehow made the movie so much more magical. In some parts I found myself with my eyes wide open and grabbing onto my hair from the tension. The two main, young actors did such a great job in portraying their characters and the small story lines on the side to do with the officer and the woman with the dog were also good :)",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good but not excellent,"Meant to be visually stunning, it fell a little short to my expectations. The visual effects may fool the children, but at some point they will get annoying. When Hugo is within the walls of the train station you will notice that his movements do not fit the constraints of the architecture as you saw it in the interior of the station. The train station and the space between the walls are obviously different worlds. Another flaw is that there are several shots which would have the camera position as much as three times as high as the Eiffel tower. There is no such tall building in the vicinity of the Eiffel tower in my recollection of Paris, especially not in the time in which the movie is set. I also noticed I got a little bored with the 'steampunk' clockworks and machinery that you see in this movie, the golden compass and likes.I enjoyed the wild experiments of the beginning of film making, in which the main character George Melies plays a big role. You feel the excitement of new inventions and wonders of technology. But I fear that this movie suffers too much from lack of focus; children will miss the different layers and will probably be bored and the storytelling will leave adults something to wish for.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Knew I was going to hate it,"My college dorm was watching the Oscars. Sweet, I thought - time to shine with my intellectual, high-end movie taste. Then the nominations came up; that's when the problems began. The Artist, War Horse, The Descendants - not only had I not seen the movies, I hadn't even heard of them. Well, I had seen Harry Potter and Transformers. That didn't make me especially proud. So there I sat sighing, as just a couple films separated me from elitist movie criticism.With this year's Oscars coming up, I knew what I had to do. It was now or never: I had to catch up on last year.To be honest, I was in the mood for a comedy. But work was work. And becoming a knowledgeable Oscar watcher somehow meant watching anything but a lighthearted comedy. Still, my mood for something funny and uplifting meant movies called The Descendents had to go immediately. The Artist - aka black and white 1930s-wannabe movie where the main actor (also won Actor Oscar, incidentally) speaks the grand total of 2 words - seemed like a bit too tough of a challenge. People said Midnight in Paris was good, but I wasn't dying to revisit the city whose people smirked at me when I bought the wrong baguette or wore shorts or wore something non-black/white/beige or spoke English or spoke French or did anything really. So that was out. That left me with Hugo. An adventure movie about a little boy, when I wanted a comedy about grown-ups. Tough luck. I hadn't even started it, and I knew I was going to hate it.And then I loved it. The visual effects were amazing. I didn't watch the movie in 3D, but even in 2D I felt enveloped in the story, flying through clock towers and transported back in time to the 1930s. But these 1930s didn't seem old and grim like they often do in films - they were vibrant and mysterious.The plot itself was very touching, albeit unrealistic. I found myself crying a couple times through the movie, and the relationship of Hugo with his father was depicted very sweetly. Hugo himself had beautiful eyes, and his friend Isabelle was very cute (reminded me of Hermione (young Emma Watson), because of the puffy curly hair and love for reading books!). All the actors played well, and you didn't feel for a second like you were watching rather than living the plot.The thing I liked most about it, though, was that at its heart Hugo is a tribute to early filmmakers. People today are often caught up in glam, colorful Hollywood productions with one-stereotype characters and cotton candy sweet endings. True, we had the unrealistically happy ending here too, but we also learned about the history of the invention of film and black and white movies. It's not often that a your typical American would pass up some juicy reality TV to learn more about the early history of creating black and white, soundless movies. But thanks to this movie, we gained some real understanding and respect for these early pioneers of one of our favorite pastimes - and had the best of times while doing it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
brilliant movie but a little slow to start with,I went into this film knowing that its was a Scorsese film and that it wouldn't be for kids witch made me more intrigued to watch it. I knew it was going to be long and i am not a big fan of 3D films but i got over that because of the great reviews that i had read. whilst i am a martin Scorsese fan i was a little disappointed by this movie because of all the hype that it had got witch i believe it did not deserve. It was beautifully filmed and you could see how much work martin put into it which i really appreciated and there was top notch acting from every single actor in the movie. If this film was shorter and maybe a slightly better storyline it would have got an eight or higher but i still recommend this movie to any movie lovers out there but do not take your kids because they will be very board by the end of this movie.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Now I can say that Scorsece has made movies of almost all kinds.,"After ""The Departed""; ""Taxi Driver""; ""GoodFellas""; ""Raging Bull""; ""Gangs of New York""; ""Shutter Island"" ... I never thought that Martin Scorsese would make a movie like this, and what kind movie is? Well, read to the end and find out.""Hugo"" tells the story of.... Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan boy who lives in a train station in Paris, his job is to make the station's clock always running. But while unraveling the mystery of the little ""robot"" that his father left him before he died. Until he met the mysterious toy seller (Ben Kingsley) that inadvertently shows have known anything about it. So Hugo embarks on a quest to find out this secret, which seems to be difficult with the station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) in pursuit of any ""offenses against the law.""Throughout the movie this mystery increases with each passing minute, but nobody realizes that the John Logan (screenplay) always gives little hints of secret throughout the film. And when it comes, is a true wonder to who's watching because nobody was expecting that, although the tips are always there. With the secret many will say that the movie is really meaningless, and that is very childish. But no one sees how much this is awesome, a director who has always done adult films, and now makes his grand debut in 3D making a movie for the whole family. Managing to keep the entertainment of his films, and a impeccable 3D direction. And the secret might not impress much, but who is a lover of cinema (like me) will love it, because while it is for movie fans, it is also a tribute to the King of cinema Georges Méliès.Even the cast impressed me, Ben Kingsley perfect as always and Asa Butterfield also excellent. But I was impressed with Chloë Grace and Sacha Baron Cohen, Chloe who was the Hit-Girl in ""Kick Ass,"" and Sacha who was Borat in ""Borat"", Bruno in ""Bruno"" and Dictator in ""The Dictator"". Both actors have been in completely different characters from the ones they are playing in here, well, this just proves that they are great actors.I loved ""Hugo"" from beginning to end, had a great time and met the King of the 7th art in a fun and realistic way. A true tribute that gave many movie fans a chance to meet their King in such a fun and exciting way.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Marty! ""Hugo"", I liked it.","On the surface Hugo seems very much like a film outside of the comfort zone of martin Scorsese alongside a departure o f the general aesthetics of his films usually (toxic male antiheroes, flashy and snappy camera movements, etc, etc).

The main theme of ""the magic of the movies!! For me personally, it leans a bit too much into the saccharine and sentimental for me to fully enjoy it.The main cast all have good performances, but for the most part, the side storyline with Sasha Baron Cohen and Emily Mortimer was far more interesting then the main storyline with Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Mortez.The use of CGI seemed pretty seamless and helped add to the feeling of the film.

As great a movie as it is an intensely personal one for Marty.,"Martin Scorsese made a family film? A wholesome one? And in 3D? GASP! Yes, believe it! Legendary director Martin Scorsese, best known for Goodfellas, Raging Bull, and The Departed, has made a terrific family movie out of Hugo.First shot of praise goes to the film's cast. A talented bunch of actors to behold, each of them giving it their best, even if some cameos may seem superfluous (Honestly, anything's better with the great Christopher Lee in it). The movie's main focus is that of young Asa Butterfield, nailing the character of Hugo. He gives a very convincing performance, and tremendous sparks fly between he and his co-stars, whether he's holding his own against the secretive Papa George (The terrific Ben Kingsley), outwitting the relentless Station Inspector (The hilarious Sacha Baron Cohen), or sharing an adventure with the eager Isabelle (The lovely Chloe Moretz).But this is still Marty's movie, and a very personal one for him. He and screenwriter John Logan have a delightful time dabbling in the history of film. Cinematic history practically courses through Scorsese's veins, and he infuses generous portions of his knowledge of cinema into the film. He excellently captures the spirit and nostalgia of old movies, movies that wowed audiences before technological advances in cinema (CGI, for example) were even thought possible. The film reaches more than a few levels of pure Cinema Paradiso inspiration. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for Marty, and you might also say it was even based on himself in several ways.On top of that, he's hired technical crew members who make the film look and sound incredible, no less than it deserved. Dante Ferretti's superb production design, and Sandy Powell's wonderful costumes are to die for. Bob Richardson's cinematography and Thelma Schoonmaker's film editing are pure aces, especially when showcasing the film's truly special effects. And Howard Shore writes a lovely, if sometimes over done, musical score complete with graceful piano and accordion motifs.**** out of ****",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Mesmerizing !!!!,"Hugo was a fun-loving,adventurous, fantasy children's movie which will be liked by people of all ages. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan staying in the midst of a railway station in Paris. He fixes mechanical gadgets and railways clocks which he learns from his father and uncle. Unfortunately, his father dies in a fire accident and only way to seek the message left by his father is to fix the automaton. In order to fix the automaton, he starts stealing from a toy shop in the railway station owned by a cranky old man , George Melies (Ben Kingsley). But Hugo is caught stealing and the only way to compensate for his punishment is to work in the toy shop. Hugo befriends George's granddaughter Issabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) during his tenure and successfully fixes his father's automaton. Eventually , he gets the message from the robot but in form of pictorial diagram which gives him a clue about George's past. Along with Issabelle , Hugo sets out to find the truth. Hugo , directed by the legendary director Martin Scorsese , is his first 3D fantasy film based on a novel written by Brian Selznick. When I saw the trailer for the first time , the film immediately reminded me of Polar express which was of same genre. The film was shot completely in 3D made it more exciting to watch. I have always Scorsese's work and this film goes one step further to prove his versatility. The master director has captured each frame so beautifully that audience will fall in love with the movie. The visual effects and camera work is so enthralling that you don't want to miss out the movie even for a second. Story and screenplay has been handled so efficiently that you would not feel bored ever. Art direction is magnificent. Dialogues are superb and inspiring. The child actor who plays the part of Hugo does justice to his part. Same goes for Chloe Moretz. But it is Ben Kingsley who steals the thunder. The actor is effective and carries the part of George Melies with such an ease. So , overall , a superb movie in all respect. Hats off to Martin Scorsese was experimenting something unusual and making it a fun-loving flick to watch. Very Good : 4/5",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lovely to look at but a bit flat and affected at times,"Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield), a young orphan who lives within the walls of the Gare Montparnasse railway station in Paris, tries to solve the mystery of a clockwork automaton that his late father was attempting to fix. Desperate for parts to repair the humanoid machine, Hugo steals mechanical toys from a small toy shop run by a bitter old man (Ben Kingsley) who turns out to be Georges Melies, one of the seminal names in fantasy films. 'Hugo' is beautifully made (although the CGI imagery of 1930's Paris is bit artificial looking, which may be due to being seen on a TV screen), the story engaging, and the cast quite good. Although the film takes some dramatic liberties with Melies biography, the core of the story, the rise and fall of the magician turned producer/director/actor who gave the world what is thought by many to be the first science fiction film (1902's 'A Trip to the Moon') is compelling. Having seen most of Melies' surviving films, I found the recreations of movie-making in his turn-of-the century-studio fascinating. 'Hugo' is primarily a film for kids and some adults may find it a bit precious (Chloë Grace Moretz's character gets a bit trite and tiresome after a while). I am not surprised that the film fared better with the critics than with audiences.

A Cinematic Wonder,"When watching then film ""Hugo"" by Martin Scorsese the words captivating an amazing came to mindWhile the film was directed by the famous Martin Scorsese, it does trail off significantly towards the end, as though Scorsese was unsure of how to proceed once the mystery was solved. However Scorsese truly knew what to do in order to bring his vision to light.The writing and editing was very good. It flowed nicely and the plot was explained very well, creating a visual rhythm in the film that fulfilled the directors vision. The cinematography and lighting was excellent, with each shot and change perfectly fitting into each scene. Every scene brought out each specific you emotion Scorsese wanted you to feel at that certain moment in time.The way the camera created and captured historical views and brought them to life was incredible. The film was a nod to the earliest days of cinema, and in particular one of its true pioneers, Georges Melies. Scorsese does a great job at the aesthetics, portraying the 1933 Paris. Within this film were hidden gems that truly brought it to life such as ""Arrival of a Train"" - one of the world's first films , Melies's ""A Trip to the Moon"" and many others. The production design was incredible, from the inside of the clocks, to the detail of the automaton and so on.Overall this film was very fun to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo is THE quintessential family film.,"It is an atypical Scorsese as far as its appropriateness for all viewers, but it does not lack the quality of a typical Scorsese by any means. The story itself is fictional, but it is loosely centered around the true story of filmmaker George Melies. The story is brilliant, fun, poignant, and a little inspirational. That is thanks to its brilliant cast including spectacular performances from Kingsley, Butterfield, Moretz, and Cohen. With the exception of Kingsley's performance, they are not particularly Oscar-worthy; that's not to understate the good quality they do have, but rather to explain the lack of acting nominations this movie will receive. On the other hand, the film as a whole, in my humble opinion, is worthy of a win Best Picture at the Oscars. Even though it would be the first PG winner since 1986, I believe that its strength in quality and is traditional themes will make it able to get the conservative votes of the Academy. However, it will not win the Golden Globe Award; just wait and see.Putting all that aside, this film was spectacularly made. It portrays the world in a mechanical perspective, revealing to us that we must be alive for some reason and that we are not just spare parts. Hugo (Butterfield) represents all people who have it rough and find their way to make their way in their world; he, like so many others, perseveres when all else seems to have failed. He holds onto the one thing left from his past to help him with his future because he doesn't know any other way. Hugo goes through what kids do not usually go through. He is forced to take care of himself and try to cope with his solitude.Also, George Melies (Kingsley), or Papa George, is a has-been filmmaker, who quit his work of ""making dreams"" through film when tastes of the audience changed after the Great War. Many supposed him to have died, and he set to live the rest of his life as a ""penniless merchant"" at a train station in Paris. Then he meets Hugo . . .The majority of the film takes place in the aforementioned train station where Hugo lives in the walls. The highlighted elements in the train station are the Station Inspector (Cohen), a florist, a café owner, a kiosk owner, and book shopkeeper. The miniature plots of these characters are woven seamlessly into the main plot of Hugo and Melies. Scorsese masterfully presents the stages of these plots together and leaves nothing behind.I highly recommend that you most definitely see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Huge win for Hugo,I have not been a fan of 3D movies. They use the 3D technology as a gimmick and not as a part of the composition of the scenes. Hugo is a movie that does the opposite and makes it a component of each scene. This is a great example of how to use 3D as a device to transport the viewer to another place and time. This movie has a mystical setting that lends itself to the magic of filmmaking.It really took me to places I was not expecting. This story is a homage to the visions of Georges Méliès who was the father of the art of storytelling in film. The Parisian train station setting and the era it took place gives it a feel more like big Broadway stage production. This is a green light film. It is purely and simply magical.For more on this review go to http://fatsamuraireviews.blogspot.com/,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"""Hugo"" is a work with a dual personality that inspires conflicting feelings: it is easy to admire intellectually, but difficult to embrace emotionally","There are two films vying for space in ""Hugo"", a new work by the incomparable filmmaker Martin Scorsese: the first, capable of involving and enchanting any dedicated cinephile, is a passionate homage to the History of Cinema and one of its most admirable pioneers, in addition to offering a warning about the importance of preserving the great classics; the second is a silly and unfunny story that takes a long 126 minutes to reach a predictable outcome that borders on melodrama. The result is a work with a dual personality that inspires conflicting feelings: it is easy to admire intellectually, but difficult to embrace emotionally.Written by John Logan from the book by Brian Selznick, the screenplay accompanies the orphan of the title (Asa Butterfield), who, living in the bowels of a large train station in Paris, tries to put together parts in order to rebuild an automaton found by his father. (Jude Law), a watchmaker killed in a fire. One day, however, Hugo is surprised by the owner of a toy store when he tries to steal another object for his project - and ends up being forced to work for the subject in order to avoid being handed over to the menacing station inspector (Sasha Baron Cohen). . Becoming friends with Isabelle (Chloé Grace Moretz), the shopkeeper's adopted daughter, the boy ends up discovering that his boss is Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley), forgotten director of the iconic Trip to the Moon and possible inventor of the object discovered by his father.Investing in a colorful universe that reinforces the fable atmosphere of the narrative, Hugo brings the veteran production designer Dante Ferretti in yet another great moment, since from the imposing station to the piled up bookstore of Monsieur Labisse (Lee) the film enchants with its settings expressive and rich in details - and the long shot that shows the protagonist walking through narrow corridors and descending improvised slides, already at the beginning of the projection, represents a beautiful joint effort by Ferretti and director of photography Richard Richardson, serving as a perfect presentation of the boy universe. Likewise, Scorsese already opens the film with a beautiful and inventive fusion that converts the mechanisms of the clocks kept by Hugo in the streets of Paris, simultaneously introducing us to the scenario of the story and the obsessions of the protagonist.And speaking of obsession, Scorsese finds in Hugo the perfect vehicle to discuss his own: Cinema. Introducing the theme in a poetic way by bringing the oscillating light of a projector originating the title character's memories (and, consequently, the flashbacks), the filmmaker also illustrates the technical principle of his Art by portraying Méliès quickly leafing through a notebook and checking, thus, I move on to a series of illustrations - and it doesn't take long until the feature film, set in the 1930s, starts showing excerpts from works such as ""The Workers Leave the Lumière Factory"", ""The Kiss"", ""The Great Robbery of the Train"", ""Intolerance"", ""The Boy"", ""A Caixa de Pandora"", ""The Fly"" and ""The General"", among others, in a kind of medley that could almost serve as a small introduction to the three first decades of the Seventh Art. Similarly, Scorsese obviously takes immense delight in recreating the scenes of various Méliès productions, from ""A Trip to the Moon"" to ""The Eclipse"" to the curious ""The Music Lover"". As if that weren't enough, Hugo ends up throwing his little hero into various situations that end up generating references to these same productions, from the incident involving the train to the moment when the boy finds himself hanging from the hand of a clock.Martin Scorsese uses Logan's text as a guide and makes Hugo something truly personal, using old signatures (such as the fog, omnipresent in the director's films, which gains a beautiful depth with 3D) while adopting more modern resources, such as the great digital tracking in the opening seconds - which offer an immersion in the scenery and history like I haven't seen in a long time; i really felt inside the train station. That tribute to the Seventh Art that you've heard so much about is provided, for the most part, by the presence of the iconic Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley, great); pioneer in special effects cinema, whose life and work are remembered here in a particularly exciting sequence (""Trip to the Moon"", the most famous feature of his filmography has a larger role) that still features images from the films of the man himself and of several others. Others (even ""The Train arriving at the Station"", first in History). It is Scorsese and his campaign for the preservation of films in an unappealing advertisement, quite the contrary, but convincing.In ""Hugo"" there is much more than that. The script is extremely metaphorical and uses details (as well as parts of a clock) in order to build and tie the story told. Hugo watches people at a train station (passengers going from one place to another). Cut and digress. Mélies joined the ""profession"" filming people's daily lives. The machinery of a watch resembles that of a camera. The persistence and repetition of the main character remind us of the countless attempts of trial and error until the cinemascope had its ""purpose"". And silent cinema, which ""died"" giving way to talkies, is protected by still life statues. ""Time has not been kind to old movies,"" he laments. ""It's like seeing daydreams,"" she says. ""The invention of dreams"", the cinema theme is complete, generating many definitions of effect. ""Everyone has a purpose"", with this phrase he personifies once and for all the real objective of cinema. Translating emotions, having fun, being moved by what you see. The young filmmaker, a character in love with Mélies' work, is the figure of director Martin Scorsese himself, who appears as an actor extra. ""With the war, youth and hope were left behind"", one tries to explain the distance to cinema.The entire cast also embraces the universe of Hugo Cabret. Asa Butterfield impresses with her charisma and drama when living the title character, mesmerizing with her blue eyes in the same way that the always talented Chloe Grace Moretz exudes a portentous British accent, which goes well with the innocent excitement of her character. Filled with outstanding supporting characters, Sacha Baron Cohen (the eternal Borat) is perhaps their best as the amusing station inspector, whose aggressiveness in pursuing young orphans is docilely contrasted by his shyness when talking to the flower girl Lisette (Emily Mortimer, from Ilha do Medo). Also watch out for Martin Scorsese's slight tip...Precisely because I admire Hugo's technical aspects and his manifest love for Cinema so much that the end result can cause frustration when seeing these elements trapped in such a thin plot - and which, to make matters worse, is hampered by Scorsese's lack of habit of building stories aimed at children. As a result, the film ends up being slow and without rhythm, which is intensified by the excessive pauses between dialogues and the director's poor comic timing, which can be seen in the scene that shows the Inspector being dragged by a train or the one involving the mess made by a dog. In addition, perhaps because he believes that a child audience would demand a little more obviousness, the filmmaker allows us to easily anticipate several incidents, just by seeing the close-up of the stool used by a character to realize that he will fall next.And if it's disappointing to see a director of Scorsese's caliber investing in dream sequences to communicate something about the protagonist (something made worse by the not-so-subtle metaphor of the chest that brings mechanisms in place of a heart), it's even worse to realize the excess of secondary characters that serve only to unnecessarily inflate the length of the film - like the couple played by Richard Griffiths and Frances de la Tour and, of course, the bookseller played by the giant Christopher Lee. Yes, it's fun to notice the presence of figures like James Joyce and Django Reinhardt being seen briefly at the station, but if these jokes don't compromise the fluidity of the narrative, the same cannot be said about the whole subplot dedicated to the preservation of films - and even if I applaud Scorsese's initiative in this regard (mainly his commitment to the cause), the feeling that remains is that the discussion may not organically fit Hugo.The feature film by Scorsese, a militant for the preservation of filmic memory, in a way dialogues with ""The Artist"", by the Frenchman Michel Hazanavicius, who, unfairly, took away his Oscar for best film that year (both pay homage to the beginnings of cinema, but one reveres simplicity while the other extols the magic transferred to the screen. It's up to the audience to choose which they prefer). In the end, Hugo ended up taking five statuettes: best photography, art direction, sound, sound editing and visual effects. But, while it talks about silent cinema, condemned to extinction in the face of the inevitability of sound, ""Hugo"" is dedicated to praising the eternity of that first cinema, not its death. The film has a great drama, unusual in so many children's films. But at the same time, it has a lightness and unpretentiousness that is unusual for the director's best films. It is packed with great performances and has gone a step further in producing quality 3D movies for commercial cinema. It is also a tribute to old cinema and especially to George Méliès, who produced more than 500 films in his career. This adaptation is more than just Martin Scorsese's first 3D film. It's a story about finding our place in the world and how dreams can be captured by the incomparable magic of cinema. It's a love letter to the cinephile in all of us. But, contrary to what the cover says, it is far from being a masterpiece.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A delightful piece of Museum quality artwork is ""Hugo""","Martin Scorcese has directed another museum quality piece of artwork in his cinema, ""Hugo"". It is written by John Logan with screenplay by Brian Selznick and it is a must see film. My only regret is waiting for the Blu Ray since I do not have the 3D enhancement that really must have made a huge difference in the actual theaters. It is set in the 1930's in Paris, and the depth of field and fading perspectives are spectacular even without glasses. The colors are brilliant, and the acting is especially well due in part to Scorceses perfect casting. The boy is very intense yet innocent. His intrigue with the past as well as his interaction with the other characters brings tears to ones eyes. Ben Kingsley emotes a fine performance as an artist with emotion that permeates the screen. Sacha Baron Cohen is superbly cast as the station inspector who has humor, discipline and finally a delicate heart that matches his empathy for Hugo. Even the former Vampire character, Christopher Lee, plays Monsieur Labisse and he too has a heart as good a gold. ""Hugo"" is a film to be seen by all ages. It entangles the soul in a very compelling manner, and I recommend to see it in the original 3D if you can find it in such projection. Don't miss it even if you see it on the Blu Ray Disc, it is a treat to be relished and treasured for a very long time to come.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nice family friendly entertainment and nothing more,"I like ""Hugo"" . I like it much more than ""The Artist "" which for me is incredibly dull , boring , heartless and soulless movie. At least you can feel some heart in Scorsese movie. Still , I don't think ""Hugo"" deserves such high rating. Coming from master of cinema this is just a decent movie.From technical point of view the movie deserved all the Oscar awards and nominees . ""Hugo"" looks good , even if the CGI is too visible sometimes. You can find many more or less subtle references to old movies ( For example ""Safety last"" – it's even on the movie poster) . The acting is good . Only Sacha Baron Cohen seems to be miscast . He is rather annoying instead of funny . Not to mention he can't give his character true depth that is required in the final of the movie.The biggest problem however is the screenplay. This movie is nothing by generic family friendly movie. It's not too deep. It's ABSOLUTELY predictable . There are no surprises or twists. It was hard for me as an adult to watch this movie , because every message is told loud and straight to the audience face ( The broken machines are like people who lost their dreams etc. etc. ). I think Scorsese made a movie for kids not adults. This is not necessarily a bad thing , but Scorsese lacks the sensibility of Steven Spielberg to direct this kind of movie. The movie didn't left me cold , I felt something , but I wasn't in tears or anything like that.For a movie about movie magic there isn't too much magic here. I give it 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I thoroughly enjoyed this stunning film,"I was keen to see this film from its publicity posters. I thought the clock looked like the clock on the Musee d'Orsay art gallery in Paris, which used to be Quay d'Orsay railway station, near the river Seine. I have since found out the railway station is Gare Montparnasse. What a treat to have the whole thing re-created in this beautiful film. There are so many facets to it, that I can only give an overall impression. I was totally engaged from the beginning. I wasn't sure about the 3D until I was completely amazed by the effects, especially sparks from the brakes of a locomotive which seemed to fly out into the audience and the smoke which appeared to linger in the auditorium. How brilliant is that! I love the cameos of station life, the flower girl with the fresh flowers which came in on the early train, the zealous gendarme with the mechanical leg, the lady with the dog and her admirer. Those who linger on the station like the smoke from the engines and those who pass through, hardly noticing anything. This film has everything to engage the enthusiast such as re- created steam locomotives, books and an Aladin's cave of a bookshop (like Shakespeare and Co). It demonstrates the mechanics of early film making, weaving the pioneers of the art into the story with a skill which engaged me completely, and tying it into the intricate mechanics of clockwork, a theme which runs through the film. Hugo is crafted to achieve an appeal to all generations. Our family group ages ranged from 8 to 65 and we were all completely bowled over with it. The whole story is carefully explained using the medium of quality film. Wonderful!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
beautiful movie but simple story!,"Just finished watching! Well, it was worth watching it. Actually, I didn't know the story or watch any trailer before watching this movie. I was amazed how gorgeous of the visual effects, cinematography, art direction. The authentic train station really stands out in this movie. Yet, a simple story and a bit of boring. I guess because I fell asleep after 1 hour watching it. I thought it would be an fantasy adventure of a young boy, but just only about his realistic life living in the walls of a train station. However, I was really satisfied with the remaining 30 minutes of the movie. It was really touching when narrating the life of a magician, a director, an actor George Méliès. His dedication to the development in the earliest day of cinema was really amazing. I will dig more about his film afterward. Anyway, how fascinating of the train station will be in my memory forever!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Movie magic, like it once was intended to be.","At first I was not really sure what to think- and how to feel about this movie. Not beforehand but also still not afterward. It's an adventure movie that's lacking some real adventure and a family movie that probably isn't all that fun or entertaining to watch for the just entire family. Some people might even call it boring, I could imaging. But still there is something about this movie. Something magical. It's innocent, visually overwhelming and manages to come across as something fresh. This is pretty much how movies still were like, at its most early days. This movie gives you sort of that same sense and feeling of watching something totally new and innovative, for the very first time.Actually, I was never all that interested in seeing this movie in the first place. I feared the worst for it. I mean, a family movie directed by Martin Scorsese? In 3D? With children as the main characters? It all sounds so unlikely but yet after watching it, it all makes perfectly sense and everything falls into place for this movie.You could say that this movie is Scorsese's love song to cinema, in which he pays special homage to its earliest days and those who were involved with film-making at the time. And if there is one person who knows how to- and is justifiably allowed to this, it is Martin Scorsese. This guy has given so much to cinema, not only with his own movies but also by restoring and saving lots of old and cinematic historically important movies. He probably knows more about movies and the history of it than any other working movie director. Or perhaps better said; he understands movies better than anyone else!To me, this is what made ""Hugo"" a very warm and heartfelt movie. I'm pretty sure that even when you don't really know how to feel about this movie, it still gives you a happy feeling regardless, that you just can't really explain. It's because of the magic of film-making, that Scorsese manages to put in this movie. Perhaps this is just a movie you shouldn't think to much about but simply let it come over and simply experience it for what it is. It's a movie that plays to all your senses and provokes lots of different emotions.Especially visually this is one wonderful. Normally an $170,000,000 sounds like an absolute absurd thing but in this case, I'm glad they spend so much money on it! And it also shows all on the screen. The movie entirely recreates a certain time period and has a wonderful, warm, atmosphere to it as well. The sets are all grand and great looking ones and so are its special effects. No, this is not a science-fiction movie but it still is a movie that is heavy on its effects, which in this case is something the movie absolutely benefited from.What I also liked about this movie was the way the story kept bouncing around. Most of the time you will have absolutely no idea what the direction the movie will be heading in, which makes the movie surprising, as well as original. It's best to simply go watch this movie, without knowing anything about it.The kid actors Asa Butterfield and Chloë Grace Moretz do a good job at carrying almost the entire movie but lets please not forget about its adult cast. Call me weird but I got a kick out of it seeing Christopher Lee in a Scorsese movie (but then again, I always love seeing him, in anything!) and I also absolutely loved Ben Kingsley. And sorry but this is something I really have to say; Sacha Baron Cohen is an absolute comical genius. His role at first sight might come across like some lame and forced but he really manages to turn it into something absolutely hilarious. His comical timing- as well as his overall acting skills are brilliant in this movie and I'm happy to see him appear in more and more big movies and receiving all of the credits he deserves for it.Now, I'll definitely admit that this is not a perfect movie. The way of storytelling and the story itself is still somewhat lacking, which doesn't always make this a throughout fun, entertaining or compelling movie to watch and you feel that the movie is still lacking a certain edge to it all. It's a warm and heartfelt movie but with a little bit better writing, the movie perhaps also could had been a good dramatic or emotional one. This was something, I felt, the movie was lacking. It's not always being a very open and inviting movie, that gets you involved with the story or its characters.Other than that, this remains a great watch and a great example of how some great movie making can create movie magic, which it manages to do, by going back to the earliest days of cinema, when every movie experience was something new, overwhelming and joyous.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Trip to the Moon,"As I watched Hugo, I was transported back to when I was a younger film student. In particular, the first time I saw George Melies's groundbreaking silent picture, ""A Trip to the Moon"". Every film student, one way or another, is exposed to Melies and consequently inspired by his works. Such is the case of the ultimate film scholar, Martin Scorsese. Though the tone of this film is a drastic departure from the dark, violent themes and characters of the Scorsese filmography, perhaps there was no better filmmaker to have made this film than him. A master filmmaker, with an encyclopedia's knowledge of film history is the only person suitable to make such a love letter to the humble beginnings of cinema.Hugo is a heartwarming picture. The cast is marvelous, and so is the production design. Not without it's flaws, in terms of run time, it could've been much tighter.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Bring a pillow & jammies.    This one's a sleeper.,"So entirely disappointed by the most boring movie ever. I kept twisting and turning and ho-humming in my seat waiting and begging for something to happen. Nothing ever did. Sure there were a few scenes where the 3D looked great. I wasn't looking for a special effects movie, I was looking for the story...... and the story I hated. The story was so geared towards movie buffs, old movies; there is hardly a child that will understanding nor care about the plot. I almost fell asleep. I had such high hopes for this one. I didn't cry, I didn't chuckle.... just watched, and watched, and watched. It felt like it would never end. After awhile all I could think of is the $20 I spent plus the $20 for popcorn and soda and what I could have done with my $40.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Martin Scosese's Hugo provides some great insight on the wonders of early cinema,"Before watching this with my movie theatre-working friend, I had previously watched many Martin Scorsese pictures that were violent or at least adult concerning subject matter. This one is meant for families but also offers something of a historical matter concerning the beginnings of the magic of the movies. As the young protagonists, Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz provide a nice way to identify with their plight and Ben Kingsley is fine as the now-financially strapped magician/filmmaker Georges Melies who gets a reevaluation with their help and that of a chronologist, Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg), who happens to be his biggest fan. Anyone who appreciates film history and preservation should marvel at the way Scorsese shows various clips of many classic silent movies that get showcased here other than those of Melies like my wondrous reaction when a clip of Harold Lloyd's Safety Last (which I recently watched on YouTube) was shown when Hugo and Isabelle were sneaking into a cinema. All I'll say now is I highly recommend Hugo. Oh, and the 3-D imagery was great, too.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

When Dreams Win or Martin Scorsese's Fairy Tale,"Adventure, fairy tale. The film adaptation of the children's book ""The Invention of Hugo Cabre"" by American writer Brian Selznick, directed by me ardently respected director Martin Scorsese. I have not read the book, so I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. I first got acquainted with this picture in the thirteenth year, when I watched pictures with the participation of Jude Law, and after viewing I was a little disappointed - there was quite a bit of Jude in the picture, but still a trace in my soul remained. After a while, I decided to review it, and then again, and this review was a great reason to review it for the fourth time. And for Martin Scorsese, making a children's and family picture was, well, frankly not a terrible format. And here's my brief opinion - Martin Scorsese's Fairy Tale. Despite my warm feelings for this picture, which I have no reason to change, there are drawbacks in it, which I will definitely mention, but for now, let me share the good, that is, the advantages of this touching fairy tale.
So the pros:
1. The story told - the picture tells about the boy Hugo Karba (by the way, in the original the picture is simply called ""Hugo"", but the Russian distributors decided to show off and called it ""Time Keeper"", for which I scold them), an orphan living at the Montparnasse train station in the famous city of Paris, which keeps track of the numerous clocks that are installed at the station with a clear purpose, and along the way tries to assemble a robot (in the picture of an ""automaton"") - the only memory of his father. He does not yet know that an ordinary case will push him to amazing discoveries and incredible adventures that will not only change his life, but everyone around him. Moreover, the film tells the story of Georges Méliès, one of the pioneers of cinema. A story about life, a story about love, a story about dreams, a story about cinema and about a movie, a story of ordinary people. Adventure, audacity, chases, humor - it's all there. Well, morality, where is without it. I don't know how it was in the book and whether much was cut or altered, but I liked the script.
2. A picture - from a visual point of view, a picture is a poured masterpiece, which is not surprising, because it was filmed in 3D, so they did not save money with effects. The picture is replete with all shades of different colors, from the darkest, symbolizing sadness and sadness, to the lightest - symbolizing joy and inner peace. Paris is great! It beckons the viewer on the other side of the screen, it is a pity that the station building where the picture takes place is no longer there, and Paris itself now looks far from being as rosy and romantic as in the old years. Alas, sad reality. In general, the picture is a real feast for the eyes, and even ten years after its release, it looks no less excellent than in the year it was released.
3. Music - the composer of the picture was the great and terrible Howard Shore himself - the one who wrote the music for the trilogies ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"". All the music in the film is a reference in the direction of France, which is very noticeable, well, and a little classics, of course. I will not say what attracts to ""Oscar"", but in the picture it sounds right. But you obviously won't want to listen separately. Nothing can be done about it.
4. Emotions - the picture, although childish, contains many sentimental moments that cause tears in viewers of all ages. No, there is by no means too much with this, but there are clearly more sad moments here than happy ones. This, although a fairy tale, is diluted with the harsh truth of life very much. The ending is obvious for the genre. And the story itself is presented from the correct point of view and teaches good, although for a child this may be a little unusual (although what am I talking about? Modern children know more at their age than you at their age).
5. Morality is to believe in a dream, go to it, and on the way you will meet people who will definitely support you, but there will be difficulties that must be overcome without fail. Don't give up! To not give up! And no matter how painful life is for you - believe that everything will work out for you!
So the cons:
1. Georges Méliès - only part of the director's true biography was told in the film, and some moments were invented for the sake of entertainment, well, and touching, I will not blame the scriptwriters, because everything worked out as it should. In reality, it was even worse with Georges Méliès, many facts would simply not have entered the picture. This picture is not a biography though. The real Georges Méliès was a movie wizard, a romantic, along with the Lumière brothers, who launched the cinema, which from the entertainment of the public led to a colossal industry with millions of people involved, expensive equipment, greedy producers, where such sums are spinning that we never even dreamed of. Romantics and dreamers created cinema, and bourgeois and capitalists turned it into what it is today. And the discoverers were thrown out as unnecessary and forgotten, like Georges Méliès, who ended his days in a nursing home, next to his beloved wife. Romantics create, but use what they have created, after their departure, completely different people who are not driven by art. The cruel truth of life.
2. Antics and replaying - not from all heroes, but some do it too caricaturely. Yes, I understand that the picture is childish, but damn it, guys, could it be done somehow more gracefully? No? What a pity!
A little about the main characters:
1. Hugo Karbe performed by Asa Butterfield - an orphan living at the train station, a talented mechanic trying to restore his father's automaton. Brave and determined, who will have a long journey, from which he will definitely come out the winner. Ace was still a child in the year the picture was released, but he coped quite well with the role, that's for sure. Well done!
2. Isabelle played by Chloe Grace Moretz is a casual acquaintance of Hugo who lives in the Melies family. A young and curious girl who pushed Hgo to adventure and opened many things for him. Young Chloe successfully coped with the role.
3. Georges Melies performed by Ben Kingsley is a former director, dragging a miserable and unworthy existence of such a genius. A sad old man, immersed in himself, who is burdened by the past. Powerful Ben did not disappoint even here, having played the legend of cinema at the highest level. My compliments sir! I shake your hand!
Well, I would also like to mention Sasha Baron Cohen, who played the role of an evil, caricatured, but good at heart, the station keeper, Sir Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths (Vernon Durrsle), Jude Law and Emily Mortimer. It was very pleasant to see them all.
The picture is not a masterpiece, but it is very good, which snatched five Oscars (then still valid), and almost all the figurines are deserved. But financially, the picture failed, without even beating off its own budget and advertising costs (budget - one hundred and fifty million, excluding advertising, and box office - one hundred and eighty-five), which is sad. Maybe it's all the fault of expectations, because Martin Scorsese is known for his excellent crime dramas, and here is a film adaptation of a children's book. Maybe so, or maybe the reason is different, we will not know this.
As a result, we have a good fairy tale by Martin Scorsese with a great and sad story, great picture, good music and a number of powerful actors who play their roles perfectly.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story line combining fact and fiction is a masterful accomplishment. The casting is a total joy... Ben Kingsley's portrayal of a young/old Georges Melies is probably my favorite among his vast list of achievements, and the young lad, Asa Butterfield who is Hugo, will win your heart and break your heart in turn.

"Hugo, a historical drama about a boy who lives in a train station.","This film was a true tribute to the silent film era. I loved that the main character Hugo who is a nobody, played such a big part in running the the Paris train station, and that the movie was shown from the point of view of a child. In my opinion thats what makes a perfect children's film, which was adapted from the children's novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret. There was great contrast between light and dark scenes. In the lighter scenes there was high exposure which gave it a happier vibe, compare to the darker scene with lower exposure which gave it more of a grim atmosphere. In addition there was great CGI of Paris and the 3D gave the movie some extra depth and made it more realistic. One scene where Isabelle falls in the train station had lots of quick cuts and a worms eye view, it was true to the time period in the film industry. The film makers began to start to play with different camera angles in that era. The angles of the cameras shot the machinery with all the gears, and levers made it look magical. The set design was also magnificent with the intricacies, scope, and industrial look. There were two little thing that bugged me during the film. The first was the constant fog, it seems like they had a fog machine and wanted to use it as much as they could. Secondly it seemed like all the actors had British instead of french accents, it made it feel like I was in London instead of Paris. On the flip side the chemistry between Isabelle and Hugo was sublime and they really played off each other very well. Ben Kingsley also looked perfect for the role of George Méliès, it would be hard to tell the difference if you put Ben and George side by side. My personal favourite part of the film was the dogs, they added a cute touch. Lastly Sacha Baron Cohen who played the station inspector did a great job of presenting slapstick comedy which was relevant during that era. Overall it was a great children's movie that can be thoroughly enjoyed by both children and adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A solid addition to the oeuvre of a genius.,"Everything, and everyone, has a purpose. Martin Scorsese has spent decades further establishing his purpose, which is to create glorious cinema. He has been infatuated with it for his entire life, and 2011's Hugo is his love letter to the craft in its early ages. Simultaneously, it is somewhat of a fairy tale catering primarily to children - a genre in which the legendary director is well, not exactly known for.The setting is magical 1930s Paris. A young orphan, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) fixes clocks and such gadgets in a train station, where he also lives. His one goal is to find the missing heart-shaped key that was meant for a mechanical man his father once built. When he meets a shopkeeper with a secret, Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley), and his adventurous young daughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), he may just be able to achieve this goal.It isn't a particularly compelling story, but when you put a master behind it, you're bound to get something of worth. The film excels in technical departments. With Robert Richardson's seamless cinematography (paired with some CGI) and Thelma Schoonmaker's sharp editing skills, the final product is a wonder to look at. However, the central material at hand is so different from the kind of subject matter Scorsese got into the business for in the first place that the magic he is able to exude from a piece of work is often lost here. He does maintain his signature style, but it isn't quite enough to allow this film to rise into sensational territory for its majority.But Hugo does provide an inner layer within all of this that does hint at much more. When older-era films become a significant plot point, Scorsese is able to explore the stuff that he truly loves. Not only do these sequences shine over everything else in the film, but they also give off the impression that they are the sole reason Scorsese was interested in making this film at all. Through montages including one that explains the background of Kingsley's character, the core of the film is brought to light and emulated beautifully, sure to please any true fan of the art form. Kingsley gives the best performance in the film by far as a broken man who has lost his strongest passion.While the film is enjoyable overall, with a lot to admire in the technique, there are only sparks of greatness to be found that nail the higher notes Scorsese is capable of hitting. With hardly adequate child performances and a clumsy Sacha Baron Cohen character thrown into the mix, Hugo is for the most part a rather mild and lesser effort amongst such an amazing filmography. At the end of the film, the cinematic homage storyline is wrapped up in a mesmerizing way, with a potentially unforgettable closing line and a sequence that capsulizes the magic of the medium that Scorsese has conveyed in the past. Then he adds one more scene to close the main storyline involving the children. It is a much less remarkable climax, lacking the grandness of what came before it. Scorsese shoots it in one of his classic long continuous shots, but there isn't a whole lot beyond his technical artistry. Having said that, Hugo is quite a good film with some fantastic individual scenes, and while it may be closer to the bottom tier of the man's work, that is by no means a bad thing considering his brilliance.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't believe the high rating.

Like a piece of fine literature projected onto the big screen,"I just rented this movie on amazon and set aside two hours to watch this, and I'm in love with it.This movie is both great in general terms and in a personal touch. I am a big fan of movies, I like the movie-going experience, and I am also an adventurer, so in that regard, this movie touched my heart. Hugo is a boy who used to work with his father fixing clocks and tweaking other sorts of gadgetry. When his dad passes away, Hugo keeps on working on his dad's last project, an automaton that is missing a key to make it work again. This makes me curious about simpler times (1930's), in a culture where people were more polite, well-dressed, well-mannered, and a young boy could learn how to work with machines just by following his dad's footsteps. What is it about France that makes movies so classy and great? (The Artist and Midnight in Paris were nominated for best picture, along with this).One of my favorite aspects of this movie is how much it looks and feels like a book adaptation. I could point out some scenes and parts that could be analyzed and interpreted in different ways like Shakespeare literature. For example, when the actor tells a young Rene Tabard that dreams come from movies, it made me pay attention to how the movie was showing some scenes that were dream-like, like when the train derails and crashes through the station and out the window in to the street in Hugo's dream. I also thought the parts with the dogs and their owners and the train inspector's love interest were an example of old style movies, in the sense that they were not 2 hour long videos like today, but rather short scenes and skits that, when composed together, told a simple story, like ""Trip To The Moon"".And then there's the score.

"If you like Carlos Ruiz Zafon , ""The Shadow of the Wind"" novel, you'll love this movie !","If you're reading my review, either you know of Carlos Zafon's books and you are compelled by my reference or you haven't got a clue of what am i talking about and so you're curious to see why i posted a title like that.If you know of Carlos Zafon's books and you're still here reading this, chances are that you absolutely loved his novels such as ""The Shadow of the Wind""',""Angel's Game"" and ""Marina"", at the most.So...if just by me mentioning Zafon's ""The Shadow of the Wind"" is enough for you to recall that haunted, poetic and beautiful atmosphere from his books, well strangely enough it's all here exactly like that in this Scorcese movie !  Because...Watching Hugo is like reading the Carlos Ruiz Zafon book he never wrote but could have written and this is very hard to explain to people who haven't experienced this film knowing about novels like ""The Shadow of the Wind"".The way the plot feels almost non existent if you're expecting it to be like a typical Hollywood movie where everything has to be explained , defined and mixed with action scenes every ten minutes. The way it creates a magical world based on real places as Scorcese does with Paris in the movie what Zafon does it with Barcelona in his novels. The way characters are all weaved into the atmosphere of the place and although their stories don't need to touch they are all part of the same magical universe, which has magic without the need to have traditional fairytale or fantasy stuff in. Christopher Lee in this movie plays exactly the same character you can find in Zafons novel , The Shadow of the Wind as the secret library book keeper!!So what does this all mean if you're just a casual movie goer, don't like to read and you're expecting Hugo to be like a typical action packed fantasy movie for kids ?... Well , it isn't, you've been fooled by the trailer and Hugo is not the new Harry Potter. Deal with it ! By saying this i really cannot believe that so many people attack Hugo here in IMDb, mostly because they though the trailer mislead them. You're fooled, so what ? Why throw your anger at the movie because some wise guy at the marketing department sold it as something that is not ? Why cant these angry reviewers just try to enjoy this movie for what it is ?! A fantastic but most of all - a different (!!) Hollywood movie coming out of studios that usually just throw another brainless Transformer (or clone) at you every other weekend.There's nothing wrong with the plot in Hugo. It's simple but its incredibly well done and contrary to what some bad reviews said, it was a joy to follow the (obvious) mystery, because the magic in this movie was not in th mystery or in he suspense scenes (much less in the action scenes) , but in the general ensemble final atmosphere that every little piece of the visual puzzle created. Sets, characters, world and love for the cinema. Also, i didn't think this is a movie for kids, or at least its not a kids movie for sure. Its just a movie with kids in it ! And probably one of the best and most beautiful looking movies i ever seen. If you like illustration or you're an illustrator you'll love this film to death. Its a visual steam-punk masterpiece.Contrary to what some other reviewers felt, personally, i cannot compare it to Cinema Paradiso because for me the real footage from Meliés movies didn't affected me at all with the same dramatic punch Tornatore's movie did at the end and so to me if there was something missing from Hugo was a bit of emotion and also character development because in some parts of the movie i wanted to see more of the many characters and little stories but they're never fully developed.  But i liked the little touches, i was captivated by the small glimpses of love-stories and really liked Sacha Baron Choen character which to me is really the heart of the movie in a strange kind of way that maybe shouldn't have been like that.Overall i think this is a fantastic and unique movie and one of the best American love letters to cinema I've ever seen. I wished it could be as emotional as Cinema Paradiso but it isn't and that is the only reason i don't give it ten stars. Otherwise its brilliant, poetic and beautiful in more than one way.Although i agree a little bit with people who said the documentary style stuff stalls the plot and makes some parts of Hugo seem like they belong in a different movie. I agree that was not a good choice by Scorcese and to me th repetition of those bits in the second half of the story really toned down the dramatic effect and shouldn't have been done like that at all.   The way the real footage was inserted felt too intrusive and split the movie in pieces for too many seconds several times when it needed to create more empathy with the audience and the characters. Anyway... If you don't go into it expecting the usual Hollywood crap blockbuster you'll enjoy the way the story is weaved. Above all if you like books and have a passion for cinema you wont forget Hugo so soon.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Martin Scorsese's Love Letter To Cinema Is Both Endearing & Frustrating,"An endearing love letter to the cinematic art form advertised as a big-budget, family-friendly adventure to its audience, Martin Scorsese's Hugo dazzles & captivates with its exquisite use of 3D photography but the wizardry it conjures in the art direction & cinematography section is missing on the storytelling front, for the narrative is slow, stale & devoid of compelling characters. And though the film captures the magic of moviemaking in all its glamour & glory, its wandering plot, clunky narration, bland characterisation, glacial pace & overlong runtime results in a dull, flat, tedious & emotionally vapid experience that will test the patience of many, if not all.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo Review,"Hugo, though aesthetically interesting in relation to its cinematography, falls short in other areas. The movie's colouring brought a youthful element to each shot which aligned well with the story and its main characters. What distracted me the most was dialogue and pacing. The way that each scene moved felt sort of rushed in a way while simultaneously moving quite slow. However, the overall story was well done when considering its target audience. When I first watched this movie, I was quite a bit younger and looking back, I remember enjoying the movie. Presently, I've found that the movie isn't something I could see myself going back to. I did enjoy it, but it just didn't hold my attention.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A kid's movie for adult kids,"The themes that Martin Scorsese addresses in this film—the thin line between self-recrimination and nostalgia, the effects of advancing technology on thriving art forms, and the lasting effects of a father's love—would seem misguided in a typical children's film. ""Hugo,"" however, a children's film directed by Scorsese—one of the greatest American film directors of all time (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" ""The Aviator,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Departed"")—is no typical children's film. Scorsese has made a children's film for adults who still experience the joys, wonders, mysteries, and painful epiphanies of childhood.First of all, the ""exotic"" setting of a 1930s Parisian train station establishes the wistful tone. The film is beautiful to behold—the colors, the cinematography, the set design, and the art direction are all stunningly beautiful. The plot itself focuses on the titular hero, a young boy who lives in the rafters and bowels of the station and spends his time adjusting the station's numerous clocks, evading the menacing pursuit of the Station Inspector (played by an appropriately surly Sacha Baron Cohen), and searching for parts that animate the automaton left to him by his dead father (played by Jude Law in an unfortunately brief appearance). Through the course of his quest, Hugo encounters an elderly shopkeeper (Ben Kingsley in another masterful performance), the shopkeeper's god-daughter, and a film historian. Through these connections, Hugo begins to piece together not only the mystery of the automaton but also the impact of the beginnings of cinema as an art form.The film is sumptuous, the plot is charming, the actors are magnificent—yet somehow the film amounts to far less than the sum of its parts. I found myself bored at many points during the film—the story seems to linger a bit too much, allowing the viewer to appreciate (almost excessively so) the aesthetic and nostalgic beauty of the film. Overall, I'm glad I've seen it, but ""Hugo"" is not a film that I plan on ever watching again.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's hard to fault this perfectly executed adventure fantasy,"The fact that Ben Kingsley doesn't overact here you would think is blessing enough, but even more impressive is the discovery of someone like Asa Butterfield who is a director's dream and undoubtedly a once in a lifetime find. If that wasn't enough, Sacha Baron Cohen gives a wonderful performance which, surprisingly, makes up for all the crude and gross shenanigans he's engaged in up til now. I'd feel good about recommending it on the strength of his performance alone. Still, this is pretty much a kid's movie with themes a kid should be able to understand and feel an affinity to. That it can charm adults as well is a real tribute to Scorsese's unassailable mastery of the medium.Scorsese probably thought that the story's eventual involvement with the birth of film gave him an excuse to pursue this children's story, but I was left wondering why he hasn't done even more in the same vein. I for one enjoyed this movie more than any of his previous films despite the subject matter or that it's a fantasy. Also it seemed odd to me given Scorsese's love of Italian themes that this movie is set in Paris, but it's a virtual love letter to a not too long ago Paris of steam engines and minimal conveniences.I even saw it in 3-D which I was resolved not to see unless absolutely necessary.

beautiful...but...,"Okay, this movie is beautiful and all but that does not make up for the storyline. It tends to labor on and on in order to maximize the visually amazing sets and graphics.

Not to take anything away from this movie, I was impressed by the cast and the fact that Sacha Cohen does a pretty decent job.

I was hoping for the best but...,"After reading all of the positive reviews following it's release, I was really excited to see Hugo, but I was utterly underwhelmed to say the least. Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker, which just adds to my confusion about how bad this movie was.The story is never really intriguing to begin with, but it devolves into messier, and less interesting territory as the film progresses. By the time I had gotten to the final reel, I was just praying for it to end.I mean, it's great that Scorsese wants to share his knowledge and love for movies, but he can do that in much less time. This is a thirty minute movie drawn out to over two hours, and that is it's major flaw. This could have been made into a short and been far more effective, allowing the thin story line to be constrained into a shorter running time, so that it was not drawn out and boring.The film has been advertised as a kid's movie, DO NOT TAKE YOUR KIDS TO SEE THIS MOVIE. They will be bored to tears, they won't be able to follow the meandering, thin story, and there's not any action to get them through it.All this being said, there are small things that are good about Hugo. The performances are great, it's visually stunning, and there's a beautiful tracking shot, but this is not enough to carry a long, boring endeavor that will ultimately leave a lot of audiences frustrated.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What A Wonderful World of A Huge Cabaret,"When I first heard about Martin Scorsese was going to direct a family adventure movie, I said to myself I had to check thiz out! As we know before, Scorsese is a Director who is widely known for most of his gangster and violent movies such as ""Casino"" (1995), ""The Departed"" (2006) and ""Shutter Island"" (2010). Since the opening sequence, we are spoiled with such fantastic panoramic scenery. Dynamic camera movements effectively draw you into the story in a split second, where we follow the daily life of an orphan named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) in 1930s France. Hugo lives inside the tower clock of a crowded train station. By his curiosity, Hugo has been trying to fix an automaton in human form that his father (played by Jude Law) left him. Not long after, it takes him to Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) with his toy booth. The premise is about the mystery behind it. Asa Butterfield, the boy who played in ""The Boy in Striped Pajamas"" in 2008, seems to be a proper choice for Hugo. His sad blue eyes tell everything. Ben Kingsley also delivers a firm and attractive performance. Only after about an hour, the things become more clearly. Apparently, thiz movie tells about the magical world of movie-making. I have to underline thiz, the whole package is visually stunning! I'm amazed by its remarkable setting, the exotic lighting schemes and the exquisite cinematography. Everything at its best, everyone can tell. The story is filled with various unique characters which are played by well-known Actors, there are the adventuress Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who is Papa Georges's goddaughter, the grumpy station inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen), the flower girl Lisette (Emily Mortimer), the kind-hearted librarian Monsieur Labisse (Christopher Lee) and still many more to mention. But if you want to be objective, most of these characters can be pushed away easily without too much ruining the main plot. I mean everyone! They are only here to become unimportant extras. Except for the station inspector, he is the only antagonist, we still need him! The character is played comically well by Sacha Baron Cohen. Without him, there will be no chasing scene and nail-biting suspense. Clearly, the main frame of the story is not that complicated at all. In fact, it's kind of flat and anticlimax. To tell you the truth, I didn't have ""The Wow Factor"" for the ending. Well, I never read the book before, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian Selznick. So I cannot tell you whether or not, disadvantage of the story is derived from basic material. However, thiz is an award winning book, it has won Caldecott Medal in 2008. In that case, if it's true that is the whole story. What we can say Scorsese has already done one hell of a job. Hugo said, ""Movie had the power to capture dream"" and Scorsese has definitely captured one perfectly.

Scorsese does it again in a brand new genre,"This visually dazzling film is Martin Scorsese's tribute to the history of cinema. The film celebrates the escapist roots and pioneers of the art form that quickly became the most popular and influential of the modern era. The wide-eyed title character, Hugo Cabret, is drawn unlike most child characters in the movies. He has real integrity and curiosity; features contributed mainly by John Logan's warm script and Asa Butterfield's performance. The film also doesn't talk down to it's audience even though it's a family film. It still remains both elegant and innocent giving children and adults two different film experiences. For kids (I wouldn't recommend the film to very young children) the film is an adventure full of eye-popping visuals. For adults however, the film is a tale of redemption and second chances.In the last act of the film, the characters frequently reference the magic of cinema and it's transportive quality. It's at this point in the film that we realise that Scorsese has been working that very same magic established by filmmakers such as Melies, Keaton and Lloyd on us.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But since they are children, it wasn't something that bothered me. And why do they all have British accents?

Hugo: Like A Tin Man In Search of a Heart,"This film is recommended.Time is of the essence and creativity is at the heart of Hugo, Martin Scorsese's so-called children's film about a boy and his robot. It's 1930 and Hugo Cabret ( Asa Butterfield ) is an orphan who secretly lives behind the clockwork of a Paris train station and dreams of a better life. Left alone by his inventor father, played by Jude Law, Hugo survives from day to day at the Gare Montparnasse. His father's lasting legacy to him is a robot in need of repair which Hugo diligently works on using stolen gears from a toy store at the station. One of the missing components is an elusive key to put all the gears into motion. Achieving that goal will take him on a journey unlike any before.It is at the train depot that he soon befriends a shop owner ( Ben Kingsley, giving a superb performance ) and his daughter, Isabelle ( Chloe Grace Moretz ). However, not everyone finds Hugo endearing, especially the station inspector who is always on the hunt for him. Sasha Baron Cohen plays the villain of the piece and provides the broad comedy and slapstick to entertain the younger members of the movie audience while the older moviegoers can be transported along with them to an imaginative world of adventure.Based on Brian Selznick best-selling book, The Inventions of Hugo Cabret, and adapted by John Logan, the film is breathtaking in its visual splendor, but rather mechanical and leaden in its story. The characters and sets seem to be inspired and resemble the detailed illustrations of another children's author, Chris VanAllberg. With the state-of-the-art technology on this big screen adaptation, the camera artfully glides and soars, showcases the 3-D experience to its maximum effect and in the hands of a master like Scorsese. All moviegoers will be totally enthralled by the CGI, even when the story begins to lose some momentum in its narrative focus. The tracking shots, especially the opening sequence, and the fluid camera movements are astonishing and literally carry the viewer into a journey to another dimension. Scorsese's impressive use of swinging pendulums, metal staircases and moving gears, his use of smoke and dust particles floating in the air, his aerial perspectives within the train station, all add to the film's sense of awe. ( By the way, Hugo's surrealistic dream sequence is pure artistry. ) This film's technical craftsmanship is the best use of 3-D since Avatar.Yet, my movie-going experience felt a bit incomplete due to the narrative structure of the film. At times, Hugo strays from the central plot and begins to meander. The children's adventure is at odds with its overt history lesson of early filmmaking. The two story lines never connect. The first half of the film is too leisurely paced and the minor characters remain only one- dimensional, continually upstaged by the lavish three-dimensional trappings. Children should be children, and children's films should be children's films, keeping their lighthearted nature with less pontificating. When Hugo takes itself too seriously, which is most of the time, it becomes somewhat inert.The film wants to work on another more sophisticated level with its love of film imagery and its heartfelt nostalgic view of the early days of filmmaking. While the film has moments that enchants as a children's fantasy should, to this adult in the audience, it became slightly desperate in its attempt to become more serious straining its credibility whenever it served as an homage to talents of Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and specifically to Georges Méliès, a pioneer of early cinema. ( In fact, the shopkeeper is one and the same man and that plot device bears some truth. )Scorsese has assembled a first-class team to handle the production values: music score by Howard Shore, absolutely terrific cinematography by Robert Richardson, editing by Thelma Schoonmaker, costumes by Sandy Powell, and an overall production design by Dante Ferretti, whose period sets are reminiscent of the old sepia stereoscopic images of time past. These are all gifted and accomplished artisans in their respective fields, and this film contains some of their finest work to date.Like its automaton, Hugo is a technically brilliant creation lacking in genuine emotion. Still, the film is quite captivating and an impressive achievement in modern day filmmaking. ( Make sure you take the time to see this film experience in its 3-D format and on the large screen for optimal effect. ) Hugo is a thrilling joyous ride into the world of 3-D and the vivid imagination of one of our foremost directors.

dreams of cinema,"For me the rebirth of cinema in 3D, the moment when the technology met with art is not 'Avatar' but Scorsese's 'Hugo'. James Cameron's film validated the technology, brought it into the mainstream, and – of course – made a lot of money in the process. Hugo is in my opinion the first great film realized in this technology, taking a rather melodramatic story targeting the all family audiences and using 3D to amplify the visual effects, to create a world of dreams and fantasy – the material great films are made from. Based on the Paris of the 1920th it recreates the city on screen in a manner that is spectacular and sensitive at the same time, and populates it with characters who meld the qualities of fiction heroes and flesh and blood humans. The complexity of the staging, the attention to the details, the pace of the action and of the moves of the camera, the world of objects who surround the heroes – all this get together in a charming visual experience. We have known many versions of Paris in art, some from books like (Victor) Hugo, some from photos like the ones of Brassai or Robert Doisneau, some from works of art like the paintings of the Impressionist era, now we have the Paris as imagined by Martin Scorsese.Bringing George Melies into the story is a real touch of genius.This film is a love declaration for cinema, full of respect and quotes from famous movies. The comparison with the other big film about cinema in 2011 The Artist is immediate and makes us forget immediately the simplistic kiddish story. But the story itself has a quality that makes jealous the current Disney productions. This is real Disney stuff, the one that would not make Master Walt blush as would the majority if not all the scripts of the films made by the studios who inherited his name. This is the Disney of Fantasia, the one that made me dream and cross the barriers of imagination.George Melies actually did break with the studios and retired from film making before the war, and many of his films were destroyed to be used to manufacture military materials. He had a shop in the Montparnasse train station, and even if a round-eyed boy who was making the clocks turn in the station did not really exist – the imagined part of the story is as good and as moving as the real one.A film like Hugo does not necessarily excel in acting, although big names show up in the cast and do more than a decent job. Ben Kingsley adds George Melies to the gallery of the great personalities he brought to life in his screen career, and Sacha Baron Cohen proves that he can be funny also out of his usual stand-up comedy style. It is however the complex and beautiful world in which the characters move will be the one that we shall remember from this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"too much, yet not enough","Hugo is an odd hybrid of children's fantasy and adult drama set in Paris around 1930 and based, like so many movies nowadays, on a comic book (or ""illustrated novel"" in this case). Half of it is about the title character, Hugo Cabret, a mechanically gifted boy living and working cockroach-like behind the walls of a grand train station where he maintains the clocks, having been trained in that skill by his alcoholic uncle who adopted him after his father died in a fire. The other half is a fictionalized treatment of the life of pioneering filmmaker Georges Melies who spent most of his later years in relative obscurity and poverty. The two stories are brought together by the device of a broken automaton, along the lines of the ""Maria"" robot in Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis,"" left to Hugo by his father. In his spare time, Hugo meticulously repairs this machine which is designed to write on paper with a pen but the heart-shaped key that activates it is missing and Hugo can never learn what the automaton can write until he can find the key, which, as we learn through various plot meanderings, is owned by the goddaughter of old Melies, who operates a toy concession in the train station and has kept his former fame a secret from the lass. Not only is she unaware that her godfather is one of the inventors of motion pictures, she has never even seen one in her life. It is young Hugo who takes her to the cinema for the first time. And what is playing? Harold Lloyd's ""Safety Last,"" with the famous hanging-from-the-clock sequence.The title character states that the world is a vast machine and because machines have no unnecessary parts, each person in the world has a purpose in the way that each part of a machine has a purpose. Director Martin Scorsese's way of bringing this notion to life is labor intensive, to say the least, obsessed with busy-ness and maze-like detail. The frames are filled with crowds of people bustling about in all directions; behind the walls of the train station where Hugo lives and works is a network of winding corridors and staircases leading to a succession of rooms populated by turning gears of all sizes. The actors (including Ben Kingsley as Melies, Asa Butterfield in the title role and Jude Law as his father) are adequate but essentially serve as support for the environment, a digital paean to the mechanical age.Along the way we are treated to a brilliantly surprising dream-within-a dream sequence and interesting reenactments of how Melies created short films in his glass-enclosed studio. The camera-work is sometimes breathtaking and the replication of Paris circa 1930, although artificial in a CGI way, is nonetheless impressive. We do get a sense of the deep sadness felt by an artist who was forced by changing socio-economic conditions and public tastes to abandon his main passion. But overall there are not enough compelling moments to justify the expense and effort of creating the vast, clicking, ticking infrastructure that houses them.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Complex characters that outshine its plot,"Hugo is as much an ode to filmmaking as it is to the joy and wonder of childhood. In Hugo, Scorsese has taken a break from writing films about violence and gangsters, to return to a story that celebrates the creativity and joy of early filmmaking. Hugo's strength is in its cinematography, characters, and set design. Scorsese uses mechanics, sounds and costuming to recreate the environment of an early twentieth century train station. Although the story itself might leave a little to be desired, the world it takes place in does not. The train station feels real, in part to Scorsese refusing to allow any of his background characters to be one dimensional. For example, the station constable (played by Sacha Baron Cohen), is not simply a mustache twirling villain wishing harm on the orphans of Paris, he is a man hurt from his time in the war, and presumably his own time at the orphanage. We see him many times trying to talk to the woman who runs the flower stand, and each time he feels as though he isn't worthy because of his disability. It would have been easy for Scorsese to fall into the trap of many filmmakers of children's movies- making flat villains, but he refuses to ""baby"" his audience and instead allows them to see the gray of these people. The plot line of Hugo might not be the most complicated or creative, but it's characters are anything but.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The thing that kept me watching really was the fact that I wanted to know where the hell the story was going, and I really enjoyed the last 30 minutes when you realise what the film is all about.

"A beautiful but woeful, empty film","At the beginning of Hugo, we're promised a charming tale of a boy living in a train station who forms a relationship with a bitter old toymaker and his intrepid goddaughter.Oh, and there's a robot-toy.For the first half of the film, there is NO mention of films or film-making. Well into the film the boy and girl talk about films. He is aghast that she has never seen a film, so they go watch one.It is like the director dropped what he was doing with ""Hugo"" and just suddenly decided that he wanted to make a movie about movies. From there, it becomes a self-indulgent tale about a filmmaker.Oh, and Jude Law has a one-scene cameo as the boy's father. The scene suggests that there's a mystery to be unfolded later on - but on that storyline we're left stone cold.Visually, every moment of this film is outstanding, maybe even magical - but substantively it is not about anything at all.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Orphan boy magically rescues recluse movie icon from self pity,"This small train station adventure led us to the grander one of movie making and, therefore, a movie lovers' treat! Asa Butterfields' Hugo is in search for his desired secret message from his dead father that magically leads us through his underground world. Martin Scorsese's adventure here is a much longer wait that eventually awakens the past, a more innocent time of wonder and imagination that, compared to Ben Kingsleys' small toy shop keeper, looks like a remarkably lucky existence captured by the line, ""If you've ever wondered where your dreams come from, you look around... this is where they're made."" In this tale, the two eventually fix each other proving we need each other which is an appropriate, if not corny, message for movie-goers.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
cinematic marvel,"All the things you've heard about this film. Magical, whimsical, brilliantly imaginative, one of the best films of the year, are all true. Like the best family films Hugo can be both sad and a little creepy at certain times but it's also smart, funny and just plain sweet a film for lovers of film young and old. It centers on a young boy whose father passes away and lives in a train station tuning clocks and collecting parts to finish his father's last project in hopes of learning why his father is deceased. But more than that it explores how powerful the art of film is and how if you're open to it can inspire you in all of life's aspects and mysteries.As a fellow film lover myself i found myself blown away by the passion Martin Scorcesse displays on screen with the help of a talented cast and wonderful cinematography Hugo is truly cinematic marvel.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Missing Gem in Scorsese's Collection,"Take a flimsy plot , Mix it with exquisite cinematography , brilliant visual effects and a comforting background score and you will get Hugo. Hugo is not as much about its story it tries to convey as it is about the spell that Scorsese creates that transports you into some other world. Technically, Scorsese has not left any stones unturned in hes efforts to create a visual masterpiece. It goes to show the immense passion he has for Direction.The film might not appeal to all, as its pacing is very labored . One of my friend who accompanied was cursing me after the movie. But it is a must watch for Scorsese Fans like me, who have admired and loved his work to no bounds.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Love it,"I went to see this quite recently, and was glad I did. Before seeing the film, I was a little bit worried about being bored as it had a very long running time. However that worry was blown away within the first minute of seeing it. James Cameron was right, it is certainly a masterpiece. Though I have to say that the 3D didn't really add much to the film, for me. There were no real problems in it, though it wasn't perfect. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a good movie, though you have to be prepared to sit through the long running time as well as having to follow the plot. Though most will be extremely entertained in this incredible film. The acting was great, the plot was great, everything was incredible.

I've always had the discussion of the question that is better a book or a movie? I think ""Hugo"" shows that both options can create the dreams of a better world. The narrative is a tribute to that thousands of writers who try to sow THROUGH seed Displayand and so exciting and delusional like reading a book and use your imagination as a screen, by the end is to sow in your soul the desire to excel , dream of a better world.

Beautiful but flawed,"This is a lovely film, no doubt about it. It's a heart warming with some of the most well thought out cinematography I've seen in a long time. If you see this film for no other reason see it for classic shot after classic shot whether it's 3D or not.Never the less it's not perfect and the two reasons are:- the dialogue which is incredibly inconsistent and the acting which similarly sways between brilliant and average. Some of the speeches which in the film change the outlooks and attitudes of major characters, I just didn't feel would do so. When that happens you're left with that ""Oh Come on!""or""as if!"" feeling a little two often. As I've said a lot of that is down to the dialogue which isn't strong enough on occasion to elicit the resulting attitudes and actions from it's recipients no matter how well delivered and some is down to the acting which is a bit laboured now and again particularly from Hugo himself. I wonder if Martin expected a little too much from his younger talent and should have given stronger or more prescriptive direction on occasion.I'd be surprised if most young teenagers would pick up on this and I doubt it will spoil the story or cinema experience at all for those between 9 and 14. For younger children I think it will prove a bit slow. For older ones a bit ""nice"" but that's more a fault with exploitative video from the music and games industries than a serious fault with the film.In every other respect. Set design, special effects, music, minor character portrayal, costume "" apart from (like war Horse) the main characters hair-cut which is not very 1930.(My dad was 10 in 1930 I've seen the pictures), It's a tour de force.As a fifty year old film fan taking my daughter to the cinema She was bored in places but overall very much enjoyed the film.

"Scorsese's best since ""The Age of Innocence""!","""Hugo"" is a wonderful homage to the cinema, made a director, who's deeply in love with the movies. I expected ""Hugo"" to be 'just' some 3-d adventure movie for family, but it is something bigger, much bigger. It is baffling, beautiful and lovely. I don't want to write much about the plot, because watching the film is some kind of exploring a young boy's world. The sad story of an orphan in Paris is told in unique pictures and lovely characters.Scorsese's last productions have been awesome. Only ""Shutter Island"" appeared quit trivial next to epics like ""Gangs of New York"" or ""The Aviator"", but ""Hugo"" is something you see very seldom in the last years. We have seen it in ""The King's Speech"" or ""Into the Wild"". ""Hugo"" is a film of the heart. And next to ""The Artist"" the best picture of the year.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Fictional Representation of Films' History,"The movie ""Hugo"" by Martin Scorsese, represents in a creative way some of the most important moments in the beginnings of the film industry. This is done by using references to some of the first movies of the 20th Century, and also using the names of real people for some of the characters. For this reason, I think that it's not a movie for everyone and only a few will understand it and enjoy it at its full.About the movie itself, I consider the directing and cinematography pretty good, the cast's performance is acceptable, but I think the highlights of the production are the camera shots. They experiment with many different angles and set ups that make it interesting for the audience.Last but not least, the sound is really good. It is easier to follow dialogues and the music and soundtracks used make you get into the movie's spirit. Overall I think it is a movie very well made for film enthusiasts, but it may not work the same way for the rest.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Who says Scorsese was all about mobsters?,"If I am allowed to be a little subjective here, I can tell you that Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese are two of my favorite directors, but for different reasons. In terms of what they do for cinema, I can't think of a similarity in their films, except that they are film makers with passion, vision and dedication. At the time of writing this, Spielberg and Scorsese are at opposite ends of the rope, with the Oscar for ""Best Picture"" in the middle. As directors, it becomes irrelevant who wins. However, when you consider Scorsese's ""Hugo"" with Michel Hazanavicius' ""The Artist"", even seasoned critics will find it hard to choose between the two. Up until the point when I actually watched these two films, I was, like a million others, questioning the choice of ""Best Picture"" nominees for the 2012 Academy Awards. Before I tell you why ""Hugo"" is a prime contender, let me say that for a year that was not really the best in cinema, The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, in my opinion, has considered the heart and soul of cinema in comparison to what cinema has evolved into today.In comparison to his previous films, Scorsese fans are in for a totally different experience with this film. Based on Brian Selznick's novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"", we follow the titled character's adventures in repairing an automaton, a mechanized invention left behind by his deceased father. Orphaned and living alone, 12 year-old Hugo lives within the walls of a Paris railway station, maintaining various clocks and stealing food for existence. Fixated at repairing the automaton, Hugo has to retrieve a book that shows how, having lost it to a bitter old man called Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). Befriending Georges' goddaughter Isabelle (Chloë Moretz), Hugo begins a journey of discovery and quest, but must do everything he can to evade capture by a pesky railway inspector hell-bent on sending him to an orphanage.As a director and film maker, Scorsese has not only outdone himself, he has severely raised the bar in the art of storytelling. Nominations for art direction and cinematography are easily justified with visually stunning aesthetics of 1930's Paris. Clearly, production design is one of the best; a feat that I feel has outdone the art direction in ""Anonymous"". Character portrayals are another big tick mark when considering the story revolves round the lives of just a few key people. With just under three films to his credit, Asa Butterfield is impressive in his titled yet heartwarming role as a boy saddened by the loss of his father, but goes on to become a catalyst in awakening self-worth in a stranger. Reciprocating this kinship is Kingsley in another fine performance, where his Georges Méliès is constantly evolving throughout the movie. Playing a World War I veteran turned railway inspector, Sacha Baron Cohen is the comic relief, albeit with an antagonistic touch, but one that is a far cry from ""Borat"" and the revolting ""Bruno"". Good choice in casting and I hope Cohen is seen in similar roles, given his unique talent as a comedian. Also nicely done are roles from Chloë Moretz and Helen McCrory, with shorts from Christopher Lee and Jude Law.For a family adventure movie, this film is structurally intact except for a glaring flaw. Set as a period piece in 1930's Paris, there is hardly any French dialogue, and worse, absolutely no French accent from any of the characters. Am I missing something here? Why go to great lengths to make an epic movie in '30s France but have all actors sport a British accent? This flaw aside, every other aspect of the movie works in favor of making this a remarkable film. Apart from stunning visuals, fine acting and a well narrated story, the heart of this film lies in the homage it pays towards movies as an art form. Call it a movie within a movie; its essence stems from celebration of life and realization of dreams, through a medium we love so much – The movies.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another visual treat from the maestro,"Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan living in the walls of a train station, in 1930s Paris. He becomes embroiled in a mystery involving his dead father, an automaton, and the enigmatic Georges Melies (Ben Kingsley).I'm not a big fan of 3D – in fact, I hate it. I'm yet to see a movie that does the format justice but, admittedly, Hugo comes pretty bloody close. What sets 'Hugo' apart from other 3D movies, and one of the reasons I enjoyed it, is that it's a 3D movie about 3D movies. It therefore allows the filmmakers artistic license, and makes the format more acceptable.But that's what happens when Martin Scorsese makes a film – the man is a certified genius, who knows how to get the best out of what he's working with. We all know he can do it with the actors, we know he can do it with genres, now he does it with 3D. And the truth is that, as good as everything else about this movie is (and there's a lot of good), the best thing about this film is the visuals. From start to finish, 'Hugo' looks spectacular. The opening scene, as we see the camera 'zoom' through Paris to the intricacies of the train station is breathtaking, and it retains that high standard throughout.It's also helped by the fact that the cast is full of incredible actors. From the young leads to the elder statesmen, everyone chips in with stellar performances. Asa Butterfield is a great choice for the lead actor, and Chloe Moretz does a very decent job with her English accent. That girl is gonna be a huge star when she's older, and will thoroughly deserve it. Not much needs to be said about Ben Kingsley and Christopher Lee and Ray Winstone and Helen McCrory, and all the other veterans. They're good, we know. Sacha Cohen is a revelation, though. He is fantastic as the Station Inspector.'Hugo' deserved all the awards that it won – it's a fantastic film and I loved watching it. Scorsese doesn't make many bad films and, with this, he proves that he can make films for children too. And that 3D is actually bearable.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Visually dazzling ""adventure""","This film has a very distinct visual style that glorifies a vintage ""steampunk"" era with powerful lighting and colours. All the clockwork and ornamentation leads the audience to another world of nostalgia, which is fitting because the whole film itself is an enthralling throwback to early cinema. This ""adventure"", however, suffers from uneven pacing and a long runtime which makes it anticlimactic. It starts off as a solid children's film but ultimately appears to be geared towards nostalgic adults.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stunning,"Story-wise this might not be as flawless as some had hoped for (difficult to tell sometimes), but the cinematography, the love and care with which Scorsese handled a ""kids"" film (from the man that brought you movies aimed at an adult crowd that is saying something) is just astonishing. Very careful framing, great effects and Scorsese (known) love for cinema shines through in every frame of it.Even just watching the trailer (which I had the pleasure of doing a couple of times recently again), before or after you watch the movie gives you just a good feeling overall. The boy has been cast good, Chloe shows she can be in serious and mellow roles too. Sascha Baron Cohens story might be a bit of a stretch for some, though I think they enjoy his comic relief moments as much as everyone else did.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Moving and visually brilliant,"What begins as a fanciful mystery evolves into a wonder-filled history of the cinema. Scorsese is the first director I've seen to understand the real potential of 3D, and he uses it as magically as the mysterious object of this film. At its heart, the movie is about finding your place in the world, finding where you fit it. All of the characters have lost something in their lives and, like a puzzle missing a piece, are searching for that perfect fit. Scorsese captures the beauty, wonder and danger of Paris in the 1930s as seen through a child's eyes. His cinematography is breathtaking. The acting -- including a surprisingly poignant performance by Sasha Baron Cohen -- is first rate and engaging. I constantly marveled at the twists and turns the story took, always in a refreshingly believable way. This is an exquisite cinematic experience that really should be seen in 3D to be fully appreciated. But even without the extra dimension, this is still filmmaking at its best.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't judge a book by its cover,My summary was the best way to describe this film nothing that I expected with acting story line and emotional twist and turns.Short and sweet Building up to the release of this film I seen shorts and trailers. From what I gathered I thought it was a 1920 1930s film about a child who discovers a secret that unlocks a robots mechanism which leads him and his friend off on an adventure through out the train station. A olden based film for kids.Nothing close yes it is for kids but its so engaging and interesting you are so caught up in the film scene after scene your just guessing and by the end of the film I was so hooked that I couldn't believe such an unusual though amazing film had me excited.

"Martin Scorsese is a magician who loves making movies, and each and every minute of Hugo is a testament to this. His Hugo timeless creation - a cinematic ode to films","Martin Scorsese is a magician who loves making movies, and each and every minute of Hugo is a testament to this; with his arms outstretched, he invites us to be hypnotized by his timeless creation, a cinematic ode to films – a medium that shall carry on so long as we dream, so long as our spirit for adventure doesn't die and our purpose of life remains strong.Broken is the life of Georges Méliès, a man, a magician celebrated once for his innovative contributions to film, and only can Hugo Cabret being back happiness to his defeated existence; it is Scorsese who colors their lives with wit, with charm, with humor, with a tinge of sadness but most importantly, with hope.Hugo is a visually brilliant film, a Scorsese's vision of Paris, and you soon fall in love with its characters, their lives, their desires, their dreams. It is an ode to cinema, and yet it remains entirely Scorsese's and that is what makes it new and fresh.'Time is everything' chimes Hugo's uncle Claude, a drunken lout, as he brings Hugo to train station Gare Montparnasse's clock-tower where he mends clocks; Hugo's father has just died in a fire accident, and his son, now orphaned, is taught by Uncle Claude how to mend clocks. We see of Uncle Claude no more, its only Hugo and his little, secret life inside the enormous castle of a clock-tower. Scorsese opens the film with turning clock wheels dissolving into Parisian streets, then gives us a scintillating glimpse of Paris like we've never seen before, before taking us down to Gare Montparnasse station, moving along the station life and rising to the clock face but closing in near number five, where we see finally see Hugo's eyes.Hugo controls time, the station time to be exact, and so long as the clock functions fine, he remains safe. His only hurdle outside is the station inspector, a hard-hearted monomaniac whose sole purpose is to catch hold of orphaned children loitering in the station and send them off to orphanage. Through the dial, he watches the movement outside – the amusing courtship between café owner Madame Emile and newsstand owner Monsieur Frick, flower lady Lisette's morning greetings to passersby, the station-master's watchful eye and toymaker Georges' tiny shop. He's particularly keen about Georges' shop because he steals toy parts whenever Georges dozes off to sleep; he needs these parts to fix 'Automaton', a mechanical man Hugo's father left behind unrepaired. Automaton, when fixed, will write down something and Hugo believes it would be a message from his late father.But while attempting to steal some parts one day, he's caught by Georges. The toymaker threatens to alert the station-inspector unless Hugo reveals to him why he is stealing toy parts. When Hugo remains defiantly silent, Georges peruses the diary he's holding and mysteriously utters 'Ghosts!' before taking away the diary from him and declaring to burn it. Before Hugo can persuade him to return the diary, the station-inspector Gustave and his Doberman Pinscher give him a chase. Hugo escapes, but now has to find a way to get the diary back; he follows Georges to his home one day and beckons his goddaughter Isabelle to meet him.The two little explorers embark on an adventure to get the book back and find the key that would make Automaton work. In doing so, they discover something they'd never even dreamed of – toymaker and Isabelle's godparent Georges is the man behind pioneering movies like 'A Trip to the Moon'; yes, he is indeed THE Georges Méliès, but he's defeated and lost all his former glory. And he's dead, according to Rene Tabard's book on film history, but that's until Rene meets Hugo and Isabelle in the public library, and things soon begin to change, for everyone.Along the way, we learn how cinema began and just how important it was for the makers. Even today, you have filmmakers complaining that the glory days of film are over. Even Scorsese's film, as good as a film can get, still could hardly match up to collections of the Transformers movie released in the same year. The truth is, so long as you have love what you're doing and haven't lost the burning desire to do it, you'll live a happy life and be proud of what you've accomplished. And Scorsese should take a bow for creating Hugo.Wouldn't have been such a delight without its wonderful cast – Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz, who are expressive and believable, especially Moretz. The wrong casting would've made Hugo and Isabelle snotty and annoyingly precocious children, but Asa and Chloe play it right. Sacha Baron Cohen is a comic delight as Gustave while Ben Kingsley is convincing as the crabby Georges and touching in his later scenes. The DVD comes with a special feature that includes the making of Hugo, and you get a good insight on what these actors felt working with a man, a magician like Scorsese who loves making movies.More on sashankkini.wordpress.com/‎",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Scorsese's Love For Cinema,"Hugo is a family film directed by Martin Scorsese. Hugo is an odd film for Scorsese to do as most of his films are much more mature, dark, and at times violent. Though different from his acclaimed films, it's damn entertaining.I have seen a few of John Logan's screenplays, some are OK (The Last Samurai) and some are near perfect (Gladiator). Hugo would be at the same level as Gladiator for me. This film is adapted from Brian Selznick's novel entitled ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"". This film is fun from start to finish, as it's an adventure film while at the same time a message saying that films from the past are important and in need to be preserved. The children may not care so much about the latter but just on the adventure alone makes this one hell of an experience. It's main focus is on Hugo but the times where it focuses on the other people from the train station, it's just as interesting. Being a children's film, sometimes the dialogue can be a little bit cheesy and it's present in this film but only minimally. The film's plot is easy to swallow and can be enjoyed by both children and adults.Like I said, this is an odd turn for Scorsese but he still delivers. Scorsese has created something magical, using a story that also relates to his passion for films. A certain flashback sequence on Hugo reminds me of the same love and passion that Scorsese put on the Hell's Angels production scenes from The Aviator. Scorsese has also opened my eyes on the beauty of the distant era of cinema and it's beginnings.The film is gorgeous from start to finish. Scorsese and Robert Richardson have captured the beauty of 1930s Paris and the train station that the film is set in. Richardson has created a magical, almost fantasy like image of Paris and definitely makes the film feel more like a pleasant dream. The beautiful imagery is supported with a wonderful use of visual effects, making the film feel more realistic but at the same time not losing that touch of magic and fantasy that makes the film so pretty. Richardson has, again, shot a period piece that brings out the beauty of an era that once was.Howard Shore has done it again with Hugo, created a wonderful score that aids in putting the audience in this fascinating world and era, similar to what he did for The Aviator and Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings saga. His score here is more enlightening but without making it sound cliché or familiar.I love seeing films with child actors that do not bring down the quality of the film. Both Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz gave strong performances that was at par with great actors like Ben Kingsley and Jude Law. I think both are going to have a very memorable career, so far Moretz is showing a lot of promise. Ben Kingsley as the toy maker was great and sweet, while Sacha Baron Cohen stole the scene when he comes on as his comedic delivery is fantastic. When he is on screen he is either doing something funny or showing vulnerability, which is very rare in his own films. Cohen has great chemistry with Emily Mortimer, who needed a little bit more screen time to make their relationships more empathetic but doing so may retract from the point of the film, nevertheless it's entertaining. Jude Law, Michael Stuhlbarg and Christopher Lee had minor roles but their presence makes the film all the more entertaining. Scorsese has a great cast that many other filmmakers would envy.I came into the film thinking it may be not hold my interest as family friendly films don't really impress me as it is sometimes clouded by it's own restrictions and would generally end up being only a guilty pleasure or a holiday tradition film for me. Hugo is something I could watch over and over again as it is a love letter to cinema.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I highly recommend enjoying this surreal adventure in 3D in the  theatre. It deserves several Oscar nominations including Ben Kingsley  as the shopkeeper and Chloe Grace Moretz as Isabelle. Sacha Baron  Cohen's campy performance as the station inspector detracted slightly  from this otherwise excellent film (8.9 out of 10).

The Cinematography of Paris in 1930's portrayed, is excellent.The movie is something parents can watch with their children and have a great experience together.Final Verdict: I was expecting a biographic experience, nevertheless its okay.

Style over substance,"I was seduced by the reviews on IMDb into watching this movie. It's got some big names, it's got terrific production values (think Dickens crossed with steampunk), an interesting concept, but ultimately badly let down by the execution, which generates no real emotion, not even sentimental nostalgia. Part of it is disbelief: the two main child actors talk and act like adults, are dressed and shot like adults, their reactions and motivations are those of adults. Then there's the complete lack of chemistry between any two members of the cast.You're rewarded for your patience (it's a two and a half hour film) with some great visuals, humorous scenes especially from the supporting cast, a bit of early film history (the famous train scene is shown, as well as a bit of Méliès' work) though too disjointed to really enjoy, and a generally pleasant film, but precious little else.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This might just be the Best Picture winner.,"When I saw the original trailer for Hugo, I really didn't think much about it. However, I recognised a few of the cast members and such. A few days later, I came across the trailer again and promised myself I'd keep an eye on the film and be sure to check it out. Come opening day, I'm watching the movie and falling in love with it.Let me just say that the first trailer is extremely misleading. It tells absolutely nothing about the movie, and you'd never know what it was really about. It's not just some goofy movie about a train and a ridiculous Doberman; it's an emotional story that'll play with your heartstrings and pretty much every emotion possible. I was crying throughout, but I was laughing, smiling, and feeling completely awestruck at the same time.Martin Scorsese was correct to refer to Asa Butterfield (Hugo Cabret) as ""the heart of the film."" He's an incredibly talented actor and that really showed during this movie. He had me tearing up a lot. Other fantastic cast members include Chloë Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, and Helen McCrory.Another wonderful part about this movie is Howard Shore's score. Everything fit perfectly with each moment and really tied the film together. The music is magical, wondrous, and Academy Award-worthy. In fact, there are several things in this movie that are ""Academy Award- worthy""; cinematography, art direction, score, sound, screenplay, etc.In a movie that shows us about an old master of cinema, who better to put it together than a master of cinema himself? Martin Scorsese does an excellent job with the material and it just blew me away. Every object is part of the story, from the hands on the clock to the dust particles in the station. See it in 3D if you can.Hugo teaches us more than just the importance of cinema, but also that there are no extra parts in the world... everything has a purpose.This is the best movie of the year, and that's not an exaggeration in the slightest. I've yet to meet someone who wasn't left completely awestruck by this movie. The entire audience broke into﻿ applause and tears after every time I've seen it. Inspiring, magical, unforgettable, beautiful, heartfelt... that is Hugo.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Magic of Méliès and Scorsese,"My knowledge of motion pictures is strongest in respect to the earliest silent films, as anyone who looks at the list of the titles I've reviewed for IMDb can tell. This includes over 50 of the more remarkable 199 films of Georges Méliès available on the DVDs from Flicker Alley. Thusly, I greatly appreciate the attention this recent mainstream movie, as well as the graphic novel it's based on, has brought to the early cinema pioneer. Although it presents plenty of historical inaccuracies, this is to be expected in a fictionalization of a historical person, and it's nonetheless commendable how much ""Hugo"" gets right and how felicitous the movie's style and tone are to the spirit of Méliès's own films. And it's all the more commendable considering that this is an atypical picture for Martin Scorsese, although he's well known for his appreciation of film history and work in film preservation. This shines through Hugo's best scenes of flashbacks of Méliès making his movies in his glass-ceiling studio in Montreuil and a passionate plea for film preservation during the climactic celebration of his career and screening of his films.That ""Hugo"" is a family-oriented picture is appropriate given that Méliès's féeries (fairy films) and fantasy adventures were among the first films ever made largely for an audience of children, although as with ""Hugo"", people of all ages, of course, may enjoy them. Méliès also introduced and exploited ""special effects"", which in his day mostly consisted of substitution splicing (stopping and resuming filming, touched up by editing, for transformations, appearances and disappearances of characters and scenery) and superimpositions (also known as multiple-exposure photography or matte shots). ""Hugo"", likewise, exploits today's tricks of computer generated imagery (CGI) and 3D digital photography. Additionally, although ""Hugo"" isn't hand colored the way Méliès's films were offered to be, its digital color grading scheme imitates the early Autochrome color photography process invented by the Lumière brothers--the same guys most often credited with inventing cinema. Although I can't speak personally to the 3D since I've only seen it in 2D, it seems to be almost universally praised as some of the best work done in the field. Reportedly, it's the first movie ever photographed entirely by 3D cameras, whereas earlier 3D movies have all had 3D conversion done in some part in post production. James Cameron said it's the best 3D photography he's seen, and he should know since he's the director of ""Avatar"" (2009) and is the biggest pusher of the technology.Critics have also praised or panned the supposed leisurely pace of ""Hugo"". Compared to Méliès's films, however, the pace is frenetic. ""Hugo"" and most movies since the adoption of the classical style in the late 1910s are composed of shots lasting an average of a few seconds, whereas Méliès would often leave a shot-scene on screen for minutes, and for whom continuity editing was largely ignored in favor of theatrical imitation. Thankfully, the makers of ""Hugo"" don't try to faithfully replicate that theatricality; instead, it begins with swooping camera vistas and tracking shots that truly can go anywhere via CGI. The quick interpolation of clips from Méliès's films in ""Hugo"", however, may give an impression counter to the actual slow pacing of his tableaux.The narrative follows a boy's ""adventure"" of discovering Méliès, and I'm sure for many viewers ""Hugo"" is their own introduction to the cinema magician. That may be the case for some popular critics, too, as it seems they mention the historical inaccuracies of the fictional story as though they were facts from Méliès's real life. For instance, while it's true that the Lumière brothers refused to sell Méliès a camera, it's not true that Méliès's introduction to cinema was from accidentally walking into a fairground screening. In fact, he was at the Lumière brothers' first public exhibition of the Cinématographe at the Grand Café in Paris on 28 December 1895. And the end of Méliès's filmmaking career happened before and had nothing to do with WWI, although the prevalent view is that his style did fall out of public favor (as well as because his non-business, artisan ethic was no match for the monopolistic practices of his competitors). This isn't so much a criticism of ""Hugo"", however, as it's a criticism of anyone who takes their facts from a movie. For more on the history as it relates to ""Hugo"" and ""The Artist"", see Fiona Pleasance's blog article ""Yesterday's Men"" and for that and other interesting observations on the movie read ""Hugo: Scorsese's birthday present to Georges Méliès"" by film historian and theorist Kristin Thompson.Regardless, for replicating Méliès's Montreuil dream factory, ""Hugo"" is a history lesson that has come entertainingly to life. Not even some otherwise fine documentaries, such as ""La magie Méliès"" (1997), do as well at capturing the process and wonder of the film pioneer at work. Given that early histories dismissed the importance of editing in Méliès creating his trick effects, it's great to see its central role in the flashback sequence here. I also liked other details that ""Hugo"" recreated, including how Méliès had two cameras shooting at once--one print for the domestic European market and another for the American. And Ben Kingsley very much looks and, indeed, embodies the part. Various silent films of others are referenced in ""Hugo"", too, including a visit to a cinema where movie posters are seen and the children see Harold Lloyd's comedy ""Safety Last!"" (1923), which is imitated later in a key scene in the outer narrative. 2011 was a good year for fans of classic movies and for those who enjoy movies about movies, with the releases of ""The Artist"", ""My Week with Marilyn"" and ""Hugo"".",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boaring,"Perhaps the best 3d movie of the 21st century. Sadly visual effects are the only thing commendable about this movie. I agree i was really exited initially about this movie to be a adventure packed with magic and suspense, Martin Scorcese is one of my favorite directors, all the expectations were shattered when i tasted it, there is nowhere the movie was heading. There is so much glitter but not a bit of gold. The script was well. ""Every thing in this world has a reason including machines"" Well plot was good but the character were not the same.The moment it started it was misleading. The little boy with staring eyes is good with eyes only with no emotion same goes with the little girl. Ben Kingsley some how managed to old it together but could not do it that well. The story is about an orphan with a Automaton found by his father who dedicated his life repairing clocks. After the death of his father the boy faces many difficulties for surviving and pursuing his dream of repairing the broken automaton as it was the only thing that his father has left for him. Later he discovers that the automaton was build by the greatest filmmaker who didn't exist. Two hours of great vfx but finally it was nothing that was promised. ultimate boar .",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant!,"I was absolutely blown away by this film! It's a movie about movies! I just barely finished watching it for the first time! Today! I loved the intelligent writing - the fact that everything, even the smallest little details of the plot, had something to do with another part of the film just exploded my brain. I was just so impressed! I was also very impressed by the cinematography and visual effects, as well as the original music by Howard Shore. This movie was just put together so well! Amazing script, amazing acting, amazing everything. And it was even packed full of film history! I really just felt like the director was having so much fun in the making of this movie.

Pure Gold,"Now living in a Paris clock tower after his father (Jude Law) is killed in an explosion, 14-yr old Hugo (Asa Butterfield) takes care of the railroad station clock having been trained by his uncle (Ray Winstone).Occasionally, a movie comes along that is pure gold. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button and Hugo are prime examples.There appears to be two stories in here and each one compliments the other. First we are concerned with Hugo who is trying to find a message he feels his late father has left for him . Hugo believes that message is to be found within the Automaton (immobile robot) that he is attempting to rebuild and that was neglected and left to rust in some museum. But, later Hugo discovers that the message within the Automaton leads to a bigger message for the whole world when George Melies (Ben Kingsley) a pioneer film maker is rediscovered to complete an important part of art film history.It is well known that Director Martin Scorsese (Bob takes a drink) is passionate about preserving film for ages to come and this story brings that home. The credits say that Scorcese (another drink is taken) also had a small part in the movie as a photographer. But, I couldn't see Scorcese (another drink is downed) unless Scorcese (a drink is gulped) was in some disguise. Well, the flashbacks did go back before the 1920s and we are in the 1930s. I was looking for an older Scorcese (drink taken again) not a young Scorsese (another drink downed). And, now you know how to play the Scorcese (finishes off glass) drinking game. The game was first introduced by two actors hosting some awards show (Golden Globes?) earlier this year.The setting is Paris, France, and although all characters had French names, no one spoke with a French accent and, to be truthful, that was a good thing as everything was easier to understand. Reminded me of the movie Valkyrie when no one spoke with a German accent. The background music had French overtones that fit perfectly. There is also a very nice French song at the end when the credits run. You should listen.Standouts: Kingsley, of course; Butterfield as Hugo with those haunting eyes; Chloe Grace Moretz as the almost girlfriend to Hugo; Christopher Lee with that imposing authoritative voice as the kind giver of books; and Sacha Baron Cohen as the comic relief who surprisingly played his role perfectly as the Stationmaster. Cohen mildly approached an imitation of Dr. Stangelove and there were times I expected his Borat character to emerge as well, but that never happened. Yes, we are wary of Sacha Baron Cohen as we never know what he will do next. All in all, the actors above and the rest of the cast were exceptional. Kudos.The cinematography was simply outstanding. I liken it to Avatar when the eyes were given a visual treat. And, here the CGI was simple, complicated and more than just right.Hugo was nominated for: Best Picture, Costume Design, and Directing. Didn't win. But, it won the Oscar for Art Direction, Cinematography, Visual Effects, Sound Editing, and Sound Mixing. As far as I am concerned it should have won for all the Oscars it was nominated for. Hey, we are talking pure gold here.An excellent family film touted as pure gold. BTW: That drink was iced tea although I am told others use something stronger. (10/10)Violence: No. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: No.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
pretty good movie,"I liked this movie for its story, cinematography, transitions, and the setting where the story takes place in Paris 1930, which gives the machinery a steam works vibe. With the visual effects and cinematography was very impressive for its time and the transitions to the next scenes were very slick. My main problem was the characters near the start and middle of the movie because all of them had something secret to hide, no matter how little it is, although i did like how Christopher Lee was in it because of lord of the rings and star wars. Otherwise this movie had a nice story and kinda reminds me of a video game called ""Stray"".",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A work of pure magic, pure wonder and pure exuberance, this is a winning delight for all ages- and an even more astounding visual spectacle in 3D","If there is one genre that Martin Scorcese has not explored over the course of his expansive four decades in film, it is that of the 'families', often considered as lightweight and therefore ill-fitting for the director's proclivity for mature fare. But though cloaked within the look and feel of a family film, 'Hugo' ultimately proves to be so much more, and there is no doubt by the end of it why Scorcese was attracted to this adaptation of Brian Selznick's celebrated novel.This is the Dickensian story of a 12-year-old orphan named Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who lives inside the walls of the Gare Montmartre train station in 1930s Paris and turns to the occasional thieving to survive. Hugo's been left with an automaton which his father rescued from the attic of a nearby museum, and over the years, he's been nicking what he needs to get it repaired- it's Hugo's last remaining connection to his father whom he misses dearly.One day, Hugo runs afoul of a grumpy toy seller Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley) and loses possession of a precious notebook with the drawings and calculations essential for his pet project. Desperate, he follows the seller home and pleads with his precocious goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz) to retrieve it for him.Thus begins their mutual journey of adventure, as Hugo brings Isabelle, who's never seen a motion picture, to a showing of 'Safety Last' where the silent comedian Harold Lloyd dangles from the hands of a giant clock. Isabelle too introduces Hugo to the world of books, the bright lass an avid reader with a penchant for big words. But Hugo is more interested in the heart-shaped key around Isabelle's neck he believes will unlock the secret of the automaton.True enough- the key fits the hole- and the automaton sketches out a key scene from filmmaker Georges Melies' landmark 1902 sci-fi fantasy 'A Trip to the Moon' where a rocket crashes into face of the man in the moon. Turns out Papa Georges is indeed the lost filmmaker Georges Melies, and screenwriter John Logan uses the second half of the movie to make a heartfelt argument for the preservation of film. It isn't just about protecting the legacy of the filmmaker- though the rehabilitation of Melies is equally pivotal to the story- but also about safeguarding the collective memories of an audience built upon the extraordinary power of cinema to inspire.So deftly around a tale of childhood intrigue, Scorcese has conveyed the importance of a cause that's so close to his heart. 'Hugo' isn't only his plea for the cause, but his tribute to his peers from the past who have left an indelible contribution to the advancement of cinema- and besides a brief but illuminating tour of the history of early cinema close to the end of the film, Scorcese also does a lovely restaging of the classic Lumiere brothers' 1897 presentation of the 'Arrival of a Train at Le Ciotat'.In 'Hugo', Scorcese has also fashioned an opulent epic as lavish and rapturous as the classic films that have captured our imagination since the beginning of the celluloid medium, employing his usual ace team to transport his audience straight into the heart of a storybook Paris. Trust us when we say that you'll be wowed from the get-go- the opening shot a breathtaking one that begins with the camera swooping over the rooftops of Paris towards the Montmartre station and continuing seamlessly above the tracks inside the station before entering the main hall where young Hugo is making his way through the crowd of commuters. Together with Scorcese, d.p Robert Richardson ensures that this 3D-shot film brims with beautifully crafted shots that bring to life the world of fantasy and mystery within the film in a most visually vivid manner.Besides its technical mastery, 'Hugo' also boasts delightful performances from its cast of all ages. Butterfield emerges from a breakout performance from 'The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas' to deliver an equally nuanced portrayal of a boy adrift in the world and longing for the people and things that will connect him to the rest of humanity. Moretz effuses warmth and radiance in every frame, while Kingsley's supporting act is a masterful one that conveys keenly the wounded pride of an artist who watches with despair as his works once so beloved by the world are now quickly forgotten.If there is one gripe about the movie, it is that the vignettes involving some of the station's regulars end up too lightweight to matter. Still, that little triviality in no way diminishes the sheer feeling of wonder and magic that Scorcese brings to his first film meant for all ages, a film that also so persuasively and winningly echoes his lifelong passion of cinema preservation. It's a film of pure enchantment, even more so when viewed in 3D, and once again reiterates why Scorcese is simply one of the best directors of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A fun family movie by a director not associated with children's movies,"It's based on the 2007 children's historical novel, ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret."" It's set in 1931 Paris and refers extensively to the early French filmmaker, George Méliès.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) is a young orphan who lives in a Paris train station, winding and caring for the many clocks. We learn early on that his father (Jude Law) was a clockmaker who also worked in a museum. After his death, Hugo lived with his alcoholic uncle, Claude Cabret (Ray Winstone). However, Claude soon disappears, and Hugo fends on his own, becoming a petty thief. He also tries to repair an automaton (mechanical man) that his father had saved from forgotten storage at the museum.Hugo is caught stealing mechanical parts from a toy store in the train station run by Papa Georges (Ben Kingsley). Hugo, to repay for his thievery, works for Papa George. He also meets Papa Georges goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloé Grace Moretz). They become good friends, have adventures together, and come to learn about Pape Georges past and why he seems so sad now. Another significant character is Station Inspector Gustave Dasté (Sacha Baron Cohen), who is officious, unhappy, and handicapped by a war injury. Several dogs also have a role.This is a fun family movie directed by a person not usually associated with children's movies. The main lessons from the film seem to be that we all have a role to play in this world and that we should not look back on our personal history with sadness. The main characters are all well-played. The cinematography is outstanding (it was filmed in 3D).",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually pleasing movie with clever details,"The movie is very nice to look at, let's start from that. I saw the movie in 3D, and while it didn't add anything significant to the movie it didn't detract from it like it does in so many other films. Would I have preferred 2D had it been available? Yes, but mainly because I'm one of those guys, who gets a headache from 3D glasses. For most of the people, I think that this movie is finally one of those that are actually enhanced by the 3D effect. But, no matter the amount of dimensions, the movie looks great. The costumes, the details, the backgrounds, the people, they're all wonderful to look at.Unfortunately the visual effects are the best part of the movie. Nothing in it is bad, far from it, but nothing is as masterful as the visuals. The ensemble cast of high-quality actors all played their parts brilliantly, but I never felt quite connected to the characters. They were all unique, well-rounded and sympathetic, yet that extra little spark was missing. The same can be said about the story. It hit all the right notes, was interesting and had absolutely no plot holes or unnecessary scenes. And yet I don't think that I'll remember any of it after five years.But movie isn't bad, not at all. The amazing visuals kind of overwhelm the other aspects of it, but it was still enjoyable to watch. I especially liked all those little moments where they replicated a scene from an old black and white film that they had shown within the movie earlier. All in all it's a nice movie and a brilliant love letter to the movie industry in general. Is it Scorsese's strongest work? Not even close, but it's definitely worth a watch for any fan of movies out there.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo Review,"Sometimes simplicity speaks volumes of what a person perceives or what he/she desires for and this movie so simply speaks about the subtleties of life. Hugo Cabret lives in train station's clock tower after his father tragically dies in a fire in a museum. Taken up by his uncle he starts winding up the clocks in the train station but has a hidden dream of setting atominator in motion and finding out the hidden secrets behind. What gets revealed out of it is the story Hugo speaks about.Set in the 1930's Paris Hugo living in his clock tower wants to fix a atominator which his father had brought home from the museum because no one wanted to have it. The journey of finding missing pieces to fit in the atominator he comes across George Melies who runs a toy shop in the train station and has glorious past. He befriends his godchild Isabella and both of them start on an adventurous journey of reading books, watching movies without tickets and finding out the truth behind George Melies. In the train station there are various characters and newspaper seller who is in love with the lady who runs a bakery shop but what's stopping them from expressing their love is the lady's dog. Then there is the station inspector (a brilliant Sacha Baron Cohen) who is obsessed with orphan's n wants to make each one of them live in an orphanage because he had a tough childhood and he is in love with the florist but can't express it because of his defected left leg and all these characters combine to make a joyful journey for Hugo.One day in the film section of the library Hugo and Isabella come across the history of film making and there they are awe struck by one name which is of George Melies and the writer who is obsessed by George's movies and he makes them realize that their Papa George is one of the greatest filmmakers ever but all his work is lost except one which also happens to be the first movie seen by Hugo's father. Now the kids want George to see the movie and realize how great he was and how people where influenced by him.Starting off with the performance everyone has given a superlative performance with Asa Butterfield great as Hugo, Chole Grace Mortez good as Isabella, Sacha Baron Cohen superb as the Station Inspector, Ben Kingsley is marvelous as George Melies and Jude Law is under used. But the real stars of this movie are Director Martin Scorsese and the Art Directors Dante Ferretti and Francesca Lo Schiavo. 11 Academy Award Nomination is a befitting tribute to such a wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Retro-Hollywood mediocrity,"It's hard to believe this movie is as highly rated as it is. It is, through and through, lacklustre tripe. The fact it won more Oscars than The Artist shows what a complete joke the Oscars are.The acting is unremarkable. The Hugo character mostly just stares and twitches his nostrils, while his gal pal mainly looks cute and smiles at everything. Baron Sasha Cohen is boring. Ben Kingsley is uninspiring. It's all Disney grade.The characters are shallow. None of them are fleshed out enough to care about.The plot is uninteresting. And slow. And full of clichés. And some of the plot transitions are so badly handled it's simultaneously comical and sad.The visuals are big budget, yet devoid of character. Typical Hollywood conservative aesthetics.

An innocent film with a good message,"I was worried walking into this film, mainly because I hoped the film would meet up to the praise that the film has rightly met, but my mind was put at ease during the opening shot and straight away the film captured the beauty of Paris. The whole visual of the city was polished, sophisticated and artistic. The production design has to be praised. The synopsis does not give away what makes this film so magical, and this is a good thing too. But what I am allowed to tell you is that it actually has a good message about how Hugo believes the world is like a big machine and that everyone must have a purpose in it, just like a machine's parts has purpose for the machine it will become (if that makes sense) The film had such an innocence and a comforting feel to it. Asa (Hugo) and Chloe (Isabelle) were quite good, I don't really like them as actors to be honest (I like the boy much better than the girl though) but I wanted to not let that spoil the film for me, and it didn't. Because they actually fitted quite well into the film, they had a good screen chemistry. The whole film is a great homage to cinema as well (but I can't tell you how they do it otherwise it would be a spoiler) watch it for yourself and you'll see what an amazing film this is.

Hugo,"Hugo has an interesting setting with an even more interesting mystery. I really liked the clockwork aesthetic and the sets, especially the train station, which help set the mood from the beginning. I also liked the dichotomy between the well lit station buzzing with activity, and Hugo's home in the station walls full of gears yet completely devoid of people, like he is surrounded by others but completely alone. All this changes when he meets the girl who helps show him that he doesn't need to be alone all of the time, and kicks off the mystery in the story. I think the mystery was executed reasonably well, although the set up was a lot more intriguing than what the ending actually is. By the end of the movie it isn't really about Hugo himself as much and he acts more like a vessel to drive the rest of the movie forward, as it focuses more on Méliès's story. There were also a couple of things from the beginning that were hastily explained, or not at all. Like what caused the fire that killed Hugo's father, or why does France look so different after the war? However I do think the film was given a satisfying enough ending and all the references to early film history were quite cool. Overall it's a good story with some interesting history and I enjoyed it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A little over produced, but what a wonderful tale for all ages!","I really enjoyed this movie for what it was; a fairy tale that portrays the power of the cinema. It is a film in the spirit of the book ""The Christmas Train"". I did feel that the production was a little too polished, or over produced,in that even dirty Uncle Claude wore ""clean"" dirt, and there wasn't a piece of garbage to be seen on the streets or the train station. That being said, Ben Kingsley really does play the part of Georges impeccably. His make up is fantastic. The actors are somewhat over dramatic, but this is a romantic tale that somewhat reminds me of ""Big Fish"" in that the story is so over the top that as a viewer, you are willing to put up with some (almost) overacting. It was interesting to watch it with a group of teens, because none of them thought it was ""cheesy"", or childish, something I thought they might. I think I was the most cynical viewer in the audience going in, but by the end, I too was taken over by the magic of the film, and the love that Georges has for film. The sub plots of the kindling romance between the station inspector (well played by Sacha Baron Cohen) and the flower girl, amongst others, were a nice touch. What I feel really made this a winner in my books was the way it incorporated so many classic pieces of film (scenes from ""The General"", ""Safety Last"" amongst others.) I teach a high school film and TV class and we will be dissecting this film and referencing all the clips of archival footage to gain a better understanding of how films such as ""Modern Times""are still relevant today.

a fantasy masterpiece,"Sad that some reviewers found the movie boring. Okay, no car chase scenes ... no violent may ham ... no conflagrations ... no bullets severing limbs. The movie works as a fantasy, which requires imagination and patience in its pacing as the story unfolds. I saw this magical movie in 3D and for once did not get a headache ... possibly because I was totally engrossed and enthralled by it. In 3D it is a triumphant mesmerizing cinematic experience. Maybe I'll have to buy a 3D HDTV to love it as much at home. Scorsese is at his masterful best. Possibly this is Scorsese's homage to the magic of movies which can bring us to other worlds if our childhood imagination is intact. Nice to see that Scorsese, for once (except for his wonderful Age of Innocence movie), depart from his violent movies.

Hugo  Now I am Spoiled,"This piece of art is so magnificent - completed by an army of artists - that I am afraid I will be spoiled to any other film. But I put on The Rum Diary again and I seem to enjoy it - so I guess I am OK. Hugo is at the end of the Rainbow and we went there once but I don't think we can take the trip twice. But it was something - my imagination thanks you, Martin Scorsese. You did your imagination proud and sharing it with everyone makes the Great Dreamer pleased.I did not see this in 3D which isn't a requirement to do that - but someday I will see it in 3D. I understand that this medium is only handled well by you. So I will make a point to. The casting of some of my favorite people - and Christopher Lee was there.Everything must have been ready to shoot the characters because the children did not age as would have shown had they labored months to complete their parts. My hats off to the sets and imagery makers - the prop people and costumers. My hat is off to the silent movie sequencers - and the energy throughout that sequence. Nothing was shortened here, or cheated. Magnificent movie. Hugo does not offend anyone's sensibilities. No ideology that is false or pushed.

Hu-gold.,"Martin Scorsese's 'Hugo' tells a rare story in cinema - a plot grounded in our own reality that establishes a concept of 'magic' that is wholly believable (within the context of the plot) without transcending our laws of physics. Like the hidden landscapes of 'The Secret Garden', eponymous hero Hugo Cabret's world is a fantasy unto itself.Marketed somewhat misleadingly as a children's fantasy movie, the film unfolds according to this very formula before gradually branching off on a wondrous and unexpected tangent that allows the characters to develop across some of the most beautiful arcs I've ever seen in any film. Hugo's endeavour to fix a broken clockwork man, in the hope of receiving a message from his absent father, takes place within the marvellous confines of a Parisian railway station, accommodating a diverse ensemble cast including Sacha Baron Cohen's excellent turn as a handicapped station master reminiscent of 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang''s child catcher. Child stars Asa Butterfield and Chloe Grace Moretz demonstrate exceptional clout in their demanding roles, the latter further illustrating her renowned acting prowess.'Hugo' is visually astounding in its intricately detailed display of grinding gears and lavish decor, recalling 'steampunk' imagery as the camera sweeps through steaming machinery and clockwork. Regardless of divisive opinions regarding its credibility, I personally feel I have no choice but to review the film as it is presented in the medium of 3D. Scorsese crafts shot after shot of beautiful, three-dimensional imagery - if 'Avatar' promoted the technical feats of the latest iteration of the technology, then 'Hugo' promotes how it can be used to serve a story as well as it does visuals. Hugo's world is fully immersive, rich and detailed with an astounding depth provided by filming in the format, as Scorsese displays an excellent discipline with the effects despite this been his first foray into 3D.To delve into any further detail regarding Hugo's world or story would be to spoil the sheer delight in watching this heartfelt tale unfold through all its touching twists and turns. Sumptuously shot, incredibly well-written and expertly realised, 'Hugo' is rewarding cinema in every aspect.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Got nomination by pandering to film lovers,"There's a lot to like about Hugo, but there's also a huge glaring flaw that a lot of people overlook. First the good: each shot of this movie is gorgeous and the cinematographer did a really good job creating this world. The cast is a lot of fun and the scenes paying homage to film's history are really well done and incredibly moving. But they are also this film's main problem. The first half of this movie is about a boy named Hugo who is an orphan living in a train station. He spends his days winding clocks and trying to finish an automaton that he and his father had worked on before his father died. Most of this part of the movie is a mystery as Hugo tries to figure out how to finish the machine and how these different figures in his life are related. This plot is really interesting and engaging, which is why it's promptly dropped in the middle of the movie for a completely different story. Once Hugo discovers that this grumpy man who runs a toy store in the train station is, in fact, George Melies, one the great pioneers in early cinema, the mystery vanishes and the movie becomes How George got his Groove Back. Hugo is now a side character in his own movie and anyone who had any interest in the mystery is given a really slap-dash answer. This does lead to some beautiful and moving scenes for anyone who loves film, but these scenes have virtually nothing to do with Hugo or his father.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Every reason why we love cinema,"features here in this bona fide masterpiece by the downright genius filmmaker Martin Scorsese! Usually I don't write user comments for popular high-budget blockbusters, but I specifically wanted to write about this movie because this is Scorsese's very own and personal ode to cinema and that urged me to write an ode to him and his work. Through using the most modern techniques and hypes – including 3D effects – Scorsese brings a deeply respectable homage to the pioneers and earliest basic techniques of the medium that loves so much and has been working for nearly half a century now. ""Hugo"" is a magical fantasy/fairy-tale, filled with absorbing characters, earnest emotional story lines, dream- like decors and hi-tech special effects that actually emphasize the plot details rather than diverting your attention from the plot holes. The titular character is a shy and introvert young orphan who lives inside the walls of a Paris' train station in the late 1920's. Hugo makes sure that the station clocks keeps running on time without being noticed by the strict station inspector, and at night he desperately tries to repair a broken automaton. The device is the only thing that still connects Hugo with his deceased father and the young boy strongly believes that it carries a hidden message. And is he ever right! When Hugo and his new friend Isabelle discover the automaton's hidden message, they embark on an adventure that will uncover some secrets on people that are very close and dear to them. I don't want to reveal too much, but cinema connoisseurs can more or less predict what the adventure's about based on Ben Kingsley's character name and the Paris setting. The acting performances are stupendous, from the young and clearly over-talented child actors to the ageing but still vastly honorable veterans in the supportive cast, like Richard Griffiths and of course the almighty Christopher Lee. The 3D effects are never bothersome or overly exploited, like so often the case in these movies, and pretty much every piece of scenery and technical aspect is a joy to behold. Everything is perfect to the tiniest detail. The entire finale and the sub plots happening inside the trains station hall are, albeit clichéd and rather predictable, genuinely heartwarming and moving. We had to wait until the end of 2011 to see the best film of the whole year, but it was definitely worth it. Martin Scorsese, I sincerely hope you win an Oscar for directing this movie  It'll even be more deserved than winning for ""The Departed"".",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese has found his purpose in life: Making beautiful films,"¨Maybe that's why a broken machine always makes me a little sad, because it isn't able to do what it was meant to do... Maybe it's the same with people. If you lose your purpose... it's like you're broken. ¨Hugo is a beautiful film that works really well as a love letter from Martin Scorsese to all movie buffs, especially those who are fascinated with its history and origins. Hugo is a family film, but Martin introduces a bit of history so that everyone can become familiar with how it began. It's like a film history lesson made in a very entertaining way. There are several funny scenes that kids will enjoy (mostly the scenes with the inspector chasing after Hugo), while there are also several serious and beautiful moments which serve as a homage to film history. Hugo works as sort of a poem and it is just marvelous to look at and listen to. I loved every second of this movie and every scene was so rich in meaning and just beautiful to look at. The use of 3D in this movie is just spectacular and I think Scorsese has used it better than any other film to date (including Avatar). This is Scorsese's first film in 18 years that gets a PG rating, it's his first time working with 3D, and it also is the first time in twelve years that he's worked without Leonardo Di Caprio. That is a lot of firsts for a film that is done in such a marvelous matter. This is one of the best films of the year and it deserves every single one of its five Oscar wins. The visuals, the sound, the story, and the cast are all excellent in this wonderful movie and it's really worth the price of admission. By all means pay the extra fee to see this film in 3D because it is well worth it. Scorsese knows his film history lesson and he really pays a beautiful homage to those early films which he has worked so hard to make sure get restored and saved.The story takes place in a train station in Paris where twelve year old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives on his own hiding and running from the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) while making sure all the clocks in the station work. Hugo is on his own because his father (Jude Law) who was a clock maker and worked at a Museum died in a fire. All Hugo has left is a broken automaton that he was trying to fix with his father. Hugo believes that this automata holds a message from his dead father, therefore he works endlessly to try to find the right pieces to fix it. Hugo survives by stealing from the different shoppers in the station. One day he is caught stealing by a toymaker named Georges (Ben Kingsley) who orders him to give him everything he has in his pockets. Georges takes a notepad that Hugo's father had given him, so Hugo decides to follow the grumpy old man home in order to retrieve his notepad. This is where Hugo meets Georges's goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), who befriends Hugo and the two begin to have adventures together. Isabelle promises to get Hugo's notepad back and helps him finding the missing pieces needed to fix the automaton. Isabelle also introduces Hugo to the world of literature, while Hugo teaches her about cinema. Together they discover the truth about Georges and decide it is about time he stops hiding from the past.Hugo is based on Brian Selznick's children book, The Invention of Hugo Cabret, and the screenplay was beautifully adapted by John Logan (who previously worked with Scorsese in The Aviator). Besides being a love letter to the origins of film, the movie also has a very powerful message about finding purpose and meaning in life. Like machines, people can be broken if they don't know what their true purpose in life is. Every piece in a machine has a specific function that makes everything work, and in the same way every person has a purpose that allows life to continue functioning as planned. I really loved the performance from the two kids in this movie: Butterfield and Grace Moretz. They looked lovely together. Grace Moretz is my favorite young actress and she just has the screen presence and charisma that other actresses don't have. Ben Kingsley was magnificent in his key role, and so was Christopher Lee. Sacha Baron Cohen was funny as always, and his character served as the comic relief because I imagine many kids getting bored if the film only focused on the Georges character. This is really a great family film and one you should see, especially if you are interesting in the history of films and how it all began. There are several scenes from early films, and I can't imagine how any true film lover wouldn't like this wonderful movie. It's a masterpiece.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
don't like it? you have no soul,"this movie is almost perfect. a wonderful blend of great aesthetic, art, performances, script, story, music! if you are expecting Raging Bull or Good Fellas, you will be disappointed, but if you are a movie lover you will love this. If this movie does not please you, I'm sorry, but there is something wrong with your heart and soul. I have just been informed that I have to write at least ten lines to submit this review, so I will ramble on a bit more about how wonderful this film is. It is a homage to movies, a fairy story, a heart warming human drama, a wonderful fantasy.

Salute to early films,"This is a film that pays homage to the classic. It can be said that there are details and homage everywhere in the film. The shooting level and the shooting input can be said to be very meticulous. The most advanced film equipment, Arri Alexa3D camera, is used to display the visual picture incisively and vividly. Robert Richardson shot it in person. The studio shot it in the famous Shepperton studio in the UK. The picture combines the early superimposed color photography effect of the Lumiere Brothers. The retro color is strong, and the light is a retro warm color, which increases the mystery of the picture. In the picture, it is clearly proposed to pay tribute to George M é li è s, the famous artist in the early period, as well as the Monterey Studios of Meriere and many classic clips, among which are also paid tribute to some of the early classic films of Metropolis, Modern Times, Berlin: Die Sinfonie der Gro ß stadt. But in addition to these, everything else is simply unbearable. The performance, character image, detail arrangement, plot handling, and emotional context are not as good as an ordinary film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually very well made.,"I only watched this movie for two reasons. Because it won five Oscars and I wanted to see if it deserved to win those awards. And also because Martin Scorsese directed it, not immediately a name known for making bad movies. Those were the only two reasons, otherwise I wouldn't have watched it, as a family movie isn't really the genre I would go for. That's probably the weakest thing about this movie, the story, it looks a bit childish, but credit where credit's due it's visually very well made. For that alone it already deserved an award. I can't say I didn't enjoy the movie because strangely I did, even though it's more for kids than adults, the cinematography is stunning. The cast was good, most of the actors had already a good reputation and even the younger actors have proved by now that they can act. Hugo is a good family movie, one that I would probably have watched over and over again if I was still ten years old, but as an adult once is just enough.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hugo,"An absolutely fabulous tale of a boy who is lost and finds his way. Hugo lives in a train station and does not quite fit in. He has the gift of tinkering with mechanical objects and is driven to find out what will make a certain mechanical robot work. This was one that was passed from his father and serves as a link to the past. Hugo is now without his detractors as the Station Inspector are bound to rid him of this underground world. The set design is amazing and the special effects will sure to wow you. It also teaches you something more about Melies, and how he became famous. The aspect of Hugo that touched me the most was his curiosity and how he tried so hard to achieve his goal: understand who Melies was This is also one of the first movies in which Scorsese deal with a happy ending and this is strange because usually he always puts in an unexpected conclusion, maybe also sad.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I loved Hugo; the reason I read about cinema history, the reason I love movies from all decades is what inspired Scorsese to create this little masterpiece. There is a purity and warmth around the whole film from beginning to end. It's about people who are yearning for inspiration, lovers of beauty and loyalty.

There is no adventure or excitement, even though the actors keep promising to take us on an adventure. When the movie was over I was scratching my head trying to figure out what had just happened. From reading other reviews it appears to have something to do with film preservation?I usually agree with the ratings on IMDb, but not this time. I looked at my watch more than the screen, and my 6 year old fell asleep!!!If you decide to see this film bring lots of caffeine or be sure to have your smart phone so you can play Angry Birds(or your App of choice).Do not waste your money or two hours of your life on this horrible movie.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

For me, the movie cinematography part is a 8/10 and direction wise it is a 7. This is my opinion ,rest everything is up-to you.

Fantastic movie...if you're not a kid.,"Hugo is dubbed as a family/kids movie, but after seeing it, I believe any child watching it would find it boring and uninteresting. This is a two hour movie, which is a long time to hold any youngster's attention, and Hugo is very slow-paced, dramatic, and adult-themed in my mind. Although appropriate for children, I believe the adults will be the ones getting the entertainment out of Hugo.That being said, Hugo is a wonderful movie. Heartfelt, inspiring, and uplifting, not to mention visually stunning. It tells the story of Hugo, a boy who is orphaned when his father dies, and ends up living in the walls of a train station and trying to repair a mechanical man that his father left behind in hopes of getting a message from him. He meets Isabelle and her godparents, and finds out there's more to them than meets the eye.This is the first time I've seen Sacha Baron Cohen in a movie that is not raunchy and crude like Borat and The Dictator. He is sort of the comic relief of this movie, but his acting is very good as the station inspector. As always, Chloe Moretz is perfect in her role as Isabelle, and I must say that her accent was very convincing. Asa Butterfield does an OK job as Hugo, but doesn't stand out as excellent.Overall, a movie with wonderful visual effects, and a very inspiring story. Kid friendly? Not really. There are a few parts that kids would like, but mostly adult-oriented. Also, I believe they could have cut this down to about 90 minutes and gotten about the same result. It does get a little tiresome.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese Does a Famly Film,"In 1931, 12-year-old Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in Paris with his father, a widowed, but kind and devoted master clockmaker. Hugo's father takes him to see films and loves those of Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) best of all.It is no secret that Scorsese loves film. As a director, you have to, but some just go above and beyond devouring every aspect of it. Scorsese is one of those, and this is his love letter to cinema, harking all the way back to its beginnings with Georges Melies.The cast is incredible, with Chloe Moretz, Ben Kingsley and Sacha Baron Cohen. Heck, we even have Ray Winstone and Jude Law. Quite a lineup.Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars saying ""Hugo is unlike any other film Martin Scorsese has ever made, and yet possibly the closest to his heart: a big-budget, family epic in 3-D, and in some ways, a mirror of his own life. We feel a great artist has been given command of the tools and resources he needs to make a movie about – movies."" Spot on.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Martin Scorsese, one of the best directors in the world still made Hugo a good story, but the book had a better one. I expected a better story, but I had the same thought about four people. Asa Butterfield, Chloe Grace Moretz, Ben Kingsley, and Sacha Baron Cohen.

"Scorsese's love letter to classic, silent cinema.","Enchanting. Charming. Magical. After re-watching this film again, I can still confirm Hugo (2011) legitimately earned all its technical Oscars, even if it didn't end up winning Best Picture. Ironically enough, this American movie about the origins of French film lost out to a French movie about the origins of American talking pictures (i.e., The Artist (2011)). Of course, the more surprising aspect of this film was how Martin Scorsese was able to make such an entertaining (and family-friendly) film that didn't involve the mafia at all.Personally, as an avid lover of classic films, I enjoyed the romanticism related to the earliest of film magicians. Scorsese's love letter to the origins of cinema-and the masters of their craft like Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley)-is a stark reminder of how much we've lost of cinema's heritage due to external events that forced the artistic community to abandon their art. The amount of experimentation and inventive special effects at the turn of the 20th century are still awe-inspiring, and Hugo gives a brief glimpse behind the scenes for how artists like Méliès achieved them.Of course, the Méliès storyline is only half of this film, as the other half is filled with plenty of amusing sub-plots that swirl around the titular Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield). Inevitably, it's the people of the train station, whose lives intertwine with the numerous passengers just passing through, who gives this movie its heart. All this being said, I'd almost recommend watching this film back-to-back with Méliès' A Trip to the Moon (1902), along with several other classic silent films that make brief appearances like Intolerance (1916), The Kid (1921), Safety Last! (1923), and Steamboat Bill, Jr. (1928).Scorsese's love letter to classic, silent cinema, I give Hugo 5.0 stars out of 5.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The storyline is nothing to write home about and I don't know how so many people liked this movie, perhaps teenagers did it because to me this was clearly unwatchable. Maybe Scorsese's eyebrows are beginning also to grow inwardly making him lose the ability to make a good movie, just saying, don't know. Nothing of this movie astounded me, it just didn't appeal to me at all. I felt like I was wasting my time. The movie just strain way too much for effect and instead of swaying people it bores them.

A magical delight,"*THIS REVIEW IS OF THE 2D VERSION*Scorsese's first film for children is absolutely enchanting, and proves he really is a great filmmaker. Part of being a great filmmaker, of course, is being able to put the right team around you (hence why Ridley Scott's work, as brilliant as he is, is so patchy), which in this case included cinematographer Robert Richardson and erstwhile editor Thelma ""The Mothercutter"" Schoonmaker.Hugo really feels like two films in one. On one hand it's a magical children's story, and on the other it's a(n) homage to the life and work of Georges Méliès. Rather than being wrapped up in his own world, Scorsese is a true student of cinema, and his genuine love and admiration of Méliès shines through.Chloë Grace Moretz's English accent is very good, though her usually excellent acting borders a little on the gushing here, while Asa Butterfield manages to be sweet and sympathetic but not sickly. I've also warmed to Jude Law's acting in recent years, and his is one of several delightful cameo performances by a host of class acts, rather like people you know in your everyday life popping up in a pleasant dream.Verdict: A proper family film that doesn't patronise kids or nauseate adults.

Childhood Dreams and Cinematic Wonders,"Hugo is a film that celebrates the magic of storytelling and the wonder of cinema. Set against the backdrop of 1930s Paris, it follows the journey of a young boy named Hugo Cabret, played with wide-eyed wonder by Asa Butterfield. Living in the walls of a bustling train station, Hugo's life is like a silent film, filled with secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.The film's visuals are a feast for the eyes, with each frame a meticulously crafted work of art. From the grandeur of the train station to the intricacies of Hugo's mechanical creations, every detail is imbued with a sense of whimsy and nostalgia. It's like stepping into a painting by Renoir or a storybook illustrated by Toulouse-Lautrec.At its heart, ""Hugo"" is a love letter to cinema itself. Through Hugo's eyes, we see the magic of the silver screen come to life, from the pioneering works of Georges Méliès to the timeless classics that continue to captivate audiences to this day. It's like watching a reel of film unwind before your very eyes, revealing the rich tapestry of stories that have shaped our collective imagination.The film's cast is a veritable who's who of talent, with standout performances from Ben Kingsley as the enigmatic Georges Méliès, Sacha Baron Cohen as the bumbling station inspector, and Chloë Grace Moretz as Isabelle, Hugo's spirited companion. Each actor brings their character to life with a warmth and authenticity that is both charming and captivating.But perhaps the most enchanting aspect of ""Hugo"" is its message of hope and redemption. It's like a ray of sunlight breaking through the clouds on a rainy day, reminding us that even in our darkest moments, there is always the possibility of transformation and renewal, and transporting us to a world where dreams and reality collide in a symphony of wonder and awe.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Made not by the director of ""Goodfellas"" but by the filmlover of ""Il mio viaggo in Italia""","Martin Scorsese, the director of gangster movies like ""Goodfellas"" (1990) and ""Gangs of New York"" (2002) with ""Hugo"" (2011) made a family movie that in its first half is somewhere in between a Disney production and a Charles Dickens adaptation.Sounds strange? Unless you wait until the second half of the film. Then it becomes clear that the man who made ""Hugo"" is not the director of the gangster movies but the connoisseur of film history who also made ""A personal journey with Martin Scorsese through American movies"" (1995) and ""Il mio viaggio in Italia"" (1999).The second part of the movie is an hommage to the birth of cinema in general and Georgies Méliès in particular. ""Safety last"" (1923, Fred Newmeyer & Sam Taylor), the well known Harold Loyd vehicle, and ""Le voyage dans la lune"" (1902, Georges Méliès) are quoted extensively, but there are many more quotes waiting to be recognized.The film is shot in 3D and this is not only paying tribute to the inventiveness of Méliès but also results in a marvelous tracking shot at the start of the film.Nearly the whole film is situated on a train station. In my interpretation this is also a wink to one of the most famous film fragments, namely ""Arrival of a train on the station of la Ciotat"" (1895, Lumière brothers), also quoted in ""Hugo"".",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Long and boring,"While Martin Scorses's Hugo was a huge contender at the 2012 Oscars and took home five statuettes, the average audience member will come away from it thinking it was incredibly long and boring. What they don't know is the movie wasn't really made for the average person to appreciate—it was made for those who care about film history and preservation. Although the main hype was to educate people on the importance of film preservation, that message will go over most people's heads.A little boy, Asa Butterfield, lives in a train station, and as he grieves for his father, he feels compelled to solve a mystery involving his late father and others he hasn't yet met. While this is the main plot of the story, it's not executed very well. I saw this movie in the theaters, surrounded by lots of interested people, and hardly anyone could remember the key plot points once the film was over. The movie seems to bank on distracting the audience with very small parts by Sascha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, and Ben Kingsley. None of these people really advance the already thin story, but if they had, the story would have been infinitely more interesting.By the time the old footage of silent movies is shown, audiences have most likely checked out and aren't paying attention. If you're in Hollywood or film school, you'll think this is an essential movie that pays tribute to a wonderful era. If you're an average Joe, you'll think you were ripped off by your ticket price.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Always Fantastic,"The first time I watched this film I was around ten years old and had just finished reading the book; it was magical then and it's magical now. Maybe it's the fact that I watched it on a rainy day, but I really felt like I was in the Paris train station in 1931, sitting behind the clocks with Hugo.
I think the way that it was filmed really reflects the stunning art from the book, taking in all the little details and never rushing anything. They way the people in the station were filmed was beautiful, and some of my favourite parts to watch were when we got glimpses into the lives of the different workers in the station (and those dogs were adorable.) I couldn't really find anything to dislike immediately after watching Hugo, nor can I find anything a few hours later besides some things being a little too convenient. But really, what movie isn't a little too convenient at times.
The acting in the movie was wonderful and I especially loved how they pieced the actors into old Georges Melies films to really bring the characters into the same universe.
As a child I don't think I could really appreciate how many layers this film had, particularly in the amount of Easter eggs in it, but watching it again brought a whole new perspective and appreciation to the film. I would recommend this to literally anyone on the street.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magnificent,"Both completely of Scorsese's filmography and apart from it, Hugo is a masterful adaptation of the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick from one of cinema's greatest filmmakers, using all of the modern tool set to create a visually lush and dense feast for the eyes matched by a wonderful emotional journey that intelligently synthesizes several different story elements into one cohesive experience. Free of guile and irony, this is Scorsese's most earnestly heartfelt film that feels closest to his own heart. His love for the subject is infectious.The titular character Hugo is a young boy living in the walls of Gare Montparnasse in Paris, winding the clocks in the absence of his uncle whom Hugo hasn't seen in months. He moved in with his uncle after his father, a clockmaker with whom Hugo had a very loving relationship after the death of his mother, died in a fire at a museum. They had been working on rebuilding an automaton that Hugo's father had found in the museum's basement, finding parts for the intricate internal clockwork to discover what it could possible be. After his father's death, the automaton becomes the only thing tying Hugo to his departed father, more important to him because of that emotional connection than just a curiosity.In the train station works a wide coterie of interesting characters, and the way Hugo watches their lives play out in snippets feels like a direct callback to Hitchcock's Rear Window. The least prominent of them, Madame Emile and Monsieur Frick, are an older pair that look to find connection, but Madame Emile's dog snaps and keeps them apart. There's also the station inspector who yearns for the attention of the flower lady, Lisette, but can't bring himself to even say hello because his leg injury from the war, which he needs a creaky brace for, causes him embarrassment. Lastly, there is Papa Georges, a sad old man who runs the toy shop off to the side, sitting alone most of the day as people pass his stall without notice.Hugo needs clockwork pieces for the automaton, so Papa Georges' stall is the ideal place to find the little gears he is trying to procure. Hugo has no money, though, so he tries to use Georges' boredom that becomes sleepiness to sneak the implements. Caught, though, Georges takes Hugo's notebook, written by his father and describing the efforts to fix the automaton, as punishment for Hugo's actions, but there seems to be more to it than that. Hugo follows Georges home and discovers that he is living with a young girl his age, Isabelle. Isabelle promises to protect Hugo's notebook from burning, and the next day Hugo proves to Georges that he is a worthwhile mechanic by fixing a toy. Georges provides Hugo an opportunity to earn his notebook back by working in the shop.That gets all of the pieces in place for the real story to develop. Everything up to this point has been wonderful and told adeptly, but it's as Hugo gets closer to Isabelle and discovers the hidden past of Georges that things really begin to click together. The automaton has a connection to Georges. Hugo and Isabelle finally make the final fixes on the machine, and it draws a picture of a rocket hitting the man in the moon in the eye and also signs Papa Georges' name. The automaton being Hugo's only connection to his father, he needs to pursue the mystery even further, thinking that it will bring him closer to his dead father. They can't approach Papa Georges' about the picture, so they go to his wife, Mama Jeanne.Papa Georges, it turns out, is Georges Melies, the French filmmaking pioneer who made La Voyage dans la Lune, amongst many others. With the help of a film academic, Hugo and Isabelle are able to bring the past alive for Mama Jeanne and Papa Georges, but the past is painful. Georges was on the top of the world when he made his movies, and Mama Jeanne was his muse, but World War I ended that. Tastes changed, he had to sell his movies for the chemicals to make women's shoes, and he's been left with nothing of his work but a small box of drawings hidden away in his wardrobe. Seeing the drawings of the automaton was a stab to his heart, a reminder of the glories that he'd lost and the lower station he found himself in there, running a toy shop. The worst part, though, was the loss of his art. Gone forever.What makes all of this work emotionally is how everyone's emotional journeys are tied together. Hugo's need for connection to his father leads him to Papa Georges. Georges' need for artistic validation leads him to Hugo. Even the Station Inspector connecting with Lisette is tied to Georges accepting Hugo, having hunted Hugo for the whole film as being an orphan loitering in his station and caught him just as Hugo found his place. The station inspector, in front of Lisette with his hand on Hugo's arm, has to chose between his obsession and allowing Hugo to go home. Combined with all of this comes the love for a lost art form, the silent movie.Martin Scorsese has a long history of not only making films but of preserving them. Founding The Film Foundation in 1990, he's been instrumental in film preservation efforts for over 30 years now. Film history is deeply important to him, and the final half of this film deals directly with one of the first great masters of the form, Melies, having lost all of his work and discovering that some percentage of it still exists. The key here, dramatically, isn't that Scorsese is presenting something he loves, but the film ties it to the characters directly, most importantly to Hugo himself, and the love that Scorsese feels gets manifested in an infectious appreciation for the work. There's a small montage of many of the most magical bits from Melies' movies that the movie crescendos to, ending up as a celebration of the community that film viewing and making creates, with Hugo at the center of it.And that is kind of amazing. The movie is a personal Dickensian journey for an orphan boy that ends up twisting his fate in with a celebration of old movies, and that celebration becomes an extension of the boy's emotional catharsis.The movie is an absolute joy to simply look at, as well, Scorsese completely blew his budget, making a movie that was way too expensive to ever make its money back, but you can see every dime on screen. From the beautiful shots of computer generated 1931 Paris to the massive sets with wonderful visual depth to the mass of people that populate the frame, there's constantly a huge amount of visual information to absorb, but through all of that Scorsese is able to discretely point the audience's eye towards what's important. In crowd scenes, it's easy to pinpoint Hugo, Isabelle, or the station inspector. I've never seen the film in 3D (despite owning the 3D Blu-ray because I don't own a 3D television), but it's obvious that the overall brightness and clarity of the images would combine well with the natural depth within the frame to create a very immersive effect from beginning to end.There's little surprise that the acting is quite good here, but the real surprise is that the acting is so good from the child actors. Chloe Grace Moritz seems to be a bit of a natural actress, but Asa Butterfield gives a surprisingly convincing performance as Hugo. His big emotional moments, like when he thinks the automaton is broken or when he's confronting the station inspector for the final time, are quite good. The rest of the cast carries their own well, but a special note must be made for Ben Kingsley. The British professional carries the deep sadness of Melies and the quiet happiness and pride late in the film with such poise and restraint that he ends up delivering one of my favorite performances in a Scorsese film. He was such a wounded creature that I wanted him to be fixed.And that's kind of the central idea: people fixing each other. As Hugo fixes the automaton, so does he fix Papa Georges and Papa Georges fixes him in return.I loved this movie. It really is one of my favorite Scorsese's.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Where ever Hugo there you are,"This is a unique combination of the way the story is told as an interweaving of a fictional protagonist to tell the story of a real-life person. I have seen the formula of interweaving reality with a fictional character before; one of the most famous is the book ""Sophie's World"" by Jostein Gaarder.Anyway, the basic story is of a child that loses his father and thinks that his father left him a message that will change his life. In the process of perusing the message, he meets Georges Méliès who may just have a message to change the reader's life.The book this film is based on incorporated a lot of pictures to help tell the story. This is innovative and holds your attention. However, it did not translate well into the film as the film was slow and dragged a lot in scenes and even dialog. They lost the continuity and purpose of the story by incorporating the station inspector story that was a minor part of the book. It was too slapstick. What was great graphics in the book translated in almost cartoonish graphics in the film? However, they did an excellent presentation of how the original films were designed to show us the stuff that dreams were made of.The flat-screen version was well enough. The 3D graphics were sort of gimmicky sort of looking through a stereoscope; however, they were several fields deep.So, we have some unnecessary story added and some slow dragging parts but, in the end, the feel of the original book shines through.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
'I was greatly Disappointed',"After watching a rather awesome looking trailer of Hugo i was convinced to go see it, but when the credits finally came all i could say is that i was greatly Disappointed.The movie does have drama and adventure but it just didn't seem to be enough. Half of it dragged on about the old man making movies and boring stories.I was, however reminded of the cruelty of the world in how the guard in train station treated the poor orphans.The storyline was...okay but with a few changes it honestly could have been better.I was very excited to see the movie and had i hopes for it to be thrilling but all i was, was disappointed. The trailer showed only the interesting scenes in which there weren't many. Just like many movies (except one that comes to mind; journey to the mysterious island) the trailer is better than the movie, and this was a perfect example of that.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It really is magical....,"Leaving all judgments aside; one needs to watch this film with an open heart. Doing so you will get lost in the magical world Scorsese has created. Scorsese with this film, and Woody Allen with ""Midnight in Paris"", have taught us how books and films can melt together to get us lost into this magical world only great directors can describe. There's no doubt that the French are cocky, but the world would not be the same without them. They really are a writer's haven; the place where great minds can express themselves freely without judgments and political demise. The greatest writer of the modern era from my country (Ismail Kadare); a writer and revolutionary nonetheless; found refuge and bloomed in beautiful Paris. And this film; for me; reincarnates how a beautiful minds can bloom in this great country. Thank you Paris. Thank You Scrosese.

Best Film Of 2011,"After seeing the trailers, reading positive reviews and acknowledging the hype, I had high expectations for 'Hugo'. I wasn't disappointed. Martin Scorsese has truly made a masterpiece, and I was thoroughly impressed and delighted by it. Everything about it is just perfect. The subtle understated story, the jaw-dropping setting and special effects are wonderful. The film is the most visually appealing I've seen in a long time. But the best thing by far is the acting. Asa Butterfield (Hugo) is destined to be a star. His performance was extraordinary, as he had to portray many different emotions and every one of them was convincing. The most memorable thing about him are his eyes, as they are so deep and soulful, and really got to me in the sad parts of the film. He was very appealing as Hugo, and I'm sure we will see more of him in the future. Chloe Moretz (Isabelle) was good as well, although her accent faltered slightly, and there were moments where she was a bit OTT. But she complimented Asa nicely as the companion. Ben Kingsley was very touching as the unappreciated film maker, and Sascha Baron Cohen gave a good comedic turn as the station master, though he was a bit scary in parts. I really liked the little clips of old films as well, because this gave the movie a nostalgic feel. One of the only problems I have is the fact it's made out to be a kids film, and I think it's too long for a child to sit through comfortably. In a way it starts off as a child's movie, what with the chase and everything. But then it descends into a more interesting and mature plot in the second half,and this was the point where I was satisfied my 3D ticket had been well worth the price. Best film of 2011; go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dreamlike,"Beautiful sets and costumes, alongside stunning CG/3D technology transport us into the visually wondrous world of Hugo.The story seemingly about a young boy who is living in a train station working the clock evolves into a story about a filmmaker. A bit children's adventure and a bit mystery the story achieves a childlike wonder as you watch the clues and story unfold to nice surprises, satisfying conclusions and resonations of commentary concerning the preservation of film itself. Hugo is about nostalgia, nostalgia for Paris in a romantic period, the nostalgia for seeing movies for the first time as a child, and nostalgia for old films themselves.It was a nice, pleasant story that seems a bit contrived and forced forward at times. The transitions in the plot were not smooth and happened so randomly that it pragmatically seemed like a stretch; however Hugo should not be watched for its absolute realism. The story as the visuals itself are surrealistic, beautifully imaginative and semi-realistic therefore transporting us to dreamlike Paris in the early part of the 20th century. The imagery and story itself feel as though you are in a dream which makes the contrived plot acceptable.A delightfully nostalgic calmness resonates as we sense the old fashion flavor in conjunction with the old ragtime music similar to what would be heard and seen when experiencing an old silent film from around the turn of the century (20th century).The softening of the typical contemporary edgy themes created an old fashioned, relaxed, slower paced flavor yet the innovated CG and 3D make it more modern than almost any movie of it day. The 3D effects enhance the experience. You feel as though you are walking into highly populated hallways, up towers, you feel like you are in clocks peering out over the dazzling, wintry, romantic city of lights and you can not help but crack up as Sasha Baron Cohen's face comes closer and closer to your own as he once again scolds the protagonist. The assortment of extras dressed to the nines in outfits of the time, the small side stories and mini romances such as between the train's security guard and the flower girl created details that make Hugo a nice, encompassing, well crafted film.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese fixing things!,"The film is very touching. IMO, it inspires at many levels and all the characters themselves draw inspiration from the events of the film. I found it very emotional from all of the character's viewpoint.The characters were well developed. It has clearly but in a subtle way portrayed:1) Hugo's great connection with his father 2) Isabelle has read a lot about adventures and all but never had any. She likes many things but doesn't know her purpose and in the end, she does find one. 3) the station inspector had a great feeling for the flower lady but couldn't take a step forward on account of his fears and getting adept to not needing/having a family. 4) Christopher Lee's character and his approach to the world via books... and many more things that if I start counting will capture every part of the film really. Everyone was a dreamer.I really like the sequence where Hugo's dream is followed up by another one. That is first of a kind I have seen ever. I may be ignorant if its shown elsewhere, however. But its portrayed in a way that dreams are bizarre but still very much linked to what occupies our mind.It also showed how the war not only changed the lives of the soldiers and everyone directly involved but also affected may people indirectly. In this case, a film-maker and his entire passion/business and everyone else involved. What a great point the film has made on this front, short but simply brilliant!Looking at the film made me feel that it would have sounded more befitting if one told me that it was made by Tim Burton and immediately made me recall Edward Scissorhands. But it was Martin Scorsese and when I come to think of it, it is more befitting to him considering the context of the film and history of films more importantly.The way he feels about the history of cinema, contributions of various film-makers and his encyclopedic knowledge of that, I just could not resist thinking that may be, Scorsese is ""Hugo"" and the child in him is trying to fix things for the forgotten dreamers. I take it as a tribute to all the people who dreamed, loved telling stories via this media and created a magnificent escape from reality, or even show the reality, developed this medium, who are easily forgotten and broken. It mends their hearts with devotion and probably that is why the key to the working of the automaton is also heart shaped which is thing Hugo keeps looking for to fix it.Ed Wood was my previous favorite trying to attempt that, but this has surpassed it. It doesn't mean Ed Wood isn't brilliant. Of course, in the vast sea of cinema there can be 2 or more ""best"".Try to see it from Scorsese's eyes as he is the story-teller, try to understand what's said and left unsaid, try to understand the expressions. This film gets a purpose and meaning, many may be. Suit yourself with whatever way you are able to connect with it.The least it can do for you is inspire you to do something, because machines never come with any extra parts, you know. They always come with the exact amount they need. So, if the entire world was one big machine, you and I couldn't be an extra part. We had to be here for some reason! In the times of deepest troubles, we can still be useful for someone. Someone who may need us.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The lead role doesnt click, the skill needed to portray his character is absent,
this for a start breaks any empathy or emotion the movie tries to inflict.
Yes he has nice blue eyes, thats about it.
The pace of the movie is horrid and the comic relief in the station guard is about the only thing that breaks this slowpaced ""experience"".

Hugo (2011) - What an Imaginative Rebirth of the Wonders of Cinema!,"After a life-long career of directing bad-ass gangster flicks, and bloody gang films, director Martin Scorsese makes his first ever family film with the use of the newest 3-D technology, and makes one of the most enchanting films in his career, or one of the best motion pictures in cinema history. ""Hugo"" tells the story of a young boy named Hugo Cabret, portrayed wonderfully by Asa Butterfield, who lives in the clock towers of a Paris train station in the 1930s. He tries to find the ingredient needed to help fix a mechanical design, found by his deceased father, portrayed brilliantly in short cameo flashbacks by Jude Law. He then finds a key that might unlock a message from his father. Hugo then goes on a life-changing quest to find the secrets of his father's device, and learn the secrets of one man's wonderful but horrid past. I absolutely loved this brilliant masterpiece, and Scorsese succeeds once again. I've never been amazed by a movie that contained those nostalgic elements. The directing by Martin Scorsese is pure gold, and he makes sure that the audience is along for the ride. Also, the cast is just pure brilliant, from the tall to the small. Asa Butterfield is the scene-stealing performance in the title role, and he delivers the right acting that the audience can relate to. Chloe Grace Moretz is great playing Hugo's only friend, Emily Mortimer is charming as the flower girl, Christopher Lee is terrific as the librarian, Sacha Baron Cohen is excellent as the inspector obsessed with rounding up orphans, but Ben Kingsley delivered most of the credit for playing a tragic toy shop owner, with a beautiful past that he tends to forget. ""Hugo"" is a technological wonder that helps bring this magical world come to life, in front of our eyes. The visual effects are top-notch beautiful, the sound is breathtaking, the 3-D puts you right in the middle of the action, and the art direction feels like stepping into a storybook. I will always remember ""Hugo"" as a wonderful tribute to why movies are being made today. This is a movie that is an homage to the many amazing wonders of going to the movies, and making them. Just like ""The Artist"", this is a love letter to cinema, and it will live on for many cinema lovers to see.

What A Masterpiece,"Beautiful. Exquisite. Magical.You'd be forgiven for mistaking seeing these words on a review for a Martin Scorsese film. When it was announced that the Academy-Award winning director was going to direct an adaptation of Brian Selznick's children's picture-novel, it left filmgoers wondering why on Earth would the masterful director of such brutal classics as Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, GoodFellas and The Departed turn his talents to a film for children.However, when Hugo was released to the world and an entrancing love letter to the history of cinema emerged, the only question on anyone's lips was why on Earth wouldn't he.Even from the opening shot of the film, as the intricate mechanics of a clock fade into the stunning night streets of Paris, it becomes very obvious that Hugo is far from a career misfire for Scorsese. As the film progresses, it becomes arguable that Hugo might be just be Martin Scorsese's best film yet.Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield, The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) is a 12-year-old orphan with a love for cinema, who secretly operates the clocks of a Paris train station by day and lives between the walls of the station by night. His late father (Jude Law, Cold Mountain) left behind a broken automaton for the two of them to fix. To complete the puzzle, Hugo needs a heart- shaped key to unlock its message. Unfortunately, that very key is nowhere to be found.As Robert Richardson's stunning cinematography glides through the platforms, we are introduced to an eclectic group of people, ranging from a sweet flower girl (Emily Mortimer, Shutter Island) to the quiet owner of a bookshop (Christopher Lee, The Lord of the Rings) to Salvador Dali himself (a brief cameo from Ben Addis). Keeping these colourful characters in order is the stern Inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohnen, Borat).As the story advances, Hugo meets avid book reader Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz, Kick Ass) and her mysterious grandfather (Ben Kingsley, Gandhi). No sensible film reviewer would reveal any further details of the adventures of Hugo as he befriends Isabelle and begins his search, but it can be said that their discoveries are enough to bring a tear of joy to the eyes of any true cinephile.It has been said that, so far in his career, Martin Scorsese has directed. at least one masterpiece per decade. In Hugo, he continues that tradition is perfect style and re- establishes himself as one of cinema's greatest living directors. Bravo.VERDICT: Both an enthralling mystery and a beautiful love letter to cinema, Martin Scorsese's ""Hugo"" is a visually stunning and emotionally satisfying nostalgia experience for young and old. Simply magic.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Never was there a more beautiful movie,"WEEKLY MOVIE REVIEW : HUGUMINI-REVIEW : Never was there a more beautiful movieRATING : See it in theaters and in 3D (Rating System: ""See it in theaters"", ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time"")Hugo (Asa Butterfield, ""The Boy in the Striped Pajamas"") is an orphan living in a Paris railway station in 1938. His father was a museum curator and watchmaker. Before his death, Hugo's father had found an automaton (mechanical man) which he and Hugo were attempting to fix.By night, Hugo keeps the clocks in the railway station running. Hugo steals parts from a toymaker (Ben Kingsley) who catches on to Hugo and mentors him. The toymaker is godfather to young orphan Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz, ""Kick-Ass"") who befriends Hugo and insists on seeing his home. Hugo agrees and shows her the automaton and together they get it to work. The first thing it draws is a picture from a movie that Hugo used to watch with his father. And we're off. . .This is without a doubt the most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Every detail of this film has been made with the utmost care and love. Even the snowflakes are amazing. I saw it in 3D and it is the first 3D movie I have seen that uses 3D artistically, not as a gimmick. There are scenes where the camera runs us through a crowd, and we feel as if we are there, brushing past bystanders. The sets look and sound real. The clockworks within the tower clock and automaton are as real as any wind up clock you know. If director Martin Scorsese had intended to create a masterpiece, then he has succeeded.The children (Butterfield, Moretz) are heartbreakingly beautiful. They give performances that exude the innocence of youth and a constant sense of urgency. Butterfield in particular plays Hugo as a tortured youngster with a passion for fixing things. In Hollywood movies it is so easy to play young people as wise beyond their years and / or smart- alecky. Instead, these children are three-dimensional with purpose and wonder.It turns out that this film is not so much the story of an orphan boy, but a wonderful homage to one of film's great pioneers. We get a retrospective of the early days of film and a film history lesson without even knowing it. Scorsese takes up the gauntlet of film innovators who came before and makes his mark in film history by crafting a 3-D movie others will aspire to match. This is clearly an Academy Award winner and instant classic.So for wonderful acting, amazing effects, beautiful set design, creative storytelling, and a loving tribute to a historical film legend, you must ""see it in the theater.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A new timeless classic.,"If any film maker in the history of films can get best picture of the year for a 3D film, this will be it. I can say that I don't feel the same way as other critics do about this film, though, where as they say it is a kids film. Sure this is something that can be enjoyed by anyone, and is appropriate for any age, but I can't see little kids being fully engaged throughout this film, especially if they would rather see a penguin dance on screen and just see something simple to the mind. There is plenty of scenes here where it is partly just visuals without dialogue, and then others with a lot of talking that is actually quite brilliant and rare in any family film. This movie is not something simple to take in. In a lot of ways, it is a piece of art that captures what has been lost in film throughout the years from it's climb from the start of when films became films. It captures everything that a great film from decades ago had and yet feels totally fresh. This is something to cherish, and can honestly be called one of the greatest achievements in film history. It makes every other 3D film (including Avatar) looks like amateur work. The performances here are also flawless, and well all in all this is one film I can say IS indeed entirely flawless.

Centainly an amazing tribute to french cinema from the beginning to the end.The movie reminded me a lot of Jean Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro movies, their visuals, the importance of daily life segments, uncommon characters and the using of fantasy to tell an ordinary story. That happens maybe for the fact that Jeunet is one of the most important contemporary french directors and also clear inspired by George Meliés and his fantastic and colorful misé en scene.Scorcese truly offers to the audience a heartfelt and inspired journey that only an experienced director would be able to give, mixing the old school cinema with what is the most modern in filming technology showing a fully emotional trajectory from the old to the new in a perfect balance.Amazing.

Artistry and craftsmanship,"""Hugo"" consists of three movies really. The first movie is the story of the orphan Hugo, his automaton and his mechanical secret world behind the clock. The second movie is the story of a Parisian train station ca. 1930, and its immediate environs, an impossibly charming and romantic place richly filled amusing Parisian characters and human interaction. The third movie is the story of Georges Méliès, apparently all true.Stripped to its bare essentials, the movie's theme is artistry and craftsmanship: the love of clockwork, the love of romantic places and the love of film. Each of these movies and themes has its own characters, plot and pace, but they are interwoven into a single movie. The movie is so rich I'm sure I missed much of it in my single viewing.""Hugo"" is the kind of movie that can be enjoyed by both children and adults. It's not a realistic adult world. There are no politics, no violence, no sex. There is a touch of slapstick, two dimensional characterisation. You'll enjoy this film more if you're at least a little in touch with your inner child. Hugo is a brave and precocious hero, having great adventures in a precarious world. Asa Butterfield played the role beautifully.But nor is it completely a children's movie. We come out of it with a much better understanding of early film-making. And the visual imagery is at times jaw-droppingly beautiful. And of course it makes you fall in love with Paris all over again, even if Scorsese's Paris is one of the imagination.This is an unusual and visually beautiful movie, something I wasn't expecting. It's more of an experience than a movie. Go see it. Go.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
About the movie magic,"The film was concerned more with the first news. Still, the family of Martin Scorsese's film - it's a little unusual, but it is tempting - especially with such actors. In the end, ""Keeper of Time"" does not confirm the fears and exceeds all expectations - with Scorsese got something that does not always work out in the cinema itself, not to mention the individual directors. In front of us - Magic straight from childhood, and it does not matter when it was his childhood - you feel it, not as a modest retrospective. But in order ...Directed by Martin Scorsese in fact - a living classic of cinema, without which it is difficult to imagine the genre of crime films, besides, he was always very talented stylist, and his films were full of very interesting mounting solutions. Does he use this experience in ""Keepers of Time""? Yes, but very selectively. It is encouraging that being on unfamiliar territory, Martin Scorsese did not cling to what he knew numbers and techniques. ""Keeper ..."" looks fresh and at the same time, so it seems that love this movie for a long time. Directed exactly what is honest with his audience, it does not work on some kind of target audience: the film is not lisp, but we do not like regular dark realism, a favorite in modern cinema.And the movie itself - it's a film about magic movie, which is now made to bury under the gloomy scenarios and effects tones. Yes, in the ""Guardian ..."" is not so simple. The protagonist - Hugo Cabra (young, but very entertaining Asa Butterfield) lost his father and forced to live at the train station, watching the clock, and around him, at first glance, it is not friendly people in more accidents and broken - the same as Toys, which sells old magician (Sir Kingsley ene) or leg cruel, but a lone inspector (mustached Sacha Baron Cohen) ... all - like broken clockwork, which never have enough gear, so that they could go further. Thus, the magician will be a real magician - though from the world of cinema, just stopped believing in magic, and evil is not evil inspector, just such a life.The characters here are classic and the film does without surprises. But as he presents them - through the whole picture is not so much a story of growing up, but simply finding yourself. Asa Butterfield played as such can only play so children - clean and quite technical, but with talent. Chloe Moretz, the young, but the star, it looks much more natural than in the same ""Let me in"" or ""Piptse."" Sound terribly old-fashioned role of a girl who dreams of adventure, Chloe looked better than in the roles of girls coming off limbs for people. It was nice to see the big actors - such as Kingsley (as very important for the movie rights), or Christopher Lee. Living legends, they are people usual, but with tremendous spark. Ben Kingsley has turned terribly vulnerable, and bereguschim themselves from large shocks - unlike his other books. Christopher Lee plays the one his monumental charisma, singing - only then - the owner of a bookshop. Sacha Baron Cohen has shown himself not as a chief mocker and troll movie, but as an actor. Yes, its inspector - is a collective image of the employees of all law enforcement agencies, and the stage with delivery of orphans and Doberman explicitly mocked the Nazis, but throughout the film are left covered by this story, these characters do not notice a dirty trick. Especially as Cohen demonstrates really cool game - not only funny but also touching. As for Jude Law and Ray Winston, they are treacherous enough. But Lowe's is charming and sweet as his father Hugo and Winston is the image of the watchmaker-drinkers.In fact, Scorsese filmed a movie about all - and of themselves, and many of the spectators, even the very young. In a world of endless sequels, gloomy and serious restarts no longer believe in the magic of cinema, which it had once granted the. It is significant that the director in whose films reflect the worst vices of men, took the wise but not preachy film. Even in the most vivid and dramatic moments ""Hraniel time"" is kept straight with his audience. He does not need to surprise the beauty of these Paris 30s (and they are great!) Or lecture. After all, a movie - it's magic, which is sometimes not necessary to have a double bottom, and let it remain a focus, but it gives people pleasure. In this respect, ""The Guardian of Time"" - Cinema with a capital letter, not intended for a specific age or age group. The film is beautiful inside and outside of his ideas - a panorama of Paris and the railway station were worth every dollar 170,000,000th budget, and embodied it with great talent and surprisingly gently, carefully.Best story of the year! I am glad that the movie recently lifted from the abyss mrachnyaka - Project Master ""Super 8"", ""The Adventures of Tintin"" and now ""Guardian of time"" once again make Cinema what he must be - a place where dreams are happening!P.S. Could not find the place to describe Howard Shore soundtrack. Well you can not make the entire tip of the words ""magic"" and ""great""! Music turned out to Shore atypical - all very gently and easily, with a great deal of French sounds. In the movie sound track Camille St-Seyesa and Erik Satie - Howard Shore is clearly inspired by the works of these classics ...",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"3D or not, a great movie!","So I decided to go and check out Hugo. For its Oscar nomination and wins, of course, because I'm not very fond of 3D family movies. As it turns out, Martin Scorsese is still Martin Scorsese, even when it comes to directing non-gangster films. He is famous for his movies like Goodfellas, Casino and The Departed, which are the cream of gangster flicks and I understand Scorsese for wanting to try something new. It's not a good thing to be trapped in a genre. Just ask Michael Bay. First I didn't like the idea of 3D Scorsese film, especially a family film, but oh boy, was I wrong.The film reminded me, why I fell in love with movies in the first place. The magic of cinema lingers all around this title, thanks to the amazing skills of Martin Scorsese. Mystery, lovable characters, interesting settings and excitement.I haven't read the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret, so I can't compare the movie to that, but I gotta say Hugo is worthy of all its Oscars (best cinematography, best art direction, best sound design and best sound editing), except one: best special effects. That should've went to Harry Potter, hands down. I mean what's so special about some flying papers? The dream- train scene was very well done, but it's nothing more than we already saw in Inception.The directing is stunning and the cinematography (especially in eye-popping 3D) is spectacular. The story sometimes gets slow, although it's entertaining throughout, the delightful performances of all the actors spice up the film, it's inspirational, it's wonderfully done, charming and touching. Though if the story doesn't grab you, you can always entertain yourself with the amazing visuals, the lovely music and the fantastic directing.I recommend this film to all, all ages will like it, except, maybe, rebellious teens.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo Movie,"Thank you - Thank you - Mr Martin ScorseseDespite positive reviews I was not looking forward to seeing this movie. Believing that it would be just another predictable, mediocre movie aimed at kids for a quick profit.I was wrong !!The art of true cinema has been captured beautifully with your careful attention to detail. The subtle music score with it's french undertones blended well with the meticulous camera work. I was pleasantly surprised to not only be presented with exceptional acting by the adult cast members but outstanding characterizations by your younger actors, Hugo et Isabelle.The storytelling was captivating, humorous and sensitive with many genres harmoniously intertwined.Personal reflections - some scenes were a little long and could have been edited. This movie may not appeal to very young children & may be a little long.A great movie for sensitive adults and older children. I will be buying the DVD.Future generations may not be afforded the platform to create in this cohesively programmed world.I hope your movie will challenge others to dream away.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dazzling not-kiddie fare from Scorsese makes great use of 3D for once,"This imaginative movie about movies is charming, sentimental, and quaint. It is not really for kids (they'll get bored by the plot), although it sustains a level of wonder and joy you don't expect from a Martin Scorsese film. Hugo will rekindle a love for the movies for some and open up an entirely new universe to others. Hugo (Asa Butterfield) is an orphan who lives in a train station, making sure the giant clocks all run on time. He's been deserted by his soused uncle (Ray Winstone), and his parents are long gone. Hugo is alone with his clock machinery and some various doodads from his father, including an old automaton that had been programmed to write and draw. The automaton requires a special key to be activated, and once Hugo locates said key, the real mystery, involving the proverbial wheels within wheels, just like clockwork, is afoot.As an orphan, Hugo must steal food in order to live. He also takes tools so he can work on the automaton, and he's caught by a toymaker named Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley). Méliès has a granddaughter, played by Chloe Grace Moretz, who takes pity on the poor Hugo and helps him in his quest to solve the riddle of the automaton. When Isabelle and Hugo finally do get the automaton working, they find their plans shifting from a connection between the automaton and Hugo's late father and to the previous owner of the automaton, who identity shall remain a mystery here.I'm not a paid reviewer, so I figure it's okay if I take the cheap route and offer up a bad pun. The movie is timely. More than 100 years have passed since the invention of motion pictures, and there are so many people who have no idea what those early films were like. Scorsese, a longtime movie historian, knows all too well his audience, and he gradually allows them to assimilate within the friendly confines of a boy-with-a-mysterious-past story before inviting them into the early world of movies.This is a 3D movie, by the way, and it's the rarest of birds – the kind in which the 3D doesn't attack you like you owe it even more money but rather the kind you don't notice until you need to notice it. Scorsese, ever the perfectionist, uses the medium to its utmost, with a terrific sense of when to hold back and when to hold forth. Not bad at all for his first foray into the new hip way of shooting movies. So, for me, the 3D version of this film is definitely worthwhile.By the final 20 minutes or so of the movie, I was absolutely entranced by what had by then become an homage to older films, to the very dawn of cinema. Scorsese takes great pains to show how difficult it was for fledgling filmmakers to make a movie look so easy. No special effects, no budget, handmade costumes – it was like working with a small grammar school. At one point we are shown an early reel, from the nineteen- aughts, and it's in color. A character explains that although the movie was shot in black and white, the crew painstakingly hand-colored various scenes to add a touch of tint. It's a beautiful detail that I assume is true, as Scorsese, in the framework of a lost-child plot, seeks to educate those of us who are not film historians.And by the end of the movie, the wonderful, poignant performances by Kingsley, Butterfield, Moretz, and Helen McCrory dissolved my senses. There are several touching moments in the waning minutes of the film, and the cast hits all of the right notes. Hugo would serve as a poetic coda if this were the end of the great director's career, but even so it's a love note to the world of movies, translated for a wide, new audience.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
There's Something About Movies,"A simple story, a boy and a girl, both orphans, meet each other and together they try to fix a mysterious automaton. The boy lives alone hidden behind the big watches of a train station in Paris. The girl lives with her godparents, an average old couple, she is a housekeeper and he owns a toy booth at the station. The boy Hugo and the old man George are in permanent conflict, because Hugo is always trying to thieve little pieces from mechanisms in the store, so he could fix the automaton. They actually have an ambiguous relationship, because George also seems to be a little curious about that boy, it seems they have something in common, some affinity or something to share. The antagonism between them is therefore surrounded by a strange affection or even it is a seed of friendship, a fight that could work in benefit of them two, but gradually involves everyone in the movie.Well, that was just the basic. Things get complicated; everything starts to get tied with each other, forming a mechanism itself, the ""big watch"". Making this microcosm function perfectly again demands a series of complicated tasks, dealing with relationships, feelings and the rules of the world that sooner or later will imply big changes in the life of each character. But this will only happen if Hugo, Isabelle and George manage to solve their own problems. The automaton remains in the center of the plot all the time. The train station is full of people, it has an intense movement and there is a lot of activities going on, as Scorsese said, everybody is searching for something about their lives.This movie is so rich of meanings, languages and images; it's like a growing concert, a little bit like Ravel's Bolero, most of the time. I'd dare say that it is not just about the magic of movies - imagination, dream, adventure, magic, drama, entertainment, feelings..., although it's already so much, and it's not limited to the story of these specific characters, and those already work as a big stream of signs and facts being released, but it is kind of a legacy or testimony of Scorsese's career. These three perspectives interact; they work together, one reinforcing the other, all under the director's baton. Scorsese's work is this diverse and wide knowledge about making movies, an experience through decades exploring all kinds of possibilities.We have then a simple story but an intense dancing of signs, images and languages, through a timeless and endless story, if you wish. It is eventually about movies today also, and not only about the memory of movie making. These eras are all contained in the movie, somehow, but there is an outcome, which is Hugo's Invention. That is a metalanguage, there is a little trick in here, because Hugo didn't actually invent the automaton, he just had it under his care, to try to fix it, he had his reasons. So, if he did invent something in this story, and it is highly suggested that he did, what was it? Hugo invented the story itself, meaning, he produced it, together with the movie makers. The fact is that it's very hard to trace a boundary among the main lines of the plot, because they are all interlaced. Hugo works somewhere in between fiction and reality. That is the magic of the movies, enhanced in this one. But, there would be any place like that in the real world? Yes, of course: the imagination.This richness of meanings was also present in the book that originated the movie - I saw after writing this review. Brian Selznick, the author of the book, had said before that his work was a combination of medias and languages. Well, but Scorsese did it in the big screen, with amazing results.The final result is this big interaction that happens when you watch a movie, and the several impacts and consequences that movies really have in our lives. They help us in our searches; help us find a purpose, a place, something to do with our life, to find the happy endings of it, in everything we do. These ""external"" effects are also present in Hugo.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mind numbingly boring - The Worst film of 2011 and possibly of all time,"I was expecting an amazing film given the high ratings this film has received on various review sites... Instead this film was absolute tripe - worse than any film I have seen for at least the past 10 years. It was sooooooo boring and rubbish that my brain literally went numb - I feel extremely sorry for any children who were forced to sit through this by their parents.Do not be duped by the marketing - seriously. This is no fantasy adventure. There is no entertainment to be found here. This is not a children's movie. This is not even a movie for adults. This is more like an instrument of torture. This film is actually worse than torture. To be honest - It actually takes great skill to spend $170 million dollars on a movie and turn it into something as bad as this. I have never been so bored in my entire life. Everyone sitting around me also felt the same. I practically fell unconscious in the cinema. Many people walked out as they couldn't believe how bad it was and there were constant yawns coming from every direction.Several times during the movie, I closed my eyes and just tried to imagine the movie ending to help me get through it. I counted down every single minute, waiting, hoping, praying for this film to end. I really can't understand why anyone could possibly give this film a high rating?? The only thing positive in the entire movie was Sasha Baron Cohen and his acting performance in the movie - he was on surprisingly good form, however, the rest of the cast were rubbish. The acting of the lead characters was especially terrible and the story was atrocious.Warning: Avoid this film - it will send you into a coma. Don't say I didn't warn you. If you want the truth - Talk to people you know who have seen this film and they will tell you how bad it is. Ignore all the fake positive reviews online - it's all clever marketing.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
a passionately crafted visual spectacle of a lovely story,"i was expecting a passionately crafted visual spectacle of a lighthearted, lovely story. the film pretty much excels in all fronts. much has been said about the cinematic virtues, from the indeed jaw- dropping tracking shot early on (a completely crazy camera traveling. an occupation of space that marvelously defines the geography and imposes Scorsese's singular vision of this universe) to the animated recreation of the silent films, through the enhancing atmospheric use of 3D (this is the first 3D film i see. and the fact is i never bothered much with 3D. but the 3D here serves as a toy, or rather a tool, allowing Marty to exercise his art, embracing the most advanced technology of the moment to pay tribute to his ancestor, who had grasped that film could not be dissociated from technology and that it should be nourished from it) and all of it looks as gorgeous as one could hope for.throughout his years, Martin Scorsese never ceased to scream his love for cinema, which transpires references indirectly inside of his work, apparitions and implications in restoration of heritage films. yet he never really attacked it from the front, to make it the heart of his films, his cinephilia. with Hugo, he had the opportunity and through the adventures of this young orphan, he finally introduces one of cinema's great magicians George Méliès. nevertheless, this should not limit Hugo to a simple homage. this story is so huge, modern and nostalgic all at once, it takes everything in its path.i find a lot of merit in the story-telling approach. without skimping on a burlesque humor that sparingly distills it, the film delivers a tale not as cruel as tradition demands but very sad. this sadness doesn't appear immediately, it is gradually established as the figure of George Méliès gradually emerges. we then switch through gigantic mechanical workings, to get to something very human. touchingly symbolized by the repair of the automaton. and as Hugo said, everything has a reason for being. this film is magical in a raw sense, and sometimes, it doesn't shy away from being literally magical, adventurously spiritedsurprisingly for a Scorsese picture, i found the editing to be a bit rushed on the chase scenes.. but for a film that aspires to represents a timeless ideal, i'm willing to forgive every little detail, should i feel like nitpicking on",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese's tribute to film told through a charming story.,"I didn't see this in 3D, yet it was still visually stunning. Machinery and snowflakes, steam engines and antiquarian shop keepers and an orphan boy whose gift is also his passion and the implied question at the heart of the film. The ingenious and breathtaking sets did not overwhelm the human element. The audience could pick up hints of how the plot just might unfold, and was rewarded with seeing some loose ends tied up in a sweet but not saccharin way.The cast was uniformly excellent. The script and direction allowed each character to have time in the spotlight, and, despite the number of speaking parts, the speaking characters seemed fully rounded. This film had all the magic of the cinema, including the magic that comes from being slightly enigmatic. Best of all, The audience was not spoon-fed tidy endings; we had to spot them for ourselves and still wonder exactly when and how this or that was resolved. Scorsese avoided the cliché of telling us what each character's future would be.Not a film for children- one for adults who still believe that cinema can be magic.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What 3D is supposed to be like,"Just saw the film - and it's as good as everybody says it is but not only for the reasons specified. I mean it is a love song to old cinema and its sources. It's superbly acted by all the actors involved, and it does carry the signature of Scorsese's genius with every frame. But the aspect I want to speak about is his magnificent use of the 3D technique.- Every picture is multi-layered, both visually and thematically, which means that the visual aspect of the film always reflects its intentions, its ideas - the way that truly good films are supposed to be. I've seen the 3D technique wasted in so many films of the last three years or so. Used for one or two scenes in a film with the real purpose of charging extra at the box office, not this time. Ever since Cameron revived the technique it was mostly misused go and see Hugo in 3D, and you'll see what it's supposed to look like. And also see how it serves the movie and not the producers wish to cash in. All else has already been said but for me this aspect of the film brilliance can never be stressed enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
France wins,"Knowing that Martin Scorsese directed movies like ""Taxi Driver"", ""Raging Bull"" and ""Goodfellas"", it would seem inconceivable that a movie targeted at a younger audience. But not only did Marty accomplish that, he did a masterful job. This combination of early cinema with a child's quest to right the wrongs is an impressive one. More than a series of special effects, it's the perfect balance of fantasy and history. The appearance of the Robin Hood book is significant since Hugo Cabret's existence mirrors that of Robin Hood.All in all, I really liked ""Hugo"". I now have an urge to watch all of Georges Méliès's surviving movies, and maybe also the ones by the Lumière brothers. Having not seen any of the other Best Picture nominees, I can't judge whether it should have won, but it's still one that I recommend. And more than anything, the Oscars that went to ""Hugo"" and ""The Artist"" - both associated with France - are a real slap in the face to all the idiots who came up with ""freedom fries"" (and similar things) nine years ago. Really good.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo - Go and dream with Martin Scorsese!1,"Hugo - Go and dream with Martin Scorsese!!Hugo – the latest movie by Martin Scorsese brought us the magical cinematic experience that we first felt when we had just begun understanding what movies were all about and the insatiable happiness that followed. This work by Scorsese is his first attempt at 3 D and saying that Hugo's very good is a gross understatement. Exceptional cinematography, marvelous acting, dynamic screenplay and the maximum Oscar nominations (11) do explain just a fleck about the preeminence of Hugo. Hugo in fact won 5 of them.Set in 1930s, Hugo's inspired by the life of a French illusionist and filmmaker Georges Méliès played by Sir Ben Kingsley. The main protagonist is Hugo played by 14 year old Asa Butterfield who awed people with his brilliance in the holocaust movie The Boy in the striped pyjamas. Hugo also boasts off a highly noteworthy supporting cast including Sir Christopher Lee, Sacha Baron Cohen, Chloe Moretz , Emily Mortimer and Jude Law. Scorsese draws emotions from situations and not just characters and Butterfield and Kingsley did more than justice to their characters. Sacha as a shy and conscientious station master stood out as well.Without spoiling the essence and rich freshness of the movie, Hugo's an incredibly lovely work of art to be enjoyed by everyone. If you want to fall in love with movies once again, Hugo may not be such a bad idea. Its a 9 for me.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Not My Favorite, But Definitely the Best Flick of 2011","Tonight I saw Hugo for the second time in 3-D. My wife dragged me to it the first time and I was thoroughly blown away and moved. But I really didn't need to see it again. She did. So with little reluctance, I saw it again and it was even better the second time. This time you could appreciate the art and lyricism of this film ever more than the first time. The second time you're just blown away by not only the beauty of the opening scene, but also by the structure and art of it as the breathtaking tracking shot focuses on nearly every major and minor character in the film. And then they show the opening credits! While Hugo isn't my favorite film of the year (that was Midnight In Paris, which I'd see for a third time in a flash), I am convinced it's the ""best"" film. I've seen ""The Artist"" and it's not even in the same league as ""Hugo."" ""Hugo"" has great direction, ensemble acting (seriously, why isn't there an Oscar for best acting ensemble?), cinematography, music, special effects, sound, use of 3-D, and heart of any film my wife and I have seen all year. It's an amazing homage to the early film makers without ever getting cloying or worshipful. It's a wonderful story on so many levels and it's impossible not to shed a tear or two among all the laughs and emotion. I realize Hugo isn't everybody's cup of tea, but taking into account its wonderful storytelling, direction, etc. it strikes me as the best of all the films nominated for ""Best Picture.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo,"A Review of the movie HugoMovie Released 2011 Review date December 8th, 2011 Starring: Ben Kingsley-George MeliesSacha Baron Cohen- Station InspectorChloe Grace Moretz- IsabelleJude Law- Hugo's Father Director: Martin Scorsese Writer: John Logan; based on the novel ""The Invention of Hugo Cabret"" by Brian SelznickReader, as I progress in this review, I will do my very best to be subjective and to avoid being opinionated. For the movie Hugo, it will be hard to express criticism. I am truly sorry if my critique offends anyone and I hope that this review will not prevent anyone from seeing the production as it would be unfortunate to miss this truly unique experience. I viewed the movie Hugo in 2-D, not in 3-D experience or 3-D IMAX and this review is based on this version.The story is told through the eyes of Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) who lives and works at a train station. He lives alone and fixes the clocks in the train station. The time period is long ago. Something happened to Hugo's father (Jude Law) before Hugo went to live at the station. He mentored Hugo in mechanics while attempting to repair a mechanical human being, however before the repairs were finished his father parishes, leaving him with his alcoholic uncle Claude (the reliable character actor Ray Winstone), who taught Hugo the trade of working mechanically with clocks. When Hugo went to live with his uncle he brought with him the last fond remaining memorabilia of his father, the unfinished mechanical human figure. Hugo felt obligated to finish the work on the human figure. Completing his father's work gave Hugo a sense of purpose and also a desire to understand the figures purpose. Curiosity motivates Hugo to undertake an adventure as he investigates the history of the mechanical human figure. In this quest Hugo enlists the help of a young girl named Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz). Along the way, Hugo unfolds the mysteries of the creation of the mechanical human figure, and of the lives many individuals who may have lost their way. Through his involvement, Hugo makes it possible for them to recapture what had mattered to them most.What is interesting about Hugo's character is his interaction with other people. As important, is his observation of other people. A very powerful part of the action occurs when significant character development takes place as Hugo watches an older couple from a distance. As he observes the two older people, very little dialogue is heard, as they are engaged in their interaction, however their emotion is obvious. As he watches this scene unfold, the effect on Hugo is apparent. This has significant impact on him and on our understanding of him. These scenes gave a sense of the silent picture era, and possibly some homage is owed to Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window as this device was used extensively in that production.Hugo encounters a cold, sad man named George Melis (Ben Kingsley) who is bitterly mean. George presents some obstacles that result in some setbacks of Hugo's investigation of the figure. Ben Kingsley's portrayal of George Melis is a truly convincing performance. This character engages the audience by generating interest and a desire to understand how and why he became the way he is.The Train Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) has a goal, to bring homeless children to orphanages. His character is well developed. A sense of his human qualities is further advanced through his obvious longing of family and his humility towards the flower girl. He has many impediments in his social interactions including a faulty leg brace. A range of emotions are generated toward this character as the story unfolds.Directed by Martin Scorsese, the result is a well-crafted, fine, beautiful and engaging motion picture. The success of this motion picture is an artistic expression of his obvious love for movies. He successfully created a living environment in which I at least partially resided along with the living characters through the duration of the showing and beyond.Most of the activities take place within an engrossing location in Paris and is mostly confined to a train station which symbolizes the importance of the confinement that is experienced within the some of the characters' lives. Dante Ferretti as production designer accomplishes this realism through the selection of color, richness and elegant design.The musical score from Howard Shore amplified the emotional actions and adventurous moments; giving a greater effect, enhancing the action, mood and impact of the production. Without a doubt Scorsese's often collaborator, director of photography Robert Richardson sizzles with smooth, graceful camera work, often flowing seamlessly, creating dramatic, powerful, and sometimes hypnotic effects.In conclusion it may be appropriate to end with the following statement of summary. Throughout one's life many people are encountered, some will bring out the best and some will bring out the worst, and some will do both. Judging the overall impact is at best often not a possibility.Rating: **** out of ****",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Absolutely brilliant ode to film,"Perhaps the best Martin Scorsese film ever. That is saying a lot. One can't help wondering if he may have been a bit influenced by Jeunet et Caro's ""City of lost Children"". A beautiful, magical tribute to the heights that film can achieve. A celebration of creativity and the minds that dare to go there, sometimes to their own detriment. Watching this allowed my imagination to see a young Scorsese completely engulfed in a magical world that would become his future. The young male lead had eyes that pierced and Chloe Grace Moretz was amazing as usual. This is a very beautiful film for people who love film. Cinema Paradiso for 2011. I laughed, I cried, I loved.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Nutshell Review: Hugo,"With 11 Academy Award nominations under its belt, common sense prevailed with the local distributors in pushing for a release to tie in with the anticipated Oscar hype, rather than to hedge its bets in March should the film with the most nominations this year go back empty handed. But regardless of the nods and awards it probably may garner, this Martin Scorsese film is one of his best, if not possible amongst his most personal films, where he has the opportunity to pay tribute to one of French cinema's earliest visionaries Georges Méliès, as well as to touch upon a topic that close to his heart, that of film preservation.Hugo, based upon the novel The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, is Scorsese's first 3D effort, and a proper one at that I may add, with many filmmakers or production companies choosing the cop out way of making a 3D film through post-production conversion. If you want to do something you have got to do it right, and Scorsese's film is blessed with countless of scenes that provide that depth of field, exploiting its 3D tool well as how it is supposed to be, rather than providing cheap toward-the-screen gimmicks to distract. And it's pretty amazing too in meta sort of way with Scorsese's use of the 3D tool, since Hugo contains a major plot about the story of Georges Méliès, who is recognized as one of the innovators of effects on film in his days.Biographies aren't sometihng new to Scorsese having done a number of films based on real people, but Hugo had wrapped a fictional narrative that's fit for the family, with broad based entertainment value and themes that make it appealing to a general audience across all ages, and best of all, being able to be a film about film history, introducing a great cinema master to the man on the street, perhaps sparking renewed interest amongst a generation that may not have heard of him, but likely to have been exposed or remember what would be one of the most enduring, iconic images seen at one point or another with the man on the moon being poked in the eye by a rocket, from his film A Trip to the Moon.In all honesty I wasn't too impressed by Hugo Cabret's story, about the titular boy (Asa Butterfield) who lives in the Parisian train station of Gare Montparnasse, winding the clocks around the premises and spending his time evading the station inspector Gustave (Sacha Baron Cohen) who is on a warpath looking for misbehaving orphans. Hugo himself is made one with the demise of his dad (Jude Law in a small support role) who had left him under the care of drunken uncle Claude (Ray Winstone) and leaving behind an automation. Believing the automation contains a secret message left behind by dad, Hugo goes about scouring the station for knick knacks, trinkets and gears to get it going again, and often does so by stealing items off Georges Méliès the toymaker who has a small shop in the station.That forms the gist of Hugo's initial interaction with Georges, and the story revolves around his friendship with Méliès goddaughter Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), where together they find themselves embarking on an adventure involving various people such as those in the station like the florist Lisette (Emily Mortimer) whom the station inspector has the hots for, the dog loving cafe owner Emile (Frances de la Tour) and the newspaper seller Frick (Richard Griffiths) as well as those who would point them toward the discovery of film and its early years, such as bookstore owner Labisse (Christopher Lee), and film historian Rene Tabard (Michael Stuhlbarg). Chloe Moretz pairs up very nicely opposite Asa Butterfield who made a very endearing Hugo, with Sacha Baron Cohen nicely ditching his downright outrageously (and sometimes offensive) comical style for something a lot more family friendly, even as Hugo's prime nemesis.While the acting here are all top notch with the cast being so incredibly comfortable in their roles no matter how big or small, I thought Ben Kingsley provided a masterclass for everyone in his role as the real character in history Georges Méliès, along with Helen McCrory who plays his wife Jeanne and is in almost all of Méliès' films. And of course digital effects make them look a lot younger when the story flashes back to their heydays, which was the last half hour that made Hugo an absolute winner as we deep dived into the early years of cinema, and French cinema at that too, about their life and times, and celebration even, together with a poignant reminder that many films are lost over the years if not for deliberate efforts to scour, source, and save prints that have been unceremoniously lost through the ravages of time.It's a tough fight going into the Oscars this weekend, especially for those who have money put down for that office bet. Two of the strongest contenders in my opinion, Hugo and The Artist, contain that nostalgic look back at cinema's past, with the filmmakers paying homage to eras, personalities and systems that have been long gone, at a time when it was brimming with innovation and artistry. Martin Scorsese has once again shown that he's amongst the top of the game, and Hugo will be one of his iconic stamps in his decades long filmmaking career. Definitely highly recommended fare for everyone itching for an intelligent, heart- warming and entertaining adventure ride.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo is a really unique and exceptional film. One of 2011's best,"Martin Scorsese is a legendary filmmaker that has given audiences many terrific films such as Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Gangs of New York and The Departed and has more recently given audiences the mind-bending thriller Shutter Island. The interesting thing about the director is that his films have traditionally been very violent, vulgar, and overall more adult in their nature and content. Needless to say, when I heard that Scorsese was doing a family friendly film(in 3D no less) I was very intrigued to see how he would handle this new territory. Does Scorsese bring his mastery of film making to his unexplored territory in genre, or does Scorsese lack the inner child and imagination to make this story of an orphan boy work?Read the rest: http://wp.me/p1tyJd-99",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful story beautifully told!,A wonderful story beautifully told. The film gathers pace gradually and though at times you're left with unanswered questions it all unravels in the last 30 minutes of the film in an emotional and satisfying finale. The imagery is stunning and the use of the 3D technology is handled perfectly. The scenic views of Paris through the clack face are the most stunning use of 3D I've yet to see. Sacha Baron Cohen's character (train station policeman) adds a nice touch of humour which helps to relieve the tension from time to time and Ben Kingsley is brilliant! So if you want a heart warming family film with a 'proper' story to tell... go and see it!,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stunning,"The 3-D composition was woven into the beauty of film itself. The movement through industrial clocks, small passages or even across the Parisian cityscape, made the movie a visual event. If this is the future of 3-D movies, those claiming the end of cinema will be proved wrong again.The cast and casting is marvelous.The plot -even though 'family' oriented- remained interesting throughout.One can only hope that such a brilliant movie launched during a 'moundane' of movies near Christmas, shines longer than a shooting star.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Dreamy and epic,"I'm really not a film's critic, but as a viewer and an old movies aficionado, all I can say is this one made me dream, which is exactly what a movie should do. On the other hand, this is maybe one of the more mixed reviews movie I've seen lately, from pseudo-intellectuals giving it a one star to people giving it 10 stars (I'm the latter, really, not because the movie deserves 10 stars in its essence but because the sum of it all is mind-blowing).So, and instead of being a lame movie critic wannabe and flame the movie with pearls like ""the actor portraying Hugo is naught but has sad eyes so he was picked"" and some other of little note, I'll explain why a 10 is a (maybe fan-boyish but) fair rate:-as far as 3d goes, this is THE ONE per se. Have you thought that the train arriving at a station movie is, though limited, PERFECT for this tech? Of course the train station itself where the movie develops is filled with precious details that make 3d shine too. Just watch some other movies in 3d (so en vogue these days, for worse than for better) and you'll probably see what I mean;-the precious details I mentioned above, from Django Reinhardt to Christopher Lee (isn't it subtle that an old movies legend like Mr. Lee appears in a movie that talks about movie legends?), the Fantomas poster, the parisian boulevards reminding us of cogs and complications... I wasn't expecting so much from Martin Scorcese, which only proves the man is an erudite regarding cinema, let alone directing;-I really lamented when I read so many wannabe critics label the movie for children, which is pathetic; this is a movie for everyone, from grandchildren to grandparents, from cinema student to movie critic, and that's the real gimmick in my opinion, as Martin Scorcese DEFINITELY payed attention to detail in order to make this a family friendly movie that could interest any other viewer, even if for CULTURE itself. I'll see it again tomorrow for the third time, in search for more detail.The movie has a major flaw in my honest opinion: it was directed by an American instead of an European, and I guess that it loses some of its innocence and naiveté because of this alone, but on the other hand, it's so very well conceived (the European details, the atmosphere, the cultural history, etc...) that it's an insignificant detail.Bravo.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Big names cannot save mediocre Hugo,"Hype surrounding a movie is not always a recipe for success – there are the rare exceptions – but, unfortunately, Hugo is not one of them.However, this will not affect box office figures as the big names attached, such as its director, and cast, but I can't see it having any lasting effect on audiences.Mix together the elements of Harry Potter, The Golden Compass, Lord of the Rings, Moulin Rouge – without the magic – and The Hunchback of Notre Dame, et voila, you get Hugo.And that is the problem in a nutshell – it has all the money and colour that Hollywood can buy, but it does not have its own unique identity due to a weak storyline.It is the sad tale of a young boy (Butterfield) who's left all alone in the world when his clock-fixing father (Law) dies, but not before he has learned a few skills of his own.His alcoholic uncle (Winstone) arrives on the scene and leaves Hugo with little choice for his future – either he starves or does his uncle's job, maintaining the clock tower at Paris railway station.The only thing Hugo takes with him from home is a robot that his father rescued from a museum, and was in the process of fixing its intricate mechanics when he met his demise.The notebook where he kept his drawings and ideas about the robot falls into the hands of French film pioneer, Georges Méliès (Kingsley).Until he can get it back, Hugo is determined to finish the job, believing his father will send a sign through it, and he almost does complete the task but a heart shaped key needed to turn the robot on eludes him.Hugo follows Méliès home and befriends his godchild (Moretz), who helps Hugo on his way to a happy ending.On the outside, this has the potential to be a great movie, with the high-profile director at the helm, the scenes of Paris of the early 20th century are magnificent, and the cast could not have be bettered – notably, Butterfield (The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas) is excellent in the title role, and station inspector (Baron Cohen) brings some humour to an otherwise sad story – but there is little substance to it.There were a few subplots, including those involving Christopher Lee (Lord of The Rings) and Frances De La Tour (Rising Damp), which were not explored enough.In fact, the characters added little or no value to the story, and should have been cut out.I could try to explain away my disappointment in this movie by being more than two decades older than the target audience, but that unfortunately still makes it mediocre.Incidentally, look out for a cameo appearance by Scorsese photographing a young Ben Kingsley mid-way through the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It doesn't gets any more beautiful,"Movie from one of the Hollywood biggest director martin Scorsese , when Scorsese name is attached with any project you know it wont be average like another big director Spielberg who's name is attached merely for money making now days. Hugo looks quite different from its trailer , may be many people expected some thing more flashy in it , some thing like adventure or darkness like harry potter or some thing else , but Hugo is filled of adventure with hard work and dramatic sadness , Asa Butterflied (the boy in stripped pajamas) plays the character of Hugo Cabaret , a child who ain't super kid or super talented like we see in many children movie , (which drags this movie towards realism) , Asa Butterflied is one hell of a kid the day i saw him in the boy in stripped pajamas i knew this kid is gonna be big , although only 14 the boy has talent filled of a 18 year old , if he keeps on doing such roles he is gonna be huge star , which many child actors failed to do , Coming back to movie again , the story is plain and simple and has a lesson of hard work and purpose a lonely child can go through there are paths which a lone child can choose which are shown in the movie in the character of Hugo . every movie character has its own struggle or you can say purpose to fill in , and in order to achieve it they need to fix the problem to achieve it .Cinematography is beautiful and i feel those who would have watched it in 3d would have loved it , what else you can say Scorsese is best in shooting from angles , he makes things look stunning , sound track of the movie throughout the movie fit every scene and setting .talking about some other actors in the movie , Ben Kingsley is awesome like always , Chloe Moritz role i think could have been played by any one , Chloe Moritz to me is losing her stardom talent her presence doesn't add the IT factor in it , Sacha Baron Cohen is one impressive being he is funny and cruel he can blend into any role i love this guy abilityPS : this movie is slow but beautiful those who haven't watched it don't expect it to be fast and all flashy stuff (it ain't American stuff i would say its more like french cinema stuff which fits the setting of the movie ) After i watched it , it took me hour to digest it properly cause i had a different expectation from movie , but after revising the movie i found , that its beautiful and it is academy material",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Visually impressive, charming family tale","After reading many negative reviews for ""Hugo"", I felt obliged to watch the film to discover why it was a contender at the Oscars.In terms of the visual production values, this is a breathtaking film and some of the sets are simply stunning. In addition to this, the film had a wonderful charm throughout that kept me positive throughout viewing and made me want to ignore the flaws of the movie and just enjoy the journey.The characters are, generally, brilliant, and Chloe Moretz and Ben Kingsley both give tremendous performances. However, my problem was, unfortunately, with the films protagonist, as although Asa Butterfield takes on the leading role well, the character of Hugo came across, to me, as little more than a sulky, negative kid.The plot and pacing of the film is fairly good; there is enough unpredictability and room for guessing, as well as a few unexpected twists and secrets to keep the story engaging, however there is a lack of any real significance or importance and the scenario's the characters are placed in seem slightly too trivial to be as entertaining as they could have been.Overall, I feel that despite Hugo being an irritating character at times, and the plot of his film perhaps lacking the sense of real peril it could have done with, the charming, original and enjoyable style of this movie, portrayed by some strong performances and fantastic visual treats, render Scorcese's first family film a success, that is well worth a couple of hours of anybody's time.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Magical...,"Words cannot explain the extent to which I enjoyed this movie. I was truly transported to a different world. It was beautiful, breathtaking, marvelous,exhilarating, and above all magical. Just magical. I laughed, I cried, and I did everything in between. It is a masterpiece. Never have I walked out of a theatre with such a silly gigantic grin on my face. I still have it as i'm typing this.I won't bother going into a plot synopsis, as I'm sure there are already a million. This movie has a bit of everything. Effects, comedy, tragedy etc... you name it, it has it. Every emotion. It puts you on a roller-coaster of a journey, not necessarily through action, but through heart. The 3D effects were used perfectly, to a great advantage. 3D is often pointless on most movies, but with this one, it does it a duty. The visuals are already there, but the 3D enhances them. After I while, I forgot I was even watching 3D. It was just... wow. I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this film.The only problem with, not the film, but what goes on behind the scenes, is the way that it was presented in theatres This is not just a kids film. It's nothing like the normal kids film. It is a film for all ages, and, honestly, I think adults would enjoy it more than kids. I'm a teenager, but I have a keen eye on film, stage, and other performing arts. I have seen many a good film, but this one just blew me away. The marketing was the large error. I simply can't see how anyone could dislike this film, at least anyone who enjoys art.The acting was great all around, but Asa Butterfield MADE this film. He is a phenomenal young actor. I have yet to see many adult actors act with the truthfulness that he has. His character portrays an enormously large range of emotions; anger, pity, heartbreak, betrayal, joy, confusion, frustration, you name it. Asa nails them all. He has such a subtle, yet effective, style. It's something you don't see much nowadays. The audience is able to see, just through those piercing blue eyes, every emotion he emits. The eyes are the window to the actors soul, and with Asa zoomed shots on his eyes are equally effective as full body shots. It takes skill to be able to portray emotion powerful enough to be read through the eyes alone, and I applaud young Asa for that, as well as his performance as a whole. Bravo.It is a shame that more people haven't seen this film. Hopefully, the Academy Awards will give it the publicity needed to make it a hit. However, in my eyes, it is already a hit.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Astonishingly wonderful,"It's amazing how great the movies have become in recent years. And Hugo is certainly one of the great ones. Some of your critics showed disappointment with the movie. I guess they were expecting something else. What I saw was a highly successful combination of biopic and documentary about a great film pioneer. We saw it only in normal vision without 3D so I can't comment on that. But all the sets and visuals were of course stunning and incomparable.After all of Melies' talk in the movie about how he had to sell his films (about 500 of them) into destruction for making shoe heels, on the IMDb site we see the same 500 films going back even as far as 1896 when Melies started. So these films must be accessible in some fashion even today if only to have their credits listed. I remember back 20 years ago when I was residing in New Zealand the big news broke that one of Melies' films had been found in a local film archive and the discovery was all over the papers.It was piquant to see portrayed on the screen real live contemporary to their time artistic figures like guitarist Django Reinhardt, painter Salvador Dali, and author James Joyce. My wife and I commented that one of the actors certainly resembled James Joyce and that's who he turned out actually to be in the film. When I saw the guitarist I said he reminded me of Django Reinhardt and that's exactly who he was supposed to be.We were delighted to observe Scorsese's ""Hitchcock moment"" when he cast himself as a photographer taking Melies' picture in front of his studio.What a precious way to become wrapped up in the early history of cinema through this extraordinary film! It reminded me of the movie The Road to Wellville (1994) which similarly immersed the audience in another time and period through its visual fineness and its portraying of genuine historical figures like the Kellogg brothers of Battle Creek circa 1900-1910,about the same turn of the century time as Hugo.Astonishing film!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Picturesque but surprisingly dreary,"Something unfortunate happens when directors decide to celebrate their love of the cinema. They end up celebrating themselves and their own fannish sensibilities, and their movies turn all mawkish. That's what happened in Truffaut's smug DAY FOR NIGHT and Tornatore's treacly CINEMA PARADISO, and it's what happens here. Ostensibly an expression of Scorsese's infatuation with film, it's really an example of his self-infatuation.HUGO is undeniably beautiful to look at, with sumptuous atmospheric sets and elaborate shots from high overhead or down long corridors -- trust me, miles and miles of corridors -- expressly designed to make maximum use the 3-D camera. But the story itself is glum and painfully slow. Around me audience members kept yawning, and they stirred restlessly in their seats whenever a character launched into another interminable nostalgic reminiscence. (I felt especially sorry for the kids, for whom the film had to be a letdown.) Too many scenes are as earnest and didactic as a museum lecture on the early history of cinema.Although HUGO's got a splendid cast, the characters struck me as formulaic and lifeless; it's like watching one of those motion-capture Bob Zemeckis movies, such as THE POLAR EXPRESS or A Christmas CAROL, populated by figures not entirely human who resemble animated Chris Van Allsburg illustrations. (The film's very distinctive look is in fact pure Van Allsburg -- a mixed blessing. Everything we see is gorgeous, but it all looks fake, like the expensive film set it is. Eventually the artificiality grows tiresome.)I've always loved Georges Melies's wonderful silent fantasies, and it's commendable that Scorsese is reminding modern audiences, via this movie, just how inventive, magical, and ahead-of-their-time they were. But somehow the sheer self-congratulatory reverence that Scorsese lavishes on those old films made me long for a simple unpretentious documentary.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is truly cinema magic,"Hugo is about an orphan who lives in the walls of a train station is wrapped up in a mystery involving his late father and an automaton. Hugo also has a back story about Georges Méliès life. The master of cinema, Martin Scorsese, takes on a beautiful adventure that makes you feel like a kid and at the same time showing you movie magic. After I watched Hugo I just sat on my couch in amazement and thinking to myself this is why I love filmmaking. Scorsese is one of the best directors of our time and will go down in history as on of the best filmmakers. Hugo is Scorsese's most unique work because it's his first family film and the way he grabs the audience into this adventure is remarkable. The camera work in this film is beautiful. The way Scorsese shoots the train station and the secret corridors of the station is jaw-dropping, along with the shots of Paris. The best part of Hugo is the way Scorsese re-creates the life of Méliès, a filmmaker who crafted over hundreds of films from 1896 to 1913. It is beautiful to be able to watch old cinema in Hugo and just fall in love with it. The visual-effects in Hugo are superb. Everything looks realistic and magical at the same time. This film deserved the Oscars it won for visual-effects. The script for Hugo is written flawlessly. A story about two kids adventure and tying in a backstory of Méliès life fascinating. I was really grabbed into this story. Hugo has a flawless cast with: Ben Kingsley, Sacha Baron Cohen, Asa Butterfield, Chloe Moretz, Jude Law, & Christopher Lee. Everyone gives perfect performances, but the ones I want to talk about are: Cohen's, Butterfield's, and Moretz's. Sacha Baron Cohen is one of those actors whose talents are like no one else's. He is a unique actor and when he acts it feels like he has become his character. His performance in Hugo is hilarious and quite enjoyable. Asa Butterfield the lead actor in Hugo and has one of the best performances I have seen from a kid actor. The emotion in his face and the dedication you see from his performance is remarkable. You will find yourself rooting for his character throughout Hugo, due to his engaging performance. Another young actress, Chloe Moretz, never disappoints me in the films I have seen her in. She is one of my favorite young actress's. Moretz's performance in Hugo is seems so natural and sweet. She delivers one of her best performances of her career so far. Hugo is one of those films that if you respect and love filmmaking you will fall in love with it. Martin Scorsese's heart is truly in this film and Hugo is the reason why I love filmmaking.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"In a word: Magical, especially for film buffs...","HUGO is a magical treat from start to finish, beginning with its marvelous open tracking shot of a Paris railroad station in the '30s. From then on, there's a treasure of masterful photography involved in the telling of a boy who lives in a train station and, in the eventive tradition of his father, keeps the huge clock and its machinery working.The boy is played with great sensitivity by Asa Butterfield in what has to be one of the best child performances ever. He carries the film and never lets the momentum stop as he scurries around the train station trying to avoid the overzealous clutches of a crippled station master (Sacha Baron Cohen) and his fearsome dog. It's reminiscent of the innocent Olivier Twist and David Copperfield trying to avoid the clutches of the laws that rule orphans.All of the behind-the-scenes glimpses of the whirling machinery inside the clock are an added visual treat, creating the illusion of suspense and danger whenever the plot demands it. As the girl whom Hugo befriends and shares his knowledge of the automaton with, Chlore Grace Moretz is equally charming and natural. Their chemistry helps the film's most pivotal moments work beautifully.A much needed sense of humor is helped enormously by the contribution of Sacha Baron Cohen, whose station master emerges as one of the story's most interesting characters. Emily Mortimer is touching as a woman he admires and Christopher Lee does a standout job as the librarian who takes an interest in furthering Hugo's education.The story's thread is slight, but the film is full of such complex images and turbulent events surrounding the boy's precarious situation that it remains an absorbing tale of an orphan who proves to be a most resourceful lad in keeping one step ahead of the authorities.Then too, it's a backstory of the famous cinema inventor Georges Melies, who had the imagination to become one of film's most inventive craftsmen in the early 1900s. Glimpses of his work are seen throughout the film and Ben Kingsley is a perfect choice to play this complex man. His scenes with Hugo are extremely touching.And finally, I must end with a word of high praise for Martin Scorsese who lends his own magical touch to the proceedings to create one of the year's best films for the child in all of us with all of its wonders underscored by Howard Shore's lovely background score.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Marty's once-a-decennial masterpiece already?,"Martin Scorsese is back. This time the director has taken a new direction by bringing The Invention of Hugo Cabret to life, making a film for all ages instead of the usual adult target demographic. So if you're under 18 and have been looking forward to his next project for a while, fearing it may fall into the 18-rated category, like his previous masterpieces have, so you cannot get into the cinema, well there's no need to. But after looking to have been accustomed to creating brilliant gangster flicks, does Scorsese's attempt at making a kid's film succeed?Well to begin with, his recreation of a 30's Paris is an ambitious and a realistic one, with the inspiration clearly coming from classic French comedy Under the Roofs of Paris. This Paris is a wonderful sight to see straight from the beginning of the film as Scorsese utilises his signature long tracking shot to take the audience through the subject train station and finish on a focus of our lead character Hugo's face. On a further note, Scorsese noticeably uses the long tracking shot in the film twice more, once subsequent to the one aforementioned where it follows Hugo travelling down the clock (effective because Scorsese is taking the audience on the adventure with Hugo) and once near the end, taking the audience around one room (I won't spoil by describing what happens, because this shot is the conclusion of everyone's story in the film) – this timelessly impressive technique and the cinematography in general is beautiful, it's part of why Hugo is enjoyable. Back to where I was - the bonus of the opening shot is the glorious 3D.And the glory of the 3D isn't just in the opening shot. Continuously throughout the film Scorsese reminds us that he has literally already mastered the use of 3D in just only one motion picture – if it is not exactly perfect, it is certainly the best since Avatar. Look out for the amazing shot of Sacha Baron Cohen's station inspector's face peering towards the left of the frame, leaning towards the frame as he questions Hugo when the boy is questioned about the trouble caused at the beginning of the narrative. I believe Scorsese has a more than likely chance of succeeding in future attempts at using 3D. I mean, he's arguably America's greatest filmmaker right now and has been for a long time.Going back to Sacha Baron Cohen – as well as placing us spectators in an uncomfortable position by leaning his face towards us (a nod to the uncomfortable finale of The Great Train Robbery), he provides plenty of humour in the film, like he would be expected to. He does an amazing job performing as the Station Inspector, breaking his comedy barrier by displaying heart in this role too. Joining him is a wonderful cast featuring Asa Butterfield as Hugo, turning in fantastically; Chloë Grace Moretz as Hugo's new-found friend Isabella, utilising the talent in acting she has been blessed with at a young age; Ben Kingsley as the legendary Georges Méliès, entirely convincing and three-dimensional, this is possibly one of the year's Supporting Actor nominees.It is an ideology of the film that Georges Méliès is a forgotten legend. A large part of the story revolves around him and his movie-making past (this film is set at a time where his filmmaking career is over, financially he is out of his luck and resorting to running a toy store). This film tells us that his revolutionary filmmaking techniques are responsible for the magic we see on the big screen today – he discovered substitution, multiple exposures, cross fading and dissolves.I'm going to stop analysing further now and conclude that Hugo is a masterpiece, without a doubt, it excels in every aspect of filmmaking and even though it is completely different to almost any children's film you will see this year, Scorsese has created something marvellous for all the ages. It is also Scorsese's (very fitting) tribute to cinema and the reason I've concluded abruptly is because I believe this fascinating article should be read – thefilmstage.com/features/10-classic-films-you- must-watch-before-seeing-martin-scorseses-hugo/. This article explains how Scorsese's Hugo is a fitting tribute to cinema, in particular Méliès, who changed cinema forever. Watching the ten films on the list will enhance your viewing experience and make Hugo more enjoyable to watch as you point out the classic film references to the person next to youVerdict: Scorsese has made a masterpiece every decade: 70's - Taxi Driver, 80's - Raging Bull, 90's - Goodfellas, 00's - The Departed.

Hugo in 3D.,"It's that time of year, where all I do is put the Christmas records on repeat and watch any and all releases of Christmas themed movies (if the trailer has red, snow and Santa, I'll watch it). That entitles movies that have tragic beginnings, heartfelt moments, comedy and falling snow in some past century location. Hugo by Martin Scorsese embodies all of those aspects and more, much ""3D"" more. The setting was dazzling and story line incredible. I saw this movie with my friend and we both had a preconceived notion that anything in 3D was going to be horrible, especially when you wear glasses it's a pain to wear another pair on top, but Scorsese made the film so much worthwhile and the 3D was used incredibly. I felt as if I were one of the passengers walking in the Paris train station and if I reached my hand out I could touch the croissants in the corner and talk to Asa Butterfield who plays Hugo. I was less impressed by his acting but the one who stole the show was definitely Chloe Moretz, she plays with the British accent perfectly. Butterfield as Hugo was alright but I didn't really feel his pain or excitement in some scenes, it was quite bland. Moretz was just amazing to watch, I was a huge fan of her in Kick-ass so when I saw her in this movie I was so excited to see such a huge transformation. Scorsese made a great choice in casting her as the female lead. Overall, Hugo is a fun felt movie for the whole family and the set design and effects were a joy to watch in 3D. This is Scorsese's first 3D movie and already it's the best film of the season. Happy Holidays IMDb!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonderful but not for everyone,"So I went to see the movie after the Academy Awards fame here in Germany with some friends. And I must say that this movie really bedazzled me.The setting is taking place in Paris in the fifties i believe, where in the main train station young Hugo secretly lives and checks the local mechanical clocks. Always in fear of the strict station overseer played very well by Sasha Baron Cohen. One day he gets caught stealing supplies from an old toy maker, because he wants to finish an mechanical human which his dead father tried to repair. Being forced to redeem himself by working for the toy maker he gets to know his adopted daughter, which he introduces into his magical world behind the clockworks. As the story unfolds you get to know of the connection between the mechanical human, the toy maker and his past, not wanting to spoil it here.When I say its not for everyone, that is because you got to have a good sake of your childish imagination and the ability to get very enthusiastic over certain scenery and magic moments. My friends didn't like it so much in the end because they lack the enthusiasm and found the acting too childish. For me as a steam punk/clockwork punk fan it was just heaven and the deepened look into the movie making of the twenties was just heart warming. I watched it 3D and found that the effect was OK but not overused because its more of a story telling film not aiming for visual effects all day long.The ending was very well and gave you that warm fuzzy feeling that everything in the world can turn out nice, and even the station overseer has a soft core, without being corny or cheesy.The actors did a good job, kids just being kids, with a little bit of a stereotype though going for the cheeky little girl that can be a bit annoying. Ben Kingsley one of my favorites in this one just gives a very believable performance and Sasha Baron Cohen proofs that he can play other roles then Borat/Ali G./Bruno stereotypes. The rest of the crew was also spot on with Jude Law as the caring father, and Christopher Lee as a book shop owner (what can that guy play without fitting?)",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Form and content unified brilliantly,"Trying with restrain to maintain a neutral look upon this outstanding film it might be running a little longer that the subject matter invites to, however it is a brilliant piece of cinematographic artwork. This comes from the obvious unity between form and content. We get introduced to the first filmmaker who was fascinated by the magic and illusion the new medium made possible. This clearly shows in the surviving examples from his old movies. They are filled with the naive charm and childlike fascination we still appreciate today. The ingenious concept in HUGO is to present this story in the same way but now of course with all the modern magic and illusion that the CGE technique provides. We also note, that humans tend to appear to be presented in a stiffer and simplified form being put through the CGE process, but in this particular context it does not matter. This is a true fairy tale told in an impressive and convincing way. Hats off to the director and his fine staff of modern magicians as well as to the old master Meliés himself, who is well worth the tribute.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese scores again!,"Legendary Director Martin Scorsese likes movies; he really, really likes them. Sorry to start this review with a Sally Field-esque play on words, but I just had to mention that since Scorsese's latest gem ""Hugo"" is Marty's love letter to movies and film preservation. ""Hugo"" stars child actor Asa Butterfield as the title character. Hugo is an orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station in the 1930's, and works the station's clock due to the absence of who is supposed to be working the clock that being Hugo's lush uncle who goes missing due to his clockwork drunkenness. Hugo's later father, played by Jude Law, was an inventor who was trying to fix a robot before his unfortunate death in a museum fire. Hugo goes to extremes to find a heart-shaped key to run the automation of the robot that his late father was working on. Hugo befriends Isabelle the goddaughter of George Melies, the cranky toy store owner whose past holds a cinematic secret that that might be the key to Hugo's robotic dreams. Scorsese's illuminating and heartfelt picture is truly movie magic due to the vision of master Marty. John Logan's ""Hugo"" screenplay was solid, but at times it stalled in its narrative progression. But in all, Logan's word-run with ""Hugo"" was worthy. Ben Kingsley was superb (when isn't he?) as Melies, and child actor Butterfield's time has come in the movie business with his impressive debut as Hugo. I have inspected Sacha Baron Cohen's performance as the Hugo-intimated ""Station Inspector"", and I must say that it passed its thespian inspection. Chloe Grace Moretz continues her rise to ""tween actress"" supremacy with another impressive turn, here with her charismatic performance as Isabelle. The art direction of ""Hugo"" is a piece of cinematic beauty with its timeless depiction of 1930's Paris; and in due time it will garner the Best Art Direction Academy Award. I think it's time for me to end my ""Hugo"" review. And the time has also come for you to set your clock for a ""Hugo"" viewing. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Scorsese for the Children,"Martin Scorsese (Raging Bull, Goodfellas) was critiqued by his daughter about how nothing he's made is something that his grandkids could go see. Scorsese then went on to direct Hugo.John Logan (Gladiator, Skyfall) pens the script about an orphan who lives in the walls of a Paris train station, and how that boy searches for a message from his late father in the form of an automaton the pair embarked to fix.Hugo's (Asa Butterfield) escapade begins when a shopkeeper, Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) catches Hugo stealing parts for the automaton from his toy shop. Georges takes a notebook from Hugo and is disturbed by the drawings of the automaton by Hugo's father. He tells Hugo that he shall burn the notebook and Hugo becomes distraught himself.Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz), Georges' goddaughter, pairs up with Hugo for an adventure and promises not to let anything happen to his notebook. The tale goes on to tell the story of how Hugo and Isabelle try to find out the automaton's purpose, and how Isabelle's Papa Geroges is connected to it. They have to watch out for the Station Inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) who determinedly rounds up any trespassing, stealing orphan to send off to the orphanage while they try to solve the mystery.This story tells the spectacular narrative of Hugo and has a backdrop of the history of the first films interwoven it. It is a wonderful film that was made in mind for children, but is one that both kids and adults can enjoy. Scorsese has added another work of art to his list. One that is unlike any of his other films. I advise you, if you haven't seen it, to add it to yours.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hugo,"Hugo was one of those cinematic experiences I occasionally have in which I feel a need to pen a letter of apology once it was finished. As a young cinephile just getting my feet wet in film, I did what I thought we all were supposed to do; worship at the altar of Martin Scorsese. During my second Film Studies class, I struck a deal with my professor where he let me complete a career retrospective in place of making a short film for my final project. I was thrilled that my professor agreed to this deal, as writing a 60-page paper seemed like less of a daunting undertaking than operating a camera. I knew I was going to pick Martin Scorsese before I knew if my professor was going to let this happen or not. With his help, I watched every film Scorsese ever made from Who's That Knocking at My Door to Shutter Island. Not only did I see all of his full-length features but I also saw a great deal of his shorts and documentaries. It was supposed to be a cathartic experience of me getting as close as possible to the director I loved until it wasn't. That's not to say I didn't enjoy and appreciate many of Scorsese's films--I did, but I also learned that his enormous contribution to cinema didn't necessitate him being my favorite director. It's unfortunate that this project was one year too early to have Hugo included because once this project was complete, I tended to shy away from Scorsese films that came after, for a spell anyway. I missed seeing Hugo in the theatre, how could I have known I would have loved it so much and it would have been about one of my favorite cinematic subjects? Georges Méliès was one of my first cinematic idols, and he remains one today, as I am finally completely healed from my tattoo immortalizing his iconic image of the moon with a rocket that landed on its eye. I even attempted my own version of a shot-by-shot re-imagining of A Trip to the Moon, achieved by painting 146 individual canvas screens photographed to appear as though they move; an intensive labor of love that has never seen the light of day. Georges Méliès life being portrayed on screen would have been enough to get me to a theatre had I not been in such a Scorsese burn-out that I never even bothered to read what his 2011 film was about when Hugo hit theatres. Starring Ben Kingsley, Asa Butterfield, and Chloë Grace Moretz, Hugo is a brilliant spectacle that would make even the most devout skeptic believe in magic.Based on the book The Invention of Hugo Cabret by Brian Selznick, Hugo follows an orphan boy who lives in the clock mechanism of the train station keeping the train clocks running so he can have a place to live undetected avoiding the orphanage. Still reeling from the death of his father, Hugo (Asa Butterfield) painstakingly works to repair an automaton (mechanical man) that his father instructed would only be complete with a unique key. Once Hugo finds the key, he will know what secret it contains and retrieves the last message his father sent him. While attempting to find the key, Hugo crosses paths with a shop owner Georges Méliès (Ben Kingsley) who believes him to be a thief. When Hugo meets Georges' goddaughter, Isabelle (Chloë Grace Moretz) who is always looking for an adventure, Hugo learns that their paths were destined to cross in ways he could have never imagined.Hugo is one of the most beautiful films to look at that I have ever seen. Scorsese's outpouring of love to classic cinema and film preservation couldn't have tugged any harder on my heart strings if that had been the intention. Every single shot is gorgeous, capturing Scorsese's grand production design and exquisite colors. This is a film for us, for cinephiles, for the ones who don't feel the magic in any other setting than a dark theatre. Hugo is for the ones who dream in 16 millimeter and can't imagine a life without cinema. Hugo encompasses everything a cinephile feels in their heart when a film begins to roll, proving that ""the movies are our special place.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Boring !,"What adventure ? And what fantasy ?! Hugo, the boy who looks like a girl by the way,just walks around Paris. He mimics a huge acting resemblance to Katie Holmes. He walks from his home to tower watch, flower shop ,town square,his friend's house and a store where he repairs things. Every time he had to reach a destination he had to go through town square. The whole movie is all about talking. It was a great idea to tell a story about someone who invests a lifetime to invent movies and capture the whole history on them but the films get destroyed. I am sorry but i can't sympathize with someone who has a nice home and a nice life while there are orphans suffering everyday which was shown in the movie... If they categorized this movie as a family drama I would have liked it....But adventure and fantasy ?!!! p.s.nice acting so extra star....another thing:they did a nice 3D job but in theaters they give you these small crappy 3D glasses",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
