Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations,"Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.Masterpiece.The Good:Cast are great againCharm returnsExcellent nostalgic soundtrackLooks amazingThe Bad:Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes awayMichael Rosenbaum was wastedThings I Learnt From This Movie:Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Yes. Just yes,"My god, I did not expect this movie to be this good. I am a big fan of the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and while I do think it is one of the better MCU movies, this one is just better in practically every way. The plot is well structured, and the pacing is great. The movie also explores its characters way more thoroughly than the previous one. The struggle of finding a place where you belong is a central theme, and every important character has their own struggles related to this. The performances are great as usual, every actor really brings their own flavor to their character. The movie also has great visuals, with all the wacky and fun ideas you might expect from a space movie. The action scenes are great, and the cgi is pretty flawless. The movie is also way funnier than any other MCU movie, with every character being a great source of humor. It's so much comedy being presented it's actually a little too much for me sometimes. Some of the characters feel like they exist only to be comic relief, even though they also have serious struggles that deserve a more serious treatment than they get. That is my only complaint though, as this is a movie with great plot, characters and visuals, as well as a fantastic climax, even though they pulled the whole ""saving the world""-plot point again. This is one of my favorite MCU movies and space movies in general, it's a great time and I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
GREAT SEQUEL,"The movie is full of heart , well directed and has some great messages as the first one but it is funnier than its predecessor. This can be sometimes an advantage and other times a disadvantage. Not quite as fresh as the original, but it's still a great triumph with one of the most emotionally impactful endings of any Marvel Cinematic Universe story. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 might not be as amazing as the first movie but it's a fun ride with characters we love.Rating: 7,8.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Do me! Do me! Do me!,"Quill finds his real father.This is an enjoyable adventure with great humour and character moments.The story is pretty threadbare outside of the development of characters like Quill, Yondu, Ego, and Nebula but this provides enough entertainment on its own. Written into most scenes are strong themes about family and friendship. What it means to be a parent. Surrogate parents and families. Estranged children searching for parental figures and family.Of course it's all done with a great sense of humour, as characters like Drax, Mantis, Rocket, and Groot light up the screen with strong verbal and visual comedy.Quill doesn't massively develop as a character, but we do learn more about his origins and powers. Alongside this the Guardians are portrayed as developing a family dynamic. This is great idea given they are all depicted as coming from traumatic beginnings.Ego is an interesting character and fantastic visualisation of an outlandish graphic-novel concept. It is not particularly subtle, but the character epitomises an extreme version of the in-built selfish drives present in everyone. Kurt Russell is on great form.The contrasting father figure of Yondu is written particularly well. He has been portrayed as having egotistical characteristics too, but here is given a huge redemption arc with with moments of great altruism. It is great to see Michael Rooker playing this type of character. He is as stereotypically violent and generally aggressive as in his previous roles, but for once he gets to show some heart.Nebula and Gamora have solid moments of relationship development. These scenes all tie in well to the movie's main themes and are important to the overarching narrative of the MCU, particularly when watching The Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame. Karen Gillan and Zoe Zaldana both give strong performances, especially Gillan who is a consistently strong performer in the MCU.Visually it is a colourful feast for the eyes and full of exciting spectacle as you would expect from a space adventure. For me the CGI action is a little too much on occasions and distracts from the story, but doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the movie. It generally tells the story through its cinematography and editing. Being a Guardians movie it has a great soundtrack of course with many a well placed song.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Fantastic,"It has its moments where it may crack a joke at the wrong time- but Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is easily one of the best sequels i've ever seen- and without a doubt- an absolute blast. I knew from the minute I saw the trailer for the first film that Guardians of the Galaxy was going to be something special, and the same thing applies to this film. We get the iconic characters back in all their glory, as well as some new ones. The entire cast is great, there is no doubting any of the main 5's performances, as they are simply as great as before. What I do enjoy about this film is how they decided to make Nebula less of a 2D character and really provide the depth they didn't have time for her character in the first film. We also get an excellent performance from Kurt Russell as the God Ego- as well as newcomer Pom Klementieff's hilarious portrayal of Mantis, and of course the brilliant Michael Rooker as Yondu. The soundtrack is great, obviously, and Gunn's direction is so excellently crafted and visually sound that you can't help but feel every aspect of emotion he is going for while making it. It's an incredibly funny film, with some great action scenes, and a deeply emotional turmoil that honestly made me cry once...or twice. The visuals are also fantastic, as well as the makeup, and the look of the film is incredibly well developed- as well as its style and atmosphere. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is everything you would hope the sequel would be and more. It may not be quite as good as the original, but it certainly is more than a worthy successor.My Rating: 9.9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
As good as the first?,"When you hear the words 'as good as the first' it is often met with skeptical ears, however, I think your friends will be pushing for you to go with them again to see Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 as it is definitely as entertaining as the first, if not better (shh don't tell). With the intense action scenes, met with the classic one liners, tied in with the classic soundtrack your dad would dance awkwardly too, this film is definitely one for your friends and family to rave about. The acting was in parts a bit over the top and a little try-hard-like with the humor and some characters had grown a somewhat over the top personality since Vol. 1, but the hilarious lead acting of Chris Pratt as Peter and the bad*SS support of Zoe Saldana as Gamora made you not care about previously stated issues. Marvel continues to pump out the action-packed blockbusters that kill at the box office and Guardians vol. 2 will definitely follow those steps. Compliments to director James Gunn! Be right back queuing again.....9/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great sequel overall,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a great movie, and I would say better than the recent superhero movies. I'm afraid thought that the first movie set the expectations so high that is not crazy to doubt if this one was able to keep up.Visually is as good as the first one, the acting is on point and the soundtrack is dope. The plot is fine, although it falls under the ""knowing better the characters and realizing their sad and deep feelings"" cliché. It leaves me with the feeling that the first one was innovative and fresh, wherever this one just reused the formula.Apart from that, this is an entertaining and fun movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who is into superhero or science fiction movies. It doesn't disappoint.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Mixed Bag,"Let me start by saying that I'm still unsure how I feel about this movie. And before I tell you about the movie, I feel compelled to tell you that I went to watch this movie with 15 excited fans of the first movie - 5 of which were comic book readers and the rest (you do the math) had watched the first one and couldn't wait to watch the sequel, but are not comic book readers. Now, remember this, because I'm going to give you some of their reactions at the end of the review.OK, now let us begin with the actual review. If I'm to put it in one sentence, I'll say that it was fun, but not that much and that it was a one time watch. Star Lord and the gang start off with the usual shenanigans that have you laughing, sipping your coke, eating your popcorn happily and adoring little Groot. The beginning of the movie is pretty much what the trailer shows us. James Gunn made us fall in love with the GoTG in the first film and in this film, he gives us more reasons to care about them as we delve into each of their pasts. The not-so-subtle theme of family is cute, but at times forced and feels like...and I quote one of my fellow movie-goer friends - ""Fast and the Furious in space"". For me this movie was driven solely by the characters and not by the story. While watching the movie, I realised that all of THIS would be better as a TV show. At one point in the movie I was like, yeah this is great, I'm laughing, but where is this going? It all seemed pointless some 45 minutes-1 hr into the movie. I had a Batman v Superman Deja Vu (only this Deja Vu was shorter and colourful). The movie suffers greatly due to the lack of a good villain and forced cheesy dialogues. Towards the end, I was like ""Man! This is Flash and Arrow level of whining."" Fortunately, the characters keep you interested and for my Rocket is the real MVP of the whole movie. I friggin loved every line he said. Drax was awesome as ever, Groot was bloody adorable. Gamora was under-utilised, Quill was funny (that's it). Amongst the other characters, Peters dad was decent, Yondu was great and Mantis was good in the limited role she had.Im sure there will be others who will reach the point i reached in the movie when i thought it was going nowhere, but might be happy with the movie overall all as there is a big emotional payback in the end of the movie. For me, that was not enough to hide it's short-comings. Loved the END (the proper end, not the villain fight - I thought that was okayish and predictable, but funny nonetheless). All in all, a decent, funny movie, that is led down by the weak writing. It doesn't quite live up to the benchmark set by the first part. Oh and out of the 5 post credits scene, the 4th one is the important one.Ratings - 6.5/10PS - Here are few of the reactions from my friends -Comic book reader friend 1 - ""That was so much fun""Comic book reader friend 2 - ""I liked it, but could've been better""Comic book reader friend 3 - ""So funny""Non-Comic book reader friend 1 - ""Bro, you didn't tell me we were watching Fast and the Furious in space""Non-Comic book reader friend 2 - ""Garbage""Non-Comic book reader friend 3 - ""One time watch""",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Top-Notch Entertainment !,"*SPOILER FREE REVIEW*As a huge fan of the first film, I went to watch the movie as soon as it came out. And I have to say I wasn't disappointed at all.Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Offers so much thrills and an awesome cinematic experience, The action starts right from the opening scene and it doesn't end until the last 2 seconds of the film. The people behind the movie just knew how to not make the audience bored, and they succeeded at that.I have to say that 3D ticket here is worth the additional price, because honestly, if any movie deserved to be really watched in 3D it's this one,It adds so much depth to the scenes and makes the movie alive.The plot is interesting enough to keep you engaged and the pacing never really drags even with the movie's long duration.The soundtrack just fits right into its place and it really helped the background quality, providing the best classic songs. The movie is also really humorous and I found it as funny as the first.Due to the movie's high budget, the scenery is Amazing! The movie feels like a very entertaining roller coaster, it was a joy and all the crowd were very pleased.In the end, Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol.2 Is a MUST-SEE for fans of the first one and a VERY ENJOYABLE ride for everyone else. It's simply one of these movies that are always fun to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"a great, entertaining sequel to a great movie","I had my doubts about this one while going to the cinema, because I am a big fan of the first one and was genuinely worried that this one wouldn't live up to it's predecessor. While I do believe that the first one was a better movie, this one is what I would consider a perfect sequel.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 does the right thing by letting us get to know the characters a bit better. What I was most surprised by, however, was the choice to focus more on the character of Yondu than that of Chris Pratt's Star Lord. I thought it was a brilliant choice; Michael Rooker really shines in this role and is by far the best character in the movie. There are also some really cool action scenes with his arrow. Star Lord gets thrown to the side a bit, which is good since we already know pretty much everything about him except for who his dad is, which we do find out in this movie. All in all, the action was fun, the characters were great, the colors were great, it was much funnier than the first one (this movie is very much a comedy with some absolutely hilarious one-liners, mostly from Drax) and just overall a delightful experience. It definitely exceeded my expectations.That being said, I do have just a few problems with this movie. They don't ruin the movie for me and they're not that bothersome, but still. We all know about the recent trend in big superhero movies such as this one, which is bad villains. And, honestly, all of my problems start with the villains. The Guardians are being followed throughout the movie by these golden people, which ultimately serve no purpose in the movie other than being ""villains"", I guess. I say ""villains"" because it's very much debatable what their motivations are and even who they are, and we just don't know enough about them to care. Everything they do is pretty ridiculous and over the top. The other problem I have is with Kurt Russel's character. Now, I love Kurt Russel and I was excited to see him play Peter Quill's dad, but his character just feels like a big exposition machine and, not to get too spoilery, goes the typical cliché route. His motivations are clear, but very much overused and he's basically in the movie as a plot device. These two things, though, aren't that big of a problem to me because they were just devices for the movie to give Star Lord something to do (of course, a movie needs conflict), and they were background things working around the jokes, fun, and the adventure the characters we love were on. And the ending does get quite emotional.Ultimately, I think fans of the first movie will have no problems enjoying this one as well and I believe it has done everything right as a sequel. Let's just hope Marvel continues down this path of movies that know what they are and are just plain fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Laugh out loud funny movie filled with many touching moments that will make you cry!,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2 is such a glorious celebration of all that's enjoyable about going to the movies. It makes you feel you've gotten your money's worth, from the ticket price to all the expensive food and drink items. Everyone in the theater walked out chatting and laughing about the movie. I can't think of a way to make a more enjoyable movie than GOTG 2.From the beginning, the MARVEL STUDIOS logo has changed. While it's slowly creeping on screen, we used to see comic pages flipping. That's now replaced with movie footage, and the music is now epic, making the MS logo feel more classy and majestic.The opening credits scene is just so creative, and a scene like that could very well be one of the best ending scenes in another movie. But in GOTG 2, it's just the opening! Looking back on the entire film, I can't believe in this age where we're all so used to seeing flashy space and combat action scenes, everything gets better and better as this movie rolls along towards the ending.This is a really character-driven movie, and every single main actor gets fantastic screen time. No one is in the background. They all shine. Jokes are non-stop, and there are WAY more jokes in this sequel. Some of the humor is so unexpected and wacky that you'll just burst out loud laughing! You'll hear other people in the theater continue to laugh as the movie rolls on and you'll laugh again just thinking about what happened on screen.As funny as this movie gets, you'll be pleasantly blindsided with some extremely heartwarming scenes between characters. How can a movie make people laugh so hard, then the next minute have everyone sobbing, or at least fighting back tears? If you're the type of movie-goer who likes to brag that you didn't cry through an emotional scene, prepare to get tested. GOTG 2 has many emotional scenes, and they happen at the weirdest, most unexpected times. My bet is, you WILL cry at least once. There's just too many good scenes coming at you and you'll stumble. This movie is such a rare roller-coaster of emotional ups and downs. Enjoy the ride!The end credits are filled with things to keep you sitting in your chair. Don't make the mistake of walking out. There are something like 5 or 6 end scenes dispersed through the credits. You'll see people in the theater standing to leave, then sitting. Standing again, then sitting down. There's just so much going on in the end credits!From start to finish, this movie has everything and the kitchen sink thrown in. It's all bigger, better, funnier and way more emotional than the first GOTG, and easily the most entertaining thing you might witness this year in the theater. Don't miss this movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
For one Marvel movie its actually pretty good.,"When first movie came out everyone was crazy about it yet I wasn't that impressed, Even tho the story was descent and characters more or less likable, Overall it was nothing special but It had same problem of uninspiring forgettable villain, typical for marvel movies.Now for the Vol 2 it really surprised me.Characters are better written,they actually have some depths this time, Actors really did good job portraying them, it can be seen how much fun they had on the set, Visauls are very good as always, story is well written full of humor, it actually made me laugh few times. Plot of the movies was already seen but it do the job. And villain is pretty cool as well.On the other hand, The problem I had with movie is that it tried too much to be funny the whole time, some jokes are forced and unnecessary, There are scenes where they really cross the line and made it too goofy. Yet again it was naive at the moments, and some dialogue could be better but Overall its quite enjoyable movie, one of the best marvel have to offer for now.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Guardians Strike Back,"I was lucky enough to see this on 20/4 at an industry screening which allowed me to sit on the film for a few days before I gave a review. I can safely say GotG Volume 2 absolutely wowed me. I can't believe these bunch of lovable misfit a-holes made one of the most MATURE themed films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is visually gorgeous. The use of colour, design and the straight up imagination of the source material outstand any MCU film prior. The action is glorious and astonishing. One scene in particular, I was jaw-dropped in its entirety as direction, action-choreography and music all came together so harmoniously. And THE MUSIC! What an eargasmic soundtrack. The songs are more poetic this time around and fit the subtext of the film perfectly. The trailers gave me the feel of the first movie; a straight-up Sci-fi action-comedy with a simple point A to B plot. GotGV2 is so much MORE than this! This film is patient with its characters and there is an emphasis on growth and family. It manages to balance 7-8 characters and gives almost all of them a satisfactory emotional arc. There is so much to chew on here with the issues and motifs felt by certain characters and I applaud that! This film is vastly different and I'm glad because I just love these characters so much! They are still so fun and energetic. It's great to see the team again and how their dynamic transforms. Also I forget to mention, the film is laugh-out-loud funny! All thanks to Drax who is by far the most comedic character and put me stitches.Overall, this was both (I can't believe I'm saying this about the Guardians of the Galaxy) an emotionally dense and exciting blast. If Guardians 1 is the fast-paced Sci-Fi adventure like Star Wars was in 1977, then Vol. 2 is the deeper & richer film that takes its time to expand our beloved characters; just like Empire Strikes Back.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
As expected for marvel studios,Yeah marvel did it again and hit us with an Amazing Movie I as a comics and MCU fan Really enjoyed the movie it has some astonishing easter eggs that will make you stand from your chair in the theater.... the movie got a great action scenes (like any marvel movie) a good Scenario and beautiful Directing from James Gunn he really did a great job with this movie. the CGI are quit good as expected from a marvel movie... but what i liked the most of this movie is character development this movie is completely about develop the characters that we met in the first Guardians movie you really start to care more about the characters especially Yondu he become my favourite character in the Guardians they really work him well very well ! and we can't forget the humor it does take a big part of the movie this movie was the funnies MCU movie till now... is it good as the first ? well the first movie was a surprise hit not like vol2 cause we expected the movie to be great ... and also Thanos scene in the first *_*,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Some sequels shouldn't happen,"I know it's a cliché to say I don't often write reviews, but that's the case here. I saw the overwhelmingly positive ratings for this film, and I'm wondering if we live in some kind of altered state or these really are the days of Idiocracy. Without giving anything away, I can tell you I'd rather get a root canal with no anesthetic in Tijuana... Yeah, it's that horrible. I was skeptical about the first film, but it was surprising delight of a film. This version is every worn out, big battle, fake CGI, movie rolled together puked out like a college girl on Spring Break.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I've never seen a movie so forgettable and so memorable at the same time,"After the release of Infinity War, I had been bingewatching all the MCU movies to catch up with everyone before Endgame comes. And of course I was watching them all very hurriedly. The memorable movies were the ones that I still remember very clearly to date (it's been nearly 3 years), while the ones that were terrible and a drag to watch, I forgot them instantly. I'd say this movie comes between the two categories, and as far as I can think right now, it's the only one to be in this exceptional category.No matter what everyone says, I absolutely hate baby Groot. Cuteness only suits on creatures we are used to perceiving as cute. And thus Groot, a tree, looks very, very awkward with those chubby cheeks. It seems as though that face wasn't meant to be on that body. Also the entire point of his innocence is very irritating, especially the part where he wanted to use Rocket's buttons in spite of him repeatedly telling him not to do it. That scene does not even make any sense, since other than that part Rocket and Groot seem to understand each other literally all the time. Groot becomes stupid or intelligent, strong or weak as the story demands it, which is why I absolutely hate him.The visuals are absolutely gorgeous. Though it feels as though there is too much yellow in the colour palette and the overall tone is more inclined towards the warm shades, the CGI world is marvelous to look at. Ego is a great planet to look at. I have seen Ego in the comics now so I can't believe they were actually able to translate him so well on the screen. Seeing the spaceship battles always kept me on the edge of my seat. It's just like how I was expecting the movie to become better as time progresses.But the way the conflict between Peter and Ego came was very bad. First of all, the way they bonded was wrong by their characteristics. Peter is a gullible guy who always thinks by his emotions while Gamora is the sensible one. Yet here Peter was the one suspecting Ego while Gamora wanted him to trust Ego. And then the way Ego revealed his mother's death, ugh! Why did he even need to say that! Firstly no matter how much you are in a flow, you'd never say something like that. And secondly if he knows so much about Peter, how did he not know saying that would make him angry?I really liked Mantis. I never understood why her character arc was about her being ugly. She looked way better than Nebula or Drax. She was kinda cute though. I couldn't hear any of Drax's jokes so I won't be talking about him. Yondu was also a very nice character. As much as I rolled my eyes seeing him in the movie, I really enjoyed seeing what he had become. His character development is fantastic, because of the redeemed person that he is. His whistling and shooting arrows was very much fun to watch.Overall this movie is a very mixed bag of opinions for me. I think it's really bad compared to the first movie, but at the same time really entertaining compared to most MCU movies. There is so much CGI, so much world building in GotG that I can't possibly hate it. I'm just gonna try to remember this one. I had forgotten everything about it except the good scenes, so I had to watch the Cinemasins video to remember it. I hope Volume 3 surpasses my expectations.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The First Was My Favourite Film. This One Tops It.,"I adored the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Like many, I was blown away having gone in with no expectations, and laughed and grinned through the entire thing. It became my favourite film, on its own until Denis Villeneuve's masterpiece Arrival profoundly moved me, and so the stakes were high for the sequel that I arrived to with Baby Groot bobble-head in hand (bringing my cardboard cut-out was logistically impractical).When I went to the midnight screening (28th of April in the UK), I loved it. Everyone in the room did. From the very first scene where the rich visuals filled my eyes, to the following scene, which made, and continues to make, me grin from ear to ear and is my favourite scene in cinema. to the laughs and action and thoughtful moments that made up the rest of this film; they managed to take all that was great about the first and ramp it up.So yes, I exited the cinema at something past 2 in the morning, utterly delighted. I wanted to go again. And that I did. In the first five days of the film being open in the UK, I watched it four times (at three separate cinemas), and I have to say that I have been delighted with it every single time.Standout performances in this film must go to Drax, Rocket and Yondu—with the former taking the lead in laugh-out-loud moments in this film—while Kurt Russell has an absolute ball as Ego.One of the many, many things that I loved about this film (whose soundtrack, I would argue—having had it on hard rotation for this last week—surpasses the first's) is the fact that James Gunn's work is self- aware. We saw some of this in Deadpool, as Ryan Reynolds spent his time making fun of 'superhero landing's and similar superhero movie tropes, despite falling into a number of those, itself. In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, we see a step up from this. Instead of making fun of the clichés that come along with this sort of film, they embrace them and ramp it up at times, having the duel effect of accepting that there are certain hoops that need to be jumped through while also retaining the sense of fun and ham for which the first was so lauded. Additionally, this also means that any sentimental message is passed on, while also you're aware that the tongue is rooted firmly in cheek: much akin to somebody who uses hyperbole to tell their partner that they physically radiate beauty- although the manner of delivery isn't meant to be taken seriously, the message is still genuine.Chris Pratt does this very well; I'm convinced he's not a very good dramatist, he's just such a charismatic and funny person that he gets away with it, which works perfectly well in situations like this, as he makes comments that plainly point towards motifs within the film which, in a Shawshank or a film of that ilk would seem out of place and stilted, but work brilliantly in the context. (Disclaimer: I haven't seen Passengers and so don't know whether his performance here proves wrong my theory about his acting chops)There are moments throughout the film that are surprisingly brutal for a Marvel film, definitely a high-end 12A, but not out of place, and there is a general joy that easily balances this out.If you go to see Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, you should absolutely love it. Admittedly, I went in with a lot vested in the film being good, but I have been to see it thrice more after that, and it still holds up for me. What I would say, as was the case with my brother, is that going a second time may help because this film is chocked full (both in the sense of the story-line and visually) and going multiple times allows you to notice little moments throughout—with there easter eggs galore for the Marvel fan, including references to the previous film. Also, I would recommend going to see it in 2D on your first showing: I went in 2D for my first two viewings, then IMAX 3D and then 2D again, and—although the 3D has some absolutely beautiful moments and really is striking—I found that it distracted from the film at times and I spent time looking at the film, rather than watching it.So yes, I could not recommend this film highly enough. James Gunn does a fantastic job of giving us a film that helps us learn more about these characters; care more about them; see them in battle and, most importantly, meet Baby Groot, who is a complete and utter delight. Bar one moment of slightly choppy editing (although this may just be my four viewings showing an over-analysis that most people won't notice) I could not fault it for the way it was put together, mixing light moments with dark brilliantly and keeping an excellent pace, and all of the cast are thoroughly watchable, with it a joy to be back in this gang's company.Now, if you don't mind me, I'm going to go and re-watch the original, before, potentially, going back to the cinema this weekend.

A Cosmic Reunion,"Hello everyone, I'm Mr. C Reviewer, tonight we are discussing the Movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. I watched it on Disney plus. The Movie first aired April 10, 2017. It has a runtime of 2 hour and 16 minutes. It was rated PG-13. The Movie was directed and created by James Gunn. The movie was loosely based on the comic books by Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning. Some of the characters was created by Steve Englehart, Steve Gan, Jim Starlin, Stan Lee, Larry Lieber, Jack Kirby, Bill Mantlo, Keith Giffen, Steve Gerber and Val Mayerik.Summary: The Guardians taking on a new mission to protect valuable batteries from an intergalactic threat while simultaneously evading the wrath of a vengeful group known as the Sovereign. Their journey leads them to encounter a celestial being, Ego.Review: -I loved the opening scenes but I found the acting varied throughout that scene; some parts showcased solid performances, while others felt less assured, to me some of the actors seemed somewhat uncertain at times. I appreciated that the film highlights themes of family-both biological and chosen-which resonate with many viewers who cherish these connections in their lives. I was pleased that it conveys messages about acceptance and understanding differences among individuals. The film expertly maintains a light-hearted tone infused with humour. Its comedic timing, clever dialogue, and absurd situations create an enjoyable viewing experience. The humour was skilfully balanced with the more serious themes of the story, providing moments of levity amid emotional scenes. The soundtrack, featuring classic songs from the '70s and '80s, beautifully complements the narrative, evoking nostalgia while enhancing key emotional moments throughout the film. I appreciate how the music becomes an integral part of both character development and storytelling in this one too. I found the gore in the movie to be visually impressive; some scenes appeared quite realistic. As an autistic individual, I was especially grateful for the inclusion of subtitles, which made it easier to follow the dialogue.I admired how the film's cinematography skilfully employed a variety of shot types to enhance its storytelling. Wide shots were often used to showcase vast alien landscapes and the scale of space battles, immersing viewers in the expansive universe. Medium shots facilitate character interactions by highlighting facial expressions while maintaining some background context, effectively balancing intimacy with environmental awareness during dialogue and action. Close-ups was crucial for conveying emotional depth, focusing on characters' faces during key moments to draw viewers into their internal experiences. Over-the-shoulder shots enhanced conversations by providing perspective and connection between characters, making the audience feel engaged in the dialogue. The film employed dynamic tracking shots that follow characters through action sequences and scene transitions, enhancing momentum during fight scenes and intricate movements. Aerial shots effectively captured large-scale battles and expansive alien landscapes, providing a grand perspective that enriches world-building. Dutch angles was used strategically to evoke unease and tension during pivotal moments in the narrative. Establishing shots introduced new locations before the action begins, while slow-motion sequences emphasize pivotal moments, particularly during intense battles and emotional revelations. Point-of-View (POV) shots immerse viewers in a character's perspective, enhancing engagement with their motivations and reactions.The film's aesthetic was significantly enhanced by its extensive visual effects, which created stunning cosmic landscapes, spaceships, and explosions. The seamless integration of live-action footage with CGI backgrounds showcased meticulous craftsmanship, allowing for smooth transitions between real actors and digital environments. Notably, the CGI character animation for Rocket Raccoon and Baby Groot was impressive; these fully computer-generated characters utilized advanced motion capture technology to accurately reflect actors' movements and expressions. The detailed creature design involved intricate modelling and texturing processes that made them appear lifelike within the film's universe. Dim lighting was used strategically to emphasize key elements within the frame. I appreciated how the movie provided on-screen text to indicate our current setting. I found the film's soundtrack and sound effects to be particularly effective, as they complemented the scenes.-I was thrilled to have the chance to reconnect with the characters, and I truly valued the film's focus on character development. This was particularly evident in Peter's backstory and his relationship with Ego. I appreciated the depiction of strong, multifaceted characters like Gamora and Mantis. Their depth not only enriches the plot but also can resonate with audiences seeking representation. The film thoughtfully invites viewers to reflect on identity, especially through Peter's journey as he grapples with his heritage. The motivations of the movie's antagonist were rooted in personal relationships rather than conventional villainy, which added a fascinating layer to his character.-I found the movie to be slightly longer than I preferred; it began to feel a bit sluggish, though not as much as the first instalment. I did find the conclusion to be quite satisfying and I was happy to discover the four cleverly integrated extra scenes during the ending credits.I rate each Movie I watch out of 10 and for this one, I give it an 6.9 Remember this was what I thought about the film personally and I suggest that you give it a go for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This movie is a joyous experience.  Guaranteed to raise your mood!,"James Gunn is clearly a fan of the work, and his love for the material shows through out the movie. Such a weird and bizarre universe so beautifully adapted to the screen.This time around, part2 concentrates more on character development rather than being a plot driven movie. It concentrates on building the team dynamics and their relationships with each other. This enriches the movie's universe and is a decision with long term considerations for the series.Even if you miss out on the amount of plot, you will be easily distracted by the great humor. The jokes are well written through out the running time. I haven't had so many laughs in a movie since Deadpool.The plot is well written and the extra character development time raises the stakes and our attachment to the characters during action scenes. The actions scenes are visually incredible, in fact the entire universe is colorful and beautiful to behold.I had a blast watching this movie, and I think you will too.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"More backstory, deeper characters and more lore!","The whole thing was just a blast. It has less action than the first film but the characters all get their backstories and some are very emotional. Some people might find this film boring, but I just laughed so many times and dare I say it, watery eyes. Some very powerful emotional stuff is being shown here amidst the bizarre comic villains and scene's. Its just overall a great follow up.Please don't listen to the negative reviews and thereby avoiding this film. I saw loads of reviews beforehand and I disagree with so many of them. this truly is one of my favorite Marvel films. So much heart went into creating this film and it truly shows! Funnier, more emotion, more lore, more backstories and the characters are so much better than the first film. This is how sequels should be!The music is also amazing (as expected). I really cannot wait to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3! (or Avengers Infinity War)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"More action and spectacle = fun and thrilling ride, but disappointing in comparison to its predecessor.","It was definitely inferior to the original. The CG was great, the action was cool but there was nothing original. It was the same as the first one, except less creative and unique. The biggest problem was that it wasn't funny - I laughed out loud 3 times and the rest of the audience was silent. All the best jokes were used in the trailers, and if you don't find it funny or original, then there's not much else to take away. The final fight scene was cool, but most of the movie was a bit boring - but entertaining none-the-less and worth the trip out. I'd rather be watching 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' or the first Guardians. 'Logan' is still the 2017 blockbuster to beat.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Please don't hate me...,"I can see many think that Vol2 was as good as the first but I'm afraid I disagree. I was really looking forward to this as the first GOTG is almost my favourite (after Deadpool, of course!)We saw this last night and quite honestly, I thought it had been directed by someone different: I was honestly quite shocked to see it hadn't! The first GOTG took a cast of great characters and told a great story with them, effortlessly peppering that story with humour. This one just seemed to want to pack the cheap gags in, often at the cost of the characters or the story. While the first seemed to just have the formula right, this one seemed to be just trying to stick to the right formula. As a result it was overall that much more superficial an experience. It wasn't just me either, the whole family shifted uncomfortably at the end, nobody really wanting to be the first to say they were disappointed - but unfortunately we all were.I don't know how many times I've seen the first GOTG. Usually, I'll be trying to express to someone why it's worth seeing, then put it on to show them 'just a bit of it' and we end up watching the whole blimmin thing. Don't get me wrong; I didn't hate Vol2 and I don't regret watching it. It's just that I can't imagine wanting to see it again. GOTG = classic!

Awesome movie,"Great movie. Mixed emotions very well and balanced a ton of characters amazingly. The story was intense and the character development was insane.

Hooked on this feeling? The answer is Yes and with extra surprises,"I don't know if I like this one more or less than the first one. The story felt scaled down if you think about how ""Vol. 1"" was. Or maybe I shouldn't say scaled down. It was more centered on one thing. So, don't go in expecting a sequel that's more epic or just bigger/grander in general. Sure, the spectacle and the humor is still there. You will get your money's worth because of those things. But, the actual story line is a little different and not very common with these type of films. It might be disappointing for some or it might be great for others. I had a good time with it though.I wasn't expecting the movie to go to some places and the surprises were pretty good. I love the characters. Baby Groot was the one I wasn't completely sold on. I'm not the biggest fan of the idea that he is a baby in this one. Most of the jokes hit home, some minor ones felt a little too much. Don't worry, there are more good jokes than bad ones. I did laugh plenty of times. Drax was really good in this and so was Michael Rooker's Yondu. Chris Pratt delivers. He gets to have more of a dramatic role, but he still doesn't forget to have fun. I felt that Zoe Saldana's Gamora didn't stand out so much this time around. She was still playing the character well though. Mantis was one of the stand outs this time. The humor and charisma she brings to the table was fantastic. Stallone was underutilized. It was weird seeing him in it at first. It was like, ""What's he doing in this movie?"". But, he was fine as a supporting character. Now how was Kurt Russell? Well, I will not spoil anything, but he was pretty much Kurt Russell. Meaning he basically played himself. But, hey! It worked. The movie is already vibrant and funny enough that having Russell in it makes perfect sense.I admire the fact that James Gunn just goes for it and makes movies that feel personal. I like that it wasn't just entirely for the laughs and that there were some serious scenes. Most of them were good, because they dared to do some unexpected things. They also helped explore the characters even better. Although those serious/dramatic scenes usually followed up a scene that was ridiculous and fun, so the transition didn't feel smooth enough. I hope you understand what I mean. For example; We get a pop song and everyone's firing blasters and then the next second the music gets very melodramatic and someone is talking about sad feelings. What I'm trying to say is that the tones were very jumpy sometimes. There's of course the ""Fast & Furious"" thing about them stating they're a family. I didn't buy it actually. As friends? Yes, of course. But, saying they are a family is stretching it. That's probably my biggest negative. And the finale wasn't the greatest. I missed the presence of a lot of characters from the first movie. Maybe they'll show up in a sequel down the line.I may have worded this review out too much by now. I'm sorry about that. Basic point is that the Marvel Cinematic Universe hasn't hit a dead spot yet. They are still bringing us entertaining and surprisingly fresh stories. This is a pretty easy watch and the plus is that you might get some nice emotional parts here and there. Go in with a fresh mind. It's weird, I know. But, the characters all feel alive in this strange galaxy. Check it out!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Best Marvel Flick to Date,"Being its own universe away from the comics (as has always been) I went into this already knowing to expect some things I've known and loved since childhood reading comics, as well as surprising things that were and are new to the MCU. Blew me away to say the least. I got the nostalgia feeling mixed with the new action packed and new spins on characters feelings :). Nothing I didn't like about this movie to be honest so rated a perfect 10. Graphics were amazing, acting was great, it was hilarious at moments, action-packed throughout, and had me at the edge of my seat for the duration. I think this is all a movie should do and it achieved it.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Great humor, poor villain","The Guardians of the Galaxy are back at it. Who would have known that the existence of life would be protected, once again, by a group of idiots.This was one of the funniest movies put out by Marvel. Baby Groot had me laughing the entire time. He was unpredictable in his actions. His conversations were intriguing. His dancing was creative and entertaining.Drax the Destroyer, played by Dave Batista, could not have been any more literal with his presence. He was not as uptight as he was in the first installment of Guardians of the Galaxy. This made him more appealing in a comedic fashion, and it was awesome!The story started off in such a powerful way, it made me think that the rest of the movie was going to build to a monumental finish. But unfortunately, that was not the case. After the main opening scene, the rest of the movie did not match the benchmark that was set earlier. The way the middle of the movie was put together, it made the villain unclear in regards to who he or she was. Ego the Living Planet, played by Kurt Russell, was not as good of a villain as what should have been present in the movie. In the first Guardians of the Galaxy, Ronan the Accuser was an incredible and suitable challenge for the Guardians of the Galaxy. Although Ego the Living Planet is more powerful than Ronan the Accuser, his presence in the movie was weak and it did not leave an impact like it should have. I believe if Ego the Living Planet could have been introduced much better, and he could have been a greater threat to the Guardians of the Galaxy to make for a better story.Despite my disagreement with Ego the Living Planet's role in the movie, the rest was suitable. Overall, this is still a good movie to see.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Groot Expectations,"James Gunn is back writing and directing the sequel to his surprise 2014 summer hit. And it might be a fresh mix tape slammed into the Walkman, but it's much of the same again. Not that that's necessarily a bad thing.In terms of the story, it's almost a remake of the worst Star Trek film ever made! However, this time its all done for 'laffs' and so works much, much better. We join Quill (Chris Pratt, ""Jurassic World""), Gamora (Zoe Saldana, ""Star Trek Beyond""), Drax (Dave Bautista, ""Spectre"") and Rocket (the voice of Bradley Cooper) 'ever ready' (LOL) to save the priceless Anulax batteries of their current employees, the Sovereigns, from the ravages of some multi-dimensional being. 'Helping' them is Baby Groot, a twig off the old branch from the first film, again voiced (in what must be the easiest money in Hollywood) by Vin Diesel (""Fast and Furious 8"").The Sovereign's High Priestess (Elizabeth Debicki, ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E."") provides payment to Gamora in the form of her chained-up evil sister Nebula (a deliciously sulky Karen Gillen, ""Dr Who"", ""Oculus"") but is then less than impressed when the mercenary Rocket pockets a knapsack full of the batteries. So starts a chase across the galaxy leading Quill to meet Ego (Kurt Russell, ""The Hateful 8"") on the planet Ego (LOL) at the very base of his family tree.The great thing about these films is that they don't even TRY to be realistic. Characters get towed behind crashing spaceships and - literally- dragged through a wood backwards; others fall hundreds of feet to certain death... no, sorry, a ""superhero landing""; and planets and characters are painted with a garishness never ever to be found in nature. You'll even believe Kurt Russell is 18 again - oh that these effects were available on the British NHS!But the other saving grace for this film is the soundtrack, put together by Tyler Bates as an ode to the 80's, with wonderful tracks by ELO, Fleetwood Mac, Cat Stevens and a host of others. The film matches the music with the action superbly.I won't bother commenting on the acting... who cares with this sort of film! But everyone seems to have fun with Michael Rooker (""Cliffhanger"") being particularly good in reprising his role of Yondu. There are also a wealth of memorable cameos, some of them being laugh out loud moments. While some of the pop culture references might go over a younger audience's heads, there are still enough great one- liners and comic moments to provide general appeal. Bad guys silhouetted against the moon, ET style, was particularly memorable.One criticism I would have though is that it's just too darn long for an ""action comedy"". The original film just about scraped into my good books by coming in under the two hour curfew. The sequel however adds another 15 minutes, which should have found its way either onto the cutting room floor or onto the ""Blu Ray collector's edition"". In particular, the final never-ending showdown of CGI manicness went on too long for my liking.Looking back at the original 2014 review, I gave it a rather stingy 6* rating, which in retrospect I think was a bit mean given its novelty. This time the novelty has worn off, but if anything this is an even more enjoyable romp that the first outing.James Gunn be warned though: I am unlikely to be so generous with ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3"" (as threatened) which in my view might be a trip too far for this franchise. My advice would be to take a leaf out of Peter Kay's ""Car Share"" book and quit while you're ahead.(For the graphical version of this review, please visit bob-the-movie- man.com.

Finally the wait is over and GOTG2 delivers,"I haven't been to see a movie on opening night for over 10 years but I've been eagerly waiting for this with bated breathe...Was it as good as the first one? This is hard to judge, I'm not really a Marvel fan and when the first one came out I reluctantly went to the cinema with my kids expecting to be bored watching a dumb sci-fi movie about a raccoon and an walking tree but ended up having a fantastic time, and I'm 47 .. This is the reason the first movie got such positive feedback in my opinion so the sequel was never going to live up to it... but it came very close.I don't like to give reviews with spoilers so I'll give an overall review..

Hooked on the Guardians,"The Guardians are back and they surely do not disappoint.The MCU creates an emotional,really entertaining and important film.It is not as good as the first one,but deserves to be watched.Just imagine Baby Groot dancing like crazy while the other members are trying to fight a huge monster in one of the first scenes.How better can it get?One thing that I really liked in this film is that it is deeper that the first and has an emotional tone,something that we rarely see in superhero films.It shows the real meaning of family and friendship and emphasizes on team work and sacrifice.It makes the audience move to tears and feel the particular film.The soundtrack was PERFECT!I loved Mr.Blue Sky,The Chain,Fox on the Run,Father and Son!It was energetic and it was combined perfectly with the scenes.Another advantage of the film was the character development.Yondu/Mary Poppins was maybe the best character of the film,because he was funny,cool and at the end proved that he's is a hero and a great daddy!Star Lord and Rocket were cool.Gamora and Nebula developed a great relationship with each other.Dax was really cool!He was funny,emotional and did exactly what he needed to do as a character.Baby Groot was really entertaining and cute,but he could have had a more important role in this film.Mantis,one of the new characters had a clever power and I liked the way they designed her look.The only character that I did not particularly liked was Ego,Star-Lord's Father.He was not the appropriate villain for the film and the idea that he was a planet and person at the same time was clever but over-fleshed.Except from Ego's character,I thought that the plot was a little weak and that the Guardian's story was less important than the first one.Although it had a great introduction and the movie included a lot of impressive action scenes,the story did not fully capture the guardian's greatness.The film provides great humor,touching scenes,cool characters and it has the same style as the first one.I especially liked the emotional ending.A perfect funeral.Fireworks all around the galaxy.Father and Son.How can you not cry?All in all,the guardians strike back in a powerful way and they do not only kick butt.They show to us that when we drop the ego whether it's our personal ego or our crazy planet god father named Ego then we can learn to value life and be with the more important things that could already be standing right next to us.

Wonderfully entertaining!!  (No spoilers),"Let me start by saying I am not a superhero or comic book fan. I ONLY went to this movie because the company I was in wanted to. I was reluctant, but was assured I would enjoy it. I was so skeptical and really had a negative outlook. I am SO HAPPY that I chose to go. I was very nicely surprised.This is an incredible journey that shows the ties of friendships and families and good vs. evil. Very well written, directed and acted. Characters and story line were well developed. The movie was paced perfectly, nothing felt rushed and nothing felt like it was dragging, even with the movie being on the long side. The movie did not follow the always boring, somewhat predictable path. Riveting moments come at the least expected times. There are plenty of emotional scenes.This movie is wonderfully entertaining. The scenery is exceptional. I would have never imagined a Marvel movie to be beautiful, lighthearted, poignant, hysterically funny, intelligent, sad, happy and a just over all very satisfying. I laughed, I cried, I was drawn in and mesmerized. I left with a smile, feeling very satisfied - but wanting more. I really couldn't be happier.I actually had not seen the first GOTG. I was so entertained by this one that I had to go borrow that one from a friend to watch. I like them both a lot. Most of the time a sequel is not as good as the first.

"Tries to do a bit much that doesn't work so well, but the core strengths are there","The original Guardians of the Galaxy was quite a fresh entry in the crowded world of Marvel. With so many famous characters we at least have heard of, and so many films all crashing into one another with cross-overs, references, solo films, and so on, the arrival of a nostalgia soaked film which had a great sense of humor, fun, and a lack of 'big important things' made for great entertainment. Accordingly it was a big hit, which puts pressure on it as a sequel and (more importantly) as a franchise and part of a bigger product. In short though, it does manage to deliver on the same strengths that the first film had – although that is not the whole story.The second film opens with confirmation of that silly fun – an epic battle against a space monster plays out to the background of Groot dancing, and only becomes the focus to allow for other characters to show themselves again and join the fun. This sense of silly fun, combined with funny dialogue, is the core of the film and it is consistent throughout. Add to that the music, the action, and the overblown nature of it and it is a continuation of the strengths of the first film. There is other content in here too. There are themes of family in 3 different threads, with emotional content between characters and factions. Not all of this works, and it does make it feel a bit heavier than it can bear at times. That said, while it doesn't totally work, it is still well judged since less time on it would have lost a lot in the film, while more time would have tipped the balanced too much in that direction – although these individual moments of the film don't totally sit easily with the humor or pace.The effects and action look good and, while frantic and busy, I didn't find that they overwhelmed with empty noise in the way that can easily happen with these things. The cast are all good when it comes to the comedy elements, although not all so well when the emotional stuff comes around (Saldana/Gillan I thought didn't work so well – although Rooker/Cooper did). Pratt likewise is best when asked to be fun, and less effective when processing a lot about his father. Bautista stands out as the best I think – perhaps because so much of his material was heavily 'fun' focused. The many famous faces in small roles add to the weight of the film (not in a good way), and although they do add value, they also distract and fill out space.Although it does try to do a bit too much, and doesn't stay away from areas where it is weaker, the sequel plays to its strengths enough to please fans of the first film, and to carry it through the moments and aspects which do not work as well as the core.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Marvel's First Turd (real person review),"After reading through the sea of effusively positive reviews, I feel compelled to add to the short list of those who actually seemed to have watched the movie. This movie was a complete and utter disaster. I actually rank the first GOTG as my favorite of the Marvel franchise (and easily the most watched at around 20 times), so I was very excited to see this one. I can honestly say I've never before been disappointed by a Marvel production (modern era), and I have actually thought aloud on more than one occasion that Marvel just seems to know how to get it right. It seemed they were infallible, incapable of putting out a bad movie. Unfortunately, they finally got it wrong. The best word I've seen used is forced. Everything feels forced. The plot, the acting, the action, the jokes, the emotion....all of it. With all other Marvel movies, you immerse into the story, you live the plot. While watching this, I gradually become less and less immersed and became increasingly aware of how awful the movie was. I finished it, hoping for a rebound, but it just gets worse, like a turd rolling down hill. By the end, its like a Gatlin gun of turd pellets being shot from the screen, a run of bad jokes, bad acting, bad dialogue, bad plot, and just plain bad experience. I'm truly just dumbfounded that Marvel could screw up at all, and especially this badly. How is this even the same director as the first? Did he have a stroke since the first film? I feel like I've gone through all of the stages of grief except acceptance, and I never will accept this Kentucky Klondike Bar of a movie. Go home GOTG2, you're drunk. Go back and try again.",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of my favorite marvel movies,"Full disclosure: I love the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie, and it wasn't until 3 years after this movie came out that I finally saw it (there are several reasons for that). I'd heard from others that this movie was very good, but not quite as strong as the first one. After seeing this movie finally though, I don't know what they were talking about. This movie was every bit as strong as the first movie, if not stronger in a lot of ways.I won't spoil anything about this film, but I will say that Quill's father is one of the most interesting characters they've had in marvel films, and the fact that he's played by Kurt Russell certainly doesn't hurt.
The story is more interesting and fun than the original, with a lot of very well crafted jokes within the movie. There are some that overstay their welcome just a little bit, but as a whole, they are all great.My favorite aspect of the film was there was no sign of MCU in this movie really at all. There were no random cameos from other marvel superheroes, and there was no ""infinity stones"" or other nonsense like that in this movie. Not saying those things are bad necessarily, but it just feels so nice not having to deal with unnecessary shoehorning in of Marvel things. This was kept relatively tame in the first one as well, but the macguffin in that film was an infinity stone, but this film was it's own separate thing and that made it feel fresh. It didn't even feel like a superhero movie all that much if I'm honest.I don't rate many superhero movies as highly as this, but this one is great. Go watch it if, like me, you put off watching it for fear of not being good.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Funny and Action Packed!,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the 15th in the Marvel Universe (i wonder how the studio hasn't ran out of ideas). This film focuses on the guardians and how they must fight off the gold people after stealing something of theirs, while Star Lord discovers his father and discovers the truth about him. That is one of the things i loved about this movie, so many things are going on and it is not distracting at all. It still manages to stay fresh and funny. The actors are still pretty good and some have improved over the last movie like Drax and Yondu. I also thought Ego(star lord's father) was a fantastic character. The dialogue is funny and very creative. As always the CGI is very good and the movie just looked beautiful. As far as action goes, i thought this was a great improvement. In the end, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the best movie i have seen all year so far, as it improves with the characters, plot, action sequences, and comedy. A+ or 10/10.

We learn more about all the characters, their past and their motivations. + Amazing visuals. + Good action sequences. + Baby Groot is very cute.Negative - The main villain looses his recognizable face, making it harder for the viewer to feel him as the bad guy. - Yondu's arrow is much too powerful, a way to solve any difficult situation. Feels almost like cheating.Great movie. Might not be as big as the first but still very entertaining.5 Stars",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It's OK not to like a movie,"It seems that people are convinced they have to agree with the hype and say they liked a movie instead of giving an honest opinion. This movie was not good, IMO. The first hour was OK...but after that it became a huge mess and ran 45 minutes longer than it needed to. The last 30 minutes were especially horrible.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Crazy Trip To The MCU Cosmic World,"If you love the first chapter, then you'll definitely like Volume 2. The relations between every character evolve and every one of them got a special moment in the movie. Now, we all knew that Baby Groot is adorable and predictably he'll stole the show, but man...Drax, Rocket, Gamora, Nebula, Yondu even Mantis they're all awesome in their way. Of course, Star Lord makes what he can do best, leading the group of a**holes.The cinematography, the stable and funny story, the brilliant colors, that James Gunn added to this movie are just fabulous! The comedy is totally on point. Action scenes are great. The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie.Phase 3 of MCU is very strong first with Civil War, then Doctor Strange and now Guardians doesn't disappoint at all. This is truly one hell of a movie and you must watch it! It's not better than its predecessor, but it is solid one for sure.Don't leave the theaters till the very end of the final text of the credits, there're a few surprises.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original.","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" (PG-13, 2:16), much like its predecessor, is one of the most creative movie mash-ups ever. When I reviewed the original, I noted how much it had in common with ""Star Wars"". My 2014 review called it, ""a movie about a group of rebels of different races getting together to save a planet from the power of a mysterious deadly orb,"" described the group as including ""a good-looking outlaw pilot who is used to only thinking of himself, a large brown creature who makes sounds that others seem to understand as a sort of language, a tough woman with a royal background who has no patience for nonsense and a small, wise creature who provides guidance to the others."" To all that, add significant daddy issues and you have the Guardians films. Well, plus aspects of ""Star Trek"" (discovering strange new worlds), ""Independence Day"" (several people playing crucial roles in defeating interstellar evil) and even ""The Fast and the Furious"" (a diverse group of friends regarded as family).And let's not forget that Guardians is a Marvel property. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is the 15th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The movie contains Easter eggs tying it to other Marvel film franchises and hints at future cinematic overlap. In terms of how this one fits with the others chronologically, according to IMDb, ""the film takes place in 2014, 3 months after Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). It takes place a year after Thor: The Dark World (2013). Before or after Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and a year before Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015)."" Speaking of Tony Stark's cohorts, shortly before the first Guardians movie was released, Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger said that the goal with this franchise was actually to create ""another Avengers"". The Guardian series does have that feel to it, along with some of the comic sensibilities of ""Deadpool"", another Marvel film franchise born in the mid-2010s. Now, having said all that (and ensuing cinematic cross-pollination notwithstanding), the Guardians movies have definitely created their own niche within the MCU – and their own sense of fun.Picking up just months after the action in the original, ""Vol. 2"" sees Peter Quill / Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) adjusting to their newfound fame, their role as galaxy guardians and the dynamics of (and their individual places within) this team – slash – family unit. Early on, four of them battle a monster known as the Abilisk (looking like a much bigger and angrier Jabba the Hutt – with tentacles) while Groot dances to Quill's music. A gold-colored race of people known as the Sovereign reward the Guardians for defeating Abilisk – and protecting the special batteries that it was trying to steal – by turning over a prisoner, Nebula (Karen Gillan), Gamora's estranged sister, who has a bounty on her head. As the Guardians leave the Sovereign, Rocket steals some of those valuable batteries. The insult of such a theft sends Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) into a rage and she sends her fleet of remotely-piloted drones after Rocket and company. Due to some nifty flying – and a little help from a mysterious ship which suddenly comes to their aid – the Guardians survive, but crash land on an unfamiliar planet.That mysterious ship lands on the planet too and out steps a being called Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Quill's father! Ego's story seems to check out, so Quill, Gamora and Drax let Ego take them back to his planet so Quill can spend some time with his pops. Rocket is left behind to repair the ship, take care of Baby Groot and keep an eye on Nebula. As Quill and friends get to know Ego – and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Ego's pet empath (a being who can experience the feelings of other people by touching them and even temporarily alter those feelings), Rocket has to defend against an attack by Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Ravegers, whom Ayesha has hired to retrieve the batteries and kill the Guardians. The Ravegers capture Rocket and Groot, but Yondu's reluctance to pursue Quill leads to a mutiny by Yondu's crew. His lieutenant, who calls himself Taserface (Chris Sullivan), imprisons Yondu, Rocket and Groot, gets rid of those loyal to Yondu and teams up with Nebula to catch up with the rest of the Guardians, who, in the meantime, have run into some pretty serious trouble of their own.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a better plot and visuals and is even more fun than the original. In the first movie, the Guardians became a family, but in this one, they have to learn how to BE a family – while Quill and Gamora each have to deal with serious conflicts stemming from their own original families. Freed from the confines of establishing the Guardians' cinematic world and forming their relationships gives returning writer/director James Gunn the freedom to do more interesting things with the story – and the characters, which are now more developed – and more entertaining – especially Groot, who's as adorable as any Minion, but much tougher (which also happens to be pretty adorable). The music is great, while the scenery is vibrant and the action is exciting (and deserving of 3D viewing). Sometimes, there's almost too much going on visually, but also aurally, as the sound effects and music compete for attention with the dialog. As a whole, Vol. 2 is a good step forward for the franchise and (with help from five short scenes and embedded graphics during and after the closing credits) builds anticipation for more Guardian adventures, including some Marvel-ous crossover action.

Nowhere close to the first one!,"I was so hyped for this movie since I LOVED the first one! But coming out of the cinema I just felt ripped off and let down.This movie has the core of the first one, the CGI effects, blending visuals, humor and great characters. The problem is how they are utilized cause it all felt so forced! The humor was so cringe worthy at times and pretty obvious. There are two scenes, one in the beginning and one in the end that are so overly done that it makes you laugh at how BAD they are. They sort of want a reaction from the audience, but it's not a good one. At my cinema it was all silence so one could hear the crickets in the first scene.The plot is also all over the place, pretty much a filler with no substance. Suddenly Peters father shows up, whom is regarded as one the most powerful beings in the universe. His purpose is sort of just latched on without any meaning other than having a second movie. Also, the movie does not tie into the other MCU movies besides mentioning the infinity stones just once.I think those who have not seen the first one will love this, but for us who have, it's just another filler episode of the Marvel franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Above Average Sequel,"Plenty of action, humor and great to keep main cast together. Hope they didn't spend much money bringing in OLD actors (Stallone & Russell) as anyone could have done as well?? Great CGI and stunts. Be prepared to sit thru a long movie but at least the flow kept viewers engaged.

Guardians of the what?,"The most astonishing thing about this movie to me is how fast I forgot the entire experience.I kinda remember that cool opening scene with Groot - but after that? Guardians of the Galaxy 2 moves from one action scene to the next with a bunch of random banter about an extended family... which is completely contradicted in the final 15 minutes.I also remember a bunch of absurd happenings during the action scenes. Improbable results, luck, weird environments that do not follow any known physics and characters screaming at one another over the ambient sound.To paraphrase someones wisdom - the script wasn't the result of time, hard work, skill and craftsmanship. Things happen on the screen because the screen writers say so. This is what many superhero films have become: glorified CG cartoons that feel like really long TV episodes.Ironic too - in an age of great TV writing, many blockbuster movies have been reduced to mass world wide appeal instead of any unique writer/director vision.I really didn't like this movie 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Review,"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: 25/04/2017 GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2Last night I made an impulse decision to book myself a ticket at the cinema to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 and I'm thankful I decided to do so. Last night's particular session had quite a few online bookings and as always there was along queue full of people on the night. I got in early (as usual) to guarantee a premium position for such a movie. Movies that I am willing to pre-book need to be viewed in the best seating or the overall experience and satisfaction will be hindered.Like with any movie that is associated with Marvel Studios, comes its inherited ""hype"" and ""excitement"" with this film being no different. Director James Gunn has really made a name for himself directing the previous Guardians of the Galaxy and a confirmed sequel to this year's second iteration. His cinematic career does not have a large array of successful movies by his name but the Guardians of the Galaxy movies remain the pinnacle of Gunn's directing career and that is nothing to be ashamed of (they're great movies!)I cannot lie, based off the movie trailer and my experience with the first film I was expecting Gunn and Marvel Studios to follow suite with a fun, humour filled experience and it did just that. From the very outset we were provided a little bit more on the history of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and exactly how he came about his existence. The first film I felt deliberately hid from the fact he was only half human, not informing the public to his other heritage. It felt great to finally uncover the mystery and secrets behind Quill's upbringing and rightful ""biological"" father.Immediately after that opening scene we are thrusted straight into a familiar line-up and setting with fellow Guardians: Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and (Vin Diesel) Baby Groot joining Quill in tackling an inter-dimensional being, as their duty. Accompanied by some soothing and scene setting 80's music the battle takes place, but the focus not on the fight but rather refreshing the viewers on the character's relationships and chemistry.Throughout the movie we are re-acquainted with Nebula (Karen Gillan) and Yondu (Michael Rooker) and may I say I'm so glad that in GOTG2 they were given more screen time and backstory, absolutely loved their characters in the first film. We are also greeted by cameo appearances from Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone that add to the prestige and class of this movie. Director Gunn chose to include explaining the complex relationship that transpired between sisters Gamora and Nebula; foreshadowing a larger turn of events in Avengers: Infinity War (2018) perhaps? Time will tell all, but nonetheless I appreciated that it was explained in more detail.The fun factor and humour; because there was a lot of it was included definitely at the right times. Drax and Mantis (played by Marvel newcomer Pom Klementieff) had a playful connection at trying to understand one another and as always Rocket and Quill clashing with one another made for good viewing. Baby Groot's adorable inclusion meant for many scenes showcasing exactly how innocent and cute saving the galaxy can be and Marvel did well at portraying Groot in such a light. After the movie reached its conclusion it was so disappointing seeing so many ""fans"" walking out upon the beginning of the credits! Almost as if they hadn't realized this was a Marvel movie which, appreciates their post-production scenes and there were a massive 5 in this movie! That's right folks, 5 different scenes and one very interesting in particular setting the scene for the next installment. My only surprise was no visual mention of infamous destroyer, Thanos (Josh Brolin) although there were many verbal exchanges featuring the character.Do I think this movie will go on to win awards and accolades? I think so. Do I think this movie was an awesome and appropriate sequel to the first? Absolutely!Therefore my score for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a:9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"The Autistic Reviewers have been waiting for this movie to come out for ages now. The biggest question is: Was it worth the wait? You bet it was! ""Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage."" It picks exactly where the last one left off. The moment the film starts off you know you are in for the ride of your life. The intro is easily one of the most memorable, hilarious and action packed things you'll see in a superhero movie. The sequel never loses its touch with the humor the first one provided. It also had really nice touches of emotion/sadness to it. it's also filled with twists and turns that you'll never see coming.All the cast from the first one return. We have brand new characters in the movie such as Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Stakar Ogord (Sylvester Stallone), Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), and Ego (Kurt Russel). Kurt Russel really steals a lot of the show as soon as he is on screen. What's surprising is Yondu. He has way more screen time in this one than he does in the first one. Michael Rooker plays him so well. But once again it's Rocket (Bradley Cooper) who gets most of the humor in this one.It's action packed, it's never boring, it's hilarious and it's very emotional in loads of scenes with loads of twists and turns. What's not to love? Jay gives this 4.5/5 where as Nick gives this a 5/5 stars. Really check us out on facebook or Instagram! The Autistic Reviewers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
You can't beat a bit of ELO,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun sequel that builds on the first film. I was drawn in from the title sequence as Baby Groot dances to Mr Blue Sky as behind him a monster fight takes place.The focus is on Star Lord meeting his celestial father, Ego (Kurt Russell) living in his own planet and with a name like Ego you can immediately sense trouble.Yet we also have character development as well, the relationship between Star Lord and Gamora intensifies but we also see it develop between the warring sisters as Nebula turns up wanting sibling blood.We are also shone more light between Yondu and Star Lord, Yondu was supposed to deliver the infant Peter Quill to Ego but kept him for himself as he was small and thin, useful for some thieving. In fact Yondu gets the most character development here.Drax also gets to shine with more comical interludes with Rocket and new character Mantis. Baby Groot is fun as comic relief.The film soundtrack works in the context of the film with songs like Father and son (Cat Stevens) and The Chain (Fleetwood Mac.) There are even cameos from Sylvester Stallone and David Hasselhoff.Visually the film looks great, it is very much a knockabout adventure than a superhero film without being bloated or self indulgent as some of the Pirates of the Caribbean sequels. It does have a thin story but is still an entertaining movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Loved the First one, this one...not so much.  Disappointing","They could have gone so many different directions with this movie, but they picked probably the WORST Plot line to follow.Great Tunes though. I mean, ""Brandy""? What an awesome, almost forgotten tune of the 70's. I had it on Cassette and I have it on DVD as well as USB Memory.They had Kurt Russell and used him so wrongly it may be his worst Film yet. Sly Stallone and they use him like a Retarded Judge Dredd type character personality. At the end credits, I am pretty sure I heard Hannah Montana's (Godawful Miley Cirus's) voice. If they want to destroy the next movie, go ahead and put ""Twerk n' Tard in it.They did expand on Drax's Humor, that was good. And who doesn't love the Trash Panda, Rocket Racoon when he is Full Blown Sarcastic. I can't even tell Vin and Cooper are doing Baby Groot and Rocket's voices.I do question putting Megababe, Pom Klementieff, in all that make-up so you can't even see her total Hotness.So, overall I give this movie a 6 and I feel I am being more than generous with that rating given all they COULD HAVE DONE with this movie, versus, what they ACTUALLY DID. With the wait and they hype, this movie was just nearly a complete letdown. And the Ending??? That Royally Sucked. If you saw the movie, you know what I mean, if you haven't, you will see what I mean.Sorry, but the best part of this movie is the Music.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"The MCU suffers a case of ""sequel-itis""","In 1997's Scream 2, movie buff Randy Meeks spelled out the ""rules"" for a sequel. While he was specifically talking about horror movies, the basic principles of these rules could easily be applied to other genres. More characters, more action pieces, higher stakes, and some kind of added wrinkle to the expected story.And what do most sequels from that era also seem to have in common? A lot of them were not well received by audiences. ""Sequels suck"" has been a popular school of thought for as long as I can remember. These days, the popularity of sequels has started trending upwards, but sometimes we still get one that follows the same old rules.Thus, we get Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.That story starts with the Guardians – Peter Quill / Starlord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) – as mercenaries for hire. After doing a job for a race of people called The Sovereign, the Guardians find themselves in trouble when Rocket steals from The Sovereign. After a chase scene straight out of The Empire Strikes Back, the Guardians – now with Nebula (Karen Gillan) in tow – find themselves stranded while Rocket makes repairs to their ship. This is where Peter's father, Ego (Kurt Russel) and his assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff) finally catch up with the Guardians. Ego whisks Peter, Drax, and Gamora away so Peter can learn of his true lineage. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) has been disgraced by The Ravagers, and accepts a job from Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), head of The Sovereign to track down the Guardians and bring them to justice.As for the stakes the Guardians are up against this time, it was always going to be difficult to top the Infinity Stone story from the last movie, and it first it doesn't look like they're going to. The majority of Vol. 2 feels like a smaller and more personal story (which, keeping in mind that I haven't seen Iron Fist yet, Marvel seems to have found decent success with on their Netflix shows), but later turns out to have ramifications for the whole galaxy. I'd have preferred it if they had kept it small and focused on the family the Guardians are becoming. Especially given that the final battle scene feels overly long and drawn out for no particular reason. Not only that, but the Sovereign are among Marvel's worst villains. They're not evil, they're just pompous douchebags who only go after the Guardians because Rocket stole from them.That's actually quite a shame, as the rest of the battle scenes are a lot of fun. Peter's music collection again provides the backdrop, and there's something whimsical about seeing explosions and bodies falling while you're listening to some classic pop music from the '70s and '80s. The best of these is perhaps a scene where Yondu effortlessly takes out a number of mooks with a flying arrow that he seems to control by whistling.While all the Guardians – except Groot – get some great character moments here, the focus is really on Peter, Gamora, and the new additions to the team. Mantis was an absolute delight, and her budding relationship with Drax is something that deserves a lot more screen time come Vol. 3. Karen Gillan gives perhaps the movie's best performance as Nebula, who is dealing with issues from her childhood thanks to her relationships with Thanos and Gamora. I spent the movie hoping she'd find the peace she was looking for, but knowing that if she did, it wasn't going to come in the way she clearly wanted it to.The weak link in the acting, surprisingly, is Kurt Russel. Ego's entire story gives him a whole range of emotions to go through, and Russel just doesn't convince me on any of it. From a man I know is capable of so much better, this felt like him just cashing a paycheck.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a fun movie, overall, and if that's all you're looking for from it – if all you want is an amusing space adventure with characters you (mostly) already know, with some great action and musical sequences – then you're probably going to have a great time with this movie. But if you were hoping it would recapture the magic of the first movie, or show a little something more, you'll probably come out feeling somewhat disappointed.For my full review of this and other movies, visit my website at theblogfather.co.nz",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Effect bonanza with lack of direction,"The first film was a massive surprise when it launched, even the actors were unsure of how the movie would be received, and feared it was going to be marvels first real flop in the new age of superhero movies.But as we all know, it wasn't a flop, it was a surprisingly entertaining and fun film that was so easy to fall in love with. The characters, the universe, the effects, the story, it was all good.Personally i have seen more or less every single American superhero movie that has ever been made, with a few exceptions here and there, but hard to say which movies i might have missed, i even saw ""The Phantom"" and ""The Masters of the universe"" when they released back in the day.But just to clear something up here and now. Those two films i just mentioned, is not among what i call good films. What i consider to be some the best superhero films made to this date is (not in any particular order) Batman (1989), Batman Begins (2005), The Dark Knight (2008), Superman (1978), X-men (2001), Logan (2017), The Avengers (2012), Deadpool (2015), Spiderman 2 (2004), The incredibles (2004). Guardians of The Galaxy (2014).There are more, i just don't want to use up all my 1000 words here listing movies i like. It's just for reference.Anyways. Guardians of the galaxy 2 is not on my list of best superhero movies of all time I'm afraid, no matter how adorable baby groot is, it simply wasn't enough. This movie is a pure effect bonanza from start to finish, and it looks absolutely gorgeous, no doubt about that. The pacing isn't too bad either, the music score is amazing. But...Yes, *sigh*. The movie lacks direction. It is sort of a mess, and i have to be one of the bringers of bad news, but the movie isn't bad though, it just didn't live up to it's predecessor. It wouldn't be the first time in history that ever happened, but still.Except for the main villain, this movie is basically almost the same as the first film, not much new to see here to be honest. It feels recirculated, like the writers just thought: Oh hey, they like the first film, let's just give them more of that.Some times, this tactic works, if you write it correctly, and add enough new stuff go along with it. But they almost fell in the ""The Force Awakens"" trap here.The big laughs are far apart, most of the jokes are just mildly ""gigglingy"" (new word *patent pending*), and the movie suffers because of it. But there are some moments in the film that are truly awesome and lifts the spirits, as it can become dull at times. Incredible actually, when you think of how much is going on in this film, at any given moment.Kurt Russel is one of those ""awesome things"". He is the one that lifts this movie up a nudge, his performance and presence makes all the difference in this film. And if you are a Kurt Russel fan like me, well this movie is a lot more easy to enjoy. Snake Plissken never let's me down ^^Anyways, if you are just going to hang out with some friends and just enjoy some laughs and watch some CGI extravaganza on display, this movie has you covered for the most part.

"From a non comic book readers perspective: fine, not great","Whilst I enjoyed my self plenty, busting out laughing at many points during the movie, something felt off when it came to a close. Whereas the first movie captured lightning in a bottle, delivering great, original (to most) characters, in a bright, colourful and most importantly funny sci-fi fantasy; the second feels less fresh and suffers from what I call ""Marvel scope creep"".What do I mean by that? It feels way more ""comic book""-y this time, forcing itself to integrate with the Marvel Cinematic Universe in ways that feels inorganic and downright puzzling. Having a detailed universe to draw upon is great when it can add texture and make the stories feel like they are supported by a living breathing world. Star Wars of course being the prime example here.But having the climax of the movie give significant screen time to characters that have never been introduced, or a seemingly major character arc and plot inferred to by two lines of dialogue earlier, is downright puzzling. Who are these people and why should we care? I can imagine comic book readers or even viewers of the billion plus Marvel movies getting a kick out of seeing quartzface or whatever get a short cameo. But this is literally the ending of the movie and we get more combined reaction time from bit players than our main characters. Bizarre and off putting.There are no surprises, and posters having already revealed well in advance which previous antagonists would end up joining our heroes, or who Quills father would be and his alignment, so that tension is well out the window. Even the Awesome Mix vol 2 seemed to have spent all its best tunes on the first one.I'm sure this all sounds like I'm too down on the movie, but I am not. I still had a great time whizzing through space with this motley crew. It is as funny as ever (even though the best jokes were in the trailer), trippy and downright beautiful to watch.

"Good, maybe even great, but doesn't live up to the first.","When going to watch Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 the main thing I was looking for was to have fun, and on that account this film sure does deliver. The characters we know and love are still just as great and a couple of new people are introduced too. However, Gamora is still the most boring character out of the Guardians, and unfortunately, Drax doesn't really do a lot except tell jokes, which are very funny admittedly. Baby Groot makes up for this and is great, if not just a little worse than the last incarnation of him we saw in the last movie. Once again the villain is not great, but he is better than Ronan in the last movie. The real flaw with this movie is that it simply isn't as good as the first one. Number 1 captured lightning in a bottle and this one attempts that and comes pretty close, but in the end, doesn't. This does not make it a bad film, however. It is still hilarious, action packed and a great deal of fun improving on some elements of the original and I recommend it to any fans of Guardians of the Galaxy.

"""It's Still Groot."" Infant or not!","The visually stunning follow-up to Guardians of the Galaxy, has the same spark of cosmic brilliance that shone when we were first introduced to everyone's favourite, dysfunctional group of space misfits.If there's one truism in comic-book movie-making, it's that giant superhero team-ups are almost always sure-fire hits. (And then there's, ahem, crap like Fantastic Fours). What's less true is that superhero team-up sequels will have the same good fortune. All the right ingredients can be there—good cast, same director, bomb-ass CGI—and for whatever reason, the movie just doesn't ascend as high as its predecessor. Such is the rare case with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.Like any good mix-tape, James Gunn serves up a steady vibe. But as long as we're talking mix-tapes, think back to the first mix-tape your crush gave you. You remember the songs, the sequence, even the smell of the air wherever you listened to it. Now, quick: What was on the second mix-tape they made you? You remember some of it, but chances are you're having a tougher time remember if the opening track was by Steely Dan or Stevie Nicks. Or, y'know, any non-1978 equivalent. But GOTG2 ain't one of those. You're most likely to remember at least some of it quite easily. (Hopefully).To say the least: If you like superhero flirting, bonding, and not- too-graphic dick jokes, it's a hoot. There might even be a tearjerker or two. But if you're hoping for something radically different from the first Guardians, you might be disappointed.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is, at its very core, a story about family. Where its predecessor brought together five hilarious a- holes and helped them realise that there's more to life than stealing, revenge and running from your past, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 works to test their ties to one another only to further strengthen their bond.There are certainly flaws in the story structure and an aggressive case of trying to please fans by just recycling what worked in the first film, but at its core, Vol. 2 gives us insight into the sins of our fathers and certainly packs an emotional punch when it counts. It's loud, it's colourful, it's funny, and it's endearing. If you were a fan of the first, you're sure to enjoy the second. However, if you're looking for the greatest movie in the MCU to date, it'd be wise to level those expectations. Don't kid yourself into absolute fanatical- ridiculousness.To declare Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a beautiful film would be an understatement. Since Marvel actually did a some really good work and for the first time, bringing the new instalment loaded with some memorable goodies of visuals and stunning cinematography. However, the incredible visuals alone aren't what make Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 a worthy sequel. Building on the dynamics within the core group of characters we already know and love, introducing us to an array of new and interesting guests, plus still managing to make us all howl with laughter one minute and fight to hold back tears the next, it's clear that Gunn's 'Guardians' are far more than one-hit-wonders.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Better and Better,"Marvel characters have daddy issues; Be it Iron Man, Thor, Loki, Betsy Ross, or numerous others. Star-Lord, however, has the grandest daddy issues of all. Between Yondu, his surrogate father, and Ego, his real father, he's got his share of problems. The rest of his team have family issues as well, and director James Gunn manages to work on each of them. In the process, he deftly sidesteps the issues that have plagued previous MCU sequels, while also reminding us of the menace that is Thanos which lurks just off-screen despite not launching the plot of this film into a larger tie-in with the rest of the MCU.The movie is fun, funny, and whenever Baby Groot is around, simply adorable. The chemistry between the actors is obvious, and helps elevate the overall product even more. Gunn is already locked into continuing the series in its third installment, and Marvel would be wise to keep him and this crew together for as long as possible.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Don't take a joke too seriously,"As a fictional Marvel fan, I didn't watch the first sequel and only watched vol.2 for its 'amazing soundtrack' quote from my true Marvel fan friend. I watched it while in the air so I really got to enjoy the soundtrack companied by the blue sky. I have to admit two out of the six stars i gave is due to star-lord thinking Sam Cook is the greatest singer on earth. The rest four is given to Groot. He is too adorable to not give at least a four star for. I would recommend it because of Groot, if he doesn't fit your taste, just download the soundtrack on Spotify.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A decent sequel,Solid story with some minor flaws that has the some similar elements to the prequel. Very good acting and good dialouge. It seemed a bit darker and more emotional than the prequel. The characters have been the same since the last movie except for some development for Gamora and her sister Nebula. Overall an enjoyable sequel and a recommended watch!Memorable: No Rewatchable: Maybe.,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
8/10,"A couple of months after the events of Vol 1. the Guardians of the Galaxy have been hired by an alien population to defend their world. Despite a successful job, a disagreement between the Aliens and the Guardians puts the team in danger. That is when Ego (Kurt Russel) comes to rescue them and reveals himself as a celestial being and Peter Quill's father.Despite having every reason and possibility to fail and become a complete spectacle mess, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2."" is another gem in Marvel's crown of wonderfully diverse films and another reason for their utter mastery in the genre.Once again we have a film that despite being a gigantic, out-of-control production, it represents good cinema and respectful storytelling. As in all of their recent films, Marvel has embraced the notion of telling stories and giving artists the possibility to realize their vision. Vol 2. has its problems and, as said above, they could have made the film a complete disaster, but once again thanks to the brilliant Marvel philosophy, the film is held together by the addictive passion and heart that is embedded in these characters by James Gunn. By starting on character and emotions and by worrying about telling a heartfelt story first Marvel has just made another great piece of blockbuster cinema.The film goes in many directions, some very welcome some unwarranted. There are many story lines being developed at once, there are some inconsistencies in exposition and mythology, the molding of tones isn't always seamless, some visual and world building ideas don't really pay off the way they should: the whole film is slightly uneven and there isn't a solid balance to all of these elements. Yet, when it comes down to it, it does not matter in the overall experience exactly because of what Gunn does with these characters.He manages to infuse such heartfelt emotion in these people that the problems there might be in the structuring of plot or mythology take a second place to all of the glorious, entertaining material being presented to you. Gunn takes us on a tour de force of character archs here, everyone of them is given a dynamic that is developed throughout the whole duration of the film. The surprises hit you, every emotional beat hits its mark, every laugh delivers.There is a beautiful variety of emotions that you are taken through and it is always such a pleasure to see a director tackle both comedy and drama to these emotional heights and deliver on both effectively. There are so many relations new and old that are developed and all of them give the audience a different flavor, probably the best one remains for me the one between Gamora and Quill or Gamora and Nebula.Then to top all of the heartfelt storytelling off, Gunn spices the whole picture with an incredible variety of quirkiness, great music and stunning action sequences that almost always manage to enhance the conflict between the characters. The space battles might still be a weak point of his, but it is hard not to be taken into the seamless, amazing work of the visual effects team.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is a beautiful, touching picture filled with powerful emotions and breathtaking laughter and entertainment, one that is so good at doing what is does that it overcomes its flaws and doesn't let the spectacle overcome the heart of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Wonderful Fun, (one tiny spoiler but no plot given away)","Without giving too many spoilers (Ok there's one), I went to see Guardians Of The Galaxy 2, any movie which starts with this little fellow Baby Groot Dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Sky (there's that darn spoiler) is on to winner, it's full of great action and comedy including some aimed primarily at adults and older teenagers that had laughter roaring from the audience, it's a while since I've heard as much laughter act film. it has a great soundtrack with some surprising songs such as Southern Nights, Glen Campbell, & Fox On The Run The Sweet being just couple of them. I loved this film the time just flew over. This is fantastic family entertainment and is definitely worth a massive 10/10 for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Awesome Mix, Volume 2","When I first saw Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, I had never heard of the team before and was only watching it because I was a Marvel fan. Ironically, 3 years later Guardians is about the only MCU series I even bother keeping up with any more(not that I don't like the others, I just kind of got burnt out after 15+ films all trying to tie in). I was nervous, because what made the first film so memorable to me was how much it's quality and humor surprised me, something which I was sure Vol. 2 would try and fail to recreate, as many sequels to surprise smash hits tend to do. However, director James Gunn has surprised me once again, taking the Guardians into new territory in a film filled with top notch action, impressive visuals, and gut splitting humor in a storyline that is refreshingly original.I was worried after seeing the trailers that this would ultimately be an attempt to catch lightning twice by basically repeating the first film with new jokes. But the trailers are pretty misleading(which is always a good thing with sequels) because the plot that they reveal is really only the first act of the film, including the spoiler character reveal at the end of the last trailer. This is where the viewers I think will be polarized, because after the fairly conventional first act Vol. 2 becomes a very different film than the original. I won't go into the villains, of which the film has multiple, because it's unclear who will be the main antagonist until the plot reveals it, bringing the film's multiple threads together.Although the plot was well written, what truly makes this movie work, much like the first, is the characters. In true sequel fashion, we see the core group split up for a large portion of the film, but the side characters are so well written that it is just as enjoyable to see our team interact with them as it is when they interact with each other. It also allows each character to expand their arc rather than just playing their respective parts on the team. The humor is excellent throughout, and it seems to have gotten even more adult oriented this time around, with many hilarious, not so subtle sexual innuendos making the audience laugh out loud.All in all, if you enjoyed the first film then I cannot see how the second part could be any less entertaining to you. With top notch humor, an engaging story, and beautiful special effects, Guardians 2 provides a great escape to a pop culture savvy corner of the Galaxy that we all wish to visit again and again.P.S. if you enjoyed Michael Rooker's hilarious redneck space pirate Yondu the first time around, I'll go as far as saying he's the MVP in this installment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guarded,"(RATINGS: ☆☆☆½ out of 5 )GRADE: B-THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Not nearly as much fun as its predecessor, this film still entertains.SYNOPSIS: That dysfunctional band of lovable space fighters as they solve one problem only to uncover another.JIM'S REVIEW: There is a scene in the new chapter of Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 which has the right flippant tone that most of the film lacks. Playing to the song of Jay and the Americans' Come A Little Bit Closer, the images of combat resonate with a stylish flair and a sense of wit. This sequence is very well choreographed and cleverly done. Would that the rest of the film have that same polish. I just couldn't get remotely close to this new entry to the Marvel series, especially when comparing it to the first marvelous 2014 Marvel movie.￼This film entertains but unlike its highly enjoyable predecessor, this sequel lacks originality, inventiveness, and humor. Oh, it tries hard, but it leaves one with a feeling of bloated desperation. You really want to have that giddy feeling of joy once again, but everything this time around seems artificial and forced.The jokes repeatedly fall flat, the action is formulaic, and the plot(s) are heavy-handed. Many scenes go on far too long as the movie rambles from one misadventure on one planet to the next. All that is left is the faint reminder of camaraderie served by its capable cast and their yeoman-like contributions to their likable, if underwritten, characters.￼Fortunately for the film, the actors bring on the charm in major doses. Chris Pratt as wisecracking Peter Quill, Zoe Saldana as the tough warrior Gamora, Dave Bautista as the brutish but lovable Drax, and the fine voice-over work of Bradley Cooper as Rocket and Vin Diesel as Baby Groot reprise their misfit roles with finesse. Adding strong support are Mike Rooker, Karen Gillian, and a robust energy force in the form of Kurt Russell as Ego, Peter's long lost father.￼While James Gunn's direction is solid enough, his writing efforts are a disappointing mix. His dialogue is bereft of one-liners that zing. He tries (and mostly succeeds) adding more backstories to his characters and their dysfunctional relationships. The real problem is his script which sacrifices its more interesting sub-plots (the relationship between Peter and Gamora, Drax's new love interest, the sibling rivalry of Gamora and her sister, Rocket's rude personality issues, Baby Groot's learning curve) with the main story-line, a dull routine father- son conflict.Technically, some of his visuals are poorly executed. For a big budget blockbuster, the CGI is uneven. The characters of Rocket and particularly, Baby Groot are spot-on, Yet, the production design on most planets use of matte backdrops are far from authentic looking, lacking depth and details. Especially obvious in its ineptitude is Ego's world, showcasing a garish Jeff Poons vibe.￼Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 will entertain its loyal audience, but already the franchise is losing its comic focus. This installment keeps the action moving, but it rarely catches its breath as it huffs and puffs its way to its conclusion. Well, let me re-phrase that...until its next chapter. Yes moviegoers, Vol. 3 will be coming to a theater near you very soon...let's hope that chapter breaks out of its own comfort zone as it explores the ever-changing universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
James Gunn has done it again!,"Guardians of the galaxy volume 2 is a great and fantastic movie, James Gunn once again delivers a great movie.The reason I give it 8 stars instead of 10 is because you don't really know what turn the movie is going to take until the second act.

Not as good as the first but still very enjoyable,"Yeah, I said what I had to say in the subject line. I have a question about this movie. After the Guardians ship crash lands on Berhart, (prob spelling that wrong) Quill and Gamora have a private talk with one another where Gamora brings up the David Hasselhoff story that Quill told her someone before when he was drunk. The two were by themselves with nobody around at all. HOWEVER, later on in the movie when Quill realizes that Ego killed his Mother and knows what Ego's plan is, he attacks Ego. When Ego recovers, he changes his ""human form"" to David Hasselhoff. How the hell did he know to change himself to look like the Hoff!?!?!? This means that he somehow heard the private conversation between Quill and Gamora or just blindly guessed; and I HIGHLY DOUBT that Ego just guessed that. It's a small nit-pick but it does kinda bother me lol. Btw, does anybody have an explanation for this???Also, when Quill, Gamora and Drax are about to go with Ego and Mantis to his planet (aka himself? lol) Rocket is seen spraying the wreckage of the ship with this gun looking thing and the all the wires and metal are just randomly reappearing! Rocket is creating matter out of NOTHING! WTF is that!?!?!? That's insane! Am I the ONLY one fascinated with this???... and the fact that he only uses it the one time and for nothing else is a waste. Can it just repair machinery that wad already there or can he just make any kind of machinery just randomly show up or off thin air??? I believe that even Tony Stark and Dr. Strange would be impressed with that technology/magic! Would that be considered tech or would that be magic? lol... idk but either way it's an impressive gadget that we see Rocket using for only a handful of seconds and then it disappears FOREVER! lol",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Keep your ears wide open, you won't wanna miss a beat!","With the second installment into the inter-galactic world of the marvel universe we had already come to love from the first Guardians of the Galaxy, James Gunn proves himself wisely in his second approach, meeting as much anticipation as the fans of the world had expected. James Gunn takes us on a thrilling action adventure that is as humorous as it is exciting. You should approach the film expecting to be constantly laughing through almost every, if not every single scene. And you will also be surprised not to come short on the more alternate of emotions as well, as this turns into one of Marvels most emotionally breathtaking films to date. This riveting sequel is not one to leave it's fans walking out of the cinema with their heads hanging down in disappointment. But rather left glued to their seats wanting more, even after the commencement of the five post-credit scenes.The films highs:-Provided as much retro beats dominated action sequences we all once again hoped for, after such success from the first films feel worthy approach.-Brought us countless laughs and non-stop humor throughout the films entire run.-Great character development proved significant to the story lines success.-Turned an action comedy into a nightmare thriller in a matter of a few suspenseful sequences.
 
-Feels us with sympathy and countless emotion for the characters.
 
-The climax proved exceptional and will please much fans, as James Gunn forces us to feel apart of the Guardians family he has remarkably transferred from page to screen.-Phenomenal acting all around. Especially Chris Pratt as usual. Also a great performance from Kurt Russel, sending us many suspenseful thrills in the process. And don't forget the rest of the main cast in Zoe, Dave, Bradley, Michael and Vin, as there'd be no proper Guardians of the Galaxy without them.-Oh, and once again...awesome soundtrack! (Kudos to Tyler Bates on his fine work).The films lows:-Apart from the humorously action-packed, giggle worthy introduction from our little dear friend Baby Groot...The film takes on a bit of a slow start in terms of pace. Too much talking, and conversations going for slightly longer than expected, just hurt the movies initial opening feel. -A few small editing woes that can slightly annoy high standard movie analyzers.-Too much CGI at times when it wasn't needed. Don't get me wrong, the film has one of the finest computer-generated graphics universes ever. But some scenes just went a little over board in terms of laziness, as even some couches were left to be decorated and stylized by the art of technology. Still awesome work though.I hope my review has further influenced you to go into the screening with high hopes. As on behalf of James Gunn, I promise you'll rather glue yourself to the theater seat with a head held high from an overwhelmingly enjoying experience, than leave with a head held low from a poor one.My official rating: 7.9/10Thanks for reading and I hope I helped, Peace out!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"As expected, GoTG vol. 2 is entertainment central.","The team are back and, as expected, there is no shortage in confidence or creativity. James Gunn knows how to enthral his audience. He shoots for fun and delivers it with style. It's structure fumbles, but collectively, is pretty unconventional. Which for a blockbuster is always a welcome.Where the 'Space Avengers' are lacking this time around, is in it's humour and it's character's emotional arks/developments, that made the first so heart warming. There are plenty of laughs, don't be fooled. The best come from the always dependable Rocket and Groot relationship. With Yondu of all characters, playing a part in the duo's (and perhaps the movies) biggest laugh. However, many jokes just don't land. It doesn't stifle the fun, but you may wish for a few more fresher yuks in the script.Along side that are the character motivations, which are often unconvincing and sometimes, unearned. One too many, sentimental back-story beats, that feel forced more than poignant, lower the drama. There's nothing here to match Quills relationship with his mother's final gift.Nevertheless. The team are a delight to watch, all involved are clearly having a blast (allowing us to have a blast with them) and with vol. 3 in the cards, this could prove to be one of the Marvel franchise's best trilogies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Despite that, there's still some good chemistry between the characters and some good acting to be found here. The film could have been a lot worse.

The characters we love are all back, plus some new characters who offer some great casting surprises.

The special effects sometimes were the usual Hollywood over-the-top, but overall they didn't detract from the movie. And, as usual, Stan Lee's cameo was hilarious.The story itself could have been unassuming and so-so, but the addition of truly emotional and ""get's ya' right here"" moments upped the ante, making the entire movie all the better. Even Baby Groot, whom I expected to be too kitschy and cliché (*cough* JarJar *cough*) was a great addition.

"A thoroughly delightful sequel, cunningly light on the plot renovation but wigged out in brimful hilarity and brainwaves","All psyched up to the forthcoming AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, there is some missing link for this reviewer to catch up on, James Gunn's Vol.2 of GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, the most retro-kaleidoscopic, and least geocentric Marvel enterprise, is a tremendously gladsome popcorn escapade amped up its predecessor's winning formula.The grand design is Peter Quill aka. Star-Lord (Pratt, whose less tested dramatic aptitude catches up with him when the crunch arrives, pales into playacting compared to Robert Downey Jr., with whom he shares a similar rakish flair in the MCU) to discover his demi-god (with a minuscule ""g"" for the sake of humility) origin and comes to terms with his ""daddy issues"" heightened by a doughty bereavement, thankfully, the rest of the pack is exuberantly driven by rah-rah and esprit de corps, the plot cunningly divvies up some unfinished/new business for them to resolve: the flickering romance between Peter and Gamora (Saldanna); Nebula (Gillan) and Gamora's sibling conciliation; Drax the Destroyer (Bautista)'s bantering with a new member Mantis (Klementieff), a maladroit alien empath; Rocket (voiced by Cooper) gangs up with an unexpected ally, Yondu Udonta (Rooker), exiled by the Ravagers league, experiencing a foes-to-friends rapport, among others.The most thankless designation is as always, its antagonist, which falls on the shoulders of Kurt Russell's Ego, the living planet, an idea ingeniously derived from the Boltzmann brain, who is Peter's biological father, but his transcendence cannot mask the egocentric, self-centered, callous timber befitting a lonesome demiurge, imperiled by immortality and a dearth of empathy, and some infelicity (why slipping up the real cause of death of Peter's mother when you try so eager to get him on board?).A new eclectic compilation mixtape of vintage hits is par for the course, and is set into motion to garnish the action set pieces right from its ingenious opening, which leaves the monster-battling cliché in the periphery and allows a capering Baby Groot (voiced by Diesel) to melt our hearts instead; a mid-point highlight comes with Yondu's dazzling whistle-arrow massacre, which splendidly wields its visual élan to tone down the scene's grimness; and in the end, it is in the company of Cat Stevens' FATHER AND SON, that the film reaches its emotional crescendo of both sadness and elation, Rooker is terrific in Yondo's hard-earned send-off.A thoroughly delightful sequel, cunningly light on the plot renovation but wigged out in brimful hilarity and brainwaves, consolidates James Dunn's resolution of doing something dissimilar from other more earthbound MCU juggernauts and prior space opera paragons, a franchise finally merits its fanboy's hot-to-trot anticipation.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Humorous moments with many laugh out loud scenes. Drax has a more active role, which I enjoyed. Baby Groot was a highlight as most would expect. The whole story seemed to answer many questions from the first movie. The first movie made them a family and this one showed what a family has to go through. The script and cast did a great job with entertaining the audience. Usually, when the audience is leaving with smiles, laughter and feeling entertained, you figure they enjoyed themselves and it was money well spent to sit through the movie. Stay through the credits to the very end cause it is well worth it. The movie was great and you didn't wish it to end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I Watched GOTG Vol. 2 For More than 3x,"I'm a bad cinema goer. No matter how good a movie is, I would doze off. I dunno.But for the first time, after so many good movies this year, I didn't fall asleep nor I looked forward to the ending with Guardians Vol. 2.No, that's not because I so love Baby Groot with all his tantrums and 3- word dialogues; it's probably because the movie is entertaining from that first scene with Kurt Russel looking like a dashing 35-year old, up to the epic post-credit scenes.What makes Guardian Vol 2 that entertaining? Was it the storyline? The plot? The new enigmatic characters such as Mantis and what's that villain name? Taserface? I like him, too. He's such a character.I love the overall choreography of action, well-timed comedy, necessary soap-ish drama, the mention of David Hasselhoff (har-har- har) and metaphoric lines (""... I dunno why they're chasing us. This is such a mystery..."") that would leave anyone's laughing their brains out.And for those reasons alone, I'm gonna watch GOTG again for the 4th, 5th, 6th time or probably until the cinemas here don't show it anymore...",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Goofy, entertaining, lacks power in the ending.","There are writer's guidelines against stating your score in the body of your review, but given the Imdb's inflexibility, I have to say that Guardians 2 is possibly the most 6.5 out of 10 movie I've ever watched.I remember how I thought the ending to first Guardians movie had unrealistic physics. I was so young and innocent back then. Guardians of the Galaxy 2 lets you know right away that it throws the physics out of the window, which frees you from having to worry about the pesky things like realism and this creative choice appears to have been the right one.In combination with an overwhelming amount of colourful CGI, the flexible physics at times makes you feel like you're watching a Shrek movie, and it was not annoying like I would've expected it to, because it was basically a cartoon at that point.Compared to the first movie, the sequel turns the goofiness knob all the way to the right, and with it, becomes funnier. This movie is a comedy above anything else and that's where it shines. All you need is a few fun characters played well, just doing their shtick.Perhaps the most notable thing about the movie is that it doesn't have a strong central storyline. There is a main villain, but he and his plan do not really enter the movie until about the halfway point. Instead, this movie has 4 or 5 stories and themes running through it, almost side by side, which somehow does not feel disjointed.Unfortunately, the film went downhill for me in the second half, as prolonged action sequences were making increasingly less sense, and the humour was replaced by conflict and forced drama. There are a few very creative scenes, but their creativity is isolated. They don't feel necessary in the context of the main narrative. They look like a pretty music video that exists to look cool.Also, something I always consider when watching such movies is how will it age 10 years from now, when the quality of CGI gets much better. The costumes and character designs are nice, but they are drowned out by all the fake explosions and monsters.In short, this movie is at its strongest in its middle section, when it is just having fun and doesn't think too hard about anything. The last third of the movie starts losing momentum and entertainment value.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Remix,"While obviously not as fresh as the first movie, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 tries to expand and deepen all characters and their relationships. In general, everything that made the first movie great is even stronger here. Bigger and better action, evolving characters and over the top production. Jokes are still effective but if you just watched chapter one they will start feeling kind of repetitive.The plot and stupid villains were the biggest flaws of the previous entry, but things are getting better this time. The overall development is predictable and again there are still a couple of things happening just for the sake of it without a real reason, but it's a big step forward at least. The fact it has little ties to the MCU also helps to create something free from the usual themes and characters (it seems a lot of people did not appreciate that though). This movie is called ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Remix"" in Japan, and it kind of makes sense considering that it improves everything from the first movie without adding much new.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Better Than The First GOTG!!!,"I have to admit that I really liked, but did not LOVE the first Guardians of the Galaxy film, so when I entered the local cineplex to check out Volume 2, I had lowered my expectations, figuring I'd find a film that was filled with ""sequel-itis"" and be just a step down from the previous film.Boy...was I wrong.I LOVED GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY, VOLUME 2.  This sequel succeeded in doing what a good sequel needs to do - take the premise, feel, characters and style of the first film and build on it.And build on it, it does.  Director James Gunn states that the first Guardians was about ""a family coming together"", and the 2nd movie is about ""a family staying together"" - and this is a family I want around and staying together.Starting with the ""core 5"" - StarLord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldona), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel).  These are all welcome characters that grow from the first movie to the 2nd, each with a purpose in this film and with something important to do.  I enjoyed seeing them all again.  Special notice should be paid to Bautista, who's Drax left me somewhat cold in the first film.  Here he is a delight.  Add to this returning characters Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Nebula (Karen Gillan) as well as newcomers Mantis (Pom Klementieff),  Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) and Ego (Kurt Russell) and you have an ensemble that is easy and fun to watch.At some point in the film, I thought to myself ""now, THIS is a comic book film!"" and I think it is because of the action and the visuals.  The action moves fast and furious all the while populating a Universe (literally) that is eye-popping and interesting to watch.  Director Gunn keeps things moving along, never staying too long in one place whilst avoiding the shaky-cam action.  I always knew where I was in an action scene, what the characters are working on or for and what the outcomes might be.  It is a refreshing change from the disorienting ""shaky-cam"" that the Bourne movies have wrought.And, of course, nothing can top the soundtrack.  The first film's ""Awesome Mix"" was a strong, joyous part of that movie.  ""Awesome Mix, Vol. 2"" picks right up where the first one left off.  The songs picked for this film did not disappoint.Nor did much of this film.  I enjoyed myself - and the antics of this gang - from start to finish, including the 5(!) extra scenes in the credits.Letter Grade:  A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The sequel we've been looking for,"Of course the first one came completely from out of nowhere. Well not in a sense that no one knew the movie was being made or came out in the cinema. But no one expected anything from it. And it became this larger than life thing. With characters so well written and with just enough swagger and good dialog/one-liners, it's almost crazy that no one expected this would be great.So now it is expected, so how does it fair? Pretty good I'd say. We have established the characters, we know their traits and we can have fun. Even with conventions in general, breaking fourth walls and all (when it comes to love relationships for example). Of course if you haven't seen the first one, you may have issues with the movie. I've seen a couple of reviews where it was clear, they hadn't seen the first one. And while I do think this does work as a standalone, I'd say it may be risky when it comes to you liking this or not.The humor is there though and as we come to understand in the Marvel Universe, there are added scenes in and after the credits. Five in total to be exact! So sit back and enjoy them - if you had a good time watching the movie that is.

Star lord makes a lot of pop cultural references and even the ending has something to do with a classic arcade game character.This movie has more drama and character development and that too mostly focusing on yondu and nebula.

Our every year ritualistic going-to-the-theater-to-watch-a Marvel-movie finally begins.,"I feel like a drone. Every year Marvel comes out with its new set of movies and every year like drones we all go out to see them. And for this reason Marvel makes tons of $$$ without any quality improvement or originality, because as drones, we all just gobble it up. It's like we have been given a command: ""This year you will see the following movies and not hold them to any standard, kapeesh!!""Marvel movie story lines have been declining while at the same time special effects and better actors getting hired has been increasing. Like how winning an Oscar now lands you a role in a super hero/big budget production rather than another artistic role: Brie Larson in Captain Marvel (and the horrible Kong), Lupita Nyong'o in Star Wars (ok, that's not Marvel, but still a huge franchise.), Jared Leto as the Joker (DC, I know), but you get the picture. This creates a conundrum in our heads: good acting, great special effects, bad story writing, so, hmmmm.......does this mean that I liked it? Should I go with the flow and say I liked it, because critics aren't gonna diss a movie that's sure to make $$$ and I don't wanna seem like a killjoy or shame myself in front of my firends? You know, I'll see the next Marvel movie and then decide.And so this year, the cycle begins with us giving our money to Guardians of the Galaxy V2. Expect nothing more than what the trailer has to offer. Or see the first one again and it'll be the same as seeing V2, you'll just save money. The story does advance with Kurt Russell starring as Starlord's dad. Kind of a rehash of ""No/Luke....I am your father."" It's good when they hire good actors. Make-up and special effects are great. But in all, I wouldn't use the words ""enjoyable"" or ""exciting."" I'll just say, ""Ritual completed, onto the next superhero movie.""Hey I'm a victim here nonetheless. I'm not criticizing people for seeing Guardians, as I also did, but I'm getting to get critical of us who every year, dish out our money for these superhero movies, which are in fact not becoming any better in quality, and studio execs thinking that they are creating masterpieces because of the gross $$$, hence thereforth making no extra effort to make a better movie.So see it, or stay at home and stare at the wall...it's up to you.

Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2,"Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2, directed, once again, by James Gunn, wasn't quite the breath of fresh air the first installment was, but it still packed a nice punch! James Gunn brings back his unorthodox style to this film, not paying off as well as the first, but still stands out as one of the better films of the MCU. I enjoyed Gunn's approach, by making this a grounded, character driven sequel, while also keeping the first addition in continuity, but by doing that, he created one too many subplots, leaving some things a little underdeveloped and choppy. Gunn utilized the same tones as the first film, while also recharging that emotional tone, but he seemed to try to throw in an extra dose of humor, and it threw the tones off in most occasions. One issue this film had that the first film didn't, was it's pace. For almost the entire first act, it was tough to see where things were going; it just felt like another Guardians film. When the second act hits, that's when it slows down, but we get great layers to all of our main characters. When the final act hits, that's where it starts to feel like a Marvel film, having big action sequences, and great chemistry between the characters.One of the best things that James Gunn did for this film, was not only flesh out all of the characters, but give them such a grounded tone, being able to mesh with the other Avengers seamlessly. With this film being centered around Chris Pratt as Peter Quill, again, we were able to dig deeper into his back story, and discover a lot of great layers to his character. He had so much to do, carrying the load on his shoulders, leaving him with the best character arch of the film. Zoe Sladana returns as Gamora, and she absolutely kills it this time! With her character being involved with a drastic plot point, it left her character to be fleshed out more, while becoming more grounded than before. Karen Gillan as Nebula got a lot more to do this time around, really giving herself, and Gamora the extra excitement and importance they both needed. We really didn't get too much more on Drax, played by Dave Bautista, but every time that man opens his mouth, it's comedy gold! With the nice addition of Mantis, played by Pom Klementieff, it helped flesh his character out, subtly. Michael Rooker as Yondu, is the MAN! He gets so much more to do this time around, fleshing his character out nicely. His character is just so well written, allowing for great character moments. With Groot being pushed to the side, it allowed for Rocket Racoon, played by Bradley Cooper, to gain a tremendous bond with Yondu. The banter between these two characters was absolutely gut-busting! Rocket also has one of the better character archs of the film, fleshing his character out more, while keeping that charm everyone loves. I'm a fan of Kurt Russell, and I really liked him in the MCU, but the writters didn't give him enough space to breath, and be Kurt Russell. Even though he has one of the best back stories for a villain, while also posing a real threat, his character development was predictable. If James Gunn let him do his thing, I feel as if this film could've benefited from that Kurt Russell charisma. The issue this film had, it tried too incorporate too many villains, making everyone underdeveloped, and a waste of potential.Guardians 2 didn't rely on the action like the first film, but the few times it's there, it's super exciting, well shot, and backed up with immaculate effects. This is one of the MCU's best looking films.You didn't think that they would make a sequel and not absolutely kill it on the soundtrack again, did you? James Gunn and Tyler Bates came together once more to create another amazing soundtrack, that enhanced the emotion and tention in each scene.Overall, even though James Gunn ran into a few more issues than the first, he still managed to create a real fun experience!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

An alright sequel to the amazing first movie,"After a second watch of guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 I have to say my score I previously gave it has lowered and I have to say this movie is just alright and probably one of my least favorite marvel movies. There is a lot of problems with this movie but the biggest is that the guardians of the galaxy split up for most of the movie which easily weakens most of the movie. What worked most about the first movie was the whole team working together as a team and in this movie that happens at the beginning and the end of the movie and in my opinion those are the best parts of the movie, Yes there is enjoyment to be had in the middle of the movie but that is for only one story which is yondu rocket and baby groot's story but the rest of the stories are just not interesting sadly. But there is still some enjoyment to be had in this movie and the cast all once again give a great performance as there characters and the villain is pretty good and interesting. Overall, guardians of the galaxy 2 is probably a movie I'll never watch again unless if I'm doing an MCU marathon, yes this movie isn't the worst but it's not amazing either.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Disappointment of the year,"The first Guardians was great. It was unexpected, fresh, funny, with exciting characters and a decent story. For the sequel they kept the characters, but the jokes were forced (I only had a few laughs), the characters, although they were the same, became much less likable, and there was hardly any story. It was boring, and after the first hour or so, I was eagerly waiting for the movie to end. While in the first film the old school music was a clever tool to create a unique atmosphere, in this one it quickly became tired, as the movie was too heavily relying on it. Also, they used waaaaay too much exposition. Almost everything you learn about the characters, their backstories and the plot itself, they tell you through dialogue. (That's poor writing.) One more thing that really bothered me (among many other things) was Sean Gunn. He is clearly not a good actor, but for some reason (probably because he's the director's brother) he got much more screen time than in the first film. And it didn't work. Just like most of the movie.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A Lot of Fun, but Falls Short of the Original","""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is another entry in a continuing trend of disappointing superhero movies. I'm starting to feel like a scratched record. ""Doctor Strange"" was a very good movie, but disappointing in how it missed its inherent potential. ""Logan"" was a very good movie, but disappointing how it missed its inherent potential. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is very good but...you catch my drift.Each movie takes a different path to accomplish its misfire. ""Doctor Strange"" never went as dark as it should have. ""Logan"" perhaps went too dark and failed to develop the core relationship of the film. ""Guardians Vol. 2"" is filled with a cast of mesmerizing returning characters, but this time in an inconsistent story that has a tendency to lurch around with either too little or too much buildup.The most prominent story problem is the lack of a coherent antagonist for the first half of the film. The closest we get is a Ravenger named Taserface whose name is enough to throw Rocket into fits of laughter making him seem less antagonist and more comic relief.That's not to say this film lack a good villain. On the contrary, Ronan from Guardians Vol. 1 pales in comparison (making it one of the very few aspects wherein Vol. 2 tops Vol. 1). It's only that the movie takes it's own sweet time establishing the villain, which leaves the audience wondering what are the Guardians guarding. It's cumbersome to invest in a movie with little to no stakes. Eventually, when all is revealed, the movie almost seems to lunge over the finish line like a runner trying to come from behind.Despite all this, the movie is still a solid enough piece of entertainment, largely due to the interpersonal chemistry between the heroes. They are the reason this film works. It's not even that the story is bad. More that the story spends too much time establishing itself and not nearly enough letting the audience appreciate where the story has gone.If you're a fan of the original movie, then you're pretty much guaranteed an enjoyable experience. The returning cast is just as delightfully watchable as they were before. The new cast are all welcome additions, even Sylvester Stallone whose appearance might only be foreshadowing of a spin off or sequel. Music is employed with the same effervescence as the Vol. 1 (Groot dancing to ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" stands out). James Gunn's direction of action is as entertaining as ever. In general, this movie is a lot of fun. Unfortunately, just not as much fun as the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Reusing what worked with its predecesor while declining a little bit in plot quality.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 plays it safe by repeating what made 2014's Guardians of the Galaxy a wonderful film, yet fails to amuse as much as its predecesor did. It's more colourful, more vibrant, more nonchalant and personal, but gives the sensation of relying too much on the popularity of the first film, with the same goofy characters doing goofy things and only a couple of them showing a real grow.

A fun ride,"Vol. 2 is a fun movie with a lot of heart, but it doesn't quite live up to the high bar set by its predecessor.One of the strengths of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is its ability to balance humor and heart. The movie is filled with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, but it also has its share of emotional scenes that pack a punch. The film explores themes of family, friendship, and self-discovery, and does so in a way that feels genuine and heartfelt.However, the movie does have some shortcomings. While the visuals are stunning, the plot feels a bit unfocused and meandering at times. The pacing can also be uneven, with some scenes feeling unnecessarily drawn out. Additionally, the introduction of new characters, such as Ego (Kurt Russell) and Mantis (Pom Klementieff), feels rushed and underdeveloped.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an enjoyable sequel that provides plenty of laughs and emotional moments.

Better upon a rewatch,"I used to have a lot more problems with this film, mainly its humor and most of the dialogue. I don't know why, but after Phase 4, even the older MCU films that I hated are becoming better over time, at least they feel like they've had some effort put into them.First, what I don't like; the entire emotional and thematic core of fatherhood and found family in this film hinges on one of the subplots that ends up taking centre-stage by the climax, and that's everything with the Ravagers and Yondu. I think the weakest parts are when Yondu and Rocket are imprisoned and have to escape, and it does not help that the other story going on with Ego and the rest of the Guardians does not feel like it progresses at all.What I mean is that the first act sets up where the two separate groups need to be, the second act then just feels like it wastes time for the sake of reaching the third act, it's like a looong continuous pause where a bit of dialogue exchange happens until we find out the villains motivations then the final act action starts. It's not interesting at all, and detracts from having a potentially really good action adventure sci-fi film, it feels like the characters both physically and narratively do not progress.I may have been previously too harsh on the film, and honestly I don't think I'm still able to fully grasp my thoughts on it yet, I might rewatch it for a final time to know for sure (watched it very late this time).It is easily the best looking MCU films ever so far and has a lot of beautiful visual designs and colors. The character dynamics that made the first film so good continue to shine in the film, although I could not care less for Gunn's take on Drax at this point. Lots of wasted potential and stupid humor, and it feels like he does not know what to do with him, I hope he at least gets a satisfying conclusion in Vol. 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Wasn't Bad, Wasn't Good","Although this is a Marvel film, it lacks in many areas that most Marvel films have. The jokes were corny, the plot was stale, the only thing that you could really think was amazing are the visual effects.

There was even many times during the film when I just thought to myself: ""wow, this is disappointing."" Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol 2 is just... plane, but it's in no way terrible, and it's obviously hard to match-up with the first Guardians of the Galaxy, but it doesn't even come close. There were a few really good action sequences, but there was more bad than good. Look, I respect Marvel, I respect James Gunn, but this movie is hard to respect, and there's one key reason why: It's PG-13, but the most childish PG-13 movie on the planet.

It tries very hard to recreate the joyful nonsense of the first volume, but fails consistently, rather targeting one-off jokes than investing in its characters that jump, fall and evade bombs, bullets and lasers like Tom and Jerry in space, with no sense of tread whatsoever. Star-Lord himself, while still central to the ""plot"", seems strangely impersonal, dutifully reacting to events around him rather than guiding the action. The movie takes forever to end and offers no surprises on the way.At the end you realize that it has all been nothing but a setup for the next volume, like a cut from an endless Marvel sausage, served shinier than ever but with not much taste.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guardians of the Sequel,"Guardians of the Galaxy delivered a fantastic modern space opera which captured the hearts of audiences and critics alike. The pressure was on for James Gunn and his team to avoid the curse of the terrible sequels. Was Gunn's aim on point or did he overshoot the target and put a bullet in this awesome ensemble?THE PLOTThe long-awaited continuation of the Awesome Mix Vol 1. regroups us with The Guardians of the Galaxy, who survive by doing some good, some bad and a bit of both throughout the universes. On their journey through space they help others out of trouble and more often than not, work themselves into trouble. When they are met by Ego, a mysterious and powerful being, the future of this unlikely bunch of misfits is all but certain. What purpose does Ego have in mind for our beloved Star- Lord? What will become of the Guardians? How does an iconic 80's action movie- star have a place in this film? Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2. will provide overall satisfying answers.THE POSITIVESThe tone and humor which got so many people hooked on the original, is preserved for its sequel. Thank Gunn for that! James Gunn managed to recapture that tone and sense of humor almost perfectly a second time over. All of the Guardians have their distinct personalities and fitting sense of humor but are given a lot more character development in Volume 2. The characters Gunn chose to reintroduce, are interesting due to compelling backstories and some creative, touching and funny character moments. Watching action scenes featuring characters you love and care about, adds so much drama and weight to the action and makes the movie all the more enjoyable. The action itself is creative, fun and often times hilariously over the top.With any great superhero film, there comes the need for a compelling villain. MARVEL doesn't have an amazing track record as far as villains go. Remember the villain of Thor: The Dark World, or his plan? No, me neither... Or what about the incredible emotional depth that was given to that bald guy from Ant-Man... Oh wait. With great relief I can say that the Guardians face off against a much more compelling and interesting villain in Vol 2. than in the original. His plan and motivation could be considered abstract and pretty vague. But to its credit, the movie does take its time to set up the big bad plan reveal and by that point you're on board with it. Volume 2 takes a lot of time to develop a lot of characters. All this time and effort pays off at the end with an incredible final act and an emotional ending which left me in tears.Finally, a special mention needs to be made for Baby Groot, who steals every scene he's in. He's adorable, funny, bad-ass and oh so very charming! An absolute fan favorite and a toy-seller for sure. Also, Yondu gets some genuine great development. His character arch is so touching, so unexpected and emotional. It elevated the entire film.As far as the actual Awesome Mix Vol 2. goes, I can happily say it's amazing! With a lot of upbeat classics and heartwarming ballads, this soundtrack is a must-own.THE NEGATIVESOne of the reasons Guardians of the Galaxy is so beloved is because of its tight story. It is based in the same universe as The Avengers and its heroes but didn't need to tie in to the other films so firmly. Just an infinity stone and a cameo by Thanos were enough to establish the connection. What we got was a solid stand-alone film that had a compact story with colorful characters that didn't need to set up six other films. Can you name another MARVEL film that had the exact same advantage? Because of the fact that Volume 2 pays so much attention to character development for a lot more characters than just the Guardians, the story loses focus and a firm grip on the plot. Although the backstories given to our characters, are pretty cool and interesting, it's the way they are conveyed that makes the film lose some steam. There's a lot of exposition and not all of it through well written dialogue. I would've preferred some tight flashback scenes. A lot more ""Show"", a lot less ""Tell"".Then there's the unfortunate need to set up plot-points and characters for future Guardians- films. All this makes for a bit of a messy film with some pacing issues. Gunn clearly tried to balance all these character and plot-points and hasn't come unscathed out of the ordeal. It's weird he went down this route because story-wise, this film is even more disconnected from the Infinity War than the fist one. So setting up so much material for a sequel, is an odd choice because it feels so unnecessary.THE VERDICTGuardians of the Galaxy Volume 2, slightly bends under the weight of its predecessor but still manages to deliver a fun Space adventure and some much appreciated character development. Even though Gunn and his gang, incorporated a lot more exposition and sequel setups, Volume 2 is still an Awesome Mix of fun, action, drama and colorful characters. With a fantastic ending, I can't wait to see the Guardians return!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"not worth it, wait for iTunes","this lost all the appeal of the first, the story was rubbish and a complete mess, the acting was sub par, jokes were lame, sound track was rubbish (this is the best of the 80s they could get?).Half way through I thought, I am finding this dull!! It just passable, but it seemed like a quickly hashed out sequel, as the first was such a sleeper hit. I would have rather wait a extra year, so they could have written a better story.

Excellent film!,"I don't particularly like Marvel films generally – they all appear the same, with by-the-numbers, easily forgettable plots. However, Guardians 2 is different, like the first film was.My favourite things about the film are: The characterizations. Rocket (he's very well done and even more expressive than he was in Guardians 1) and Baby Groot. All the characters are pretty good, especially the two leads, and Drax comes into his own more in Guardians 2 than he did in the first film. Yondu did very well here, too. I like the mixture of fun and emotion, including sadness. The visuals. The colours and the depictions of environments and outer space. The plot, especially due to great characterization.Making a film that equalled the first one was a difficult thing to pull off, and I think the director did a great job.I hope the Guardians stay as a unit and are not sucked into the rest of the Marvel 'universe'. They are different and much more quirky than the characters in the other films. Trying to integrate them with the other films would be a mistake, in my view, and would be a turn-off (for me, anyway).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Gave this one some thought,"I had originally not made it past 15 minutes in Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) before walking out because of too many clichés at once (eg classics used in soundtrack, dance while you work, the choreographed fight scenes, precise long shots like ""throwing a dagger 30 feet, hitting, and knocking an orb out of someone's hand as the ran away"".) and given it a 1.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) coming out prompted me to see them both and it was almost as hard to get through the first one again, but, I enjoyed it. ""I am Groot"" was wearing thin then came the credit scenes.Then I started Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) and more of the same kind of initial revulsion with the opening scene. But, then, in short, I concluded that these movies shouldn't be judged harshly as I've seen almost all the classics and some turkeys. Sure, GOTG 1 and 2 has elements of both, and a few clichés, but, with so many movies coming out of Hollywood, there's going to be some repetition and imitation.This movie gives Disney storytelling image a much need boost with the help of current and not so current culture. Sure, I don't like most comic book movies but, this one makes the short list of ones I really do like. I even upped my GOTG (2014) rating from 1 to 8.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
These guys are not the avengers,"I want to start off by saying that I was thoroughly entertained throughout this movie, and would highly recommend it. I must also say that this film has it's issues. Personally, I found the structure a little uncomfortable. I expected that like the first installment and the other Marvel films, that the focus throughout the story would be on an a group of heroes eliminating a great threat. Unfortunately the main antagonist is revealed way too late in the story, leaving the characters rather aimless throughout most of the film. As a result the plot meanders into the territory of sketch show and t.v. drama, but fortunately, still manages to deliver a great final punchline. Although the action, effects and comedy are all very enjoyable, I couldn't help but wonder where it was all leading. Although the story evolves into quite a satisfying conclusion, about two thirds of the way through the film the absence of direction made me worry that the film would end up being a complete mess. That worrying unfortunately soiled the experience a little. I feel that I would probably enjoy the film a lot more the second time around, knowing what to expect.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
What a mess,"I honestly went in seeing Guardians of the Galaxy 2 with high hopes and excited expectations because it's part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe which I absolutely love but my hopes were dashedI was severely disappointed....about 10 minutes into this movie I kept thinking to myself, this had better NOT tie into the Marvel Universe because it is just far too childish and immature This movie looks like it's target audience was for 6 year old's, it was atrociously bad, it was trying to be funny continuously but failed in all departments Please don't waste your hard earned money or time watching this stupid trash, save your money for Wonder Woman instead",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Vol 2 is a brilliant family movie with a lot of heart and the comedy is absolutely golden, kept me laughing through out the whole film, most probably my favorite MCU movie!

The plot wasn't as fresh as in a first part, but it was OK. The weakest think in this movie was script, without a doubt. There were characters from first movie, but they were near as funny here as in previous picture. The movie was simply boring.Overall, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has the looks, but its a mess.

This movie is fantastically made, I think the cast in this movie was amazing as well. Baby Groot was the cutest/ coolest thing in the movie. Star-Lord...who's that again?:) He was amazing. Gamora, cool as always. Drax, just fantastic- very funny in this movie, and Rocket, just amazing- also very funny in the movie. This is a movie that you have to go see in theaters.

A charming launch of summer blockbusters,"""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life, is right there beside you all along."" Peter Quill (Chris Pratt)Although a cliché like that shouldn't be allowed on any screen or stage, in the hands of filmmakers responsible for the amusing and sometimes serious Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, it makes a sweet leitmotif that serves the large family-searching theme.Yes, this comic sci-fi is not Shakespeare or Sophocles, but it does allow classic motifs to be enclosed in wise-cracking and explosions as the Guardians return from a rousing first volume to keep the noise high along with the humanity of earth '70's—the opening sequence featuring the pop tune Brandy (You're a Fine Girl) ushers in a sound track full of blasts from that turbulent time.Central to the serious side, Peter is faced with the father he never met, appropriately named Ego, played ever so craftily and cavalierly by the durable Kurt Russell. You say you've already gone through daddy issues in summer movies, and you'd be right. However only the 1977 Star Wars with Luke, Han, and Darth is a bit ahead of the light and dark in this version.After all, James Earl Jones is all voice while Kurt Russell is all boy- man: complicated, evil, and lovable at the same time. When Peter and he face off, I actually felt the tension every man-child in the audience remembers about his dad. In true Greek tragic form, the sisters are not left out either: Gamora (Zoe Saldana) struggles with her bad-girl sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan). No, it's not classical drama, but it is at least a worthy sequel to a version of the first Guardians at which even Aristophanes would chuckle.Praise goes to director/writer James Gunn. Who spreads the love among the characters, most of whom are searching for identity or a respected reputation among a family of crew members prone to insult each other as social sport.Captain Peter does double emotional duty between his father and his unspoken love, Gamora. Fortunately Pratt, Having played the mediocre hero of the latest Jurassic Park, is low key enough an actor to do no serious damage to the demands of heavy-duty plotting, and Russell, well, is a pro at mixing the ridiculous with the sublime.But, hey, this is the beginning of summer blockbusters, where classical dramatic tropes are not usually on the menu. What is so delectable, however, is the constant rattle of ironic lines like, ""You killed my mom! And squished my Walkman!"" (Peter) That's the sound of summer fun.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"The first half was terrific...the last half, not so much!","At this point, this film has made nearly $400,000,000 domestically and had nearly 800 reviews. Needless to say, it's a hit and my review sure ain't gonna change that! But, I did just see the film and with my compulsive need to be IMDb's most prolific reviewer, I decided to contribute yet another review.The fist portion of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2"" impressed me. In particular, I found myself laughing very often at Drax (Dave Bautista), as he was hilarious and often said the most horrible and inappropriate things. He was, to me, the best thing about the film. As for the rest, it was just fine until about midway through the movie. Then, the plot and what happened after that didn't make a lot of sense (such as multiple baddies suddenly becoming good guys/gals) and instead the picture solely focused on insanely big and explosive special effects. It's as if they were telling you to turn off your brain and enjoy the rest of the film on a very primal level. As for me, I didn't wanna turn off my brain and thought the second half of the film was a HUGE disappointment. The first portion, I'd give an 8 or 9...I really liked it. The second, I'd give a 2 or 3....I really hated it. Overall, 6 seems fair.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Far too much lame humour.,"God-like space traveller Ego (Kurt Russell) reveals to Peter Quill (AKA Starlord) that he is his father and tries to convince his new-found son to become part of his plan to assimilate the entire universe.I'm one of the few who didn't enjoy the humour in the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie: I just didn't find it funny. So you can probably guess how I feel about Vol. 2, which ramps up the level of comedy even further. I can't say I'm disappointed that James Gunn won't be directing part three (although I do think he was treated very unfairly by those in charge).But Vol. 2 doesn't just suffer from an excess of bad gags: the plot is weak, the pop soundtrack is overbearing, at 136 minutes it's way too long, and the action is too far-fetched (even for a comic book sci-fi film featuring a talking raccoon and a dancing baby tree). Our heroes are thrown into numerous situations that would reasonably result in a very messy fate, yet they repeatedly manage to emerge unscathed. Suspending disbelief is one thing; accepting that a character can escape certain death time and time again is asking too much.Admittedly, Gunn has produced a film that looks great, with some mind boggling special effects and mesmerisingly beautiful scenes that make wonderful use of colour, but with such a silly plot and execution that frequently defies logic and the laws of physics, it's hard to care too much about what happens to the good guys.In short, this is the second best film to co-star Sylvester Stallone and Michael Rooker, Cliffhanger still clinging firmly on to first place.5/10, simply for sexy insect alien Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and tasty blue bald cyborg Nebula (Karen Gillan), both of whom make watching just about worthwhile.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Epic, flashy sequel that is still not quite as good as the first one","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningThis sequel to 2014's monster comic book fantasy hit Guardians of the Galaxy delves further into the back story of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), the young boy abducted from Earth by Yondu (Michael Rooker) after his mother succumbed to cancer. Here, he is re-united with his father (Kurt Russell) who disappeared from his life and became the inter-galactic warrior Ego, who inhabits his own corner of the universe. His son, meanwhile, continues to be known as Star-Lord and, as he and his ragtag misfit friends, including Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket the Racoon and Baby Groot go about their missions, they uncover a sinister truth that could tear them all apart.The big screen comic book craze is certainly not one that's showing any signs of dying down, but of the last few years, none has quite sent it into such a spin as James Gunn's 2014 blockbuster GOTG. This sequel was practically a cat in the bag in terms of being made, and the fans of the last one have certainly been waiting for it (as the packed theatre I was in would attest to. ) It pretty much repeats the formula of the last one to wise effect, and with Gunn back at the helm, hopes were really as great as they can be. What it does try and do is do it all on a bigger, grander scale and while this is visually impressive and aesthetically stimulating, somehow it's all a bit too much and just not quite as good as the last one.The 80's throwback vibe is on higher alert, with David Hasselhoff frequently referenced (and even making a brief cameo!) as the image presented of Quill's father, on account of him being a big Knight Rider fan, whilst even Howard the Duck himself no-less appears in one segment. This is often used to enhance the humour, which it does, though it even creeps up uneasily during darker moments of the film, such as when Peter learns the truth behind his mother's death. The big theme here is exploring the back stories of each of the characters, and what springs off this is a load of subplots, that are interesting but don't have a massive connection to each other, and so what we do have is a long, slightly incoherent film.Fundamentally, though, it does faithfully stick to the formula from last time, with some hilariously funny moments, and a soundtrack listing that is actually better than the last one (including a wonderful opening involving a shoot-out to the tune of ELO's marvellous Mr. Blue Sky.) It is a visual splendour to watch, too, that even Mr Sylvester Stallone seemed to want to get on board with. ***",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Intergalactic fun ride filled with emotions,"Marvel successfully introduced their lesser known comic book characters with the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014. It went on to become a blockbuster and also was highly appreciated by the critics. Following its predecessor's success, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 released with much higher expectations than the first part. Director James Gunn not only manages to live up to the expectations and delivers a near perfect fantasy adventure.After saving Xandar, the Guardians of the Galaxy continue to work as a team and are on a mission to protect the valuable batteries of Sovereign race from an interdimensional monster. After the successful mission, team ends up being attacked by the Sovereign due to Rocket's misadventures. During their escape they encounter Peter Quill's father who takes them to the planet Ego to reveal his origins and his purpose. While Quill and Gamora fight their own personal battles, Rocket, Drax and Groot end up making new allies and strengthen their bonds. The movie is about how Guardians work together again as a team (or should we say family) for saving the Galaxy, again.Vol. 2 is a bit different and more emotional than the first movie. It is also not short of any humour as promised in the trailer. Once again the choice of music is on point which almost make this movie seem as a musical even in intense action sequences. The visual effects are handled brilliantly just like any other Marvel movie. Funny one liners, stupid humour and loads of cuteness with everyone's favorite character Baby Groot makes this movie an enjoyable experience for all age groups. The movie seems a bit out of place in certain scenes, but apart from that it is thoroughly enjoyable.Chris Pratt as Peter Quill has a meaty role in this one as the story revolves around him. While Zoe Saldana and many others cakewalk through their roles, it is Dave Bautista as Drax who steals the show with his funny act. The character if Drax the destroyer has taken a U turn compared to what it was in the first part. Dave Bautista sidelines the fellow funny character Rocket which was the show stealer in the first movie. The character Baby Groot has been so well written and executed so that it is impossible to hate. Even the Ravagers in the movie find it, ""Too adorable to kill"". While veteran actor Kurt Russel plays Ego, Quill's father, Michael Rooker as Yondu has a very significant role as well. Special mention to the actor Sean Gunn as Kraglin whose character is unintentionally funny. Watch out for special appearances in the movie serves as icing on the cake.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is yet another fitting piece in the Marvel cinematic universe.

"Entertaining, with revelations and amazing visual effects","Like many Sci-Fi movies, they are entertaining, they have good fights and flashy characters.

Oriented in a simple way, good against evil, with much more comedy than the prequel.Now what stands out are two things, the mixes nostalgia with old songs in a futuristic environment and the visual effects, making colorful places of the galaxy, space traveling, bubbles and beautiful fireworks are just a part of it.

Volume 2 and still going strong :D.,"In to the second installment of the Guardian of the Galaxy our team meets Peter's Father ,Ego,Yondu faces issues with his crew and everyone is for a lack of a better word a brick ,even Baby Groot ,which was beyond adorable and up and right hilarious. In general as a sequel was on part with the first film, thought not all the jokes were on point and the soundtrack wasn't so memorable as with the first one.Over all the film had amazing visuals ,excellent computer animation and ,in all that ,we got a in-depth look in to the psychology of each character. And it was done in a funny, enjoyable and ""normal"" way (we talking about a space film, with a talking raccoon, a living tree and gold aliens ,the term normal ,we have to take him with a grain of salt). To be more precise all the main characters (apart from Groot )face trauma due to their up bringing and this team ,these Guardians aren't just a team, is their closest to a family.But what I got of film is that all the misadventures of all the player in the film come out of their actions. They acted foolishly and got in to trouble, basically karma. And I can't forget the most outrageous Stan Lee cameo ever, it was funny to the point of tears.Over all I am unable to say more about the film since that would be to heavy of a spoiler and I don't want to spoil that flick for you, go watch in theaters as soon as possible.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The emotional part of the movie doesn't feel real because of the lack of build up.If you still see this movie i hope that your expectations are lowered, thus making your experience better than mine.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Perfect mix of comedy and action for all ages,"I'm going to try to keep this short as there is a lot to say about this film. Never again will ""the sequel is always worse"" come out of my mouth. Both films in this series have received 10/10 reviews from me. However, I do believe the second installment was a more enjoyable experience than the first. That is no slight to the first movie as I had considered it my all time favourite super hero movie... until now. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 offers the perfect blend of comedy and action for all ages to enjoy.The comedy in the film is appropriate enough that you could take your 12 year old child to see the movie, but also has more than enough edgy humour to keep the parents laughing for a majority of the film. Although most of the main cast brings their own unique humour to the table, Dave Bautista's character, Drax the Destroyer, steals the show with his brutal honesty towards the rest of the Guardians.The action scenes in this movie were perfectly done. With amazing special effects, this film provides mind blowing action scenes even more extreme than the first film. The violence is kept to a low enough level that it is appropriate for young people, while still delivering an enjoyable experience for the older crowd.I could write all day about how much I enjoyed this film, instead I simply recommend you go watch it. I guarantee anyone who enjoyed the first film will be more than pleased with Vol. 2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Well, did it live up to the first one?","Guardians of the Galaxy 2 in my opinion does not surpass the original film however is not a let down at all. The second film managed to tie in a more interesting aspect about family and therefore becomes a much more self centered and confined film which may be a put off to some as in nothing really happens and everything is generally self contained with not much implications on the greater MCU. However as James Gunn has quoted he does want the Guardians to be mostly its own separate thing despite having to eventually join the Avengers in the Infinity War. Which is a creative choice that I fully support, granted what makes MCU great is its ability to tie in all these different characters a separate faction is a breath of fresh air and is a chance for audiences to just have fun without having to worry too much about the overall continuity.The film is very funny and contains many of the space battle sequences that we would like with a dose of Baby-Grootness that just edges on the line of being too much, a good thing that they have finally decided to bring back the old Groot as suggested in one of the five post credit scenes. My favourite character to come out of this second outing is Yondu and he actually plays a very interesting father-son dynamic between him and Quill also establishing a sort of rivalry with Kurt Russell's 'Ego' the planet.Gamora and Nebula's relationship was also very interestingly explored, as i said this film features heavily on family and this sort of familial ties. Another relationship that I really liked was between Drax and newcomer Mantis, they make a very good dynamic duo and Drax himself does become a much more interesting character compared to his last outing adding many comedic moments.One of my favourite moments was definitely Stan Lee's cameo, this is probably the best Stan Lee cameo so far, he is first seen speaking to a group of 'Watchers' an extraterrestrial race from the Marvel comics and then in the end credits seen trying to stop the Watchers from leaving telling them that ""there's more stories to tell."" What is so great about this particular cameo is that it confirms that Stan Lee is in fact playing the same Stan Lee in all of the Marvel films including his earlier non-MCU ones. Although this may not prove the Stan Lee is a watcher, it does seem like it has some ties to the Watcher and is interesting because he always pops up in major MCU events as Watchers do, as a sort of bystander. So just a fun Easter egg that Marvel throws in there.So the film was really great and I enjoyed the comedic aspects as well as the further character development that a largely self contained film like this managed to do despite having slight flaws like having the Sovereign popping up randomly felt like kind of a distraction but well i suppose they were just there to set up for Adam Warlock in the upcoming vol. 3.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The team of hero misfits return,"I think of Guardian of the Galaxy has the red haired step brother to The Avengers. Funny space adventure, with some dramatic moment. All the actors have good chemistry, and really feel comfortable in there roles. CGI Rocket Racoon voiced by Bradley Cooper, and Groot voiced by Vin Diesel really stole a lot of scenes. I was eagerly waiting for the sequel.The funny moments are always the best parts, but are some dramatic moments also, but never over shadow the funny parts. Our favorite hero team of misfits get into more trouble and find more adventures. Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana really shine again as Star Lord and Gamora. So does Rocket and Groot once again voiced by Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. Michael Rooker is quite the scene steal er as Yondu. And Karen Gillan is memorable as Nebula. Kurt Russell really comes alive as Star Lords dad. The effects are pretty good for a space adventure, one scene I felt paid homage to The Empire Strikes Back(1980). I'm really excited to see more, the after credits scenes makes excited.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Overrated but fun,"I personally had a good time with this movie. The comedy was really great in the first act of the film. That is about all of the great stuff. The villain was absolutely ridiculous. Bringing back the death of Peter's mother again, did feel a bit forced. Then, the villain was Peter's dad? And a planet, i guess? It was all way too weird and complicated for the Guardians of the Galaxy. I also didn't really enjoy the fact, that they split up the group for a big chunk of the movie. The group dynamic worked really well in the first movie and they completely ruined it. The emotion between Peter and Yondu was great, but that is not enough to elevate this movie anywhere near the quality of the first. Overall, I would recommend it for a Marvel fan, but don't expect too much of it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Prepare to, once again, get hooked on a feeling","Three years ago, Marvel Studios and James Gunn introduced us to the Guardians of the Galaxy, a superhero team of outcasts and misfits who resembled more of a dysfunctional family than a cohesive unit setting out to save the galaxy. It's safe to say the world fell in love with them right there and then, and now they're back in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, the fifteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.With the Guardians of the Galaxy, consisting of Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), renowned as heroes and hired to defend the galaxy, it's not long before they find themselves on the run again. The trials and tribulations they face along the way pushes their relationships to new limits, all while Quill discovers the truth behind his parentage.While others moan that the MCU is becoming quite tiresome, I can't help but feel that it seems fresher than ever, particularly when they can break away to something as different as Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. While it may not spring as much of a surprise on its audience as the first film this sequel doesn't try to be a carbon copy, exceeding any expectations I had going in.Going from one of Marvel Studios' biggest gambles to one of their most profitable properties is some achievement for Guardians of the Galaxy, and a lot of the success they've had has to go down to James Gunn. Gunn's work on the first film drew a lot of Star Wars comparisons with the whole space opera ideology and in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Gunn has made his Empire Strikes Back, with a strong sequel full of adventure, fractured relationships and a narrative that even comes with the father/son elements.The film is much funnier than its predecessor, the jokes coming thick and fast, with Drax and Baby Groot getting the lions share of them, and Gunn really does knock it out of the park with both the visual and verbal pop culture references. That doesn't mean the film's narrative is sacrificed in any shape or form mind, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 going on to become one of the more personal and emotional films within the MCU.One of the best things about the first film was the awesome soundtrack the film played out to. Like I've said already though, this isn't a carbon copy so they don't just pick random songs because they sound cool alongside an action sequence. The songs really do excel the film at times, Come A Little Bit Closer, Father and Son and The Chain being the stand-outs this time round. Oh, and Mr. Blue Sky deserves a special mention for playing over the best opening title sequences ever, and you'll find it hard to disagree when you see it for yourself.Coming to the performances, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the fine ensemble cast return along with the addition of some very welcome new cast members. Chris Pratt leads the cast with copious amounts of charisma as Peter Quill embarks on a journey into his parentage, Zoe Saldana really does hone in on the fierceness of Gamora whenever she feels like it, Dave Bautista is, once again, hilarious as Drax, his laugh being one of the most infectious you'll hear in any film and the stellar vocal performance from Bradley Cooper as Rocket is one of the highlights of the film.Michael Rooker and Karen Gillan return as Yondu and Nebula respectively, getting more to sink their teeth into this time round and each of them provides the film with some of its more prevalent heartbeats. There's also the new additions to the cast that come in the shape of Kurt Russell as Ego, a cosmic being and Quill's father, and Pom Klementieff as Mantis, Ego's empathic assistant. Russell just oozes the same charisma as Pratt so no surprise they seem to go hand-in-hand as father and son, and Klementieff does a great job in selling the innocence of Mantis as well as showing fine comedic qualities, mainly in her scenes alongside Bautista.As expected with these big budget superhero films now, the visual effects look stunning and in the case of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, they play a major part in making these films feel so detached from the rest of the MCU. The vibrant colours add even more energy to the already electric action sequences, turning the film into even more of a thrilling ride in the process.I could honestly sit and type for hours on end regarding how much I loved Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 but rather than do that, I'll just go and see the film again and again because this film has so much to give. I'm certainly hooked on a feeling again and I'm sure it won't be long before the rest of the world follows suit.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Worth seeing for real heroes.,"I'd classify The Guardians of Galaxy vol.2 as a crazy action with both jokes and sad moments. I'm sure that the film will keep both adults and children excited. The picture is very colorful and contains many professional special effects. This is the first feature film shot with Red Digital Cinema's Weapon Helium digital camera, and is the first film shot in 8K resolution. I would pay a particular attention to the film score. I'm sure you'll agree that The Guardians of Galaxy is especially famous with its soundtracks. Music of 60's, 70's add some retro color to the movie. The film has a talented cast. I'm in favor of Chris Pratt's acting. Most of humor scenes belong to Drax that is the character of Dave Bautista. Also I was pleased to see charismatic Kurt Rassel. The plot isn't very complicated and new: our heroes try to save the universe again. Most of questions are answered in this film that remained unanswered in vol. 1. Some things were quite illogical and not convincing but in general I was satisfied at the end of the film. Represented topic of the relationship between father and son made a big impression on me. If you liked the prequel, I'll recommend you to watch this. The film is full of breathtaking moments and flavored with light jokes. Don't forget it has 5 scenes in the closing credits. 7 of 10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Colorful, Loud, and Fun","It's almost impossible for a sequel to out-preform it's predecessor, although it has been accomplished more than once in recent years (The Winter Soldier, The Dark Knight, etc.). The first Guardians of the Galaxy was, and still is, one of my favorite movies of 2014. Knowing this, I went into GOTG2 with lowered expectations, yet eager to see what fun eye candy the director, James Gunn, had in store this second time around. Needless to say I came out pleased and satisfied with what I had gotten. Is it as good as the first? No. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 does not quite capture the magic of the first film, but it delivers the same laughs and action that we know and love. The very opening scene with Baby Groot dancing to ELO's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" while a huge inter- dimensional space monster battle rages behind him delivers the tone of the movie perfectly: it's fun. The main reason so many fell in love with the first Guardians was how fun and joyful it all was. This sequel certainly captures that same feel, while delivering more on the humor as well. You notice an attempted effort to include lots more jokes and laughter into this second movie, and while some jokes don't hit as they intended, most do. So why isn't Guardians of the Galaxy 2 as good as the first? The plot. The first 30 to 45 minutes are spent without a real purpose, and it isn't until around halfway through the movie when an actual goal comes to fruition. Star Lord, played magnificently once again by Chris Pratt, finds his long lost father, Ego. While this seems compelling, many scenes in the beginning parts of the movie don't flow very well. Contrast this to the first film where every scene flawlessly fit into place one cut after another. Some scenes between the first and second act feel a little disjointed and choppy, but the movie soon picks up for a spectacular third act. Overall, this movie is a fun escape (with an excellent soundtrack) that will please most, despite not quite capturing the extraordinary feel of the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Will the price increase to save the galaxy for the second time?,"The inaugural chapter of the most irreverent galactic mercenaries from Marvel was a gigantic turning point in the path set by superhero movies. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was one of the best — and completely fortuitous—proposals in 2014, a carefree sci-fi film that divorced in full from the general storyline that, by requirement, has to follow regarding the super longed final outcome called ""IW"". The massive success was mainly due to inexorable features as the different and unusual—at that time—humor types present in the characters, the visuals as artificial as extraordinary or a soundtrack based on the 80's Walkman, which were developed with ease on the three true foundations: Story (screenplay), actors (performances) and director (decisions). From all, that colorful and hilarious mix comes the expected ""Vol. 2 "", which remains stable in relation to the first one and satisfies the enormous expectation that was on the shoulders of the guardians.If the creative outbursts of the writer seemed eccentric in the first film by virtue of the composition of apparently nothing correlated tones and genres, in this one, James Gunn is fully unleashed from any impediment in a story of living planets, hybrids between deities and humans and allusions to Mary Poppins. The director preserves his characteristic flame innovating and relating exotic formulas even in the opening since later in the astonishing 80's introduction, the initial sequence ratifies a cosmic and comical aura almost equal to its the predecessor, orchestrated by multi-functional Gunn.Here, the triad of elements, that were as original as refreshing in the first installment, are strengthened, getting the same heart with a similar wrapper, it's really a continuation, not a clone. The most important pillar is the story, the plot around which the movie will have to be meant. Before it was about setting up a dysfunctional family, now, it's about being a dysfunctional family. With a general structure established, its writer, who is also a director, chooses to explore and clarify the past of his pieces, since due to its dazzling introduction was possibly a wide and amusing deepening of its roots. In addition, this study is applied to the introduction of new Guardians: Mantis, Yondu, and Nebula, who arrive to transform the quintet into an octet of light hearted fun, finding in them a new breath to irreverence of the core stars. Likewise, within that sea of fabulous inclusions, the scriptwriters insinuate and strengthen what they have been announcing for some time: Independent of the appearances in ""Infinity War"" or future movies, the story of the Guardians will have three films, nothing more, nothing less, however, the filmmaker has insinuated that although the official closing of the cycle of Stard-Lord and his gang ends with the longed for third one, we could see more movies, in the distant future, of the Guardians, but... Of who? With great feasibility may be referring to the ancestors of Gamora and GrootIt happens with very few motion pictures, ""Guardians"" is in that strange but thankful section. Even though humans will always get swept up in visuals, seeing is believing, James Gun's film, like its predecessor presents an authentic, nostalgic and a maddening musical compendium from the late 1970s/early 1980s, hits enhancing the scenes with regard to the seen ones in the universe. While ""Mr. Blue Sky"" by Electric Light Orchestra provides the best and most monumental opening for a Marvel movie,""The Chain"" by Fleetwood Mac orchestrates one of the most mind-blowing sequences that Phase 3 of the MCU has been able to set up, to this mix of yesteryear, we can add it a few songs that are right on target in the dramatic moments, which also make way for the best of Marvel.Do you want an appetizer? See the teaser trailer. Another extra? See the official trailer. But in case you are still overcome by doubts, another one? Delight yourself with the opening sequence. The pictures are sickeningly sweet like a visit to a candy shop, prevailing and vigorous like the guilty pleasure of entering the shop. The range of colors is phenomenal, and its application boosts greatly that feeling, moreover, the way to sort the components in the scene is beautiful, colorful; a harmony vis-à-vis with each character. However, they episodically fail in the well-known ""more is less"" proverb, even thought Ego's planet is paradisiacal, the screen is crowded of pigments and dizzying gadgets for the spectator, tarnishing the beauty of photography, from superhero world newcomer Henry Braham. It's worth highlighting the remarkable work in the editing room, that in addition to vivify scenes, produce mind-boggling IMAX and 3D screenings, that will leave you astounded. Also, it's meritorious to applaud the exact length of the film, those two hours and eighteen minutes don't feel unused at all.And Gunn keeps on to inscribe rules for upcoming superhero movie directors. The filmmaker concludes his feature film, his work, his son, his beloved in an intimate and melancholy way, producing a breath of hope and affliction at the same time, something that, at first glance, doesn't fit into the atmosphere of the story, but that after following the crazy adventures of our guardians for two hours feels phenomenally effective. A smile and a goodbye hurt more than hundreds of blows and Gunn has shown (also) to know how to handle it. He's a peculiar director, that has pros and cons like any other man—but more pros—, the priority for music, the character design, the importance of comedy and drama, the tidiness imposed on frames and a few hazards crossing their minds. It seems Marvel will continue at the service of the demands and ideas of this talented man and his squad of characters, demonstrating in this installment more of everything, duplicating what we liked about the first one, but giving it personality to a film as fun as tear-producing simultaneously.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

The Guardians are back in action!,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the second installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise in the Marvel Cinematic Universe and it's about the latest adventure of the titular team. While escaping from a team of bounty hunters, they come across Star-lord's father, Ego, and discover the powers that he holds and what Star- Lord was destined to do.Now I didn't watch the original Guardians of the Galaxy, but from what I had heard, it was supposed to be incredible. Because of this, I expected this movie to be that way too.To an extent, I was pretty pleasantly surprised by the movie. The characters held the same charm that they did in the original movie with the heroes being flawed yet still very lovable. The movie gives our main character Starlord some more depth, which is something that I really appreciated. Somehow, I found the new Baby Groot even more charming than Groot from the original film. He provides the comedy and gives some of the more intense scenes such as the intro a more light hearted feel. The movie has a lot of funny moments. The Awesome Mix was also really good with many great classic songs as well.If there's one complaint I have with this movie, it's that it wasn't quite as fresh as the original Guardians of the Galaxy, as it holds a heavy focus on the relationship between Starlord and Ego. Either way, it is the must watch superhero film as of right now and I highly recommend seeing it!9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Simple dumb fun, which could be good or bad, depending on your tastes","The *Marvel formula* is back. By now the famous Marvel formula has been so successful for the Marvel movies that not only do they not have any reason to ever surprise us by giving us anything new, but they're actually doubling down on the weaker aspects of their formula: Interruptive jokes, underdeveloped villains, and the same old recycled plot where the world/planets/dimensions are threatened, but despite the massive scale of events, things never actually get serious enough for any viewers to be afraid the heroes won't save the day, and even before it's over, you already know that the inconsequential events of this week's episode will probably be by wrapped up by the end credits and forgotten by the time of the next Marvel movie.Marvel must have some sort of mandate to never let any of their movies go for more than a couple minutes at most without another interjected joke. It's like they deliberately pepper in jokes to desperately avoid ever taking themselves too seriously. It's gotten to the point where it's not natural humor anymore; they just have to constantly interrupt the flow of the movie to insert jokes - and, in the case of this movie, not even particularly witty jokes, but extended juvenile back-and-forth conversations about nipples, penises, and turds... I wish I was making that up.But despite all of the above, I'm not saying don't watch it.

Good but no magic,"After having watched the first GotG a gazillion times I was SO looking forward to the sequel. It was definitely entertaining but fell short of the first one. You can tell they really were trying and tugging desperately at the viewers' heartstrings, but they were unable to capture the magic of the first one.First, the music fell far short. I remember every single song in the first movie from my childhood, and they were all hits. This movie, I didn't recognize half of them and half of the rest were not big hits. Also, the timing and pacing of the music didn't work, pulled me out of the movie instead of tapping my foot and smiling like the first movie.Second, (possible spoiler alert), in one scene there is a close-up of Gamora and her green skin makeup clearly looks unfinished. Terrible job and again, takes you out of the movie.Third, too many scenes don't work (SPOILER ALERT). Nebula practically kills herself trying to kill Gamora, and minutes later the sisters practically forgive each other. I know the movie's theme was family, but it just felt so forced.(SPOILER ALERT) I did like the young Kirk Douglas in the beginning of the movie, that was amazing.I won't be watching this one a gazillion times.

James Gun holds strong by breaking the formula,This film is amazing in so many ways. This film does push away from some of the ensemble feel of the first one making this film not feel as strong as the first one did by giving more development to other areas in the world that Guardians inhabit. It is amazing what James Gun manages to accomplish in this film. In this short he has managed to capture all the most important parts of the original making it more interesting and dynamic.The first Guardians of the Galaxy was pretty much a 10 for me. I thought it was one of the funnest movies I had seen. Only being outdone by the Oscar wining film known as Birdman (which I watch once ever year). It is very naturally written and paced also extremely well. It was such a great film that was always going to be nearly impossible to outdo.And in some ways it is better.Vol 2 manages to give development to one of the lesser characters in the last film known as Yondu Making him a lot more interesting and a lot more dynamic as well. You come to care foe Yondu as a person.The relationship between Peter and his father is also very well done and has a lot of heart.And for the first time ever the Marvel movies actually manage to make a really amazing and captivating villain who matters!! This film also has a legitimate death in it. James Gun has done it people. He has broken the Marvel formula!!!Sadly it is still to the defeat of the ensemble feel of the first one as the rest of the cast while still great and fun aren't being as highlighted as they were in the first one.The jokes are more like Age of Ultron jokes with a few being really funny.And the final act of the film feels like every superhero movie ever.Overall though Guardians of the Galaxy is still a fun movie that you will still very much enjoy despite some of its flaws.,8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

I'm sure you won't be disappointed! Made me want to see other Marvel movies even more! Star Lord and Co. continue as the whited gang as they are and with a great mix of comedy, action and visual effects to boot! I still prefer the first one but the chemistry of the cast on Vol. 2 is still present and Drax's honesty is hilarious in most parts of his dialogues.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017),"I wasn't raving about the first Guardians of the Galaxy but it was humorous and enjoyable. Didn't think it was the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it was one of the better efforts. I knew I would catch the sequel at some point in time and now that I've seen it, I gotta say I'm a bit mixed about it. I think overall the film is good but is certainly inferior to the first film. Regardless, this film and the MCU still remains a money making vehicle as they head into the next Avengers.This film takes our Guardians on a new path. They are wanted by the Sovereign people after Rocket steals batteries from them. More importantly Peter Quill comes across his father (played by Kurt Russell) who is revealed to be Ego a celestial being with great powers. All is not as it seems, as the film tries to uncover Ego's real motivations.The cosmic visuals of the film are still as good as the first. This was never a problem with the film as cinematically still colorful and eye-popping. I think the humor while still ever present, does not hit its mark as much. There are funny moments, mostly through the MVP character of the film (Baby Groot) but the jokes feel forced and not as natural. The writing in places isn't always strong and the film has a hard time justifying its running length.I will say though the film does a better job of characterization for some of the side players in this film, namely for Michael Rooker's Yondu. He is one of the standouts in this film and is a strong point of the film as he is given great time to develop. While the film doesn't have a lot of negatives I have to say it seems worn down and more manufactured than the first film, which genuinely felt like a free flowing fun film. Its standard sequel stuff really, but the film is still worth a watch. Especially if you are waiting on the next Avengers film that everything is building towards.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Continues the Great Run of Marvel's Most Unconventional Team,"*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We briefly join Meredith Quill (Laura Haddock) as she's having a joyride with her boyfriend Ego (a CG version of Kurt Russell). They pull in at a Dairy Queen but Ego takes her down the hill behind it to show here an extraterrestrial flower he's planted in the ground. They hug and Meredith remarks how she fell in love with a spaceman.A lot is expected from this movie. When you serve up an excellent and memorable movie the first time around, you not only have to meet that expectation but surpass it. James Gunn and the crew had an enormous amount of pressure and I think they expanded on the Guardians universe about as well as they could have. This movie is even more impressive visually, the colours explode around the characters. They create an even more vibrant and fun galaxy to exist in. The makeup is just as good if not better. I love the fact that they did the makeup practically on characters like Yondu, Drax, Gamora, Ayesha and Nebula; it just looks better with how much CGI we're getting nowadays. They also travel to new and interesting environments and it's good they weren't content just to recycle the CGI locations. I think this is an even better looking movie than the first one and considering the first one was no slouch in that department, that's high praise.The first Guardians really launched a few careers besides Gunn as a blockbuster filmmaker. Chris Pratt took a risk doing the first one and it payed off handsomely. He's consistent as Peter Quill and continues doing excellent work. Zoe's a sci-fi vet and she gets a more complete arc to work with here. She never gets her due and she's good here. Dave Bautista as Drax was even funnier and he continues to grow as an actor. Vin Diesel and Bradley Cooper lend some more solid voice work. Several supporting characters get bigger chunks of screen time. Michael Rooker shines as Yondu, Karen Gillian gives Nebula some more dimension and I liked that Sean Gunn had a bigger role. Kurt Russell was perfect and he stole the show for me. He sells his emotional beats as Ego and you want to believe in his growing relationship with Peter. Pom Klementieff was decent even if I was kind of so-so on her character and I liked Elizabeth Debicki a lot. She's an underrated actress and she's pretty versatile.I think the only real weakness in the first movie is that Ronan makes for a forgettable villain. It wasn't Lee Pace's fault, it just seems to be a weakness that most of the Marvel movies share. Guardians Vol. 2 obscures the major threat to our heroes for a lot longer in the movie than it normally takes. I had an inkling on who would step forward but I think the movie did a really great job of creating a well rounded character to put in that spot. They develop a strong and personal relationship with one of the Guardians and you want to believe that they're going to be best friends forever. Even though if you pay attention, you can see the bread crumbs being dropped. So Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 even pulled off a rare feat for Marvel, an excellent villain to match up against the hero.This movie excels at being funny and it has some very emotional moments. The only real criticism of this movie that I have (other than comparing it to the first one) is that some of the moments feel a little forced. They make a concerted effort to give each of the characters their proper time and normally that's a good thing. But I felt like the movie was a little pushy in getting some of the emotional beats across. I don't want to come across as a nit-picker but they seemed less organic and a little overstuffed because everyone had to have a character arc. Perfect balance is hard to achieve and while this movie didn't fail, it didn't perfect it either.Guardians of the Galaxy was not only one of the best Marvel entries of the past couple of years but one of the best of Marvel's complete run as a movie production company. It completely blew me away, I love sci-fi adventure and while it fit in the larger Marvel cinematic universe, the movie wasn't afraid to deliver something off-beat and fresh. It gave us new Marvel characters that were different and took us to new places that we wouldn't see in other Marvel films. It was extremely funny but it had the plot and characters to back it up. I'm praising the first entry so thoroughly because one of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 unfortunate short-comings is that it doesn't come across as being as fresh or as inventive. It's not really fair because once you've already been introduced to something, you can't be re-introduced to it. So this movie really needed to do something amazing to replicate that feeling and while it more than justified itself as a sequel, I can't put it on the first one's level. It shored up certain minor short-comings from the first entry (delivering a genuinely memorable villain and adding interesting character development across the board) but it didn't hit that high benchmark. I still really dug it though, it would be more of an 8.5/10 but I don't feel bad rounding it up to a 9.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Solid sequel, but not as memorable as its predecessor","#MCUrewatch. GotG2 has the same great humor as the first film. Once again the entire cast is in top form but for me the real highlights of this film (apart from a great Baby Groot title sequence) are Drax (the droll manner with which Bautista says his lines is classic) and Yondu (Rooker is terrific as a Han Solo like space pirate). As I said: the humor is great and director Gunn manages to create a visceral and unique film in terms of esthetics. But...there is something wrong with the plot and story here. GotG1 was a straightforward mission like film. Here...there really is no mission. Just our heroes hanging about. The middle act kinda drags on (especially the Ego sequences) and the finale feels a bit like a rehash of the Dr Strange climax (visually that is). And in terms of plot it is sometimes a bit too much on the nose (although Yondu's farewell line is classic). It is a shame the story/plot aren't as good as in the first film, since all the other things are.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Easily the Most Underrated Movie of Phase Three,"I do not understand why this movie isn't talked about more. It's emotion, though not as much as the first movie, because how could it be...that movie started with Peter witnessing his mother's death. Anyways, this movie is also the absolute funniest movie in the MCU, no competition. And the cast are arguably just as good as they were in the first movie. Don't even get me started on the score, which I play on repeat. Overall, this movie isn't the best movie of phase three but it is the most underrated and definitely is the funniest.8.4/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
GOTG Vol 2,Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 where do I start except saying that was one killer movie that you need to see if you have not seen it yet. Chris Pratt did a great job once again as Star Lord and Vin Diesel did a fantastic job as Baby Groot and Bradley Cooper did a great job as Rocket. This movie was one of those where you know it is going to be great but it is better then you thought it was going to be.Parents to be honest yes this movie is PG-13 but besides the violence I don't see why it is PG-13. The film will take you on a wonderful journey that you will want not to end it is by far the best Marvel movie so far. This is just not an action movie but it is also super funny I mean Baby Groot I love him he made me laugh and laugh every time he was on the screen this is just a great movie.My score 10/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I'm surprised. This is my favorite MCU movie after Captain America:Civil War.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 15th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Time flies, huh? With all bigger comic book movies coming out in 2017 I was actually the least hyped for this one. There were some reasons to worry. Usually when a sequel tries to outdo the original by going bigger, it turns into a mess. And I'm happy to say that wasn't the case with this one.The plot is actually rather straightforward but it's how it's done that matters here. The characters are all likable and well fleshed-out, the dialogue is witty and well-written (except for a few cringy jokes, but those tiny parts are easy to forget), the actors give their best in their roles and the soundtrack is absolutely amazing! First one was also entertaining, but it just didn't really feel as good as this one, you don't have that sense of a team and friendship in the first one because they were still introducing to each other and getting together. Here, the chemistry is real. And now that you know the characters, it's a lot easier to relate and feel for them. The emotions are strong with this one, trust me. Also, if you're looking for answers you didn't get in the first one, you will get them here. And finally, another great villain. Not forgettable like in many MCU movies.So, in short, I said everything I wanted about this movie. The plot may be simpler than the predecessor's but this one is so much more enjoyable, heartwarming and emotional. You will want to come back to this one more than the first one. At least I know I will.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everything you want in a movie,"This 45 year old really enjoyed this movie. A must see for all ages. The 1st Guardians did such a good job of character development, and the second did not disappoint. The cast delivers strong performances throughout.Youl'll find the perfect blend of humor, action, with just a touch of romance. Not too much romance to take away from the story. I appreciate this films underlining of family and friendship, too.My 16 year old convinced me to attend the first one because of the 80's music. He told me if I didn't like the movie I would like the soundtrack. The good tunes from the 80's continue in this film.It is pure action from the start. There were times the whole theater erupt in laughter. Guardians is definitely worth the cost of admission.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"A winning combination of infectious energy, gorgeous aesthetic and laugh out loud humour","In 2014, Guardians of the Galaxy catapulted relatively unheard of superheroes into the hearts of millions of Marvel Cinematic Universe fans worldwide. Three years later and looking to jack up their prices as two-time galaxy savers, the Guardians make a triumph return with Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Eschewing the need to outdo the first in terms of spectacle, the sequel offers a more mature and deeper look into the ragtag group of lovable miscreants. The characters once again prove to be the highlight of the show, and by putting the spotlight firmly on them and their relationship with each other, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 delivers a satisfying sequel despite the uneven storytelling.Opening with another memorable credits sequence, we reunite with the Galactic heroes on a new assignment. Hired by a gold-skinned race called the Sovereign to take down a giant inter- dimensional monster eating their planet's power, it's business as usual for the crew. That is until Rocket steals the power that they were meant to be protecting and the crew swiftly find themselves on the run from the Sovereign's fleet of drones. Old habits die-hard after all.Except the chase doesn't last long before the Guardians crash land on a nearby planet. Stranded, they are aided by a mysterious stranger who, if the trailers hadn't already spoiled the surprise, is revealed to be Peter's dad, Ego (Kurt Russell). The father-son reunion forms the crux of the story, and with the group left with few options, they split into two. Ego invites Peter to his home planet, and he follows along with Gamora and Drax, while Rocket and Groot stay to tend to the ship. As the characters break up, the story also splinters into a tangled web of subplots, and there's not much pulling them all together. Each character is given their own arc and we learn a little more about each of them, especially Peter and his relationship with his father, but there's nothing really pushing the story forward. There's no real villain, no imminent threat and only hints of something nefarious bubbling under the surface which lends a decidedly lack of urgency to the center of the film.Having said that, even when the story does slumber, there's always something to distract your senses. The film's presentation is once again stellar and it not only elevates the film but at times it feels like the film gets by solely because of it. The bright, fluorescent colour palette nails the trippy, free spirited 70's aesthetic and locations such as Ego's beautifully, CGI rendered home planet are a feast for the eyes. Much like the first, the film is a marvel (pun intended) to look at.Your ears are also in for a treat as the film's new mix tape (aptly titled Awesome Mix Vol 2.) is another killer. The soundtrack has been carefully curated as an integral part of the film and the inspired song choices reflect that. Drawing once again on classic tunes, the soundtrack is populated by the likes of Fleetwood Mac and Cat Stevens, who perfectly compliment the film's eclectic mix of drama, action and comedy. Even the bizarre addition of an original song called 'Guardians Inferno' sung by David Hasselhoff feels inspired and is likely to be stuck in your head for days after.Despite the mid-film lull, the story does recover, and a late game twist pulls it back into top-form. It's a dark revelation that threatens to pull the group apart but instead serves to bring them closer together. It highlights the strength of the film, that even amidst all the action and razzle-dazzle special effects, it's the characters which standout and endure. Their resolve to stick together as a family, through thick and thin, is what makes the characters so great to follow and the film's heartfelt coda encapsulates this perfectly.It should be noted, however, that those expecting for the film to pave the way for Avengers 3 are going to leave the theatre somewhat disappointed, as the narrative is surprisingly self-contained for this stage of Marvel's Phase 3. While it has been confirmed that the Guardians will appear in the third Avengers film, there's nothing in Vol.2, not even in one of the five (yes FIVE) end-credits sequences, which remotely hints at the Guardians involvement with the Avengers.For that matter, very little at all of what happens seems to have an impact on the overarching MCU universe. While that's not exactly a complaint, given Marvel's penchant for constantly teasing of bigger to come, there's a slight disappointing feeling to Vol 2 that it acts mostly as filler. In the end, however, it's hard to complain when the film is as enjoyable and well made as this. While not exactly the breathe of fresh air that the first one was, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2's winning combination of infectious energy, gorgeous aesthetic and laugh out loud humour more than makeup for the uneven storytelling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It's a pleasure,"Despite the mention of Thanos and five different post-credits scenes, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" is just that kind of Marvel movie that flows very well on its own terms. No MCU infrastructure to maintain, it's free to do its own thing. Which is refreshing, let me tell you.To that end, it's exactly what I was hoping for; the songs are well chosen (The Chain, in particular, one of my very favorite songs) the humor's great, and the story's strong enough to balance new faces (Kurt Russell, Stallone, the Hoff). It's a little saggy in the middle with everyone separating off on their various narrative jaunts, but when the group is together, the movie fires on all cylinders.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Guardians are back & they're freaking better than ever!,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues with the adventures of Peter Quill/Star-Lord(Chris Pratt), Gamora(Zoe Saldana), Drax(Dave Bautista), Baby Groot(Vin Diesel) & Rocket(Bradley Cooper). This film takes place, a couple of months after the events of Guardians of the Galaxy(2014). Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Baby Groot & Rocket have made it a habit of saving, the various planets of the galaxy from imminent threats. Soon, Star-Lord & the rest of the guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego(Kurt Russell) & Mantis(Pom Klementieff). These two new characters might be the key to discovering, the truth about Peter Quill's father.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an incredible movie. Script writer & director James Gunn has definitely kicked things up a notch & has given us, a funnier & more epic sequel. The soundtrack is unforgettable. All the songs on Awesome Mix Tape Vol. 2 are foot-tapping & melodious. The humor in the movie is on par with & even surpasses the humor of the original. The visual effects are mind blowing. This film is a treat for the eyes. All the new planets shown in the movie are gorgeous & you just can't tell that they're all created using CGI. The 3D is awesome, with the majority of the film utilizing the technology, that is a norm for almost all big-budget movies these days. The highlights of the film are the performances & Baby Groot, of course. Chris Pratt is spectacular as Peter Quill/Star-Lord. Pratt expands on his character, adding more depth to his portrayal of Quill. Zoe Saldana is brilliant as Gamora. Saldana also explores new avenues of her character. Dave Bautista is outstanding as Drax. Bautista's portrayal is commendable as he delivers all the best zingers of the movie, to hilarious effect. Vin Diesel is adorable as the voice of Baby Groot. One look at Baby Groot in the beginning of the film & your heart will just melt. Bradley Cooper is excellent as the voice of Rocket. Cooper's portrayal repeats what worked so well the first time, with the anthropomorphic raccoon. Michael Rooker is fantastic as Yondu. Karen Gillan is great as Nebula. Pom Klementieff is funny & super cute as Mantis. Kurt Russell is superb as Ego. Elizabeth Debicki, Chris Sullivan, Sean Gunn & Sylvester Stallone are impressive as Ayesha, Taserface, Kraglin/On-Set Rocket & Stakar Ogord. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a must watch.

"The movie was great, the playlists truly make them what they are.","Bodyguards of Samsung aka Guardians of the Galaxy...S8Do you like action movies? Do you like comedic movies? Do you like unspoken romance that's there but not there but still there? Well I just saw ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" which had all of what was said before. I'd like to give my opinion on this amazing movie.In this movie the Guardians, Starlord, Gamora, Baby Groot, Drax, and Rocket, save the batteries of the Sovereign from the space monster and then battle it out later with the Sovereign due to the Guardians being neither good nor bad. This takes place all over the galaxy. They jump from planet to planet in the ship.I liked the movie because of the dynamic of the characters and also the playlist. The characters work good together with Starlord being very funny and silly and Drax is very serious and literal. The one thing I didn't like about the movie was that it ended. I learned that you shouldn't trust some random guy who says he is your dad and was gone for 26 years. i also think that people can change.Groups of all age will love this movie. The humor can be mature but it wont be inappropriate to the younger crowd. I recommend everyone comes and watches this movie because it isn't too mature or too immature. The MPAA rating of the movie is PG-13. I think this movie is really good and I would give it a 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Canned garbage -- Are the Writers Laughing at us?,"The only redeeming part of this film is that it allows you to think about how fun the first movie was.Two possible theories for why it is so bad:1. they found a group of high school drama students with no creativity to write the screenplay, and all they had was a list of generic plot and character devices to use for ideas.2. the writers purposely wrote in all the canned, tear jerking, feel good plot/character plays they could as a contest to see how good ratings they could get for something they whipped off in an afternoon and knew was garbage.Just horrific if you are looking for anything remotely creative or interesting.

Another Awesome Ride With the Guardians!,"As good as Vol. 1? I believe so. This movie came out just as wonderful as the first. A perfect 10/10 again. From all the Marvel films, Guardians of the Galaxy takes the win and favorite. If you have not yet seen either of the two, I strongly recommend them.Following our favorite bad mouthing heroes, Starlord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and probably everyone's favorite baby Groot. This time though we get to learn some back story's and most importantly who Starlord's father really is. An emotional but funny space journey. Hats off to James Gunn again pulling off another incredible film. From start to finish we get to learn more about these heroes which was left out of the first volume. And with doing so, great jokes and some intense action.One of the reasons I love Guardians so much is the music/soundtrack. Beautiful music that of course comes from Starlord which gives it a much more deep element than just random thrown in music. It is who he is. And glad of the song choices they picked this time round. You almost want to jump up and start dancing.In the first volume, Starlord stuck out and believe you loved him the most. Whereas this one I praise James Gunn on Drax, Dave Bautista who plays him. This character will have you on the edge of your seat laughing. Probably the best jokes come from him. But what is also beautiful is just how kids actually enjoy him much more. Baby Groot of course takes some of the cake for his cuteness. Each character has their own little world which fits perfectly. With new faces to get to know as well. But I also have to mention Michael Rooker's character, Yondu. Again another character who stuck out in this film with more of a backstory and such a step up. An awesome character that is downright B.A. In the comics he is one of the original Guardians but for the film is a Ravager. But how Rooker plays Yondu is absolutely brilliant. I would go as far to say that he deserves an award for such a talented performance along with Bautista.The only downside I saw with this film is how it takes awhile before the story/plot come into play. You sort of wonder where it's going, but by the end of the film, it all comes together. You'll appreciate the way they do it. Otherwise I can't say anything I didn't like about it. Maybe some of the jokes weren't the best, but nowadays movies aren't funny. You will get some great laughs from this film and some great emotions from these characters. Don't miss ""Awesome Mix Vol. 2!"" Or in other words, Guardians of the Galaxy!And don't forget to stay after the credits! Five post credit scenes!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Brilliant but flawed,"Flawed certainly if you're expecting a reprise of part 1 but certainly brilliant in the special effects which are extravagant and mind-numbingly overwhelming. The plot, minimal as it is, continues the saga of the first film but otherwise follows predictable sci-fi/comic-derived paths; character development is also minimal and phony, personal interactions and situations are sentimental and boring used mainly to provide relief from the near constant barrage of sound and explosive visuals; music is triumphal or soft and flowing as befits the screen action. It's also flawed in the sense that they tried to incorporate some of the features that made the 1st film such a surprise and delight: the sparkling, inventive dialogue with its outrageous puns and allusions to the 70's occurs in part 2 but now it's thrown in out of context and totally bewildering in terms of its meaning. Similarly the cassette of 70's music and some songs of the era make predictable appearances but in a casual, pointed and rather nonsensical way. Part 2 takes itself seriously like many other ""save humanity from aliens"" features whereas Part 1 was whimsical and lighthearted where Part 2 is angry, driven and almost brutal at times. I gave Part 2 6 for the captivating, riveting special effects but the other 4 are lost for trying to incorporate features of Part 1 that no longer fit. IMAX 3D is stunning and do sit through ALL the credits; you won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Space Oddity,"The Guardians are back. Bigger, badder, crazier and funnier than ever. However, how does this one size up the original? A film that surprised filmgoers everywhere and took the Marvel empire by storm as an August sleeper hit, three years ago. You can only capture that sense of discovery once, I suppose, but does that really matter in the end? Isn't the whole idea of this franchise to be a goofy, popcorn action flick that gives you more bang for your buck than most multiplexes serve up in a month? Guardians Vol. 2 does that in spades. It's unbelievable fun.All the returning characters have a real sense of longevity as to how likable and hilarious they all are. Like a family reunion, you're amazed by how much you missed them and how much they've grown. The story may seem choppy, but you're having too much fun to notice. The non-stop action made me cackle with glee. The jokes are timed perfectly. The emotional aspect of the drama scenes hit you out of nowhere, and surprisingly, moved me even more than the opening scene in the first one.Let's not forget all the little things that tie the whole thing together. Like the adorable Baby Groot's kiddy antics, cameos by Marvel legends and another blast from the past from Peter's mixtape.

"""Sometimes, the thing you've been looking for your whole life, is right there beside you all along.""","Character-driven ensemble pieces are fast becoming my favorite sub- genre within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. James Gunn takes all the style and flair from his first beloved (and slightly smug) space adventure, and adds a great deal more substance this time around. Too often blockbusters have taken the shortcut to meaningful character development, audaciously implying or declaring their heroes to be a ""family"" without putting in the necessary leg work. Guardians Of The Galaxy is one such movie, but its sequel goes about actually justifying it. It sure as hell earns that smugness.Above all else, it gets its characters right. Gunn's working with a larger ensemble this time, and yet, somehow, nobody feels as short- changed as before. He shrewdly invests in some unexpected pairings, leading to a whole new wave of hijinks, heart and hilarity. This isn't the Peter Quill show anymore. Rocket & Groot aren't the only dynamic duo in the business. Each sub-plot imbues these heroes/anti- heroes with greater depth, even if it's at the sake of the story's momentum. We're able to explore powerful father-son themes, build on relationships featured in the first film, and bask in the incredible chemistry shared between this wonderful cast. Even the various antagonistic figures feel more fleshed out than the shouty-pouty- Ronan - and you're given a very strong reason to hate a few of them here.The film walks a fine tonal line between high stakes sci- fi/adventure and light-hearted comedy - and to its credit mostly succeeds. The timing doesn't always work. Gunn undercuts a few key emotional scenes with the odd tired one-liner, but the goofy self- parody is, once again, quite endearing. This also leans more towards a Star Wars-inspired space opera. The stakes feel naturally higher, and splitting up the core group allows for multiple interwoven subplots - each one separated by a different visually stunning setting. It lends the story a sprawling sense of scale that proves that, in this case, bigger is indeed better.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of The Galaxy Are Back with More Laughs With More Acton With More Cast,"this is one of hell of better sequel then first film never hated the first film i enjoyed the first film i really enjoyed but this is big sequel ever has been made with a lot more funny staff in film makes more laugh then first film, a lot more action in it, a lot of Guardians in film, a lot of story i am not going to write because you have to go and see the film for yourself if your big fan of First film and a lot famous actors playing Cameo's a lot of them i Enjoyed Cool Staff What's in Film the Sequel a lot actors I love cameo actors in it Plot is Always Simple I loved Plot it was very Interesting it shows back story not a lot back story but it shows before 8 years before Peter mother died of cancer in (1980) Ego (Kurt Russell) Escape from New York, The Thing,Tango Cash Ego was in love with Peter mother Meredith Quill encounters Ego who shows her an alien seedling he planted in the woods of Missouri in woods in Kurt Russell i am not going to write what type of character he is because of spoilers i will just keep that way he's performance was good in film not best character in my opinion but he did good in film he looked like he is having fun i liked him in film he did fine. story follows to present day they had action in start with the Guardians of the Galaxy – Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), (Zoe Saldana) Gamora,(Dave Bautista) Drax, (Bradley Cooper) Rocket, and baby Groot still is (Vin Diesel) character steals the show – are renowned as heroes after defeating Ronan the Accuser They are tasked by Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) leader of the Sovereign race, to defend a cache of valuable batteries from an inter-dimensional monster called the Abilisk. i would say her character is boring theirs noting to her character at all it's character you will hate to death she is pretty annoying character but you have funny moments when RocketTease's her it is so Hilarious funny things to her.The Guardians accept and complete the job in exchange for Nebula (Karen Gillan) Gamora sister, who was captured by the Sovereign following the Battle of Xandar from First Guardians of Galaxy film. When it's discovered that Rocket secretly stole several batteries for himself, the Sovereign send a fleet of drones to attack the Guardians' ship, the Milano. Drax going at back of ship shooting enemy's little drones that's great action scene giving Bautista something to do more he is in the all film but in fist he hasn't got much action scenes to do but anyway he does a lot in this film. I Like that Action Scene a lot more it was fun, they crashed into some planet nearby planet, where Ego (Kurt Russell) character appears in all movie with along side with new character Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and single-handed destroys all the drones. After revealing himself as his father, Ego invites Quill accompanied by Gamora and Drax, to his home In Moments you have Yondu Udonta (Michael Rooker) we all know he is Pain in butt in first film but in this they changed his character better in moment scene with Stakar Ogord / Starhawk (Sylvester Stallone) one of my Favorite Actors of all time. him and Michael Rooker Played each another Cliffhanger(1993) but in this film they both have scene together about A lifelong, high-ranking Ravager who has a history with Yondu In past with him and Starhawk sold him out he doesn't want him anymore. i am not going to share that detail what i liked about scene its strong performance i just really wish they got Sly & Michael in longer scene it's Strange because in my opinion Stallone doesn't suit for role for Guardians of Galaxy film not his type but he is their for paycheck he is not really in it maybe Director or writer's didn't give him much to do witch it's shame. About more to do and making more acting performance in film give sly to do more action alongside with Michael Rooker character i really wish that could happened. give Sly and Kurt acting again in this film they all played In One Film They Never Met Each Another Characters never did noting with them it would be cool if they scene with Sly and Kurt in this film have action fight scene or something or acting scene but anyway it doesn't happen. there were a lot of funny moments So you have many funny moments with Groot its so funny makes you laugh more. and this sequel i would say a lot more better not just because new characters or just because its new sequel all that it was just better and it was more fast Paced film it was Guardians are together the first film is great. idea of Michael Rooker Character more of good guy and he becomes character you hate in first film but in this you start to like him a lot great funny jokes makes you laugh out of you ass out of seat. there is something you should not miss towards at end of film there mid post-credit scenes and ending to it never miss something i never wanted to share. 10 out 10 its worth fun watching sequel of all of time i would say its a lot more better first film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Disappointing...a bit,"This Vol. 2 disappointed me a bit. I think it's a goofy movie for kids, but not even since my two kids were not so impressed by this film either. So different from the first one. I believe that the movie is too long, the final battle too long and boring. I had so much expectations for this Vol.2 - I enjoyed the presence of Stallone though.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A Great Sequel to a Great Franchise,"While not as great as the first, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 was still spectacular. It looked great, Ego's planet was one of the best looking settings in the MCU's entirety in my opinion. It's another funny, lovable movie from James Gunn, and while every character has their respective moments, Groot took the show, again. Seeing that even though the team has come together, but they still have problems like a family would was a great aspect to include, especially between Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon and Chris Pratt's Starlord. The same goes for the father - son dynamic between Kurt Russel's Ego and Starlord. Let's not forget the heartstring-pulling performance from Michael Rooker as Yondu. And I can't forget to mention what a perfect soundtrack we got again. Every song makes the scenes they're in even better. Guardians of the Galaxy's franchise is one of the best in the MCU. The more they're included, the happier the fanbase is. James Gunn, the characters and scenes he creates, and the people who help bring his visions to life, are a miracle to Marvel, and I can't get enough of it. This movie was amazing, and I can't wait for another soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a strong sequel and a very entertaining spectacle to watch. Whilst I will never get used to the Marvel ''quip'' that is that quintessential humor. The GoTG sold me over and are one of the few Marvel movies I can stomach.By all means I think whether you like Vol 2 or 1 more is a matter of taste. Personally I much prefer Vol 2, this one. Mainly due to it having a villain that matters, and it's team being more refined, and Yoni. Vol 1 lacked a villain that matter, the part of that movie was entirely forgettable. And sure, the villain of Vol 2 is good as a character, but some plot things (being as powerful as he is) does make you sometimes feel ''cheated'' as if you're playing on easy. That didn't bother me as much though as we know Marvel movies, the baddy always loses. So it's not like I'm ever on the edge of my seat. Without spoilers though, it deserves to exist, this isn't a filler movie.Directing is solid, with the signature colorful and vibrant look and feel of the world. The world they have build I got to say is pretty good. Good variety of creatures and humanoids. And sometimes a shimmer of star wars. Overall though just really good. No odd timings or shots, everything flowed great. Playful cuts going from crazy scenarios or things are ramping up to calm ones/funny ones. The ''kill montages'' are incredible. Yondu's scenes will always be memorable and in my opinion he got his best scenes here. Man when that music kicks in you're just in it. It's so effective.Comedy/humor. Now I struggle a lot with the type of comedy used. Because it tends to work fine for the most part. Mostly the dialog banter is perfectly fine. But sometimes they just ruin a epic moment, with a forced ''kadunk!'' or ''bonk!'' or ''funny'' line that just never allows the scene to land. Like the antenna girl getting hit in the head. At least it served some purpose. But those are the exact type of moments I don't like. The slapstick. Keep the slapstick in dialog and let moments either be fully comedic, or take it serious and let the emotion of the scene continue. This is obviously a huge personal preference thing.CGI/VFX just as good as the first if not better. Really impressive and stunning to look at. Sound effects great too, and nicely balanced sound, no dialog issues.Characters, some nice development here making it a worthwhile movie. Acting, honestly no negatives, everyone was great. No particular standouts either. Just really good overall.Music, fantastic. Maybe Vol 1 was a bit too long ago since I've seen it but I feel like the music here was used more, and more effectively. But I know both movies do it really well, Vol 2 just a tiny bit better. That opening scene, talk about getting hooked.Sequels are always a bit scary when the first was good fun, but this added the much need emotional depth and character development to be a worthy sequel. And better than Vol 1 in most respects.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A bit funnier but mostly the same thing,"""How can you guys be friends? all you do is argue."" asks Gomora's sister. For most of the first half, I confess, I was asking myself the very same question. The script is 80% bickering, which makes Guardians paradoxically entertaining and not. The banter is the film's highlight, but its not easy to invest in a family that only ever points out the worst in each other. Rocket has enough material to be an insult comic.Director James Gunn's strength is his ability to set up laughs both in dialog and in shot. He has a good eye for framing shots to make the most out of the visual gags. Just when you think the movie is starting to take itself seriously, he throws in another punch.Perhaps it could be argued then that his weakness is restraint. The action set pieces are a circus of animation and disorienting camera work, and there are far too many colours on the palette (including pink). When everything is dazzling to look at, nothing is. The climax is an especially shaky fiasco, pitting the guardians against Quill's super villain father and his generic super villain plot involving control of the universe. Here we have Kurt Russell playing Kurt Russell, and never knowing how seriously to take himself from line to line.The script makes it a priority to shed light on Peter Quill, but less for the sake of the character and more for the sake of embedding plot device; Isn't that always the case? It's a shame that Chris Pratt has nothing to bring beyond his face. Even his one liners fall flat, because he takes himself so darned seriously for the camera.Stan Lee gets his usual funny cameo but more unexpected is a guest appearance by Sylvestor Stallone, who is just in the movie long enough (and not too long) to be good.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Awesome and incredible movie,"I really loved the first movie of the guardians of the galaxy, I thought the movie was entertaining, the characters were well developed, and there were even some dark touches that I personally loved. And this movie was no different. In this volume, the guardians have been assigned a mission by the alien race the ""Sovereign"" to protect the planet's batteries from a galactic monster. After defeating it, Rocket steals some batteries, and the Sovereign are after the guardians now. During this movie, we learn more about Quill's parentage, which means Quill learns more about himself. I'm not gonna say any spoilers, but this movie has a major plot twist that I didn't really expect. Over all, this is a great movie that I really like and recommend.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
More comedy than scifi,"The first one is much much better. This is almost a farce. The plot is wafer thin and a lot of the dialog was cringe worthy. I've not seen all the MCU movies, but they're on Disney+ and I've been watching them in chronological order. I stopped this movie around halfway through just to write this review. The only thing I can think is someone made bet, how bad can we make this movie and still rake in a profit? I'm glad I didn't see it in the theater. The visuals are the best part, if you don't care about the plot and the dialog, the visuals probably looked incredible on the big screen. My rating of six is based on the visuals. I'd give this movie maybe a 4 for the plot and dialog. I'm going to try to finish this movie, since I figure something in here is going to carry over to a subsequent MCU movie. Think of the MCU as a book, this movie is one of the many chapters and to follow the book one has to read all the chapters or you miss something in the storyline.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
At times I felt like I was watching Transformers,"It is hard for me to justify 4 out of 10 for this movie. I thought part one was refreshing and different from other superhero movies. However, this one felt forced at everything that part one excelled at. I thought there was just too much music, visuals reminded me of transformers, and story-telling was just that story-telling. It also felt like they tried cramming in too many characters' and their back stories. You get Yondu, Mantis, Nebula, Ego. I would advise waiting for DVD.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Space Rangers go into a new breakaway,"Watching the second part of the space blockbuster about the Guardians of the Galaxy team, you are already tuning in to something similar that you saw in the first movie. This is a wild narrative, unreal beauty of the video series, loose jokes and a truly entertaining movie. And you get it. That's what movies about this superhero team are good for.Colorful battles are flavored with an excellent soundtrack, which is coming back into fashion, pleases the ear and of course gives drive to the picture. The heroes have fun, save the galaxy and do it very inventively. I would like to note that the dialogues are written just fine. It seems that the characters do not seek to insert any joke into the dialogues, and the dialogues consist of jokes. And very good ones. You don't have time to stop laughing and wipe your eyes from tears, as the characters give out a new portion of humor. This is an undoubted advantage of the film.The plot is famously twisted. His main theme is the relationship between father and son. And the film raises serious issues of interaction and confrontation, trust and hypocrisy. And everyone will decide for themselves how much the situation in which the main character Peter Quill finds himself responds. After all, it often happens that true relatives are not as close as the people with whom fate brought them together (the one who saw will understand).The characters continue to develop, and the picture successfully demonstrates this. The whole team begins to realize how much closer they have become to each other. There are conflicts, but they are necessary, otherwise the viewer would not have observed so many humorous situations.The heroes have their own unique features, which make them easy to unravel in the dark. Star Lord strives for leadership, is confident that he is able to achieve the best for the team, loves Gamora and demonstrates this in every possible way. Drax, as always, is straightforward and witty, although he does not understand it himself. He is both brutal and funny. Rocket is on his mind, cares only about himself and Groot, ready to get another limb. For what? Only he knows. Gamora is the soul of the team, energetic and independent, but at the same time the burden of the past presses on her. Groot is beyond any competition. The funny kid has become synonymous with the funniness and cuteness of the film, despite the fact that he is quite belligerent, if necessary.Such a mix of important topics and stunning humor allows you to highly appreciate the work of the entire film crew. The film was created with a love of detail, a keen desire to convey ideas to the viewer.8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Solid sequel but falls short of the excellent original,"The original Guardians of the Galaxy is my favorite Marvel Universe movie and probably my favorite movie of 2014 (either that or John Wick). I was completely unfamiliar with them until the movie, but I loved the characters and the tone. The film reveled in unabashed wackiness in a way that reminded me of stuff like Flash Gordon, Big Trouble in Little China and Howard the Duck (more on Howard in a minute). The sequel is much of the same. This is a really fun movie with great characters, but it does fall short of the original largely due to some narrative restraints.The plot largely revolves around the team finally meeting Star Lord's father (played by one of my favorite actors, Kurt Russell). Star Lord, Drax and Gamora go off to investigate the father while Rocket and Groot are taken as hostages by Yondu's crew (Yondu, played by the awesome Michael Rooker, is the blue guy with the flying arrow). To discuss any further would require major spoilers, so I will leave it at that.The issue with the film is an almost inevitable flaw with a series like this. In any story about the formation of a team, there are four basic stages: Stage 1: The team members don't trust each other; Stage 2: A threat forces the team to learn to work together; Stage 3: Something causes the team to become conflicted and/or separated; Stage 4: A new threat brings the team back together. For reference, Captain America: Civil War is Stage 3 for the Avengers and I'm hoping the next Avengers film will just dive right into Stage 4. Stage 3 is almost always the least entertaining part; it's the dramatic lull before the status quo is returned. It's the film equivalent of a ballad at a metal concert; it's a good time to grab a beer before the fun stuff comes back. The middle act of Guardians 2 is essentially stuck in Stage 3 with the team divided in half and individuals resolving their own issues. It isn't bad, mind you, but watching Peter resolve his daddy issues, Yondu ponder his role in Peter's upbringing and Gamora and Nebula discuss their sibling rivalry isn't as fun as watching them battle space mutants. All of this drags down the pace of the film while the audience waits for the inevitable status quo to return in the form of big space battles. The beginning and end of the film are a hell of a lot of fun, but some running time could have been trimmed in the middle.Now let's address the biggest issue that is weighing on my mind: Disney and Marvel, where the hell is my new Howard the Duck movie? The reveal of Howard at the end of the first Guardians is my favorite post- credit scene since the first Iron Man and it's the only one that has never been followed up on. Sure, we get a glimpse of Howard in this movie too, but he has no lines and is only seen for a second as if to taunt me. I kept waiting for Howard to show up with a bigger role throughout this entire damn movie and, at the end, I was left sitting there duckless like an idiot.Despite a meandering second act and a disturbing anti-duck agenda, Guardians is still a solid sequel that is worth seeing in theaters. If I sound overly negative about it, it's because I love the original and had high expectations that were not quite met. So go see it, enjoy and hopefully I will get my damn Howard the Duck movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"An entertaining and witty film, which is almost completely ruined by silly plot twists and cheese. Thank god for Baby Groot.","Guardians 2 is a clever and entertaining sci-fi / action romp with amazing pop culture references and wit, which towards the end, is almost completely ruined by ridiculous plot twists, poor leads, and layer upon layer of cheese. Thank god for Baby Groot.Peter 'Star-Lord' Quill (Chris Pratt) and his gang of guardians, while getting up to their usual mischief, stumble across Peter's real father Ego (Kurt Russell) – a living breathing planet. Everything seems to be going just fine until Gomora (Zoe Saldana) senses that something is up.Like the first film, Guardians relies on its humour and its soundtrack, which is a fantastic mix of past pop hits. The humour goes deep into slapstick territory on a number of occasions, obviously to impress the kids in the audience. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. At least there were no overly sexual and egotistically lame jokes like Peter's 'Pollock' joke in the first one.Majority of the jokes are pop culture references which are thoroughly enjoyable. That Mary Poppins moment was the icing on the cake. On top of that, there was always Baby Groot to make you laugh. Without his adorable whimsy, some of these scenes would have lost their appeal altogether. That opening credits scene was PHENOMENAL, and such a good scene to set the tone for the film. Wild colours, banging tunes (see Spotify playlist), beautiful monsters, and Baby Groot. I even got used to all the green screen CGI which doesn't often happen. A job well done to the VFX crew.Another stand-out character was Nebula, brilliantly played by Karen Gillam. Her character arc over the course of the film is so involving and you feel sorry for her. She also has a subtle sense of humour that makes her a bit human, despite all her machine parts and general Terminator chic. She's one actress to keep an eye on in the future. I expect great things.Most characters have equal screen time when it comes to humour and they're all pretty good, but special mention must go to Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his speedy fin and arrow scene, and Sovereign High Priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki) and her golden army, who seem like spoilt millennial gamers. However, surprisingly, it's lead couple Peter and Gomora and their love story that is just so mind- numbingly boring and predictable. Gomora is about as much fun as a postal worker, and Peter is just well Chris Pratt – trying to show depth but doesn't quite know the definition of the word.And unfortunately, he brings the plot down with him. The third act (which is way too long) is all about working out his daddy issues which are neither convincing nor particularly interesting, and then when it finally ends, you've got scrolling credits of GIF-like character dances, written dialogue and of course, the after-credits scenes. It went from fun action/adventure to franchise universe overload. Less is more.But, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is overall an entertaining watch. A Saturday night movie to catch with family or friends. Safe fun. Check it out in 3D if you want the full experience.More on moviebarf.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"The best characters/action team in movies today makes ""Vol. 2"" hard not to enjoy","Marvel Studios and writer/director James Gunn proved with 2014's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" that superhero movies don't need to feature familiar (usually white, male, special suit-wearing) characters saving Earth; they just need to be fun, dynamic and easy to relate to. ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" doubles down on its investment in Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) among others, and it pays off.It turns out great characters that have interesting, often-hilarious and sometimes even sentimental interactions with each other can cover up a plot lacking any kind of direction. The film doesn't have a story so much as a few inciting incidents that create complicated scenarios for the characters to navigate. So the best one-sentence plot description is: After completing a job for the snooty, gold- embalmed Sovereign race and ensuing complications, the Guardians discover the truth about Quill's parentage.Gunn sews the movie's story lines into the character dynamics. The Quill-Gamora unspoken romance, the difference in attitude between Quill and Rocket, the animosity between Gamora and Nebula (Karen Gillan) – whom they pick up as a prisoner from the Sovereign — in addition to the verbal sparring between everyone. It's enough, because the characters already won audiences over the first time, and those same audiences will come out of this film even more invested in them.Although Groot, especially in baby form, will have the most fans, Rocket in particular emerges as the Guardians' most fascinating character. This movie is so overrun by CGI, but he feels as real as any of the actors. The character also gets a wider range to work with and Cooper absolutely delivers. Bautista also gets to show even more comedic range as Drax, who becomes more multi-note than simply the proud warrior who doesn't understand figures of speech.The script is so funny, so clever and so focused on blissful sci-fi action moments colored by '70s and '80s music that the finer details of the story are immaterial. The entertainment value is through the roof from start to finish despite the ways the plot seems to lack the appropriate stakes. It survives joke to joke, song to song even when this pattern starts to become a little predictable.So this sequel succeeds in ways that good sequels succeed and struggles with the challenges most of these sequels face. Gunn and Marvel Studios have identified precisely what made the first movie great and bring it even more to the forefront, while the same old conundrum of what situations to put them in plagues this story. So the story takes the form of mostly arbitrary scenarios whose sole job is to set up the characters, humor and soundtrack for success.To evaluate the action sequences would also lose sight of what this movie is. The action isn't interesting; it's more about the character dynamics that play into it and the moments of levity. No moment articulates this better than the opening credit sequence, which features a camera exclusively following baby Groot dancing about as the other Guardians fight a giant space beast in the background. There's a beauty in the way the movie pulls itself away from the noise that so many action movies bombard audiences with, assuming we just can't get enough of it. But if the action is going to be kind of low-stakes like it is here, better to turn it into about something more than just action.If it was close before, ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" beats out ""The Avengers"" for best super-team after this one. In fact, they're probably the best ensemble of characters in any action franchise in the modern era. Each of them brings something unique and consequential to the film. Blockbusters just aren't doing enough of that, and it makes the flaws of ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" effortless to overlook.~Steven CThanks for reading!

"Meets the standards of a Marvel Cinematic Universe film, however...","Look, here me out on this one. I love the MCU, I love James Gunn, and most of all I am a huge admirer of Guardians of the Galaxy. However, I have real difficulty discussing the pros and cons of this film. I cant say it was either really good or just average. Taking the plot into account = quite basic, not the strongest. Character development was quite strong, and there were some fresh faces that were warmly welcomed. I wont say it was BETTER than Vol. 1, but I wont say it was as good either.

Superbly Crafted sequel that fails not to disappoint!,"GOTG2. Just simply does what it was hoped and expected to do. It has built on a wonderful, tongue in cheek and yet surprisingly refreshing original. The original I approached with skepticism, a raccoon, a tree, a blue woman, a pale hulk and a rising ""chisel jawed"" A-lister, amalgamating to save the universe. I own that mistake, for as we all know now it was one of the most refreshing films in the Marvel cinematic experience. This skepticism for the original was almost echoed by knowing the apparently insurmountable objective of expanding the original concept without it parodying itself into oblivion. Once again I was surprised, if not elated at the achievement of the direction, story, the cast and visuals. It is as hammed up as a Christmas pantomime, yet the humour, blatantly obvious at times treats you to almost audience participation. It feels as if you are turning the page of your favourite comic, hoping that you know the next panel in the storyboard and being relieved, at the satisfaction of the well-conceived twist and turn or equally satisfied by the predicted character nuance based response. These are family, you are a guardian of the galaxy recruit. The tongue firmly planted in the proverbial cheek for most assaults on the emotions, it manages to largely avoid groans of soft story writing and delivery by well timed obtuse interjections. Just when you are about to groan at some saccharine infused moment you find are laughing out loud as someone blows the sentimentality out of the water. Prepare to laugh, and laugh a lot which serves to put you off guard for the inevitable emotional polarity shifts, when the rewards for great character development gives rise to losses and strains. You probably can guess the story, you probably will be three comic pages away from knowing the story, but it is with satisfaction these unveil themselves in the crafted art, complimented but not obscured by stunning visuals, amazing special effects and fantastically incorporated soundtrack. Let's face it! It is a must see for those that immerse themselves in the Marvel universe it will satisfy all your hopes for it. For the easter egg hunters. Happy bountiful Easter! For the not so familiar with the comic genre experience on screen. BUY GOTG1, watch it and enjoy and see this before it leaves the big screen.

We need a Drax and Mantis show NOW,"SYNOPSIS:
Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is found by his long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell), and learns a lot about himself. He also finds out that it might not be as good of a reunion that he was hoping for.REVIEW:
A step up from the first film. *Insert outrage and hate in the comments*. Someone had to say it and I'm apparently the only one man enough to admit it. We get a deeper dive into the mental of several characters and it was funnier. Don't get me wrong, I have the same qualms that I had from the first film and I also feel that this movie had a couple of terribly unfunny lines. Like, super cringe. Almost makes it worse than the first film, but not quite. On top of learning about who Peter is, why Yondu (Michael Rooker) and Rocket (Bradley Cooper) are the way they are, why Nebula (Karen Gillian) acts the way she does, how Drax (Dave Bautista) feels deep down behind his strong and cheerful facade. This film gives us so much and then it just throws interactions between Drax and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) in there like we're all angels and saints. We don't deserve those moments, but James Gunn goes ""here, take this, cherish it, hold on and never let go."" Or at least I imagine that's what he would say to us. In this film, I also feel the villain was a genuine threat. I do wish that Starlord wasn't just automatically incredible at what he just found out he could do. Other than that, I really felt this was a strong film with slight potential to do more, but still good nonetheless. 7.6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Based on the Marvel Comics characters, this film still retains most of the fun and action that made the original such a hit.A short time after the events of the first film, the Guardians of the Galaxy, lead by Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), are still travelling through space on their usual adventures. One day, after escaping from a barrage of enemies, the Guardians meet a mysterious man named Ego (Kurt Russell), who claims to be Peter's true father. Ego takes Peter to his homeworld, where he intends to live with and be a true father to him. However, the rest of the Guardians feel something doesn't seem right and investigate what Ego's true intentions really are.Filled to the brim with dry humour, great action, a catchy soundtrack, a funny Stan Lee cameo, and the rest of the Marvel film staples, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a worthy follow-up, although it does lack some of the freshness and surprise that was in the 2014 original. I particularly enjoyed the extended character development given to characters Drax (Dave Bautista) and Yondu (Michael Rooker). Once again, though, it is Vin Diesel as (Baby) Groot who steals the show in just about every scene he is in. As to be expected, there are some post-credits scenes to stay back for, five of them to be precise.I rate it 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Just what i expect from James Gunn,"OK let star the review saying this How Adorable and sweet Baby grood is , he stole my heart the moment that he star dancing in the middle of a small battle what a star.Movies was just what I expect from a James Gunn Production , quality and color where amazing just what Marvel needed. Character development was good no to fast no to slow. I think in this one the importance of the movie were in making a connection with each other.But Since I am talking about family and character development, Ego of the Living Planet(Kurt Russel) I am going to be honest I had my doubts about him and this character. At first I was reluctant to like him but as the movies when alone I star surprise liking his character more and more, I like that development it was just the right touch and the big empty space that our dear star lord has always had about his dear daddy. But not everything is in a sweet dream, as the drama and comedy when alone I kind find my self wondering how was the Villain in this story but I would never ever even imagined that it was going to be him I knew that he want to dominated the Universe and make them bee as his imagine but I never though he would have kill Peter Mother's come one. I think that twist make the final touch to James Gunn, he did really catch me out in this one.Gamora and Nebula relationship as sister when I even beyond death, I think that development of this two was good, we know for sure that there would be more of this two in a future movies.I like Yondu in the first movie but in this movies I even like him more and more that I could even like. Yondu show us the principal value of sacrifice yourself for those that you love most and he did. he show us that no matter how many things wrong you have do wrong there is always around to make up.The concept that James Gunn brought thru the movie not only shows to people like me and younger audience that Family and friendship are very important.Overall it was a excellent movie the comedy and sarcasms was just in point , it was just as a roller-coaster ups and down but with a define beautiful end Cannot wait for Guardians VOL 3",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"So far the worst hero movie of the year, disappointed me a lot.","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 had an absurd Hype, much of it obviously for the first film that is very good, and without a doubt top 5 best films of this cinematic universe of Marvel, and I was very excited, until leaving the trailer, of all Trailer of this movie I found everyone weak, and trailer is something important, but I hoped that at the time of the movie would be different and unfortunately I was very disappointed in the film, a superhero movie does not have to be something complex or so different, but it is a plot Zoe Saldana as Gamora is the best thing about this film, its relation with the Nebula, played by Karen Gillan. Is the best part of the movie, but the other arch are very annoying, Dave Bautista like Drax I found it very annoying in this movie and also in the past, it was a lot better, it even annoys his innocence, The Groot I think it's cool that he was just a baby, Kurt Russel, that Ego Peter Quill's father disappointed me, his scenes are very problematic, and his relationship with Quill did not convince me, and Michael Rooker As Yondu commands very well, Yondu next to Gamora are the best characters of the film, the outcome of the film is very good, I liked it a lot, not to mention that it is very exciting too, but the film has a serious problem of tone, sometimes He tries to mix a lot, the comedy of the film is very exaggerated, in the first film he was well balanced, in that it is very exaggerated, not to mention that they want to put music everywhere and this is very annoying in my opinion, and sometimes a scene that Was to be dramatic or epic and spoiled by it, the direction of James Gunn is good in some aspects, but he leaves it to be desired in others, the CGI of the film is well done, and the script is a bit confusing, sometimes happens a lot Thing in a short time, the film has 5 scenes post-credits and 4 of them Are unnecessary, only 1 was interesting, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 can please anyone who loves this formula of marvel, but in my opinion is one of the worst movie in the universe of Marvel, I hope that if you have a third party they do not exaggerate in jokes outside Hour.

I am Groot,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a whole heap of fun. The film really gives you enjoyment. American superhero film based on a comic book by Marvel comics. The film was directed by James Gunn, who is known as the screenwriter of the film Scooby Doo. Legendary actors such as Bradley Cooper, Chris Pratt, Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell starred in this film. The atmosphere of the film is really amazing. Guardians of the Galaxy continue to explore the space while helping Peter Quillen to learn more about its true origin. The film captures the hearts of millions of people with baby Groot (this is so cute). Once again, we hear the music of the eighties that sends us to the past. Incredible visual effects and production design allow us to take in the film. A well-crafted plot makes no odds to leave without a smile after watching the movie. In the film, we find out who's the father and who's just a dad I fell in love with this movie. I believe it will be one of the most successful movies by Marvel. Good luck, enjoy!

OK...I guess.,"The first thing that went through my mind after I left the theater was:Too. Much. CGI.Don't get me wrong: I love some epic battles, but here it just felt constant to the point of nausea. Where's the suspense if our heroes survive a score of against-the-odds fights? Yes, we all know the hero(es) must win one of those in a any of these movies. But half a dozen or so? Come on. At some point nothing feels like a threat anymore. And certainly the CGI doesn't help. Yes it's pretty, but it feels pointless despite (or maybe just because of) its obvious over-prettiness. It's one 'oh golly' scene after another. When will Hollywood learn that that doesn't work?On the positive side: What we do get are some good moments from Nebula and Gamora, Yondu and Rocket - and of course Baby Groot steals the show (not a good sign when your best character is a CGI creature with only one line of dialogue). The other characters (including Pratt's lead and Russel's villain) came off as very superficial (I know that Drax is supposed to be that - but his kind of cringe/toilet humor just doesn't do it for me).Speaking of humor: I dunno. The first movie seemed to have this down better. It's like they were trying too hard this time around. The 'duct tape' scene was genuinely funny, though, I'll give them that.The music: Also very forgettable. Is this the best they could scrounge up for an 80's mix tape? I didn't recognize a single song (and yes, I grew up in that time period).So is it a good movie? No. It's passable. A textbook example of a sequel. Something that will either be forgotten if the third installment is good, or will be marked as the point when the franchise went downhill.Do I want to watch a sequel? Probably not. What I would totally watch is a spin-off featuring Stallone's Ravager's, though!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
One of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).,"'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY VOL. 2': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)The highly anticipated sequel to the blockbuster 2014 superhero flick 'GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY', based on the Marvel comic book of the same name. The film is once again written and directed by James Gunn, and all of the original's starring cast return as well; including Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Sean Gunn, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel. They're joined this time around by Kurt Russell, Elizabeth Debicki, Pom Kelmentieff, Chris Sullivan and Sylvester Stallone. The story this time deals with the Guardians helping Peter Quill learn more about his father, who he meets for the first time. The movie has received mostly positive reviews from critics (just like the first) and it's a blockbuster at the Box Office so far as well (just like the first). I loved it.The story begins in 2014, when Peter Quill, also known as Star-Lord (Pratt), and his friends, are now all well known (across the cosmos) as 'The Guardians of the Galaxy'. They're hired by the Sovereign race to protect valuable batteries from a giant space monster. In exchange they're given Gamora's (Saldana) sister Nebula (Gillan); who was trying to steal the batteries for herself. Upon leaving, Rocket (Cooper) also steals some of the batteries, for no apparent reason, and the Sovereign race hunt the Guardians down for it. They crash on a planet close by, after being rescued by Peter's father Ego (Russell). The Guardians then help Quill get to know his dad, for the first time. Things are not all as they seem though.The movie is once again full of colorful characters and visuals. It's also full of witty jokes, decent performances (which are all very well cast once again), exciting action scenes, and an awesome soundtrack (featuring Brandy, by the Looking Glass, which is a karaoke song I've done hundreds of times before). The film, this time around, is not quite as original, creative, action-packed or as hilarious as the original though; it does all of those things well, but just not quite as well as the first film. It is once again filled with great character development though (including a lot of psychology and family drama), and very touching dramatic scenes; this is where this sequel actually outdoes the original (I cried more times in this movie than in it's predecessor). Gunn gives it his all once again, and he definitely delivers (it is a near perfect film). When the original is as classic as it is though, it's almost impossible to top the second time around. I still give the movie 5 stars though, and it is one of the very best films so far this year (that's for sure).Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/rLEEz_CHZwo",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Not as good as the first,"I thought Kurt Russell did a great job and was a fine addition to a great cast. I thought the story line was eh and they were trying to hard to get you emotionally attached to what most people see as a funny group. Also, I HATE this move by Hollywood to try and make Chris Pratt out to be heartthrob stud. It failed in Passengers and scene in GotG2 where he is shirtless was as bad as the butt scene in Passengers. Pratt is best when he is an everyday, likable Joe IMHO. All in all, it is still an enjoyable flick and worth a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Gunn's weapon is already loaded with happiness.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 introduces Baby Groot, a collectible figurine that's been brought to life. With exacting awareness and only slight edge of shame, the movie deploys its newfound mascot whenever the movie needs a boost. His minuscule smiles are irresistible, but his miniature scowls are just as winning. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is as reminiscent of the Fast & Furious franchise as it is the first film. They're a ragtag group of former criminals who've found themselves semi-accidentally on the side of saving the day. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 plays like a grand version of the sort of sitcom episode in which it looks like someone might leave the show, and then of course they do not.Testing the strength of the Guardians' connections would come across as more meaningful if it felt like they'd actually spent enough time together. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 attempts to tell a funny, heartfelt story about identity, loneliness, and belonging by way of a planet that has a face. Chris Pratt's reliably charismatic, but he's coasting on his appeal in this installment. Gamora, too, feels like she's in stasis, in both her not-quite-romance with Quill and her combative relationship with her sister Nebula.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Just as good as you hoped, maybe more.","Guardians Vol. 1 was easily my favorite of the Marvel movies to date. I didn't think Marvel could ever top that effort. But Vol. 2...it's making me reconsider...Listen, I shouldn't have to tell anyone to go see this. If you're reading this review, you've probably already made up your mind about seeing it. So, I'm just going to offer a bit of friendly advice:See it in IMAX. It's gorgeous.Be prepared for another fantastic soundtrack.The cast gels just as well as they did the first time, even with the new editions. In particular, I should note that Michael Rooker (Yondu) is a better actor than anyone gives him credit for, and his acting chops are on full display in this one.Kurt Russell as Ego is great.You're going to laugh. Try to limit your sips of soda to between major scenes. (And to the guy who sat in front of me...I'm sorry.)You're going to feel feelings, especially during the spectacular ending. Tissues are advised.Guardians Vol. 2 gets a 5 out of 5, but that was a given. The real question is, is it better than Vol. 1? Personally, I think it's VERY close, but I'm leaning towards Vol. 2. Maybe I need to go back and watch Vol. 1 again for some clarity, but one thing is for certain, both movies are good enough to warrant the debate. I liked the soundtrack to Vol. 1 a little better, but that's just an issue of personal taste. I also think Vol. 2 was a bit funnier. Both endings were great, but Vol. 2's final act really gave me goose bumps, and I legitimately sat on the edge of my seat, pulling for everyone to make it out alive.So, again...5 out of 5.

""Guardians of the Galaxy"" is an entertaining film with good and understandable humor. Despite this type of film, the history of the characters is not scored.The characters were very very well drawn, especially the raccoon Rocket and Baby Groot. I believe that audience should watch this film on the big screen to feel all the beauty of graphics.

The Learning Curve Movie,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is the sequel to the highly successful surprise hit of 2014 and damn, you gotta give James Gunn credit for that movie. It's hilarious and he managed to get a group of characters to the point where you understood the motivations of all of them, but they also managed to function as a very cool team.You would think with Vol. 2 that now it's the easy part. They'll go on a mission together, the sarcastic ones will tell some jokes, we'll get to know a bit more about Gamora's dad Thanos, Peter will give us another Awesome Mix Tape, Baby Groot will say ""I am Groot"" over/under 500 times and there you go.But while we can see snippets of the characters we loved so much in the first film, this movie is strange. Like there's no real plot to speak of but I don't think I was even able to realize that til about an hour in. It's very involved. Like most second movies it's trying to figure out where it should go from here, just not always successful.Basically the Guardians have been lending their services out around the Galaxy, then Kurt Russell turns up as Peter's dad and he turns out to be a celestial planet whose been built into bio-form. So we'll get some bonding over harnessing Cosmos and classic rock, but never with the amount of feeling you might expect.While Peter, Gamora, and Drax hang out on Planet Daddy, B-Groot and Rocket are in a pickle with Yondu and have to help him. So the group is separated from most of the movie and I felt it ate into some of the comedy.There are other subplots like a will they or won't they romance between Peter and Gamora (which, you won't care), there's one about the Guardians pissing off the head of some Sovereign race (you can tell they're Sovereign cause they're done up like Oscars) and they keep coming back for a fight, Stallone also shows up in another.Nebulla is brought in too because Gamora also needs some kind of family drama to deal with while Peter deals with his. I actually thought Nebulla would be the villain here but it appears Marvel has fixed it's villain problem.by keeping the villain a secret til the last half hour. He's still bent on world destruction though.But listen- all of this really does come off like Gunn is just trying to keep 10 plates spinning at once but it's not really bad so much as it's just hard to hang on to for long. There is still some fantastic stuff here and for every joke about Cheers or David Hasselhoff that seems played out, there are others that work excellently.Drax doesn't get much to do plot-wise but Bautista couldn't do a better job of playing him. Drax is a lunatic, that big laugh just makes him more of a lunatic, and when he does a joke or a prank with a straight face; he is comedy gold. Rocket also brings the sarcasm, B-Groot is cute.The action is also as cartoon-like over-the-top as it was in the first film, and Gunn gives us a humdinger of an ending battle sequence. His effects work here is like the best acid trip you've ever been on and he really does have a gift for attaching music to all this.So overall, if you loved the first movie, you'll like this one. But this is a movie that's going to be overrated before people even see it. Some will expect more, some will just overblown the whole thing cause they love these characters. I think as we look back on it, it will be the movie in the series we'll all call fine but that was definitely a learning curve.I go 6.5 out of 10.

Wisecracks and CGI don't make a good movie,"One of my favorite scenes from original Guardians of galaxy was the escape from the Xandar jail. There were some great comic moments, good teamwork, genuine moments of curiosity how the team will be able to break free. When you replace a good script with CGI explosions, you don't get the same impact. It is disappointing to see that after more than 10 movies later, Marvel still relies on the good old ""explosions and punches solve the problem"" technique. I understand the logic behind action in Avengers but I have never been a fan of cheap looking CGI climaxes, be it in X-men Apocalypse, Thor movies or Suicide squad. There is a reason that The Winter Soldier is still considered to be the best MCU movie so far with far more humane action and restrained with such great quality on television and Netflix we are getting, anything less than extra ordinary seems sub-standard.The movie in one world is about Parenting, more specifically about Peter Quill finding his father and how other events unfold which endangers the entire galaxy. Movie starts with some real promise, story lines seems to be really intriguing in the beginning when the team splits up and go on their own individual adventures. What follows in 2nd half of the movie is less than satisfactory in terms of storyline, the novelty factor wanes off and it starts feeling like any other generic Marvel movie where even world ending stakes don't feel much.That being said, it is quite a fun movie, better than a lot of movies proclaiming to be comedies. Drax, baby Groot, Rocket, even the newly added characters such as Mantis make sure you are laughing out loud many times in this movie. Even if you are not a fan of Marvel's movie making rule of 4 jokes per minute, this movie's humor level is much better than anything seen so far, it even beats Avengers in that regard.It is definitely a watch, you will have a great time during its 130 minute runtime, its the hollow feeling once you have left the theatre which is the main concern.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Different species of nice characters talk then along comes bad characters to spoil these quiet moments.

It has Russell and Stallone who are legends from the 1980s along with references to KNIGHT RIDER and David Hassellhoff which will mean absolutely nothing to younger audiences and the nature of the film means more discerning mature audiences like myself will be bored by the constant noise and bluster.

"""Vol. 2 - The Awesome Mix""","There isn't much to say about 2017's ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" that probably hasn't been said already, so I'm just going to try to break it down into a few pointers/highlights.Writer/director James Gunn. I am continually impressed by this jokey, enthusiastic former Troma alumnus who has certainly come a long way SINCE his Troma days, and the gross-out horror of ""Slither"" (2006) and his first superhero effort, the black comedy ""Super"" (2010). You can tell that the ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" series for Marvel are probably the films he's been wanting to make for the longest time.James Gunn, again. Gunn is a true smart-aleck, and his film is rife with witty one-liners and clever dialogue that shows that while his budgets have increased ten-fold, he still retains his smart-aleck sense of humor that characterized much of his earlier, smaller-budgeted work. And he makes his laughs, and the timing of those laughs, count.The cast - Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (pro wrestler Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). What can I say? The central themes of this sequel are family, and the ties that bind. While Gunn's script kind of hits us over the head with this, it is clear that a cinematic family of sorts has been formed, amongst these hard-luck losers of petty crooks and fugitives-turned-mercenaries-for-hire, and they all appear to be having a blast in their roles - especially Chris Pratt, who before ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was known primarily for his role on ""Parks and Recreation"" and has lost a considerable amount of weight, beefed up, and shaped himself into a capable leading man.The music. The film has a score by Tyler Bates, but its main soundtrack is comprised of old-school hits primarily from the 1970s, which gives ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a kind of self-knowing retro-hipness that shows that while it's set in outer space and in another galaxy, its roots are firmly in the distant past, in far simpler times that Our Hero Star-Lord clings to desperately even as he embraces his new role as the leader of a mis-matched group of interstellar heroes.That's all that I really have to say about ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"" which is an even more Awesome Mix than the first.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Tried too hard, but it was enjoyable.","The bad: I felt like they missed the mark on the scenes that should tug on your heart strings. Believe me, they tried. But I wasn't emotionally attached. The dialogue left much to be desired. They injected too much humor. I wasn't as connected to the characters as the first one. The fight scene near the beginning wasn't hitting the spot. You'll know what I mean when you see it. I'm sure some people loved it, but not me. That sets the tone for the movie, and they didn't pull me in then.The good: Acting. The characters were top notch. They did the best they could with the script and storyline they had. The action scenes were (mostly) good.

Ummmm...,"I so wanted to love this film, as I did the first one. I guess then that the danger with having hit the bullseye first time is that you can only go one way... Which is not to say this film is a total ""bust"". It's not, and with characters that worked so well in the first film it would be hard to make a complete turkey. But here's the thing... it's WAY too long, and there are a LOT of sequences when nothing much happens, or if it does you don't really care. The plot is fairly ridiculous, but then it's a Marvel film so you're not expecting Hitchcock. At times it does moralise a LOT about families and family values and all that, and fair enough families are important, but it gets a bit sappy in parts. The good points are the action sequences, and there are a fair few of them, Rocket has much more screen time this time (a good thing), and Baby Groot is cute. Drax's character though only just about comes off this time, and Quill is a tad wasted in his parts. So is it worth a couple of hours of your time? Well... it would definitely be worth 90 minutes or so, for sure. My cousin and I just thought that over 2 hours stretched things too far. In addition to which if you're wanting to hear ""Fox On The Run"", which we were, it's not in the film at all, unless you count the end credits, and a long way down in those...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guardians of the Solar System,"When Guardians of the Galaxy came out in the late summer of 2014, the world once again fell in love with an admirably ambitious, yet uncharacteristically shaggy space opera. It was at once a travelogue, an adventure story and an ensemble piece that smartly borrowed from golden-age blockbuster ephemera to give us something truly ballsy for the time. The fact that the potential franchise was yet another loop in the Marvel Cinematic Universe's rapidly expanding armor was but the icing on a very fulfilling and very expensive cake.Three years later, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is put in a very precarious situation. Due to the MCU being a nay unstoppable force at the cineplex, the exploits of Peter Quill and his band of bickering mercenaries no longer have the element of surprise. Quality special-effects, impeccable casting, expert-level character work are now not just unexpected surprises, their bare minimum pass/fail aspects of these kinds of movies. Show me a villain with world-destroying ambitions; yawn. Find me a roguish, white, male, American lead with daddy issues; next. You have a talking racoon, they have a Hulk.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 picks up with our motley crew cashing in on their savior status while working for a civilization known as The Sovereign. After defeating an inter-dimensional monster to the crunchy tunes of Electric Light Orchestra, the plot is kicked into high gear when Rocket (Cooper) steals a handful of powerful batteries. This puts the Guardians on a collision course with The Sovereign, Yondu (Rooker) and his returning band of space pirates, the revenge seeking Nebula (Gillan) and a new character, that just might hold the key to Peter's (Pratt) lineage.Part of the reason for the original film's success was its ability to feel fresh and new while never doing anything actually risky. Even so, the finished product managed to artfully ape irreverence and feel organic; a mix that Marvel fans ate up if only for the sake of novelty. Here however everything seems to be stapled into the same world as the rest of them, complete with perfectly mimicked story-beats and predictably playful Easter egg hunts. If one were to pick a spiritual forebear to Guardians 2 it'd be Iron Man 2 (2010) who similarly took the runaway success of its prequel and made everything more self-contained and character oriented. Some may claim that means it's more intimate, I'd claim it feels like the series is running in place until the rest of the larger universe catches up.At least this movie isn't as sloppy and emotionally empty as Iron Man 2. We can thank that on the fact that the Guardians are a goofball ensemble and not just one goofball pining for a liquid lunch. James Gunn's script, while lacking the gusto of the original, takes a few decent cues from Empire Strikes Back (1980). It finds an opportunity to split our cast early and forces them to examine their own particular hangups to the structure of clever bookmarked editing. This guarantees that if a plot point does become sloppy or uninteresting at least the integrity of the film proper doesn't suffer for it.Guardians 2 also benefits greatly from a unifying theme, that being an honest examination of family and what being part of a close-knit group of people truly means. Both Peter and Gamora (Saldana) go through struggles of blood and birth, Yondu opens up about his fidelity to Quill, Rocket comes to terms with knowing the very people he's pushing away aren't going to give up on him. If a short straw is to be drawn thematically it goes to Bautista's Drax whose only real task is to assimilate newcomer Mantis (Klementieff) into the fold. Yet even then his mirthful laugh and steely unironic gaze serve some of the only moments of true feeling in a movie alarmingly light on them.At its best, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a mildly entertaining romp through a visually pleasing space-age universe complete with a likable gallery of oddball characters. At its most craven and cynical however, the film feels like nothing more than a stopgap. One who clumsily mistook the forfeiting of stakes for irreverence and thought a barrage of forced 80's references was a substitute for wit.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2""- A laugh-out-loud and wildly entertaining follow-up that is almost derailed by a messy first act, but quickly corrects itself and delivers!","The first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" was a magical film, and one of those rare examples of ""fun"" in its purest form. Seeing it in a packed theater with the right audience was mind-blowing, and it was a joy seeing everyone come together to just have a blast with its delightful characters. But even beyond that, it was also an expertly written, often stirring and enthralling and even sometimes surprisingly emotional work thanks to the talents of director James Gunn and his wonderful cast. Heck, the first movie literally had a scene where a gun-toting, smack-talking raccoon cried because his living-tree best friend appeared to die... and I heard more than a few sniffles coming from the audience. It was clearly doing something right and pressing all of the correct buttons.And I'm more than happy to report that despite a shaky first act that nearly lost me, Gunn's follow-up ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" delivers much of the same high-quality entertainment of its predecessor. It's got all of our favorite characters, an intriguing new story filled to burst with shocks and laughs, and the same big heart that made part one such a rampant success. It might be a tab bit rough around the edges... but it pulls through and gives you more of exactly what you want to see.The Guardians may be in over their head when member Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) decides to steal some tech from a race of prestigious beings known as ""The Sovereign,"" who respond by attacking the them and leaving them stranded on an uncharted alien world. Luckily enough, they soon are greeted by the mysterious god-like Celestial being ""Ego"" (Kurt Russell), who offers to help them because, well... he also just so happens to be the long- lost father of their leader Peter Quill, aka ""StarLord."" (Chris Pratt) While Peter catches up with his father, the other members of the team are off on their own adventures, as Gamora (Zoe Saldana) tries to settle the score with her sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax (Dave Bautista) takes a liking to Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff) and Rocket and Groot (voice of Vin Diesel) are forced to team up with former-Ravager captain Yondu (Michael Rooker), after the three are captured during a mutiny while the Ravagers try to retrieve the Guardians for a hefty bounty.The film did initial have me at a bit of a worry. After a spellbinding and hilarious opening action set-piece set to the iconic ELO masterpiece ""Mr. Blue Sky"", the film does dip into convoluted territory for much of its first act. There's just a bit too much going on a bit too quickly, as new characters are established, old characters are re- established, and an intricate web of sub-plots and B-story lines are set up. It almost lost me for a few minutes there. And I worried the whole film would feel overstuffed and aimless. But fear not, because Mr. Gunn knows exactly what he's doing, and every single thing that it established early on pays off in the later sequences. It might not seem like it at first... but there's a grand plan at play. So I can easily forgive the fact that the first twenty or so minutes doesn't flow particularly well. The pacing and focus quickly corrects itself, and we can see why it needed to speed through so much, so quickly.Much like the original, a great part of the success of the film lays on its incredible cast. Every single returning player is a phenomena, especially Pratt and Rooker, who are given a lot of emotional pay- off in the film as they deal with their respective issues and arcs. The new cast members are a welcome addition. I especially must give major praise to the genius that is Kurt Russell. I've always been a fan of his, especially in his ""crazier"" work. (""Big Trouble in Little China"" in my opinion being his greatest film.) And he's just outstanding here as the rugged and hilarious and sometimes questionable god-like being Ego. It's the perfect casting.Writer/director James Gunn is clearly having the time of his life, and his giddy attitude adds a lot to the proceedings. The first ""Guardians"" most certainly had his fingerprints all over it, but you got a feeling that he was perhaps holding back a bit. But for the sequel? He goes full-on insane in all the best ways! There's so many jokes. So many cameos. So many references. It's just crazy to think about how many zany details Gunn threw in, and I'm sure there's dozens of more in the background that I missed. Every single frame is saturated with pure Gunn mayhem, and I loved it. From the seemingly random insertion of familiar 8-bit video game sound effects into a number of action scenes, to entire sequences written around kitschy old pop-songs, to a climactic moment that I won't spoil, but I'm pretty sure was a giant ""Screw you!"" gag aimed at a recent high- profile critical disaster... It's so delightfully loving and geeky. And I can't wait to see what Gunn has up his sleeve for ""Vol. 3!""While I do have to dock a few minor points for my issues with the first act of the film, I can't see any fan of the original walking out disappointed. It's not only a great new addition to the ever- expanding Marvel Cinematic Universe... it's just a great, fun film, period. I attended a sold-out screening, and the laughter and cheers and whoops from the audience brought me right back to that same magical feeling I had watching the original. You done good, Mr. Gunn. You done good.I give ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" a fantastic and near- flawless 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (2017) Review - 8.4/10,"This is one of the most underrated films in the entirety of the MCU. In my opinion, it's the funniest MCU film, the action isn't the best, but they make up for it with a compelling villain, in Ego.

Nothing to Write Home About,"First, don't get me wrong. It was definitely a visually stunning movie with the same light-hearted characters we all came to love in Volume 1. However, things all seemed a little forced and cheesy in the second volume. I thought, personally, there could have been a little bit more action and less expository between the characters. I am all about character development, but every scene seemed to be another sad sob story with another one of the characters. Also, in the end, it never really seemed like the universe ever needed saving.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Perhaps not as spectacular as the first entry, but nonetheless exciting, funny, and visually stimulating as it needs to be","When Guardians of The Galaxy first hit the cinema multiplexes in the summer of 2014, it was a surprising success, especially for a superhero film based on comic books that very few knew about. Grossing around a quarter from crossing the billion-dollar mark, it was fairly predictable for a sequel to see the light of the day. This second installment, which helms director and writer James Gunn as the conductor, brings back our favorite heroes from the first film and places them in an all-new adventure. While this film made the score as a wild crowd-pleaser with its clever humor and tense, special-effects-laden galore, this one perhaps marks a just a slight stepback from its predecessor. Cutting back by a fraction on its zany, light-hearted tone in favor of deep character development and heart, this film delivers the fun and excitement with only a few flaws that go marginally noticeable. This film focuses on the Guardians: Peter Quill/Star Lord (played by Chris Pratt), Gamora (played by Zoe Saldana), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), Drax (played by Dave Batista), and the now Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). The team travels to a distant planet where they come across a celestial named Ego (played by Kurt Russell) who happens to be Peter's long-lost father. The team soon sets out on an intergalactic adventure to discover the mysterious of Peter's strained past.Whereas the first installment ran off the chains with non-stop cheekiness and balls-to-the-walls humor, this movie takes a small step back to take a deep exploration into the characters, most particularly Peter Quill. This endeavor opens doors to a more powerful emotional core that taps into the heart strings. That is not the say the film does not leave any room for some light-hearted banter between the characters along with gut-busting one-liners. Although a small portion of the sexual innuendos tend to fall flat, the character certainly prove to be fighters for stealing the show from each other. The main driving force of the plot here is themes of family, that is where the dynamics of the father-son relationship between Peter Quill and Ego comes in. The story spends a portion of time diving into the relationship between Peter and his father, and what accounts is some emotionally resonating sequences that are surprisingly moving. But that is not all, the relationship Gamora and Nebula (played by Karen Gillian) is also greatly explored here, though perhaps not as ambitiously. The family dynamics result in numerous (and occasionally clunky) tonal shifts throughout the picture. Along the side, the film doesn't fail to fuel the adrenaline tank with visually stunning action sequences including spaceship battles and countless CGI explosions to keep things moving at a reasonable pace. And much like the previous movie, serving the backdrop of nearly every scene is a sweet classic 70s soundtrack to establish the cheeky mood of the story.The majority of the cast from the previous installment returns, each of them is good as ever. Chris Pratt, the likable guy he is, returns with a sheer amount of charisma and humor to his role. His humanistic performance serves as a supporting factor for his chemistry with new-face Kurt Russell who plays his father. The two share a strong emotional chemistry that greatly serves as a driving force the story. For fans of Russell, the actor never disappoints from his opening screen time, to the final act. Zoe Saldana is very strong in her role, boasting a fair amount of humanity with her emotional bond with Karen Gillian's Nebula. Bradley Cooper returns as the voice for the loud-bantering raccoon Rocket and continues to deliver one hilarious one-liner after another. Professional wrestler Dave Batista puts some great effort into the role of Drax, adding both humor and sentimental value to his already comedic figure. Groot who is now shrunk down to baby form is sustained by the voice of Vin Diesel who like the last film, never reaches a departure outside his signature lines ""I am Groot"". This little character is cute the second he appears on screen, and never fails to deliver the charm. Michael Rooker does his job as Yondu, another returning character. Sylvester Stallone makes a surprise appearance here as well, although his screen time is reduced to no longer than five minutes or so. Then there is Pom Klementieff as a telepathic mantis who swarms with a slice of humanity to her character, as well as a pinch of comedic chemistry with Dave Batista's Drax. If there is anything that chews at the clever chemistry between these characters, it is most likely the long separation between these characters with Peter, Gamora, and Drax spends a large amount of time on one planet, and Rocket and Groot on another, thus reducing the hilarious banter that contributes to these character's likability.Guardians of The Galaxy: Volume 2 is a fun follow-up to the 2014 original, with a fair amount of energy, heart, and humor to satisfy moviegoers of a various demographics. It's certainly not as polished as the previous entry, but that very little to bar from the insane amount of fun this movie is. This movie is an early summer blockbuster that is virtually impossible to doubt for reaching a phenomenal box office receipt by the end of the summer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Just as enjoyable and funnier than the first movie.,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just as enjoyable and funnier than the first movie that was a surprise hit at the box office in 2014. There was no way that you had the ""I've seen it all before feel"" nor was it recycling ideas from the first movie for the sake of it. The original cast returns and it was a delight to see them pick up where the left off from the first movie.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 sees the return of Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper), and Baby Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). This time, the misfit quartet have been hired by Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), leader of the Sovereign race to protect valuable batteries from invaders in exchange for Gamora's estranged sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), who was caught attempting to steal the batteries. After it is discovered that Rocket has stolen some batteries for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. When the Guardians crash land on a mysterious island, they are rescued by a mysterious figure who reveals himself to be Quill's long lost father, Ego (Kurt Russell) who offers to take him back to his home. The antagonistic Yondu (Michael Rooker) also returns but finds himself forming an alliance with the Guardians to prevent another threat against the universe which nobody saw coming.Chris Pratt, once again, is a delight to watch on screen and he makes a welcome return as Peter Quill/Star Lord. Zoe Saldanda, Dave Battista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Michael Rooker also return in their respective roles from the first movie. Kurt Russell is one actor that can do no wrong and here he is fantastic as Ego. Sylvester Stallone pops up in a small role which may possibly pave the way for a bigger role in a sequel. Baby Groot had the best role in the entire movie.The story keeps the movie interesting, the stars light up the screen, the visual effects are dazzling, the are plenty of perfect moments of humour, and the soundtrack just puts a smile of your face.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is another winner for Marvel Studios and the sequel is a welcome addition.

The MCU starts its biggest year yet with a very strong start,"Logan, 2017's first Marvel offering, was a movie I loved because of just how little it relied on its comic book origins, completely forgoing the superhero tropes and going in its own unique and totally enthralling direction.Guardians 2 however, is a movie I loved because of just how intensely it embraced its comic book origins. The Kirby-isms shine through brilliantly and every couple of minutes I found myself grinning like an idiot at some new reference or stylistic choice.Logan might be the super hero movie for people who don't like super hero movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 Episode 2: Attack of the Sequelitis,"Wtf did I just witness??? This was like the Star Wars prequels on crack. Yes, you read that right. Episode 1 is better than this soulless dreck. Watching this film was like watching a Skittles commercial whilst overdosing on cocaine in an LCD induced fever dream.The action is nothing but over the top, sledge hammer to the brain, mayhemic, CGI diarrhea. Gone is the disarming charm of the first film, replaced with something that feels like it was written by a Disney AI, and cobbled together as a result of strict focus group fan polling of the memorable moments from the first film. Remember dancing Baby Groot? Of course you do!! Now we get an Entire SEQUENCE of that!! Great, right?!?!?!No joke, I need to wrack my brain just to find anything to praise in this. Zoe Saldana is sleep walking through this whole thing, and Chris Pratt barely seems to care. Bautista is the only one that actually looked like he was having fun, but then he's reduced to being nothing more than a glorified background character. Seriously, his name is Drax the Destroyer, and he does no destroying in the film. He just kind of tags along, cracking the same kind of jokes over and over again (FYI, he's a big guy who does big turds yes, this is an actual joke in the film.)The fact this film received any praise whatsoever is absolute confirmation that Marvel bias is a thing (if that weren't already obvious.) Seriously, if Michael Bay had directed this mess of a film, then one. hundred. percent, the internet would be tearing it to pieces. As it is, enthusiasm for the first film is clouding people's ability to judge.More jokes, more humour, more action, more CGI, more explosions, more characters, more 80's references, and yet this is a lesser film than the first in every conceivable way.

So much better than the first one,"I went into this film hyped as for this sequel and I tell you what when I left the cinema, I was blown away with what I saw. The director James Gunn has crafted another mind blowing movie with out of this world visuals and stunts making it the most spectacular film of all time, the hilarious chemistry between the guardians of the galaxy is unreal major points go to drax who made me laugh the loudest I've ever laughed in a cinema or ever to be fair. The main cast is excellent in it again, especially Micheal rookers character yondu who you really care for and get behind in this film which I loved.What I loved about this film is that it's so different to the first one, James Gun hasn't tried to top the first one in anyway, he's tried to make this one so different from the first which I loved, seeing something that's fresh and unexpected really kept me on the edge of my seat as I watched this master piece of a film. The sound track is so much better than the first one, in fact I think this sound track puts the first one to shame because I'm still singing all the songs from this film to this day. And with out saying any spoilers, Kurt Russell in this film is amazing, I really liked what they did to that character.In the end I had a blast with guardians of the galaxy vol. 2, it is so much better than the first one in every way and I cannot wait to see what James Gun does next with the crew in guardians of the galaxy vol. 3",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
James Gunn displayed his big guns and iron back,"This movie should have been terrible, because of the time limit, the lack of good material to work with and a fatigue of rag tag team genre. However, that being said, Mister Gunn brought out the big guns in writing, in direction, in keeping the team together and it shows in a great adventure, something out of the playbook of a space opera wildhogs. There is a great sense of being in the moment and each time we thought the magic would fade, it strengthens just a little. This is by no means the only story Mister Gunn wanted to say, because we can tell from it his great passion for the arts, but it was one that was still pretty awesome. The cast retained their great chemistry and flaws and that is pretty neat, given we are normally washed down with generic characters with blandness of a overbearing sense of perfection. There is none of that here, and the sense of vulnerability was good. The plethora of legit human emotions make me confident in vol.3 and the music was still good, so lets believe in the next ride because it will probably be the same given the dreaded sequel was not blowing up in the flames of first film's own initial success.

"A very fun summer movie, still not better than the first one.","I was very excited to see Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 because the first one is my favourite Marvel movie.I was really satisfied with the end product because it is a very fun blockbuster movie and I expected it to be nothing else.I was laughing throughout most of the running-time of the film and was having a lot of fun with the characters and action scenes. Many characters are much more developed in this film (specially Yondu, who was f*cking bad*ss).I of course loved the soundtrack (although not as good as the first one). I also have to give credit for the style of the film, because most marvel films don't look colorful or alive. This one had a great color palette and the use of a new camera improved the film in my opinion.Some of the ideas of the film are very cool and it is not afraid to make bold choices (which differs to some other marvel movies).I really don't know what to think of the score because it was very present throughout the film and it kind of spoiled some scenes (for example, someone is saying something and the music turns really evil and you get the scene kind of spoiled in that way).Now lets move into some negatives. There were more than a few times when you could clearly notice the Green Screen, it looked kind of cheap.The biggest problem with the film is its script, which is filled with TONS and TONS of exposition which is never good. There was a time in which you felt you were taking a Marvel Lore Class.There were also some very cheesy lines that ruined some scenes. Also, at one point the crew is divided and you jump back and forth between the two scenarios. One is clearly much more fun than the other one and you just want to go back to that one instead of watching the other one.In the end, I got what I expected. A fun summer movie that will make you laugh and hunt for Easter eggs while giving you a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Somebody at Marvel should have reeled Gunn in,"After Marvel had struck gold with The Avengers in 2012, raking in over a billion dollars at the box-office, it seemed that the studio could do no wrong with their roster of superheroes, with Iron Man 3 going on to also break the billion mark in 2013, despite being one of the weakest in the franchise. When it was announced that they would be bringing the Guardians of the Galaxy, a relatively obscure, space-dwelling gang of misfits to the big screen, to some this seemed like their biggest risk yet, and one that could stop the Marvel Cinematic Universe in its tracks. James Gunn's spunky, colourful and idiosyncratic blend of B-movie quirkiness and big- budget thrills struck a chord with the audience, and this group of minor league superheroes only really known to comic book fans suddenly became a household name.For fans of the first movie, there is plenty to enjoy in the sequel, which takes its 'Vol. 2' from the new playlist of '70s and '80s favourites on the soundtrack, usually pumping out of the retro walkman belonging to the group's leader, Peter Quill, AKA Star-Lord (Chris Pratt). Taking place almost immediately after the climax of the previous instalment, the gang are all present and ready to take on an intergalactic monster hoping to steal some valuable batteries from a golden, near-perfect race called the Sovereign. Gamora (Zoe Saldana) is stern-faced and struggling with her feelings for Quill; Drax (Dave Bautista) once again gets all the funniest lines and is the best thing in the movie; snarky weapons engineer Rocket (voiced by Bradley Cooper) seems eager to push everybody away as he tests his newly-forged bond with the other Guardians; and Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel) is a big-eyed baby, clumsily fumbling from one scene to the next and inspiring the most ""aaahs"" from the audience in the process.When they inadvertently p**s off the Sovereign's leader Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), the Guardians find themselves marooned on an island. They have their arses saved by a mysterious figure who introduces himself as Ego (Kurt Russell), a character glimpsed in the opening flashback scene via some immaculate de-ageing CGI enjoying a courtship with Quill's mother. Ego is a Celestial, an ancient being who has manage to build an entire planet around him. To give him his full name, he is Ego the Living Planet, and he is also Quill's father. Themes of family run throughout the film, with Gamora constantly fighting with her returning sister Nebula (Karen Gillan), Drax forming a sibling-like bond with Ego's assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Groot playing the role of the baby everybody is responsible for, and of course Quill's daddy issues. Also returning is blue-skinned Ravager Yondu (Michael Rooker), the guy who kidnapped Quill from Earth and raised him like a son.Marvel directors have been vocal in their support for the hands-off approach taken by Kevin Feige, the man overlooking the entire Cinematic Universe, which goes some way to explain how they can attract such enormous talents as Taika Waititi and Ryan Coogler. Gunn has been given the key to the kingdom here, and he throws all of his Troma-taught wackiness at the screen. Space battles and gun- fights fill the screen, and while there's a bright, almost psychedelic visual pizazz to it all, there's a real lack of dramatic weight. Somebody at Marvel should have reeled Gunn in. With the constant quipping and '80s references going on, including an appearance from Pac-Man, it never really feels like the characters are in any danger, and even less so the galaxy. There's also an insistence on trying to squeeze humour out of every single scene. I don't remember one joke failing to land back in 2014, but there are plenty of moments in Vol. 2 that had me frustratingly straight- faced. In particular, one running joke involving a character named Taserface (Chris Sullivan) long outstays its welcome.The film is as its most effective when exploring the quieter interactions between the wide roster of characters, and the Freudian issues brought along with Ego and his uncertain intentions. While the Fast & Furious franchise insists its mythos is built around 'family' by having Vin Diesel inform us so every 10 minutes, the Guardians genuinely feel like a tight unit brought together by their own troubled pasts. Rooker brings a lot of heart into his role of surrogate father facing a major turning point in his life, after he is exiled from the Ravagers by higher-up Stakar (Sylvester Stallone) and faces a mutiny led by Taserface. Gunn ultimately tries to bring too much to the table, piling on the jokes and special effects-laden set-pieces, as well attempting to introduce new characters who will surely play a larger role in future instalments. I left the cinema back in 2014 overjoyed and eager to see it again. Three years later, I left with a headache and a sore backside, but still with a fondness for the characters.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Still fun,"The best thing about Marvel is also the worst thing: They always try to outdo themselves with the next film in the MCU. Sometimes it really works like with this film, and Captain America 2 and 3, and sometimes it doesn't like with Iron Man 2 and Thor 2. But the advantage is they know how to keep making it better. They take fan's criticisms and complaints into account and try really hard to fix them. Such is the case with this film. Not that I had anything to complain about with part 1, but man, this definetely beats part 1 by a lot. Everything about this is better. The pacing, the story, the dialouge, the humor, and even the soundtrack. It manages to keep the style, spirit, and tone of everything we loved about the first film while also breaking new ground with it. It's very hard to make lightning strike twice, especially with a film with as weird a premise as Guardians of the Galaxy. By all accounts, the first film shouldn't have worked. Even more so the case with this film. Marvel has managed to do the impossible twice now. This is good, because it proves they're willing to take risks, but this is also bad, because now they'll be forced to outdo themselves every time, until eventually they'll be crushed by their own unattainable expectations. I'm very worried this will happen in the near future, especially as new films come out with new characters and new crossover films. Will we eventually be too greedy and want more and more and bigger and better each time until we're disappointed? I hope not. I know this isn't really a review of the movie, so much as it is about Marvel, but it's getting really had to keep this spoiler-free. Trust me, this is one film where you want to go in knowing as little as possible. Don't read the comics, don't use social media until you've seen the film. And I cannot stress this enough: Do not leave until ALL the credits have finished!!!!.
There is a total of 5 (Yes, FIVE) end credits scenes. And all are important especially as we gear up for Infinity War.

Not as good as the first one!,"I love the series, that is until I saw this, don't think it was developed for film properly... Volume 1 was awesome! Volume 2, not so much.

Another Fantastic Marvel Movie,"It's hard to compete with the first movie of The Guardians of the Galaxy, the first was beyond good, setting the standards very high. This one falls a little short of the first giving us a cliché plot, but it's still an excellent film. The filming was amazing, the CGI top notch, the sound track was beautiful, the cast once again brought a spectacular performance and above all the jokes were fantastic. Guardians of the Galaxy Part two, explores some of the questions brought out in the first film, taking you deeper into the characters lives and personality.

Needs to be More Solid and Shorter,"OK, I understand that you sometimes feel tempted and peer pressured to give a high rating to a movie, but when you do so, please be logical. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is just another Marvel movie with a weak, yet emotional plot. I must say that I'm not a big fan of this movie genre, but over the years I've built up enough experience to recognize a good movie. This one could be enjoying sometimes, especially the romantic dialogues between Drax and Mantis, and between Rocket and Groot. I must also admit that Chris Pratt's acting was great in this movie and that it gives it weight. This movie could definitely be shorter, as it gets boring and drags along. I should also give a shout-out to Kurt Russel. His appearance and character certainly leave a mark on this movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Well...it tried,"The newest contribution to the famous MCU, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 attempts to recreate the witty, touching and clever film that came out in 2014. It also tries to stand on its own without relying on cameos from the Avengers or other superheroes, which I appreciate. However, although it tries, it doesn't quite succeed, with many jokes that fall VERY flat, plot points and twists that are strange at best and completely out of nowhere at worst and character development that leads nowhere. That is my biggest problem with the film, that it spends so much time on trying to develop characters like Yondu or Rocket and yet do it so poorly that it ends up being a waste of time. We have already established their characters in the first film, but rather than expand on it the writer chooses instead to focus on the aspects we already knew and occasionally throw in a trait that makes no sense. Drax's personality almost completely changes, we get some awkward romantic banter and the rest of the film is throwing one-liners at the audience hoping that one of them is funny. Don't get me wrong. There are good things, like the effects, acting, action, and some jokes do hit home. Also, you can tell they really tried. Unfortunately, the direction they chose to go in was not, I think, the correct one.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great movie,"Guardians of the galaxy is an amazing Sci-fi, Action-Adventure movie.It started off shaky with the beginning, the beginning made me think that they were going to rehash the same characters and tone as the first but as the movie went on it became its own.There is a lot of character development in this movie but James Gun makes it feel all connected and not cluttered. It gives characters stuff to do without it feeling forced or shoved in there so characters have something to do.The women who played nebula (Karen Gillan) made one of the worst performances i've seen in a while. She talked to the ground the whole movie and here voice was monotone and dull.Her Acting ability ranges for fighting to wooden.Overall I give this movie an 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"So much fun to watch, but still a notch less than the first one.","Its more action packed than the first one, a laugh riot and so much fun to watch, but still a notch less than the first one.Like the first one, the start of the movie is so much fun that it gets you excited. It starts with, obviously, the Guardians kicking some ass in the Galaxy and helping a planet where people are literally made of gold, yes literally. So somehow, they get into trouble, and circumstances let Peter Quill (Star Lord) meet his mysterious Dad (Ego) for the first time.It answers few questions from the first movie that why Peter was able to hold a damn Infinity Stone. So anyway, like always with superhero movies, the galaxy gets into trouble and Guardians have to save it, with of course some new team members.The action, the CGI and 3D effects are top notch, as you would expect from a Marvel movie, or any big budget Hollywood movie for that matter. It has the same kind of comedy that you would expect if you have watched the first movie. Just when you think its getting serious, someone will say or do something funny, but few times I felt it was unnecessary, it almost gets predictable if you have jokes everywhere.Star Lord, Gamora, Rocket, Nebula, Mantis were great, but Drax(Bautista) was just delightful. Baby Groot is just so adorable, kids would love him, I want to adopt him. But what really stole the show for me, was Yondu. He had more depth in his character and I liked the unpredictability of his actions. Kurt was fine as Ego.Even though its full of action and unique comedy, it gets a little boring in between. There are great moments in this movie where you can't take your eyes off but some dialogue scenes slowed down the movie. But still great fun!! P.S. This one has multiple post-credit scenes so don't leave the theater till the end.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Love from the first sight,"I don't usually make reviews but this time I was forced to do it. I am a huge fan of the first movie and absolutely loved it. Here is what I think you should know if you loved the first movie and were really excited to hear about the second but still haven't watched it. Everything you loved so much in the first movie is doubled if not tripled in amount. I was really excited to see this movie and It did not disappoint me.There are times when sequel to the original movie is much or just a bit better than the original movie. This movie is just awesome. It's a must watch for those who want to discover some truths about the Quills story and his family. The movie is not just fun to watch, it creates great emotional connection with characters: Peter, Rocket and surprisingly Yondu. Drax and Gamora also have some moments but for me they did not feel as strong this time. Little Groot is what he is...little cute groot. Overall, the movie is worth it and i really hope to see the third.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A large dominoes pizza with everything on of a movie,"*******SPOILERS***** Now I don't know about you but every now and then I like to go and have a pizza. I don't actually care for fancy la-di-dah pizza's I just want a Dominoes thick crust with everything on it and a cold beer. Hopefully I can put my feet up and watch a good movie at the same time and once we've finished the pizza who knows we might even have some ice cream! Crazy right? It's madness! We're bonkers here. That is exactly what Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is, Dominoes Pizza, cold beer and maybe ice cream. IMHO it's not quite as ice creamy as Vol 1, but it was thoroughly enjoyable from start to finish. I was never bored there were some genuine laugh out loud moment and it's all rather silly, but in a good way, like Star Trek can be silly but IN A GOOD WAY. If at any point I had stopped to think about the logic of the story or even went, ""hang on - wait a minute...?"", the illusion would have been ruined and I would have found a shard of glass in my thick crust. It doesn't stand up to story scrutiny but it isn't 'that sort' of film. All the visuals are totally awesome and the space ship designs and tech are (pun intended) out of this world. I'm not sure why Sci-Fi always feels the need to get Godly and have gods in them (Star Trek, 2001, Promethius (shudder) and so on and so forth and what have you) but they do, and I know that they are guardians of the galaxy and they have to protect the galaxy but can you really kill an all- knowing immortal god by punching him in the head? Apparently so! It also makes Quin guilty of patricide, he kills his father because he killed his mother, but does that make it right? I suppose so, But wait hang-on! Doh! see - I'm not supposed to think about this stuff! Quick gimme some beer! Phew! Thanks! Some really awesome casting - Stallone is ace, Kurt Russel is fabulous and I was genuinely moved at the death of blue bloke, but mostly cause he's the best actor in the film, bit of a shame his 2nd in command wasn't Alieny-at all and just looked like a skinny human, but small potatoes. But I genuinely looking forward to Vol 3. Another slice? Why yes - that'd be lovely. And one more beer n'all. Thank you. 4/5 Great movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Like Modern Families...In Space.,"I feel this movie inhabits an early teenagers universe. A lot of the characters to me have a 'bickering family' type quality. Reading some of the other user reviews: 'astonishing easter eggs that will have you standing on your seat' another that 'James Gunn has done it again (has done what again - oh another movie?) Also one said ' All our favourite characters are back' (Well they're not MY favourites - sorry.) One reviewer mentioned being part of a (film) industry screening. Maybe that is why there are so many positive early reviews.I feel many characters are difficult to get to know. Rocket sounds like a New York street hustler; Gamera has the sister/enemy subplot where she will not trust her sister. To complete the whole family thing we have Starlord (Why did the movie have to reveal his characters real name?) meeting...you can guess, right.Kurt is the best character in this movie. At least he is a 3 - dimensional character likable but a bit unlikable when you realise what he's done. The others have early-teen personalities as well. David Bautusta laughs at everyone, the New character that 'feels emotions' is always sad until she can laugh with Dave - who's laughing at her. Michael Rookers character is too adult for this movie. He's head of a mercenary group and plays it like he enjoys hurting people - even if he does it with a whistling arrow. Is that supposed to make us think his character is funny?Squeezing in what I think are basically unfriendly characters creates bad role models for kids. Would be good if James Gunn can 'do it again' in the final trilogy part of this movie where all the regulars get a smack on the ass and told to go to bed.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Hooked Again, 'Guardians 2' Does Not Disappoint","No sane person expected Guardians of the Galaxy to succeed at half the rate it did, but it won a legion of fans and earned more than enough box office dough to earn a sequel. Though not quite as magically magnificent as the original, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 (GotG2) lives up to the hit that was the original, and in some ways, is even better.Director/writer James Gunn undoubtedly has proved himself to be one of the most passionate, driven directors in the superhero film genre, and that passion shines through to the film. Gunn deserves all the praise he can get, as GotG2 again delivers a wildly exhilarating, heart warming, hilarious and down right entertaining experience.Vol. 2 is very much a character-driven film, with the character development in full effect, diving into more backstory and focusing heavily on chemistry. The main narrative revolves around Star-Lord and his quest to discover his true parentage, and while jumbled and somewhat disjointed in the second act, provides enough of an emotional weight to keep you intrigued.But it's the characters, fueled by their spectacular writing and chemistry, that take center stage, allowing the audience to connect, laugh with and care for them, and this again calls back to Gunn's amazing passion for creating a rich, extensive franchise. Star-Lord and Gamora share terrific scenes of their ""unspoken thing"", Drax and newcomer Mantis mesh so hilariously together, and what else can be said about my favorite characters, Rocket and the adorable Baby Groot, who together again form the film's best duo. Yondu is a much better character this time around, Nebula gets more screen time and even with Marvel's ""villain problem"", the main antagonist Ego is a different take on your classic villain, very much enjoyable. There is enough humor to go around 3 times over, which is mostly great, but sometimes does get repetitive and dull, with some humor on occasion feeling overly forced. Even so, every character compliments each other in some way and the interactions are so entertaining and often laugh-out-loud funny, that you can't seem to get enough of it. The overall story of Vol. 2 isn't anything groundbreaking, but the characters that inhabit the narrative steal the show, and that is GotG2's greatest strength.Along with its set of phenomenal characters, GotG2 excels in the visual and audible department. The CGI is breathtaking, Vol. 2 is a delight to look at, colorful, exotic and explosive. Behind the gorgeous visuals is the soundtrack, which again provides the movie with a unique pop and attitude that makes it so special. The action sequences are varied and entertaining, the atmosphere dazzles, and the amount of fan service and to the greater MCU is off the charts. Much like the original, if you're looking for pure entertainment, GotG2 doesn't fail to deliver.I can't forget to mention the cast that portray the characters I spoke so highly of. Marvel's star power is unmatched, with the likes of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, and Vin Disel leading the pack, followed by Kurt Russell, Michael Rooker and many more, who all represent their respective characters to a tee.Guardians of the Galaxy was able to able to reach out to fans with its unique set of characters, adventurous and sci-fi setting and hilarious dialogue , all backed by an awesome soundtrack. Luckily for fans of the first, aside from some hiccups in pacing and the amount of humor, Marvel's 15th entry into the MCU once again delivers on every aspect that made the first one a success, getting you hooked on a feeling, and high on believing.9/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 Review,"Did Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 deliver? You better believe it delivered. Was it as good as the first one? Unfortunately, I would say no, but it's still amazing.Synopsis: Set to the backdrop of 'Awesome Mixtape #2,' Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team's adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill's true parentage. Starring: Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper, Michael Rooker, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Kurt Russell Director: James GunnThe comedy delivered on all levels in this movie. But we all know the reason anyone went to go see this movie was because of the comedy. Seriously, if that is the only reason you are going to see this movie you won't be disappointed. Enough with the comedy, let's get to the story.Anyone who reads the comics knows that Ego is not Quill's father. J'son is actually Quill's father. Although, they did take some backstory from J'son and added it to Ego's backstory to give a reason why he was doing what he was doing. I'm not going to tell you what he was doing, because that would ruin the movie. Just know, there is a purpose to it all.The actors delivered on all levels here. There is no other way to say it. Adding Kurt Russell only made the acting better. If you haven't figured it out yet from other reviews, I give Kurt a lot of praise. He deserves it too. You would think I would say this is the best movie of the entire MCU, but unfortunately I can't. The reason?I don't like that the changed the story for Ego. Yes, he has done things like he was doing in the first place, but still. They took one of the most powerful characters in the MCU and made him a one- off. You'll see when you watch the movie.Then there's the fact they barely added any effects to the MCU. We all know the Guardians are part of the MCU. The closest thing we got was seeing Jeff Goldblum in the credits, a visual of three of the Watchers, another Adam Warlock tease (that's the third if I remember), and a glimpse of Planet Hulk that if you blink you'll miss all of them. I know that shouldn't matter in the long run, but it does to me.Final Thoughts: You MUST watch this movie. Yes, it is right in the middle of my averages for the entire MCU, but it is still worth it. Stop what you're doing and go watch this movie. Enjoy it.Civil War – 9 Iron Man 2 – 9 Avengers – 9 Iron Man 3 – 9 Guardians of the Galaxy – 8 Winter Soldier – 8 Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 – 8 Iron Man – 8 Ant-Man – 8 Incredible Hulk – 8 Doctor Strange – 8 First Avenger – 8 Thor – 7 Age of Ultron – 7 Dark World – 7Rating: 8 out of 10That's it for me folks.

Vol.2 is a Mix Tape,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a mix tape of the good and the bad. The movie was decent overall but the move had a sadness going through it that felt out of place and just not what I (and I think Audiences) are going to look for. So when I say this is a mix tape it's not really so much the movie, it's how you feel about it after you watch it. You don't really know if you enjoyed it or were disappointed that you really didn't get what you expected.OK so what I like about it... effects, production design, action and the humor (sort of). The look of this film is like a Christmas tree full of color and blinking lights. The images pop and made me think any frame in this movie I could pause and use it as a wallpaper on my computer. Lots of CGI but good CGI that gave the movie a very beautiful Sci-Fi look I liked a lot. (There is even an alien made of crystal that was cool). And the look of Ego's planet is worthy of an Oscar production design nomination. The best action sequence was almost reminiscent of the best action sequence in the Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back and was very fun to watch. And the humor ....well it wasn't the jokes that were spoken it was the visual humor that made me laugh out load. The vocal jokes spoken by Drax were very bland and Rockets jokes seemed forced. And the banter between the characters got kinda annoying.Now what I didn't like. The Story...It took most of the movie before you realize ""oh OK this IS the story"". To me, it felt like the whole movie was a set up for the climax. You're led into a series of sequences that are caused by the characters that you think are set- ups for the real story but nope they are the story. Even though the scenes are entertaining you can't help but think ""ok can we get past this and get on with the story"". And see that is where I'm mixed at...The Is a Character Driven Action Sci-fi Film! and I put the emphasis on Character. There is so much character building in this film that you now know your heroes better than you did in the first film and that is the point of the movie. We keep preaching as movie goers how much we want quality in the movies we pay a ticket to see then when we get it we dislike it...at first (for me personally: Alien 3, The Empire Strikes Back, Spiderman 2). I think I will like this film a lot better when I see it again because now I can watch it for what it is and not what I expect.Like I said This is a Mix Tape but not a bad mix tape. I think if you go in not expecting to see a rehash of the first film you will be pleasantly surprised. BUT Vol. 3 better bring it, lol!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"""'Guardians 2 succeeds as smaller, character-driven story""","Baby Groot. A young CGI Kurt Russell. And a soundtrack that will transport your parents back to the good ole' days. What more could you ask for in a summer blockbuster?Aside from hits like ""The Dark Knight,"" ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"" and ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" most sequels fail to capture the ingenuity, wit or sheer awe of their predecessors. However, as Norman Vincent Peale once said, ""Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars."" In that vein, ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2"" shines brightly.The film continues the story of Peter Quill/Star Lord (Chris Pratt) and his mangy band of criminals, warriors and assassins, who must once again save the galaxy from certain destruction. While James Gunn's first film masterfully introduced us to Marvel's cosmic realm and the quirky individuals that inhabit it, ""Guardians 2"" foregoes a conventional superhero narrative arc in favor of a more personal, character-driven story.From Gamora and Nebula's disdain for their father, Thanos, to the Guardians' fluctuating relationships with one another, the story largely focuses on family. Many critics were put off by Karen Gillan's portrayal of Nebula during the more impactful, heartfelt scenes. For me, however, humanity and sincerity shone through her acting and in the small details of her damaged history with Thanos and Gamora.The Guardians themselves, as always, exude confidence and chemistry, with much of the film's humor stemming from Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista).Gunn's visual direction is impeccable, characterized by vibrant colors and grand set pieces. And the soundtrack, ""Awesome Mix Vol. 2,"" while less recognizable as the first volume, compliments the film's themes to near perfection.""Guardians 2"" isn't groundbreaking. Not all of the jokes land, the secondary villains are, at times, annoying and it does little to further the overarching narrative if the Marvel cinematic universe. Overshadowing these nitpicks, however, is a glimpse into the souls of the characters we know and love, several gut-wrenching laughs and Baby Groot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

You will laugh throughout the entire movie just like the first one, you will like the characters even more. The cast gave a stellar performance and the visuals are top-notch. Things bad with it? 1)the story(basically non-existent, as I said before, it does not serve a purpose), 2)the villain. I watched the double bill at the cinema so I watch one after the other.

Also the script is clever. It's full of funny one-liners and Rocket and Baby Groot are hysterical. Still there are problems.

Therapy of the Galaxy,"The film was OK. I mean, the far off 3D shots were something fresh, the acting was good, the production values were good. Yet I could see right off the bat that something was off. You know when something is off where everything in the plot is related to family (pardon the pun): it means no more ideas.While Guardians 1 was fresh and unexpectedly good, the sequel took the subtleties out and enhanced everything else: special effects, family drama, toilet humor and above all, spin off seeds. That's how you get dialogues like ""Ow, my nipples"" and ""We're not friends, we're family!"" (which could only have worked as a parody of Fast and Furious).So instead of exploring strange new worlds, we again collapse the entire story to the dynastic relations between a few characters: Quill's dad(s), Gamora's sister, Nebula's dad, Rocket's similar other, Yondu's surrogate dad, and so on, while everything else is just pow pow, pew pew! and some really pathetic jokes. They even added a new member that feels and sometimes manipulates emotions. Oh no! Not Deana Troy!By the end I was tired of childhood trauma's expositions and group therapy like teary embraces. Stuff is not supposed to make total sense in a Marvel story, but they went so overboard that I couldn't care anymore. And no, I am not excited about the Ravagers spin off (or tip of the hat to the 60s Guardians from the comics), the Adam Warlock spin off, the Stan Lee spin off or any of this crap.

"No where near what the first one was, which isn't entirely bad.","First of all, how the heck can a movie be so entertaining predicated on a plot thinner than those Chinese ""pancakes"" you wrap your Moo Shu Pork in???Gigantic explosions, huge laughs, enormous fun, and probably the weakest plot of any Marvel movie to date.Without spoiling anything, our protagonist finally gets to meet his long lost papa, who may not be exactly who/what he purports to be. Thanos's daughters continue their long standing sibling rivalry, and Disney/Marvel gives us the cutest CGI character since Dreamworks ""Puss"".Note to parents, there is a lot of vulgar language thrown around, as well as a major plot point in which a certain character regales us with his conquest of the opposite sex all over the universe in VERY PG-13 terms.All in all a big, fun, and at times touching film about family, friendship, and loyalty, all of which revolves around a plot-line that may have you leaving the theater wondering what it was exactly that you just watched.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is almost as good as its predecessor,"Just watched this with my movie theatre-working friend and his nephew. Like the first one, there's some laughs among the action and touching scenes. And, yes, there's once again some cool '70s recordings that augment the score, the kind of songs I remember very much enjoying listening to on AM radio as a kid whether in my house or when my parents were driving us around. Among the newcomers, Kurt Russell is quite effective with the role he plays here. I admit there were some slow spots but the results were very much worth it. So on that note, we all three highly recommend Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2The worst thing about summer in space is that all of the garage sales float away.Fortunately, the starship in this sci-fi adventure has found a planet able to regulate its own gravity.When Rocket (Bradley Cooper) pockets a powerful battery, the alien race he stole it from hires Yondu (Michael Rooker) to bring it and the Guardians of the Galaxy – Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) – back to them.While his surrogate father stalks him, Star-Lord's real father Ego (Kurt Russell) offers him and his crew asylum on a sentient planet.A surprisingly emotional sequel to the 2014 sleeper hit, this complex follow-up focuses on the fluidity of fatherhood and the burden of loss. Thankfully, it also amps up the action and layers on the laughs.Incidentally, if planet Earth was sentient then she could tell us where to drill for oil.Green Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Falls short of the standards set by the first film,"It's hard to go into the details without spoilers but these are the primary reasons I didn't enjoy it as much: - it lost its sense of adventure. GotG was a giant space adventure with a varied and fascinating variety of backdrops. Much of the film is spent on a colourful planet that looks ridiculous rather than interesting.in GotG the villain was very villainous and his purpose clear. The villain in Vol 2 is just not that interesting, a bit ridiculous (WTF is that brain thing about?) and heavily CGI reliant.the main characters seem to have become these overpowered super heroes capable of hand to hand combat with immense creatures; it lost its sense of scale in this regard and through it any sense of danger.the humour is nowhere close to the original; all the funny bits are in the trailer.It's still not bad. I just felt the original was a great film and this just a half-decent one.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
James Gunn and Marvel Studios at their best,"This is the one to see! If you're not a fan of Marvel, but want to get into them, definitely see the Guardians movies.And Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is the best of them all.Filled with style, color, a devastating ending, great actors, and a script that manages to be both hilarious and touching, this is easily one of my favorite films of all time, as well as the MCU's absolute best! The villain twist is predictable, but it's so touching you likely won't care. The one who really carries this movies, however, is Michael Rooker, who once again knocks it out of the park as Yondu Udonta. An absolute treat from beginning to end, and one I'll definitely see a million times more!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Enjoyed This Film Very Much,"Bottom line, if you liked the first GotG film, then you will like this one. Since the characters were already known, more work had to be done to make it humorous and it hit the mark.Probably the only downside to this film was the use of tiny Groot - it was for more of a cutesy effect and Groot in the first film was anything but cutesy.Rate it a 9/10 as the effects are excellent, the action superb, and the characters once again lit up the screen with their wit and humor.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 2 Review,"In Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 Starring Chris Pratt, The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.Guardians Of The Galaxy was one of the riskiest films Marvel Studios had decided to take on but, it ended up becoming a smash hit. James Gunn has to follow up that film which will be tough to improve on an already great not only superhero film, but just a great movie overall. Now onto Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2, does it live up to the first movie or does it fall short?Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 is nearly on par with the first movie while somehow maintaining originality in the sequel. I was afraid that baby Groot was going to be overused and become a crutch on this film but luckily I was mistaken. Baby Groot is used sparingly and when he is used, it pays off in either great adorableness, or utter hilarity. The ensemble cast shines again in this film especially Dave once again showing his acting chops in his transition from Pro Wrestling. Kurt Russell makes his debut in the MCU as Ego The Living Planet. Kurt comes across as charming and beautiful much like Peter Quill himself.The film is less of the normal superhero film's heroes journey ending with the final showdown with the big bad villain. This film is a character study, James Gunn smartly splits up our main characters from each other in the film allowing to us to learn so much more about every character. He gives us even more reasons to love this ensemble of great characters. He continues to expand the cosmic world of the MCU with amazing colors, and a great cameo from Sylvester Stallone but I won't spoil that for you. Guardians is one of the great superhero sequels, but that's to be expected from the MCU, James Gunn knocks it out of the park again, but I can't go into plot details without giving away spoilers but the Story is great and not forced upon the world. Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 2 is a worthy film that is unique in it's own way, but once again is plagued by a flip of the switch villain who suddenly becomes evil.Guardians Of The Galaxy Volume 2 is a Solid 8/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very Funny,"Guardians of the GalaxyMonths after saving the world, The Guardians of the Galaxy will do so again. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) located in one of his adventures to his father, Ego (Kurt Russell). He and his team must know if ego is his father or a phony.Let's start with the actors. It is part of one of the bad things. The proceedings during the movie is not in the film, as well as the interactions between them are very poor or unnecessary. But the character I liked the most was Drax (Dave Bautista). The first was the worst of the film for his performance. But in this film I don't know if your character has improved but I'm better now than in the first. His voice sarcastic, his jokes out of place... words out of place.The proceedings were not so much because of the effects, good. The effects in the film, the colors are impressive in the film. Especially in the planet Ego, all very beautiful.The GREAT! Problem that I have with the film, is that the protagonists do not have a clear objective. Already,Star-Lord knows his daddy and must discover who he is. OK, what then? Hence the film creates unnecessary interactions between the main characters with the Drax-Mantis Rocket-Yondu, side effects, and what interested us most was the Gamora-Nebula interaction. This interaction becomes a bit rare, of love and hatred. Returning to the subject of Limbo after meeting the pope of Star-Lord, our heroes are is this ""Limbo"" in that unnecessary interactions were executed. But after that time (which is almost the entire film) The film returns to be moved.The jokes in the film... In all sides!!At the post-credits scenes (if they are 5) have a lot of eye...Infinity War...Very Funny 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Simply Outstanding Entertainment,"""Guardians, Vol 2"" is simply the best in movie entertainment - outstanding across all metrics that matter - plot, casting, acting, dialogue, pacing, VFX, and soundtrack! I hardly ever give a ""10"" rating but this gets it hands down! I viewed in 3D and the ridonculous visuals were just so much better with that added dimension. James Gunn has got to be in the Top 5 of all film directors, if you're going to give someone this scope of project with a $200M budget then he's one of a few you'd have confidence in delivering. I smiled, chuckled, and laughed throughout, and the final 15-mins required a handful of tissues so yeh, the full range of emotions. Don't skip the 10-mins of end credits, along with crediting like 5,000 contributors you'll find three or four bonus scenes.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
fun overload,"Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and his friends; Gamora (Peter Quill), Drax (Dave Bautista), Baby Groot (Vin Diesel), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), take a job from the Sovereign. They get Gamora's sister prisoner Nebula (Karen Gillan) as payment. When the Sovereign discovers Rocket had stolen from them, they set off to take out the Guardians. The group is saved by a Celestial, Ego (Kurt Russell) who claims to be Peter's father. Meanwhile, Yondu (Michael Rooker) is being ostracized by the other Ravagers and faces a mutinous crew.This is a visual overload of wildly colored space fantasy with unending quips. The first Guardian is refreshing for that idea but it gets a little repetitive with a sequel. The freshest scenes are Nebula's obsessive murderous rage against Gamora, and Baby Groot's inability to get Yondu's hat. There is some heart with Yondu and the sisters. It has some fun but a lot of it feels overloaded. At times, I pine for more of the quieter moments to let the characters deal with their feelings or simply reset my color receptors. Kurt is Kurt and is really perfect as Quill's father. I want the movie to take its time with the emotional turmoil but like a lot of these superhero movies, the pacing has to maintain its freight train momentum. Overall, this is fun but it can't be new again. It expands on the characters but it can't stop to smell the roses.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Spirit of FARSCAPE lives here,"As does John Crichton, who is playing the Sovereign ""Admiral""- complete with ""Peacekeeper"" NZ style accent. Peacekeepers were not gold, though.But one could make an argument that Peter Quill is a kind of John Crichton, and that Gamora is a type of Aeryn Sun (Gamora, like Aeryn, can lift up heavy objects with no problems at all). Peter Quill is an earthling who was snatched up by aliens, actually by Yondo, in much the same way John Crichton was sucked down a wormhole. So in some ways Peter is as out of place as John was during the 88 times we got to see him in the uncharted and tormented territories of space.We could even say that Drax is a stupider Ka D'argo and that Rocket is an equally funny Rygel, except that he is a raccoon rather than a helium-farting frog.Yondo can even be a Scorpius, Mantis a Chiana that is attracted to Drax/D'argo, Nebula a Jool or Shikozou.However you mix it up, the characters and the stories and the comedy is so much like Farscape. Actually come to think about it at the end of ""the peacekeeper wars"" which was the end of the Farscape franchise, John Crichton's Best friend is lost. Something similar to that happens in this film, and that just solidifies the relationship between the two franchises.It almost makes us want to see a Farscape sequel or a continuation produced by James Gunn because we know he would handle the property properly.As far as the freakin guardians of the galaxy (except I didn't say freakin'), this installment has so much more in it compared to the first one. Including Sylvester Stallone, David Hasselhoff, and some dope who has a name that is so funny that you can't stop giggling every time somebody says ""Taserface"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
The Guardians 'russell' up a good one!,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 sees our heroes from the first film reunite with a couple of new characters but with new villains, new discoveries and an awesome new soundtrack!The acting is good but the tone of the film is very light hearted and doesn't take itself too seriously so it is hard for acting to shine out. Having said this, I thought Kurt Russell's performance was very captivating.As for the visual effects, Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 doesn't disappoint. The film has truly spectacular visuals. The movie also has excellent cinematography which highlights these effects superbly.Overall, the sequel is not as good as the original. However, this is to be expected as the first is hard to beat. I personally think that the humour was slightly over done. At times it wasn't necessary, but I did laugh a lot and was very thoroughly entertained. I would give the movie 7 out of 10 and I am looking forward to seeing where the franchise goes next.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Funniest Marvel Movie Yet,"When I saw the trailer to this movie months before its release I was excited of course but also a bit worried because it looked kind of empty and I worried that it won't feel as heartfelt as the first Guardians movie,but I was gladly wrong.The characters is what made the movie for me because almost every character was developed in some way or the other even if I felt that they may have been too many heart to heart moments at times.Star-Lord,Gamora,Rocket and Drax continued to be interesting characters like the first GOT movie.The best Characters for me we're Yondu who had more to do than the first movie and Star-Lord father who was a welcome addition to the cast and he had good Chemistry which Star-Lord.As for the story,it was not as great as compared to the first Guardians movie but it was good.During the first half of the movie I was entertained because there was good action,some very funny moments and just fun moments but as the movie started progressing I was worried because it seemed like there wasn't any purpose to the movie,the villain wasn't introduced and it seemed the movie was just playing along with no end game at one point I even thought the Guardians weren't gonna save the Galaxy because nothing meaningful was happening but when the last half of the movie came along it all made sense,without spoiling anything there was something hidden in the movie and when it was introduced during the last act of the movie the first half of the movie made complete sense even though it took a long time it was worthwhile.Like I said this is Marvel's funniest movie like 4 out 5 times of the movie had me laughing even though some of the humor began to look like slapstick comedy and some sequences were just plain silly some of it worked and I'll say it again this is Marvel's funniest movie.The action sequences are similar to the first movie,entertaining but on a smaller scale,like The guardians still had to save the galaxy from something but it wasn't a battle from a city with many characters like the first GOT but it was something different with key characters and the villain only and I liked that.Again about the characters was that each character was placed at the right time as there were key characters who contributed to the story and there were some characters that were meant for humor only which worked nicely.This film didn't have the same impactful emotional scenes as the first Guardians of the Galaxy movie but when it did they really hit.In the end Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is a good sequel,had some great surprises had great humor and fun action and even cameos but its not better than the first but still a good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Great sequel,"Sequels are not always successful especially if the first film was successful. Often they pale in comparison however that is not true for Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 that more than holds its own.The team are back and in excellent form for another space adventure. Baby Groot makes a great and humorous addition to the Guardians. The film also introduces a number of new villains and brings back some memorable old ones. It has a great story that in this genre and universe makes great sense and flows very well. So it's easy to sit back and enjoy the ride.Just like the first film the humor is effortless and the great chemistry between the cast really shows and enhances its quality. The doses of humor are very well placed and occur at the right moments. Volume 2 also had a few big moments that the film built up and it certainly drives it home. The soundtrack, volume 2, is also really good and includes some other great tunes.Definitely recommended as you should enjoy this fun and entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Welcome to the freakin' Guardians of the Galaxy,"The coolest team of the galaxy returns to save it one more time. But before you even begin to read the review, I can hear you asking: Is it better than the first one? For me: almost. Let's explain. This time our heroes are being chased through the galaxy by those gold people you see in the trailer. At some point, Star Lord meets his father, Ego (yes, this is actually his name) and that's where things get interesting. Starting with the technical aspects of the movie, I want to say this is probably the most beautiful among all the Marvel movies (flawless visual effects, colorful scenery and from what I know they used the same type of digital camera Pacific Rim used.) Now let's talk about the story.What's better:1) Double the humor: While the first was a really funny adventure, Vol.2 is a really adventurous comedy. Luckily, it mostly works, but sometimes it breaks the tone of some dramatic moments.2) We get to know them better: This time we spend more time with them talking to each other and learning their back- stories(especially Star Lord, Nebula, even Yondu), which helps to develop the characters and make us care even more. Also, that's where a potential negative lies.3) More action: and probably better. It's very creative and usually combined with humor, which makes it so fun to watch.What's worse: Story structure: until half way through the movie, just funny things happen along with a lot of action. Our heroes don't have a specific goal to focus on. This, of course, is not necessarily a bad thing. Remember the same goes for Goodfellas, but it works perfectly. The thing is while Star Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket and Groot are definitely really funny characters with distinct personalities and a nice chemistry, they are still not so perfectly written. The jokes sometimes remind me of sitcoms. You can tell the character told the joke for the sake of telling a joke and making the scene funnier. All in all, Guardians of the Galaxy vol.2 is still a damn good time at the cinema. (9/10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"OK, I guess.","Entertaining, but not as good as #1. This feels like a middle movie, which it obviously will be.

Must see for comic book readers,"First of all i have to say that back when they announced guardians of the galaxy's first movie i was super hyped and that was totally worth.And we all know that sequels are far less better than the first ones but this one is just amazing.James Gunn is a genius and that's all i can say he brings a special ingredient to Marvel Cinematic Universe that no one has ever had.Song choices are as always great.It hooks you up to all sorts of feelings.All of our Guardians keep their same attitude from the first movie except Rocket.He's a bit more douche but that also has a reason, that i can't specify because it's kinda spoiler.James Gunn basically gives us a Cosmic Avengers but it's much more better.I already want to see the movie again, it's that good.Just don't waste your time and go watch it.If you don't like it,then watch all the other marvel movies and then you'll understand how good it is.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It went to a much bigger scale...,"I am not much of a fan of the superhero genre or Marvel movies in general, but I actually think that the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie from 2014 was the best of all Marvel movies so far. So I needed little convincing in order to go to watch ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"".I will say that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" was every bit as enjoyable and entertaining as its predecessor. And I don't understand why so many people have been mouthing complaints about the sequel. In my opinion it was every bit as good and right in the same alley as the first movie.The CGI in the movie was fantastic, as it usually is in all of Marvel's movies actually. And having good CGI effects and visuals is rather important for a movie such as ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"". I like how the effects were every bit as fast paced as the actual movie turned out to be.I found the storyline in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" to be entertaining and enjoyable. Sure, it was a little bit more out there in comparison to the first movie. But come on, this is a movie set in a galactic setting with alien creatures, spacecrafts and what have you not. And furthermore, it is set in the Marvel universe, so what do you expect if nothing other than getting a story blown out of proportions as all other Marvel stories essentially are.Just as in the first movie, then the cast ensemble for the sequel was quite good. It was nice to see the return of the cast members from the first movie. Just as it was nice to welcome new ones. But we also depart with some in this movie, which I hadn't expected. It wasn't a bad thing, but it just was somewhat of a surprise to me. But then again, I haven't read a single page of the comic books. Personally I must say that I was very pleased with the introduction of Mantis (played by Pom Klementieff), as this was a very interesting character and the presentation of the character was quite good in terms of effects and wardrobe.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" has a myriad of impressive cameo appearances, some more obvious than others, among which I found Sylvester Stallone, Michelle Yeoh, David Hasselhoff, Ving Rhames and Stan Lee (of course). I looked up the cast list afterwards and saw that there were even more cameos such as Seth Green, Rob Zombie, Miley Cyrus and Jeff Goldblum.If you enjoyed the first ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movie then you will definitely also enjoy the sequel. If you haven't seen the first one, then you can still sit down to watch the sequel, as there is nothing overly important from the first movie to the storyline of the sequel.""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" scores a solid 7 out of 10 stars from me. And I am looking forward to seeing the next movie in the series.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
You Won't Be Disappointed,"Saw it last night and thoroughly enjoyed it.Now I doubt that I'm capable of writing an in depth review so I won't try.Suffice to say, if GotG-1 was the introduction, then GotG-2 is the first act. The chemistry and joking between the characters is still there, along with more pop culture than you can poke a swizzle stick at. There's also more character development which taps into more emotions this time around.Overall, in my humble opinion you won't be disappointed as GotG-2 is well worth the price of admission, which incidentally was $46 in the posh seats last night.(GotG-1 9.5/10 - GotG-2 8.5/10)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original,"Another enjoyable entry, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' is very good fun.I actually didn't find the story in this as interesting as in the first film, but the humour - which is still up to the mark in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' - is much greater here; it got more laughs from me, that's for sure. The ending to this is also entertaining.Chris Pratt and Co. are just as enjoyable as before, with Dave Bautista particularly standing out to me here; if only due to his amusing moments. I like the addition of Pom Klementieff, I can see a spot for her in the crew. Kurt Russell and Elizabeth Debicki make for contrasting newcomers, Russell is just about good but I felt Debicki and her lot were underused/unintriguing.Not the most compelling plot, which I found more predictable than what the MCU usually produces, but the strong action end and noteworthy humour elevates it to become a pleasant film to watch; if a drop from the original.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

All less than the first. Less groot,"One of the greatest merits of guardians of the galaxy is not to get serious, it makes it less silly, incredible as it may seem, its whole mood is turned to humor, we have a movie where the characters call themselves family after 2 great adventures , And not after 20 minutes of film, we have well-built characters and a very reasonable plot, although everything in the film is a bit less than the first. Telling the story of the quintet of guardians, the script follows the cliché of all the films of heroes, but also features some very interesting dramas and sub-plots, which makes it stand out a bit, the film is not completely generic and its minor scope , Of course, that in the whole is common, but ""Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 2 ""is a silly film but at the same time passes all seriousness at the right point, his script is good, fun, comic, cliché and at the same time different, because his greatest success is to develop the mood of the characters situations, because in question Of history is weak and even forced. Technically the film is very well done, its action scenes are great, although well computerized, its effects do not let it transpire, its makeup is great and the assembly is good, we even have a risky sequence in the film, its soundtrack follows with songs Very good, but without a hit that is the face of the film as in the first, and his rhythm has problems, however fun it is, it tires at a certain moment, something that does not happen with the first. We have to highlight the wide range of actors of name that participated in the film, such as Kurt Russel and Stalone, but even so, there is nothing to be highlighted in terms of acting, except the fluffy Groot that steals the scene whenever it participates .

Not Half Bad,"I have a degree is English literature from the University of Washington. This qualifies me for only two things; I can teach, and I can be a snob about movies.

OK, when we compile our lists of the most influential movies we've seen, this won't be on anyone's list. It breaks no new ground. The characters don't develop much. The plot has so many holes you could drain your pasta. Boo hoo! Cry me a river.It's fun. The special effects are amazing. The colors are brilliant. The action is well-paced.

The Power of Friendship Strikes Again,"This time it's about finding your place in the universe and about family. While this installment in the franchise falls short in terms of story than the first one, it retains the humor which made the first film a success with both the audience and the critics. The best quality of the film is that the humor seems almost unintentional, as it should be. The writers have managed to creep in humor even in the most heated scenes, which breaks the intensity to an extent, but still, the humor works like magic. This one of the very few problems the film experiences. You can't help but laugh, but that distracts you from the story a little. It's rather lighthearted.It's about family this time. That sounds rather Fast and Furious-y, but it is not cringe-worthy as it is in the Fast and Furious franchise. In this film, it is subtly hidden, it is an 'unspoken thing' Also, they don't say 'family' as much as the Fast and Furious folks do. It is not just about Star Lord's family, as one might expect from what has been shown in the trailer. Every single member of the Guardians of the Galaxy has to come to terms with how they are and where they belong. And it's these characters that keep the film together, it's what they are willing to do find those answers that keeps the film going. The story is just the background, but unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 cannot be considered to be among the likes of those glorious character-driven films of the past. In his sense, James Gunn reinvents the Marvel Movie once again. This one's not about big explosions and over the top action like all of them are, though there is some action in this film.We can't truly review Guardians of the Galaxy film, without talking about its music choices. Awesome Mixtape Vol. 2 is not as awesome as Awesome Mixtape Vol. 1, one would find. But that, I think, is an intentional decision made by James Gunn. The first Mixtape was full of Rock, Dance and early Pop music, representing that these young Guardians have not a care in the world except to be awesome, but as time progresses their view of the world, or in this case, the Universe changes. They grow emotions, which they will find, hard to find, and so, they have to express them. They are expressed in this film through the Mixtape Vol. 2, it still has its dancy-ness, but there are also old and slow songs in their which speak of love and relationships. And that is why I think it is intentionally less awesome.The characters are improved upon what they were in the first film. The only sad part was to find Baby Groot saying 'I'm Groot' in its adorable voice less than I anticipated it to say. Everybody struggles to come to terms with their self, expect Drax, Drax is too cool to be sad for long. Nebula takes Gamora's place to call out the stupidity of the Guardians. Yandu matures in an exceptional way, but he still has that smugness about him. Every character is well executed, which I expected James Gunn wouldn't be able to pull off.In a line: Marvel has another one in its bag of blockbusters.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Total Stinker, Worse Than Howard The Duck","I have to review this movie because it might be the worst movie ever. In fact, just as I was thinking that it may have topped Howard the Duck in that category, Howard made a cameo! No joke, he's in this movie, but he plays no part so this is no spoiler. He's just hanging out.Within the first 30 seconds of the movie, it became painful to watch. The lackluster banter between characters reminded me of a bad Seinfeld episode. Within a minute of the film, I was wondering if it might be the biggest loser ever. In all honesty, I don't know because I left about 45 minutes in. All I know for sure is that I was completely disappointed, especially because I loved the fist Guardians so much.This is just cashing in, and the writing is absolute trash. There is no way this movie will maintain a score over 6.0 in the long run. If you were extremely eager to see it like I was, change that frame of mind and forget this movie. Maybe then when it hits cable you'll be able to enjoy a few scenes in it as if they were outtakes from the first. Lower your expectations to their lowest possible point, and you might get a chuckle. Go in expecting a movie like the original and you're going to be upset.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Bigger, bolder, weirder and more emotional","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 wisely chooses to match its increased scale and action with even more emotional heft, delivering a sequel that does everything the original did and fixes the minor flaws as well. With James Gunn being writer/director once again, the difference between this and other marvel films in terms of personality and vision is night and day.Chris Pratt still leads in a loveable fashion, funny and charming whilst delivering some emotionally resonant moments. Zoe Saldaña shines as Gamora, who still has to be the sensible one which leads to a lot of great moments. Bradley Cooper's constant anger as Rocket is even better here as the film really digs into why he's so closed off.Dave Bautista gets to show off his impeccable comedic timing but the film still sets aside some time to remind you off the pain Drax carries everyday. In a nice twist, the standout performance of the film is Michael Rooker as Yondu, a cool supporting character in the original here given so much more depth and humanity, as well as the best lines.Pom Klementieff as newcomer Mantis plays her character's naive and childish nature really well, always endearing and never grating. Fixing the original film's weakest aspect, Kurt Russell makes for a far superior villain, leaning into his natural charisma which only enhances his sinister edge.James Gunn's direction is even stronger here, he still has a talent for crafting action scenes that are clever with real personality and overall everything is even more colourful and weirder. It also has the most emotionally resonant moment of the entire MCU (at this point) allowing its ending to really sink in and have genuine weight to it.The CG is really impressive, the detail is there from beginning to end and weak spots are few and far between, which is particularly impressive considering the downward spiral the effects are currently going through (all Marvel's fault). The soundtrack remains a highlight with another selection of classic songs all utilised at the right time.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Lacks the novelty value of the original but delivers for the fans,"In 2014, the original ""Guardians"" was a surprising hit and, like many others, I was totally won over by its original bunch of characters and fresh tone with rich colours, witty script and zippy action. Three years later, the next outing for these space heroes is again directed and co-written by James Gunn so it is very much a case of back to the future. This sequel does not have the novelty of the initial film but the reprising of style will ensure that it is another massive success. One thing that has changed is that, whereas the first ""Guardians"" was the break-out role for Chris Pratt as Peter Quill (aka Star-Lord), since then he has become a major star with hits like ""Jurassic World"" and Passengers"".There is a wonderful opening with a background battle between four of our superheroes and a giant squid while - a minor twist on the original lineup - Baby Groot dances to ELO's ""Mr Blue Sky"", the first of a succession of musical tributes to the 1970s. The closing credits provide much more than the traditional single clip of other Marvel movies with a host of textual and visual tit-bits. In between, the action rarely stops with a luscious use of colour for both characters and sets, but for much of the time I had little idea what was going on. I mean: a demi-god called Ego who has trouble sleeping. Rollover, Freud. Best just to enjoy the ride.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Temper expectations, fun but not like the original","This will be a fairly short review because if you are at all familiar with the first Guardians of the Galaxy or the Marvel Universe, then the characters and actors, directors and writers will be well known.The second volume explores Peter Quill's/Starlord's parentage and unfortunately as a narrative hook it is a dead end. It requires a huge amount of exposition to set up Ego (Kurt Russell) as the God like father of Peter and the plans he has for his son now he has found him.The second hook involves a race called The Sovereign who also end up hunting down the Guardians. This is all incredibly messy as the chess pieces are forcibly moved into place to swell out the structure and give us the ending we all want.The film looks great and all the cast turn up...this was not phoned in. The charisma of the leads and the use of Baby Groot for humour keeps momentum going but it just feels like the wheels spinning faster but going nowhere. I can only assume that Gunn was trapped by requisites in the lead up to the Avengers: Infinity War which restricted what stories he could explore.My 11 year old son really liked it. It will make a mountainload of money so if you temper expectations it might make for a more fun experience.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
James Gunns consistency,"Ridiculous, colourful and stupidly fun...it's just great! First off the movie is very funny, the humour is quite particular so if you don't like one joke you probably won't like the rest, but if you do it's hilarious! The comedy is actually well timed as well, it isn't thrown in at random points that disrupt the flow of the movie. The plot is also decent, it's not the best part of the film but definitely respectable. The section with the golden people(can't remember their names), while being a big part of the plot that is quite necessary, gets a bit repetitive with them constantly chasing the guardians. Much like the first movie I think the best part of this movie is the character. Undoubtedly what makes these movies so good is how well each character interacts with one another. Not only that but most of them have genuine development that has meaning that leaves the ending to be quite impactful. The movie excellently balances every character while leaving more room for them to grow and plenty of directions for future films. The villain is a bit mediocre, still works well and the acting by Kurt Russell really makes you hat the character...which is perfect. Oh and this movie looks absolutely beautiful, I never really noticed before but this movie was way ahead of its time...the camera work, the colours...everything is just amazing! Andddd the action :0 fabulousss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

More fun & frolics with our gang in the outer galaxy.....,"The surprise comic book movie of recent years, has built on its original premise, and provided another slice of fun, frolics, humour and originality. We have a motley crue of intergalactic hired hands who simply can't do anything without some fun and action.We have here more an equal footing for most of the characters, although that's not to take away from Chris Pratt as the main lead. We have the beautiful Zoe Saldana as Gamora, the lovable big muscled Drax, the wily Rocket and the now adorable Groot. There's around 3 or so different strands of story in this film, and to the credit of all, each interlinks without stepping on each other's toes. Which is quite a feat.Really, the main crux is the camaraderie amongst our crew. Are they a unit or are they really a family? As they encounter life-threatening situations, they are moving towards the family aspect, and it's just heart-warming.The whole film is sci-fi, but is wrapped up in a pseudo-retro feel from the early 1980s, and the soundtrack is as big a star in this as in the original.I really enjoyed this space voyage, there are old friends back in this and new ones too, and to my surprise, it's not over crowded, the writers have done so well. Really recommend this for a viewing. Enjoy.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A fun sci-fi/superhero sequel,"These comments assume viewers have seen the first film and are thus familiar with the established characters.As this sequel opens are heroes are protecting crucial batteries from an interdimensional threat in exchange for them handing over Nebula, the criminal sister of Gamora. Unfortunately Rocket steals the batteries and soon the Sovereign Race are hunting then down. They manage to escape with the help of a stranger who turns out to be Ego; somebody who is more than a man and is closely connected to one of the team. Quill, Gamora and Drax accompany Ego, and his empath associate Mantis, to his home world; Ego's Planet. Meanwhile Rocket and Baby Groot guard Nebula. Somewhat inevitably things go wrong for both groups and once again they are forced to save the galaxy.I really enjoyed this film; I know it is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and thus a superhero movie but it feels more like science fiction with its space based setting, assorted aliens and general atmosphere... that suited my tastes nicely. The story is fun providing plenty of excuses for impressive action scenes and some nice twists. More importantly though it gives us good character development for existing characters and some good new characters. As one would expect the special effects are most impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and enjoy the ride. The cast do a fine job making their characters fun to watch and providing humour that isn't overly forced. Overall I'd recommend this to fans of the first film; if you haven't seen the first film, and like fun sci-fi action, I'd advise watching that first then this... then look forward to the promised third film being released.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Vol. 1 is fantastic, Vol. 2 is satisfying and nothing more","When I watched Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014, I couldn't imagine it would be one of the best superhero movies I've ever seen. It was so funny, inventive, original and packed with memorable characters, I just loved it. So, as you can imagine, I was really excited to see the sequel. Did Vol. 2 match my expectations? Hum, not exactly. It could have been much worse but it should have been much better. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is more like Age of Ultron or Iron Man 2 than The Winter Soldier or The Empire Strikes Back. Let's analyze it:PROS:The opening sequence: it perfectly captures the spirit of the first Guardians.The soundtrack: it's okay, it fits into the movie, although it's not near as memorable or as good as Vol. 1.The visuals: stunning. The cinematography and special effects are definitely better this time around.Baby Groot: you can't hate him. Every time he's on screen you can't take your eyes off him. He has 3 funny moments, but I felt he could (and should) have been used a lot more.The characters: We learn new, surprising things about some of them. That helps us to understand and even sympathize more with them.The action scenes: they're good, not incredible, original or memorable, just entertaining (even though there is very, I mean very, VERY little physical fights and a lot of spaceship battles).Surprises: there are compelling plot twists (but none of them are particularly original), there are some great cameos and fun post-credit scenes.The acting: just like the in first movie, is amazing. Everybody fits their roles perfectly.Mantis: a good addition. She's a funny and interesting character, but I don't see anybody after this movie saying ""Mantis is my favorite character of Guardians of the Galaxy"".There is a sequence with Yondu, Rocket and Baby Groot that is just incredible. One of the best moments in the whole MCU for sure. I just loved it.There are some heartfelt and touching moments.The movie is never boring.It's great so see the characters we loved in the first movie back. As usual, their interactions are fun to watch.The 3D: good, although unnecessary.CONS:Unfocused story line: The movie takes a long time to really start; there is too much characters and too much going on at the same time.Ego: I was expecting much more. Kurt Russell is fine, but I can see this role been played by any other decent actor. The character is much more a Living Exposition than a Living Planet.The villain(s): weak and forgettable, just like 95% of the villains of the MCU.A lot of forced humor: the original had it but this time there is even more. Vol. 2 is funny but the original is much much more.Lack of originality: this time, almost nothing feels fresh, memorable or inventive.The main characters evolved very little compared to the original and most of them are given nothing to do during most part of the movie.There's not enough tension or excitement.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not as good as the original or the best MCU movie ever, but it's a satisfying follow up. It has some misses but more hits. It didn't let me crazy to see Volume 3 or increased my excitement for Infinity War, but it was a fun ride. Just don't go see it with crazy expectations because otherwise you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a good time at the movies, this is the movie you should see.PS.: You don't have to watch every single MCU movie to understand Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Watch only the first Guardians, that's enough.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Guardians Vol. 2 continues Gunn's energetic, fun & emotional formula.","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is written & directed by James Gunn and stars Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, Dave Bautista, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Pom Klementieff, Michael Rooker, Sean Gunn and Kurt Russell.Set to the backdrop of Awesome Mixtape #2, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2' continues the team's adventures as they unravel the mystery of Peter Quill's true parentage.Where to start? After the huge success of Gunn's first instalment in the trilogy and the incredible praise it received, Guardians Vol. 2 had expectations set pretty high. The story was written beautifully and each character felt important. It was hilarious & action-packed but still left room for one of the most vital ingredients in any film; emotion. When the first film cut to black, the fans felt like they'd experienced something truly unique. It made us happy, sad, filled with adrenaline. Gunn had us hooked on these feelings. The bar was set.Which is why I'm so happy that Guardians Vol. 2 hits every single one of those notes once again. There's a surprise ingredient in this instalment, however, and you'll know it when you see it.Let's start with the characters. 'The 5' are back. It pretty much picks up from where the first film left off, but our characters have evolved significantly and it's evident from the first 10 minutes; which is one of the most incredibly fun sequel openers I've ever seen (again, you'll understand when you see it). Peter Quill / Star-Lord, played effortlessly by Chris Pratt has some of the funniest lines, but also hits the emotional core splendidly. Bautista's Drax is one of the most amusing characters in the line-up. He delivers each line with great comedic timing and had the theatre laughing from line to line. Rocket is brilliant, Bradley Cooper is casting at its best. Gamora and Nebula are given some more development, we hear about their past and even at times feel a little sympathy for Nebula. Both Saldana and Gillan play their respective roles with strength. Even Baby Groot has some chances to shine, which is awesome.There's a new addition with Klementieff's Mantis, providing a nice back-and-fourth between herself and Drax. Stallone's casting didn't work with me, it's one of the very minor things I disliked about the film, however we never get a chance to explore his character. Michael Rooker returns as Yondu and he is a badass with so many crazy scenes, a truly superb performance. Alongside Rooker is Sean Gunn, brother of James, returning as Kraglin. He has some really cool moments and definitely develops more as a character towards the end of this film. Finally, Kurt Russell. Yes, it's no spoiler that he plays the father of Quill. In fact, it would be impossible to avoid. That's why the 'reveal' is in the trailers. Gunn personally chose to have that scene included. There's so much more to Kurt's character, which I will not discuss here. Though a little exaggerated, Kurt is great.Moving the focus towards something that most of the time goes unnoticed, or at least under-appreciated, is the costume design. Judianna Makovsky pays close attention to detail and everything looks beautiful. These films wouldn't be as brilliantly convincing as they are without her. The same goes for the cinematography, editing, visual effects, make-up, production design, art decoration, set decoration, stunts, sound department, and of course, the music.As an exception, I had listened to the entire score by Tyler Bates before seeing the film. I think it worked out better this way; I had a vision in my mind of how these themes were going to be used, but then hearing them within the context of the film really surprised me. Tyler has created a wonderful score that, with Gunn's love and appreciation for his work, has been utilised perfectly. There's some Williams-esque writing in the percussion during the opening battle, creating a fierce introduction which then progresses into a psychological examination of our leads, most notably Peter Quill. Not only is it an enjoyable listen compositionally, it's as vitally important as the characters.One of many fans' favourite 'characters' from the first Guardians was the Awesome Mix, gifted to Quill by his mother. In the final act of the first film, Quill opens a second gift with another tape inside, Awesome Mix Vol. 2. This continues to complement the picture wonderfully from start to finish. Personal favourites are Electric Light Orchestra's ""Mr. Blue Sky"" & Fleetwood Mac's ""The Chain,"" but a perfect use of Cat Stevens' ""Father And Son"" may just cap it off.Finally, Gunn's writing feels as grounded and as human as it did before. He writes humour very well, but also provides intricate detail within characters that move the viewers. It creeps up on you and it's tremendously touching. Not only that, but Guardians Vol. 2, like the first, never once feels as if it's just setting up the next big thing. Although taking place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), it sticks with our characters and only very minor nods to the MCU are used, creating its own 'Cosmic Universe' which breathes a lot of fresh air into the genre.I could go on and on, but that would ruin the experience. This film showcases some serious talent, in front of the camera and behind the scenes. Support these incredible individuals by heading to your nearest cinema and seeing this film. If you enjoyed the first Guardians, you're gonna love this. I think it's better on almost all levels.Verdict; Action-packed, hilarious and an emotional ride.

The Guardians Are Back And They Brought The Laughs And Action,"Saving the Universe is bound to get you noticed, and in ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"", we find the dysfunctional Guardians reaping the benefits of their newly found notoriety by being hired to resolve threats all over the galaxy.The film opens with Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), and Groot (Vin Diesel), battling a gigantic creature at the request of a race known as the Sovereign.During a frantic and hysterical battle the crew is eventually triumphant and accepts their payment, which is the form of Nebula (Karen Gillan), who the crew look to turn in for a very lucrative bounty and settle some old scores in the process.Of course their naturally ability to find trouble arises thanks to Rocket, and soon they have a very large and motivated new enemy gunning for them which results in them crashing on a remote planet. A mysterious benefactor named Ego (Kurt Russell), arrives and claims to have a connection with Peter and he, Gamora, and Drax head off with Ego and his assistant Mantis (Pom Klementieff), to his planet while the rest of the crew repair the ship.As if things were not complicated enough, Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his crew of Revengers arrive hoping to collect a Bounty on the Guardians that has the group divided and facing serious danger. A new and greater threat is soon discovered and despite internal tensions and conflicts, the Guardians must once again risk everything to save the universe once again.The new film hits the ground running with plenty of action and humor and gives the characters new and old plenty of great moments that really expand upon their characters. The only issue is that the film does have some slow pacing in the middle as we are given numerous CGI landscapes where the crew walks around talking, but little else. With such a large cast, this is done to allow the characters to grow and new ones to be properly introduced, but it can at times drag on. Thankfully the finale is filled with the trademark humor and action that fans have come to expect which although very CGI heavy does result in a very satisfying and surprisingly touching finale.The cast works well with one another and the jokes fly frequently throughout. Writer/Director James Gunn has done a great job in expanding the characters and introducing new ones as we see new layers of complexity to the characters that explain their actions and motivations in ways not usually shown in comic themed movies. I would strongly suggest waiting through the credits for the numerous bonus scenes and keep an eye out during the film for some special surprises as the film is littered with them.As the characters will soon transition to ""The Avengers: Infinity War"" which is currently filming audiences will not have to wait as long to see the dysfunctional Guardians family on their next outing, and thankfully we have an enjoyable new outing to enjoy until then. 4 stars out of 5",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It doesn't deliver like it should but that doesn't mean you won't have fun.,"Guardians of the Galaxy was a surprise hit in 2014. No one expected the film to do the business it did, especially me. However, the film delivered on every single thing you would want out of a summer blockbuster. It had heart, action, comedy, thrills and the right slice of drama to make it a little better than your average summer film. Now, fast forward 3 years and we've got its much anticipated sequel. Many fans will absolutely love this film and rightfully so. James Gunn has done a great job with these two films and it will definitely be enjoyed even if it is half the measure of the first film.First off, the movie is good. It is light, funny and definitely digestible. There is not one moment where you find yourself lost or wondering what is going on. That is a definite plus for a sequel. Sure, having a handle on the source material or, at least the first film, will help but it isn't really needed. Considering there has been a plethora of Marvel Universe films since Guardians of the Galaxy, not needing to brush up on some plot points is a good thing. While I could easily go into a 10 page essay on this film and its quirks and why it works, I am giving a short, sweet spoiler free review here. So, in short, the film itself is a decent sequel to a great movie.The cast returns and delivers even more banter and jeering at each other than the first film which adds to the characters. Chris Pratt and the voice work of Bradley Cooper really tie this film's characters together. Supporting cast members such as newbie to the series, Kurt Russell or seasoned alumni Michael Rooker, all deliver with Rooker giving a career best performance here. The man is so good in this film, you forget which side he's on. It's not that you love to hate him. It's that you can't wait to see what he does next. The film's strong point is its cast and James Gunn knows it. He uses it to his complete advantage. We care about these characters, no matter how other worldly they end up being. That is a true testament to James Gunn as a director. He really does an amazing job both as a filmmaker and screenwriter. But, no matter how good of a job he does, the film is a bit of a mess at times.Now for the problems it has...there are quite a few. The biggest issue facing this film is that it is too similar to the first. There isn't enough to distinguish it from the original and that is a bad thing at times. It doesn't allow for the freshness and inventiveness that the first one had and that was where a lot of its magic happened. Truthfully, the only way to distinguish both films apart are the soundtracks. While both soundtracks are awesome, they're both different in a lot of ways. From Blue Suede to Fleetwood Mac, that's the big difference musically...but visually, it's more of the same. That's probably the biggest and only complaint that I have with this film. As much as I like seeing these guys and gals kick some otherworldly ass, I still wish there was just a little bit more to it than what we got.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a complete rehashing of the first film with a new character here and there and a revamped soundtrack. While many will be happy with the end product, those of you who are wanting something fresh and new will have to holster those expectations. The film is definitely a crowd pleaser and will go over quite well with audiences and fans. At the end of the day, I think that is all James Gunn and Co could dream of getting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
It's an Okay Addition to the MCU,"This is quite an experimental film coming from Marvel. There are risks, but there are also safe spots. I thought a lot of the comedy hit for comedic reaction, but a lot of it screwed with the tone of the film and continuity of the Marvel universe. I don't think it's a bad thing to 2x the comedy up for Guardians of the Galaxy, but Gunn needs to know how to put them in the right spot so he doesn't create a chain of uneven continuity errors. There were parts near the end that should've been taken more seriously instead it was very insulting. There are a group of villains that are forced to be there that Gunn should've just shown for 2 minutes and move on with one main villain. They do end up having a purpose by the end, but they are just a plot device to be used for the next film. I feel like Marvel should've made the decision to make this a complete standalone instead of teasing for the next. The main villain is a bit better developed, but really too over the top and just completely silly. I like the character development throughout the film even though two of them did nothing. I feel the worst development out of all of them is Drax. They do keep some serious aspects of him, but he's quite uneven and becomes an almost different character. At times, he was so over the top that he ended up being comic relief throughout. Like, actually trying to be funny. The humor isn't bad, it's not completely cringeworthy like the other previous Marvel films, but it's just becomes a mess for the narrative. The visual effects are good, but there are several parts where the visual concepts just look bad. There is not much use of the 8K camera, but when there is, the dynamic range is incredible. Hopefully, Disney decides to adapt to a full length 8K Marvel film in the future.Overall, this was a fun movie even though being deeply flawed.

"Review - Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 - Fine, but certainly not as good as the first one.","Guardians of the Galaxy came out of nowhere, at least for me. I'd heard the name thrown around a few times in conversation with hardcore comic- book fans but didn't really know anything about them before the film was released. I really liked it. I thought it was a great departure from the standard MCU formula (as much of a departure as can be had while still being part of the universe, anyway) and a genuinely exciting film with fresh characters and a fun tone.With this sequel, it feels as if the filmmakers recognised that audiences were pleasantly surprised by the first and so decided to see what else they could get away with. Something new had to be done, something that built upon the characters established by the first. Sadly, the charm of the original was lost somewhere along the way.We begin with the Guardians seemingly earning their way by working as mercenaries. Returning are Star-Lord (Chris Pratt being Chris Pratt, which is entirely fine by me), Gamora (Zoe Saldana is underutilised), Drax (Dave Bautista is hilarious, if a little one-note), Rocket (Bradley Cooper does his best with some very poor dialogue) and Groot (Fun, but would many people have even noticed if they got someone other than Vin Diesel to voice child-Groot?). After a member of this team crosses a client, they're chased across the stars before being rescued by a powerful entity who reveals himself to be Star-Lord's father (played by Kurt Russell, who channels Pratt and does a great job in doing so). We also get a scene of young Russell, which was probably the best implementation of digital deaging that I've seen in film, and yet I still couldn't help finding it a little weird. Until I can't tell at all that it's computer-generated, I don't think I like it. The ultimate unnecessity (Is that a word? Should be) of said scene didn't help matters.On the topic of necessity, it really is quite frustrating when filmmakers explain a joke to the audience after telling it. It's insulting and redundant. You can understand it when Star-Lord makes a reference to Earth pop-culture and then needs to explain it to his alien friends, and you can understand where Drax, who does not understand the concept of metaphor, is concerned. Do we really need all of the other jokes to be explained to us as well, though? Ironically, the film doesn't bother explaining things that actually have importance to the plot, especially in its third act where multiple revelations are had.Other complaints? Lazy exposition, especially early on. Jokes taken way too far. Multiple instances of toilet-humour, and not cleverly done, either. Some weird line deliveries with emphasis in all the wrong places. Annoying illogic (how come space-suits can be taken off without issue, but later on a character can't get theirs off? How come one character witnesses another pinned and uses that moment to shoot at them until they fall a few metres and are pinned again, and the character this time goes to save them? What changed in the last five seconds? The situation is identical). Also some truly cringe-worthy cheesiness towards the end of the film, some of which was supposed to be sad and some funny. It wasn't at all earned. The ""sad"" stuff, specifically, was crammed so tightly into the end of the film that it barely had time to register before being capitalised upon. The worst offender, though, was a scene in which certain characters travel faster-than-light for longer than they are supposed to, resulting in what I assume was supposed to be amusing screams, facial-distortions and eye-bulges for a while. Very Looney Tunes. And then we cut back to it, multiple times. It's really silly, and not in a good way.There are some fantastic elements and moments. The dynamic between Drax and new character Mantis is hilarious. Most of the dialogue, sans- toilet-humour, is great. The opening titles are excellent, and got my hopes up for the rest of the film (whoops). Performances are solid, music is fun, and there were some awesome shots in there. There was even a subtle 47-reference. When it comes down to it, Guardians 2 isn't a bad movie. It just isn't a good one.Five post-credits scenes (not exaggerating) is probably a little much, too.http://alexfalzon.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-2/ - for spoilers (and more reviews)",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
This film is unabashedly funny,"I saw Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 last night on the Xtreme screen at Hoyts Riccarton and I was utterly pleased with the work James Gunn has done for this film. There is no dearth of unapologetic humor in this film and after a certain point of time even the strong speakers of the cinema hall could not douse one of my friends' maniacal laughter. I was personally vouching for the more serious moments in the film because that's when I could clearly hear what the characters were saying. Otherwise when there was even the slightest hint of comedy, this guy (my friend) used to start laughing like the most hysterically loud hyena that has ever walked on this planet.In this film we get a better insight into the complexities of Star- Lord's dad and realize that he is not exactly what he seems to be. We also get a better idea of Yondu's character. I wish Marvel made a spin-off film that intricately depicted the culture and traditions of the Ravagers. They are such an exquisite group of space -pirates. I also felt sorry for Nebula and I wish the Avengers manage to conquer Thanos as fast as possible although knowing how powerful Thanos is, it will take quite sometime to bring Thanos down.We get to see Stan Lee in this film, not once, but two times. And the Marvel tradition of having post-credits scenes is maintained in this film. There are a plethora of post-credits scenes and I am eager to find out how significant Sylvester Stallone's character turns out to be in the future editions of the Marvel films. It would be awesome to see Doctor Strange and the Avengers team up with the Guardians to fight their most important battle . We got amazing seats for this film. We were seated at the center of the hall and I felt I was right amidst all the action that was happening on the screen. I'll try to seat myself at the center for all the future Marvel viewings.

The laughs and adventure pumped up by 10!,"Greetings! Just came from a double-feature showing of the Guardians movies, Volume 1 and 2 together. In doing this I got to compare the first and the second movie with them both freshly in my mind, and I will say Vol 2 is the BETTER of the two movies. The first movie did introduce us to this universe and these characters, so therefore you will hear some people 'professional critics' complain that Volume 2 isn't as 'fresh' and the first movie. Well they are idiots for saying that because the first movie was the introduction to characters most people have never heard of. Remember when the first trailer came out and many people were like ""who the heck are these people? is Marvel pulling our leg?"". Volume 2 gets to get right into the action and the story without having to re-introduce all the characters again. The movie has bigger and better laughs and some very touching moments. The stand out characters in this film are definitely Yondu and Nebula. You find out what drives them and what shapes them and their life. The only downside to the movie is although it is 2 hours and 15 minutes long, it seems to go by way to quickly and I would have loved for it to have 20 minutes longer.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Literally fighting a planet,"The enemy is literally a freaking planet. The old crew from guardians of the galaxy is back.

But soon (though not too soon) they shall discover that something is wrong, that Quill's dad has evil intentions. That's when a spectacularly animated fight starts again.I already wasn't a fan of the first movie and I'm still not a fan of this one. There is still no SHIELD involvement and the story pace was kind of slow this movie.

It's Pretty Good,"Guardians of The Galaxy has so much potential, being a Marvel movie based in space. This new installment, although a good movie, still leaves a lot to be desired.The story is something that's been done before and the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise doesn't really bring much new to the table in that department. Same with the villain he might even be blander than the villain in the first Guardians. Though something it does do better in Vol. 1 is character development. Every member of the guardians are genuinely interesting and doesn't come off nearly as one dimensional as they did in the first one.This franchise has struck gold with it's soundtrack again. The special effects are up to Marvel's standards and the camera work doesn't do much special.Everything in this movie was good (other than the drawn out death scene plus funeral at the end) so give it a watch.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guardians of Box Office Profits,"We recently watched ""Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 2"" as a class. The series continues with another strong movie, leaving no question about the universe they've created, the age gap across the moviegoer demography, and the carefully placed comedy within the interstellar drama. If you are looking for adventure, comedy, love, drama, and talking animals, the second in the GOTG series will not let you down!The movie begins as the Guardians protect a set of batteries in the sovereign territories from a monster. After stealing the batteries, a series of unfortunate events cause Peter (Star-Lord) Quill, played by Chris Pratt, and the rest of the guardians to cross paths with a sentient being named Ego, played by Kurt russell, (spoilers withheld here) who takes the Guardians to a planet he has crafted with his powers. Ego ends up being an important piece of Quill's puzzle (still withholding spoilers). Throughout the adventure, comedy is provided by Drax (Dave Bautista), and Rocket (Bradley Cooper), advice and attitude by Gamora (Zoe Saldana), and overall confusion by Groot (Vin Diesel).I loved the never-ending twist of action and comedy, and the way that you are always learning something new about a character, helping the story to continue to evolve. Drax being brain dead and Star-Lord's hard-headedness help to involve the viewer by presenting relatable character traits, and the space pirate equivalent to everyday personal and social issues. At times the movie seemed to drag, but it would always redeemed itself. A large underlying moral of this story is that family doesn't always mean blood, and to be careful who you trust.The demographic for GOTG is unbelievable. The rating and often gore-free violence opens it up to younger viewers, adults who grew up in the 80's are attracted to the throwback style of soundtrack, and pop-culture references, and older generations who saw the Guardians emerge as a comic are drawn in by this modern version of a childhood staple. This movie is honestly excellent for everyone; never too gory or vulgar, has great underlying messages and morals, and is only rated PG-13. I give this movie 4.5/5 stars. It is a great movie overall, with no lack in entertainment and excitement.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Whenever the writer(s) of a movie have to resort to penis jokes, you know they're grasping at comedic straws.The first movie had a good Sci-Fi story interspersed with well timed moments of humor which I enjoyed. This film, in contrast, was laced with one lame joke after another that I've seen time and time again in other movies.

Like any child, Groot is either fondled or abused, perhaps an oblique comment on family omertà, just as supposed adults often exercise their hangups on their own progeny.

Character driven fun,"Guardians of the Galaxy 2 takes the audience on a fun but ultimately personal adventure with the rag-tag outcasts that we met in the first film.GotG 2 throws you straight into the action, as the team tackle a job for Ayesha and the Sovereign (or rather, the gold people) And in typical Guardians fashion, something doesn't quite go right, which leads to the Guardians being chased by the 'golden people.' Upon this journey, we meet Ego, who claims to be Star Lord's father. The introduction of Kurt Russell as Ego was a great addition to the cast because of his charisma. He's easy to like and I found myself wanting to learn more about his intentions. His side-kick Mantis also helps add a lot of humour to the film. The dynamic of the team is the films biggest strength and really made for an entertaining viewing. The family dynamic has slightly developed since the first film, especially with Groot now in his youngest form. I have to say, I really did like the way they animated Groot, but I do feel like James Gunn really did push for the ""awws"" from the audience, of which I heard plenty. There is a general feeling that the group are a lot closer (except for Star- Lord and Rocket who continue to bicker like brothers) and it is clear that some time has passed since the first film, as they are now sort of cult heroes in the universe.Each character has their moment to shine, especially Yondu, who is given a lot more on screen time this time around. Dave Bautista did really steal the show as Drax, as he did with the first one for me. His comedic timing and deadpan humour was a real treat. On the topic of humour, the film delivers on laughs however I do feel that at some point some of the things characters say does feel out of place. For instance, jokes about a specific character's looks often fell flat.Whilst the scale of the final act is large, it unlike other Marvel films, is not fixated on expanding the universe and is instead self- contained-preferring to develop the characters and their arcs. This is something I appreciated but in a strange way, made the narrative feel insignificant and quite forgettable. The final set piece also takes away from the more human nature of the narrative. There were some pacing issues throughout the film. I felt that things just sort of happened for the sake of progressing the narrative and that the film felt absent of flow in some parts.I think the one thing that separates the Guardians from any cinematic superhero team is the family dynamic because it genuinely works. The characters, colour and soundtrack are vibrant and help to create a charming adventure. The way in which in the team interact alone is enough to recommend watch this film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
All good fun,"Even though I really enjoyed the first 'Guardians of the Galaxy' movie, for some reason it didn't leave me wanting to watch the next instalment straight away. I sort of got the feeling that it would be more of the same. And it was. And I tried really hard not to like it. And I failed. Yes, it's effectively not that different to the first instalment and yes there's a lot of CGI, making it look like an extended cut-scene from a computer game, but it's just too much fun to really hate.The story carries on a little while after the first ended and our team of 'Guardians' are in the middle of some computer-generated space combat, generally saving the galaxy from one beastie or another. However, the main story is kicked off by a plot thread that was left hanging from the original, namely regarding 'Starlord's' father.People often use the term 'Avengers in space' to describe the 'Guardians' films and I can see why. It's technically (another) superhero team-up movie. Starlord is 'the star,' but the rest of the screen time is shared between the five or so other main cast members, giving each just about enough room for a little character development. And it's because it's an ensemble that it words so well. I guess for all its obvious flaws that I tried to dwell on, it's the sheer 'interaction' between the characters that makes it so enjoyable. Yes, the action is - by today's standard - pretty generic in that you'll probably have seen stuff like it before in any other modern sci-fi movie, but the way the characters bicker is a joy to watch.It's also nice to see Michael Rooker's character getting extra screen time, but the big surprises were the 'big names' of 'Tango & Cash' getting back together for their respective roles (or should I say Sylvester Stallone and Kurt Russell if you're not familiar with that *ahem* 'classic' buddy-cop movie from yesteryear). There's even a bit of genuine emotion thrown in there at the end which I won't go into for fear of runing into 'spoiler' territory.Ultimately, if you're familiar with the current 'Marvel Shared Universe' then 'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' isn't anything you haven't seen before, even coming across like other similar modern space epics (like 'Valarien' only people actually went to see this film!), but if you're looking for something which is pure 'fun' then you'll definitely find it here. It's not really that necessary to know what went on before and I was pleased to see that this film wasn't one long lead-in to the upcoming 'Avengers: Infinity War' movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A fair follow up,"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2 - Another larger than life offering from Marvel, but one that doesn't reach the heights of its predecessor.When the first installment came out in 2014, it was nothing short of a complete experiment by the studio. There was no popular hero or mainstream IP to tout, but rather a collection of no-name characters and an 80's soundtrack. This very well could have been the beginning of the end for Marvel. The result was a resounding success, becoming the 10th highest grossing superhero film of all time. How did they follow this up? With poop jokes.I'm not saying the last one was an upper-echelon comedy, but this one is pretty much lowest common denominator when it comes to material. Along with the aforementioned topic, they throw in a handful of crotch jokes too so the 10 year olds could chuckle. Too often what could be heartfelt moments quickly get turned into jokes or are made light of right away so as not to pull in any emotion.There are some fun action scenes, but how they're executed ultimately ends up hurting the movie in the long run. In the first 20 minutes the characters are seemingly unfazed by massive amounts of punishment, removing any sense of tension for what they might encounter in the remaining 2 hours.There are of course plenty of positives in the movie. It takes the time to flesh out the majority of the characters, which is something that is skipped over all too often in large ensemble pieces. You really come to know and care about these characters. What started out as a disadvantage prior to the release of the first one, has far and away become its strength. And the opening credits with Baby Groot might be worth the price of admission alone.There have been some great movies this year that were basically undone by poorly executed third acts (looking at you, A Cure For Wellness), but this one is not among them. While a good amount of the film was just OK for me, the summation brought my score up considerably. Underneath the surface level jokes and bright visuals, is a lot of heart and an important message. Not bad for a bunch of no-names.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Everyone Needs Family,GotG Vol. 2 is one of those rare sequels that was better than the original. Maybe it's just that the characters have grown on me more or the fact it was a better story but I found myself far more interested this time around. I'm still not running out to purchase GotG comic books but this movie is a nice addition to the ever-growing MCU. There were more laugh-out-loud moments as well as more heart-touching moments. I think a couple of the heart-touching moments were a bit out of place if not just a little too trite; still they were tolerable.The pervasive message was that everyone needs family whether that family be an adopted family or blood family. Of the handful of very apparent presentations of this message I'd say one or two of them were done well--meaning it aided the story instead of looking as if it was shoe horned in there.By and large I can't complain much about this film. The two hours were well spent.,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
*batteries not in-Grooted,"Wolfing down a huge amount of MCU films in a very short time, as I have found myself doing in the last year or so, makes you appreciate the differences. Going straight from one of the more ponderous and formulaic entries to this is quite the tonal whiplash and I found myself liking Vol. 2 much more than the original film. Drax is written better, the main character arcs all work well and the finale is pretty great. The issues I have with this spacey pocket of the universe are still there though, it's pretty blokey and Peter's dogged pursuit of Gamora never feels less than greasy. The ""ugly"" joke as well only serves to highlight the ""men can be giant trees/racoons/planets women can only look like women"" issue.

Nice,"Like its predecessor, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 benefits too much from the cast's charisma and dynamic soundtrack to support themselves. For my part, this is a little better than the first. The 2014 film, in my opinion, is very nice and the humor works, but there are some problems in the technical part of the production (the CGI is particularly mediocre) and some performances in the main group are not so good. For example, Chris Pratt, despite being a charismatic protagonist, in that movie sounded rather pedantic and one-note, with the music tossing and the comedic tirades, just like the Rocket. But here things are much sharper, I think that the space of 3 years between one and the other has benefited, it gave the actors time to find themselves better in their roles, and the track is less excessive. The space adventures of this group of misfits are not one of my favorites at MCU, but still, a good adventure.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

A Thrilling and Hilarious Sequel to the Beloved Superhero Movie,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a worthy successor to the first movie, delivering all the thrills, humor, and heart that fans have come to expect from the franchise. The movie picks up where the first one left off, with the ragtag team of misfits - Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Rocket, and Groot - embarking on a new adventure to save the galaxy once again.One of the strengths of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is its excellent cast of characters. Each member of the team is given plenty of screen time to shine, and the movie also introduces some new and intriguing characters, such as the mysterious Ego and the fierce Mantis. The chemistry between the actors is spot-on, and their comedic timing is impeccable, leading to many laugh-out-loud moments throughout the film.But Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is more than just a comedy - it also has plenty of heart. The movie delves deeper into the backstories of some of the characters, revealing new layers and emotions that make them even more relatable and sympathetic. The film also explores themes of family, loyalty, and sacrifice, adding depth and weight to the story.Of course, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 also has plenty of action and adventure. The movie is filled with thrilling set pieces and epic battles, all set to an amazing soundtrack that features classic rock and pop hits.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a must-see movie for fans of the first film and for anyone who loves superhero movies with heart, humor, and action. It's a thrilling and hilarious ride that will leave you wanting more, and it cements the Guardians as some of the most beloved characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Strong sequel,"Yes yes yes. I'm really suprised about rating a marvel film this high but it really deserves it. I enjoyed the sequel more than than the first one. I genuinely love guardiens of the galaxy and I think they're the the best marvel films for now (I haven't watched all of the mcu films). The film was well structured, had good directing and was funny. We got to explore in more deph the characters especially Peter and his relationship with his father. I liked the acting in this film as well as in the first one especially Chris Pratt, he's really good. I got goosebumps during the end of the film which is funny because I never get really emotionally connected to marvel films or too interested in the characters and the story overall. Watch the film and the first one you will enjoy them.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Less Funny, Less Interesting","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is not a bad movie, but a huge downgrade from its predecessor.The writers had great ideas for the story, but the execution is poor. The first half of the movie is uninteresting and boring. The second half is more engaging with the high stakes and more focused story. I think it was a mistake not to have one clear villain throughout the whole movie, but it was great to see a different kind of antagonist. I think it was stupid that the Sovereign chased after the Guardians for a few objects that most likely cost less than the equipment they lost while chasing them.The direction isn't bad, but this movie is not together. The cinematography is good, the pacing is great. The visual effects are amazing and the cast is awesome.

Colorful and entertaining,"The sequence to GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY sticks to most of the good things that made the first movie such a success. It's a more colorful vision of Sci-Fi than what we see in oh-so-many gray dystopias. And it's warm-hearted and light-headed, never taking itself too seriously. And even though self-irony pervades almost every image, there is some genuine sense of suspense in at least some of the action-packed scenes. The movie has some hilarious new side characters, in particular the arrogant queen of the Sovereigns—all painted in gold. The sensitive ""Mantis"" and her interactions with Drax add a tint of cuteness. The performances of the main cast, the likes of Zoe Saldana and Chris Pratt, was as good as we come to expect.The plot's main theme surrounds the discovery of Chris Pratt's past. This piece of the story is interesting enough to keep you going, but it's also not particularly deep and moving—a somewhat slower pace and a bit more 'feel' for the depth of the characters would have helped here, but then, oh well, there'd been less time for all the fun action! And so VOL. 2 of the guardians is a blooming and buzzing action sci-fi adventure with a somewhat shallow story ... but it's entertaining nonetheless! If you liked the first one, this is definitely recommended.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Pretty good, for a CGI-driven sequel...","Like most sequels, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" lacks the freshness and novelty of the original. The main characters, while still entertaining, are a bit predictable, having had their shtick well established in #1. The primary villain continues the trend for 'super-heroes' to be combating some kind of god-like foe, (presumably mundane villains are no longer sufficiently challenging), which allows the special effects/CGI teams to pretty much include any image that they find interesting (or easily rendered(?)). The film is fast moving and colourful (although I am getting tired of space looking tie-died – a little of that goes a long way) but the images come so fast that it's difficult to really get any real sense of at what you are looking. The climactic battle is overlong and confusing, being full of the 'swarms of ships' that is so popular in the current crop of CGI-driven movies. These criticisms aside, GotG2 is fun entry in to the movie Marvelverse. Michael Rooker's 'Udonta' returns and is put to good use, the new character, Ego's empath-servant Mantis, is a worthwhile addition to the story, and there is lots of quality Rocket time (I liked the scenes where the furry mercenary takes on an army of Ravagers). Good, but not great; watchable, but not rewatchable (at least by me).",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Hilariously funny, which brings us to the problem","Where GotG1 took us by surprise, in a time where cinemas are overloaded by superhero movies, GotG2 fails to do the same. GotG1 built on characters who were lesser known and succeeded in making them likable by combining background stories, with a decent build-up and great comedy thanks to flawless timing, while staying connected to the mainstream MCU.GotG2 had the opportunity to build further upon the stepping stones that GotG1 laid out. Since the backgrounds are now known, GotG2 had the chance to pick up the pace where GotG1 sometimes felt slow and chaotic. But instead of picking a pace, GotG2 chose to focus on comedy which was there abundantly. After 45 minutes of jokes, you get the drift, but the movie doesn't. Star-Lord is witty and funny, Rockey is sarcastic and funny, Drax is dumb and funny, Groot is cute and funny.During the 2nd half where the movie tries to turn to action and character work, while feeding us bits of information as a promise to part 3, the audience's patience may already have worn out after countless jokes that hurt the pace. The heroes are funny but offer nothing more than they already have. The villains feel empty and pointless. The plot is rushed and so disconnected from the mainstream MCU that his movie feels as a filler that could have been let out.The only character that rises above it all is Michael Rooker as Yondu, who single handedly provides more character and more development, than all the other characters do, despite the messy script. So is it a bad movie? No it isn't. Should you skip it? No you shouldn't. But IF you skip it, you won't miss very much.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Guardians of the Galaxy 2,The second Guardians of the Galaxy is good but not as good as the first. It is still quite funny and the cast is great again. Yondu gets a good story in this and the villain is good. The plot is not as strong as the first and the movie is a little messier then the first. It is also not as fast passed as the first movie. It was great on first watch but for me it hasn't held up on multiple viewings. Still a fun movie.7.5/10,7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A hilarious journey of Star Lord and the rest of the guardians as they travel the galaxy fending off some old and new foes as well as some unexpected introductions.,"As someone who has followed the MCU tirelessly and have been intrigued by these comics all my life I was nothing but eager to get into the theater to see Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2, and I must say it did not disappoint. So many things in this movie had to step up with the second installment not having the evil villain Ronan and the depth he added, and i feel like people stepped up perfectly. Drax for instance showed us that his humor ranged farther than his inability to sense sarcasm, and Yondu and Kraglin played perfectly by direction James Gunn's brother Sean Gunn stole the show in my opinion. In conclusion Guardians made me laugh like I expected, and it also gave me many more goosebumps than I had expected and it turned out to be a great second installment in a budding cinematic franchise.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
9,"The film is the long-awaited continuation of the adventures of the most atypical of the teams in the Marvel Universe. It includes such characters as: Star-Lord - Peter Quill (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax (Dave Bautista), Rocket Rocket Raccoon (original character voice acting from Bradley Cooper) and of course the cutest creature in the Groot universe who, after the events of the first part, became Baby Groot (he was originally voiced by Vin Diesel). Not without replenishment of the composition with new characters in the face of the devastator Yondu Udont (Michael Rooker), his deputy Kraglin (Sean Gunn) and the adopted daughter of Thanos, Gamora's sister - Nebula (Karen Gillan). In comparison with the first part, the film pushes the general interaction of the team into the background and shows the personalities of the characters, their characters and problems, and the plot is based on family values. The viewer is shown the relationship between Peter and the father of Ego (Kurt Russell), who suddenly appeared after so much time, who has his own planet on which there is not a soul except for his servant - the empath Mantis. The relationship between the sisters Gamora and Nebula. Drax who became part of this team has changed and become less gloomy. ""Rocket"" who takes care of baby Groot, and repels everyone else around him (a kind of egoist who wants to be paid attention and loved). Yonudu who not only raised Peter and replaced his father, he became one. With all this, the picture is still filled with cool 80s music, great action, a huge number of Easter eggs and references, humor (sometimes adult and on the edge but funny), and a cool main villain who was not spoiled in trailers. As a result, my rating is 5 out of 5, the MARVEL studio once again showed everyone that at the moment they are a cut above in comic book adaptations than everyone else.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Disney opens another chapter of action films but better than the 1st installment,"PROS: I watched Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.2 in IMAX with Laser and it was mind-blowing. Since the movie was especially shot for this format, it resulted in crystal clear images, projected by Dual Projectors on the Giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen along with the powerful 12000 Watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand!Once again I loved Raccoon, reminded me of Puss in Boots, making you laugh when he speaks. Baby Groot was predictably adorable and almost stole the show, but of course Star Lord is the main character, leading the group of a-holes. Action scenes were great and the colors were dazzling.CONS: The story relations between every character were good but again the story focuses more on comedy/drama and less on character development, especially of the villain(s). It has the (The Batman Lego Movie + F&F) mentality and some scenes were exaggerated but again Marvel fans would not mind.Verdict: The music? Well you can listen the GOTG Vol.2 songs over and over again and they all works perfectly in the context of the movie!My significant digit score: 6.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Guardians of the galaxy back 2 Africa,"Guardians vol. 2 by far has the best opening of all the marvel movies. I could watch the opening for two hours and be totally content. The set pieces and colors are so clever and beautiful. The design of characters is fine art. The humor is stronger than the first mostly, sometimes the balance between dark drama and humor feels a little mismatched. And dare I say even the soundtrack is improved. All the characters feel like your friends, like you know them personally. And of course, acting legend Kurt Russel is a marvel villain force to be reckoned with. Shoot, Yondu proves to be one of the greatest marvel characters of all time here.
The great thing about this film is it's not so worried about setting up anything but just telling a story. Telling a story about the characters and letting you learn about them more and give you more of an emotional connection. James Gunn went all out on his trademark weirdness on this film, he truly claims it. It's even stranger than Doctor Strange. AND you get Sylvester Stallone in the marvel universe. What else could you really ask for. All the guardians are in full flux here. Theres no way you're not going to have a good time, and even possibly just feel something.

Not as good as Vol. 1,"I loved the first film but found this one less enjoyable.

A fun cosmic adventure,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"" directed by James Gunn, continues the intergalactic adventures of Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) and his misfit crew. The film delivers on its promise of humor, heart, and spectacular action sequences, diving deeper into the backstories and relationships of the beloved characters introduced in the first film.The story focuses on Peter Quill's discovery of his true parentage, introducing Kurt Russell as his enigmatic and powerful father, Ego. The dynamic between the characters, especially the sibling rivalry between Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and Nebula (Karen Gillan), adds emotional depth to the otherwise light-hearted narrative. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) continue to charm with their antics, providing much of the film's humor.Visually, the film is a vibrant spectacle, with colorful planets and imaginative alien species. The soundtrack, once again, plays a significant role, with nostalgic tunes that enhance the film's retro-futuristic feel.While ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" excels in entertainment value and character development, its plot occasionally feels disjointed, and some jokes miss the mark.

Family is much more than blood,"Guardians of the galaxy vol. 2 is where the cast settled with each other, and it became a good comedy/sci-fi/action mix. Everyone seems far more down on earth and natural here and the chemistry seems far more natural. This is the dysfunctional superhero family in the MCU and it´s amazing to see them grow together in this movie. You can feel the natural evolution of the characters, and this is a fun little adventure. And also Disney+, stop changing your aspect ratio.After Rocket get´s the guardians into trouble, they are saved by an entity called Ego, Peters dad. Peter now learns about his origin while the rest of the guardians finds the circumstances suspicious. Rocket, Groot and the captured Nebula is repairing a broken ship and is taken hostage by the ravagers.I think the movie handles it´s two storylines pretty well. It jumps from story to story in a natural way. I will say the story fizzles out a bit though. I started to lose interest in the Peter storyline and just wanted the Rocket storyline to continue instead. The union of the two stories work fine and the climactic ending is pretty good. The first hour of this movie is very solid and entertaining though.I think this was a potential strong villain character, but Ego ended up being disappointing to me. I think he fits well into the theme of the movie about what is family and that it´s more than blood, but he becomes a bit too cartoony towards the end where his plan is revealed, he starts to monologue and dose an evil deed for evil deeds sake. It´s a bit unnaturally integrated to me.The acting at display is very good. Every actor really gets´s to shine in their own way. Chris Pratt as Peter has a lot of moments to shine and is very funny in this movie. He has some issues towards the end with some emotional scenes, but other than that a solid performance. Karen Gillian as Nebula also delivers a strong performance. While Bradly Cooper still has some issues with him sounding like his voice recording and seems distant from the rest of the cast, his acting is very good, his comedic timing can be a bit off but overall, a strong performance. Pom Klementieff as Mantis is a fun little character, and the new baby Groot is fun and adorable. Dave Bautista is so great as Drax, his comedic timing and delivery is incredible and no doubt the highlight of the movie for me. But for greatest performance in this movie, I´ll give it to Michael Rooker as Yondu. He really gets to flex his emotional and comedic side in this movie.The comedy is dialed up in this movie and it´s so good. The cast seem more in tune with each other and use each other so well in this movie. The movie seems more creatively free than the prior, and the friendship and personallties shine so much more here.The action is also way better than the original and I think the stylization helps it a lot. This movies approach to action is far more grounded in cool factor and while it´s cartoony and maybe a bit too goofy at times, it feels like the movie identity shining though. The Rocket forest scene, the Rocket and Yondu scene, the spaceship battle in the beginning and jut the opening in general. It´s all so well done and so memorable because it feels like itself and not forced into the movie.I also really love the art direction of the movie. Gunns films has this style to his universes that are so colorful and feels almost retro. Ego´s planet, the core, the rainbow shootings of a monster, the costumes and incredible makeup, it all looks so good and unique, especially the core is a work of art. The CGI also holds up for the most part. Some scenes seem seamless, but then characters will talk and it´s clearly just a greenscreen stage. I just really can´t with the greenscreen movies anymore it just looks so fake and like two people was stood in front of a painting and told to act. A pretty painting don't get me wrong, but the actors just stick out like a sore thumb to the background and it looks so fake and goofy to me.The soundtrack is once again incredible and such an integral part of the movie's identity. The soundtrack sets up the themes, really elevates the moods and tones of scenes and are o fitting for the movie.The theme of this movie is a great continuation of the original. The guardians are misfits that found each other and now have to make do with their new family even when they don't all agree on how things should be. The guardians feel so much more in tune and like a family than they ever did in the original, and the theme is now what family really means. Family is sometimes more than blood, which Peter most discover with Ego vs the guardians, Rocket is confronted by Yondu about them and Yondu is confronted by himself, Nebula and Gamora most learn to understand each other better and Mantis most learn what a family is. There are some really great themes in this movie that is explored, and I just wish it was done to it´s fullest all the time.But this is a great and fun movie. You get a great theme, great comedy and action but most importantly for me, you get a Marvel movie with some identity to it other than Marvel tm. This is not just any Marvel movie, it´s guardians of the galaxy, and this movie just has its own identity and it really shines in this movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

We had high expectations and expected the movie to be greater than the first, but instead it was a total mess. The star of this movie is baby Groot but he is too cute. The mature Groot in the first movie was naturally funny and intimidating at the same time, here everybody tries to be amusing. The sentimentality in some scenes feel superficial. I just didn't buy it. Kurt Russell and Sylvester Stallone are cast in the same movie together years after Tango and Cash for the first time which is a historic moment, but they never come across during the movie. What??? The villain of the movie makes no sense and there is a relationship between the villain's motivation and Peter Quill's past, but why do you dig for the stories which were perfectly built in the first movie? What is wrong with you? We were exposed to the same forced sentimentality and story being tied to another story in the latest sequel of The Pirates of the Caribbean. Maybe, the most annoying relationship in the movie is between two sisters. It was ridiculous. I almost couldn't endure watching this character and her relationship with her sister, because it looks fake. It is just a plot device. The movie recalls the movie Zardoz which is nice, little Greek tragedy and definitely the best part of the movie is trying to escape from space prison part, but oh man, this was a total mess! Even the post credit scenes were boring and uninteresting. In the second half, we watch action, action and more action until we become mentally tired! The team has ""we are a family"" message for you like Fast and Furious movies and as said before, the movie is very similar with its poster: a complete audiovisual mess! Lots of CGI, lots of noisy action and overblown visuals with no properly built up story, no development, no tension and no heart and soul. By the way, like most of the movies in these days, the villain explains everything one by one, evil plans are included, to make everything clear for us at some point! Jokes are mostly unfunny and forced, Gamora has a lesser screen time, it is a pity, Drax doesn't fight much this time and everything else is a mess except for great Stallone! This is a must see for ""GOTG"" fans to follow the story, but keep your expectations low. However, your kids may love it!",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Good cgi,"Sure this movie has its flaws, but they are few and far between and they pale in comparison to the spectacular visuals alone. The landscape of Ego's planet is beautiful, same with the space battles and the makeup, and the fourth act has some of the most brilliant cgi in the mcu. I have to agree with Youtuber Jeremy Jahns that I was expecting a more complex core of Ego than a giant brain, but nevertheless it's an amazing treat for the eyes. The plot is creative and I think the story of Starlord's father was incredibly interesting, but those visuals made this movie a pretty damn good sequel. There was one thing in my opinion that kept it from being a great sequel, and that was the few instances of forced humor througout the movie. Examples I can remember are everyone laughing at the name Tazerface, the space fruit not being ripe, and the baby Groot schtick. I really don't know if the Tazerface thing was in the comics or not, but it just made me uncomfortable to watch all these characters bursting out laughing over something that warrants a chuckle at best. I know the MCU is family friendly and humor is the best way to ensure that, but the jokes need to be... jokes. They need to make the audience laugh, not the characters, and I just wasn't laughing at a number of these jokes. But this movie's visuals were so captivating I don't even really care about the cringey jokes, the images of reality-warping space jumps and fights with a cosmic superbeing eclipse them. Really cool soundtrack, too. The Chain by Fleetwood Mac was kind of the theme song, and it fit smoothly. Above all, this was a good sequel because it built on the original without mimicking the plot in any way, and that's all I really want in a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

"Space Pirates, Classic Music, and Egotistical Villains","Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a 2017 Marvel superhero movie and sequel to Guardians of the Galaxy. The story follows the misfit team of superheroes that were introduced in the first film. Peter Quill, aka Star-Lord, Gamora, Drax, Groot, and Rocket are all back to face some new and old challenges. After Rocket offends the Sovereign, a haughty and totalitarian race of gold- skinned aliens, the group must flee for their lives. The Guardians of the Galaxy are rescued by a strange and powerful individual who has many secrets in store for the team of heroes.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an incredibly fun film. With another fantastic soundtrack and amazing visual graphics, this action- packed film is another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This movie is hilarious at times and heart- wrenchingly sad at others.While most of the jokes are great, there are a few that fall flat. Unfortunately, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 has a problem with hammering in a joke whether it works or not. Sometimes less is more and when a bad joke is drawn out for more than a minute it can become an annoyance. This over-the-top sense of humor applies to background characters as well. A simple joke about a murderous pirate thinking that something is cute turns into one scene after another of doll-holding and thumb- sucking murderers. Lastly, the film has a little too much of the heavy, emotional moments. Not every single character has to make a psychological and emotional breakthrough by the time the credits begin.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is a good movie. There is plenty of action, drama, and comedy to satisfy any film preference. Incredibly moving at times, hilarious at other times, and intense action throughout the movie make this a fun and light-hearted film that is definitely worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Action-packed and amusing space fantasy with moments of depth and wonder,"RELEASED IN 2017 and directed & written by James Gunn, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2"" chronicles the Guardians meeting Star-Lord's father, Ego (Kurt Russell), and visiting his beautiful planet, which turns out to be (I'm not going to give it away).The Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in 1969 and in various Marvel comics of the mid-70s, like The Defenders, before appearing as the main attraction in Marvel Premiere in 1976-77. The Guardians are like the Avengers (or Justice League) of space, a superhero team with a revolving door line-up.The popular 2014 film and this sequel were based on the 2008 version of the team, which includes Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Gamora (Zoe Saldana), Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista), Rocket Raccoon (voice of Bradley Cooper) and Groot or, more specifically in this movie, Baby Groot (voice of Vin Diesel). Also returning are Gamora's vengeful sister, Nebula (Karen Gillan), and Yondu (Michael Rooker), the space redneck who kidnapped Peter Quill (Star-Lord) from Earth when he was a boy. Elizabeth Debicki has a significant part as statuesque Ayesha, a haughty gold-skinned queen.The movie combines elements of The Avengers, Star Trek and Star Wars and is a thrilling blockbuster that's fun, but probably too goofy at times for people who prefer the dead seriousness of Nolan's Batman trilogy. As far as galaxy-traveling superheroes go, I prefer the more-serious tone of ""Thor"" and ""Thor 2.""Despite that cavil, the movie's entertaining as an amusing space fantasy blockbuster. It includes loads of action, character-defining parts, several classic rock staples and moments of wonder, not to mention the highlight (cuteness) of Baby Groot. A lot of elements come straight from Jim Starlin's Captain Marvel and Warlock comics from the 70s, not to mention Stan Lee & Jack Kirby's stuff from the 60s, albeit more goofy.THE MOVIE RUNS 136 minutes and was shot entirely in Georgia (Cartersville, Atlanta & Pinewood Atlanta Studios, Fayetteville).GRADE: B",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

This movie goes into lots of peters backstory and explains just how truly tragic yet lucky his life is, it does the same for rocket and ties in perfectly with the narrative. It also creates many interesting and fun character dynamics with various new and old characters and creates lots of great jokes and inner problems however, the villain is extremely boring and relatively uninteresting.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Kind of.
All the characters from the original are here plus many new ones, too many new ones actually. That's one of the problems with GOTG 2 it feels bloated and in need of editing especially in the final 3rd. Had to watch the film twice at home on Blu Ray after seeing it in the cinema to fully absorb everything that happened both from a story perspective and the action sequences.

Capsule Review: Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2,"If repetitive chase sequences, contrived colorful explosions at the end of every action sequence, and occasionally forced and isolated comedy are the only parameters that you judge a superhero movie in 2017 with, then Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 should be a collector's product. There's a lot of references in this film that demands you go back to Vol. 1 and also take a 50-hour pop culture lesson narrated by Stan Lee. The plot associated with Walkman-ambassador leader guardian Quill's parentage is a boring cliché and one that makes you puke, considering there are more grotesque beings and objects in the film. A sheer lack of novelty, the inability to improve the charm in the characters, and reckless usage of CGI majorly affects James Gunn's second major feature film that is gaudier than the film's obnoxious poster. Chris Pratt has begun to slightly annoy and if he maintains a similar air we'll have to turn to DC by the time these guardians create the next volume. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is an ordinary superhero film with lots of blabbering using advanced vocabulary and lots of flashes, lasers, flares, and plasma. It also has a gold-obsessed priestess awkwardly trying to get at the guardians for stealing a bunch of her Duracell batteries. Like this, there are many more mindless arcs, but I'm fairly content because Quill was finally introduced to Microsoft Zune, arguably one of the best music players to come out of the technology race.

Guardians 2 blows away all expectations,"GOTG Vol. 2 went bigger with the action and the set-pieces. The soundtrack is an excellent follow to the first movie's mixtape. It had a far more interesting villain than the first (played by Kurt Russell). They explored some very interesting character traits and dynamics. Most notably the relationships between Rocket and Yondu, Gamora and Nebula, and Peter and Ego. James Gunn so clearly crafted this film with love and adoration for all these characters and the entire cast shines on screen. Some tiring comedy bits drag the film a little bit but it doesn't hurt the film too much overall. Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 improves upon the surprising and winning formula of the first film in every way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Rating: B,"The first installment of this saga was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. Its hilarious jokes and the visually mind-blowing action scenes plus a cast full of chemistry elevated a movie with a simple superhero plot to one of the best in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU).GOTG Vol. 2 is pretty much the same, but with some family issues. I'll answer the question that everyone has on their minds: ""is it better than the first one?"" ... No. Honestly, I think the former is far better. Not that this one is bad (it isn't), but one of the main reasons the first film was successful was because everything was new and different. They used the more dramatic and suspenseful moments that we've seen over and over again in every single movie ever made and placed a comic relief moment in the middle or at the end of the scene. Even if the joke didn't land, it was still so original that most people really enjoyed the movie.The humor is as hilariously great as in the first film. Some jokes are indeed pushed too far and it ruins some scenes that could have received a better tone to it. Most of the comedy is successful mainly due to the incredible cast. Once again, Chris Pratt nails it, not only as the funny guy, but in the dramatic scenes he's compelling as well. Zoe Saldana (Gamora) and Karen Gillan (Nebula) have a lot of screen time together and, while the former really delivers, the latter ...  delivers too much, she overacts most of her scenes and that kind of threw me off.However, believe it or not, the real star of this film is Yondu (Michael Rooker). This character has so much development throughout the movie and it's a joy to watch Rooker's amazing performance. As expected, the relationship between Baby Groot (Vin Diesel) and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) is adorably funny and Dave Bautista (Drax) keeps surprising me (definitely the best wrestler-to-actor transition since Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson).As for final praises, the soundtrack is great once again (even if some of the choices are clearly some plot points), the action sequences are good enough and the visuals are amazingly stunning.These are the things that I (and most fans, I guess) expected, so until here I'm pretty much fine with the movie. The problem is that this second installment has a lot more issues than the first one ... For the first hour-ish, I spent the whole time thinking ""is this going somewhere? Who's the villain? Is there a villain? Why do I feel bored? This joke is still going on?"". The aim of this film isn't quite clear until the second half of the film and once I get there, there are a lot of pacing issues and the story becomes uneven (even if it has some thrilling action scenes spread through it).If you've seen the trailers, Kurt Russell (Ego) is in this movie and he's great as always, but the main story that the film follows (with Kurt and Chris being a big part of it) didn't captivate me that much because there are so many subplots involving the other characters that when all of it comes together, it doesn't connect very well. It's like the film couldn't figure out what to do with so many supporting characters, they're just ... There.There's also this civilization that you can see in the trailers (they're all gold ... they're all painted gold for some reason) that work fine for the opening scene, but they keep showing up throughout the film and it's just another thing that bothered me. This is definitely the more ""stand-alone"" movie from the MCU's Phase Three. There isn't a single tie or set-up to another film from the universe and the fanboy in me wished that it had something on it (even the FIVE post-credits scenes don't show that much).Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 isn't better than the first one, but it stays true to my expectations. The whole movie is hilarious, the cast has an unbelievable chemistry and Michael Rooker steals the show from Chris Pratt, who also has a great performance. The visuals are stunning, the action set pieces are good and the soundtrack keeps being awesome. However, there are some issues: the pacing is off, the comedy becomes forced, Karen Gillan is the worst part of the film, even if the Nebula-Gamora subplot is interesting, and the main story isn't as captivating as it should be since the supporting characters are terribly misused.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Another 9...close to classic Star Wars level of quality,"As always no plot spoilers or even summaries here...I'm doing the massive Infinity Saga for the first time, started with Iron Man 1, and will finish not with Endgame or Far From Home, but with Guardians 3.While the epic build-up of the Saga seems to mostly revolve around the Avengers, it's the Guardians who are the most charmingly-likeable group of the MCU, and with the most entertaining films...so far.Vol. 2 continues the expert blend of humour, charm, wit, action, drama, thrills and feels of the first movie. And again great soundtrack! The plot is a good one, and feels the right time to flesh out Peter's character. Everyone else from the main cast gets an equal share of quality screen time and development. A handful of fantastic set-pieces, and a well-played ending.Only small nit-picks: a couple of Drax jokes felt like the writers trying too hard (he landed more than he missed, to be fair). There's a slight but noticable lull in pacing around the hour mark, and the movie could probably have done without The Sovereign (a bit too silly, even for this universe, diminishing their threat in the eyes of the viewer).However, like Vol. 1, the sequel deserves the 9/10 for its supreme entertainment value, gorgeous audio/visuals, fine script, excellent cast and decent story. Above all, it's huge consistent FUN!There's room for the Guardians to bag a very rare 10/10, the movie would need to somehow add a deep dark layer of awe which wouldn't diminish the already-present qualities. Empire Strikes Back could do it....and once I'm done with the Infinity Saga we'll see if Guardians Vol. 3 can bring it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Awesome ride, really recommended.","What a fantastic sequel to one of the better films of the MCU. Kicking things off right out the bat of the events of the previous film. After the guardians take up a job by 'The Sovereign' to retrieve their valuables, Rocket decides to steal them, causing the entire golden fleet to chase them down. While chased and almost destroyed, a mysterious man comes to the aid of the guardians and obliterates the fleet. Later it is revealed that man is actually Peter Quill's long lost father, Ego. They then travel to Ego's planet, where they unravel slowly but surely Peter's origin and past.This film came in the golden era of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, where most of their films absolutely crushed it. Yet still this one stood out for me. I remember first watching this film in the theater. Experiencing the theater reactions, laughing my butt off, and become emotional because this film does get you.Chris Pratt along with the rest of the cast completely embody their characters. Each actor perfectly casted in my opinion. Bradley Cooper voices Rocket splendidly, and Mantis's introduction couldn't have landed better. Pom Klementieff's performance added wonders to the film and to the team.The mixture of comedy and heartfelt moments work here. Neither overshadow the other, and both are crucial for this film to work. Plus it is beautifully captured. The set pieces are colorful and wonderfully crafted. Another big plus is the playlist for this film. Some of the greatest songs of the 20th century appear here and make this film ever more groovy and fun.Loved rewatching this, it never gets old. Phase 3 of the MCU is possibly the best out of them all, were this film standing out there.

Ugh!!! AWFUL!!!,"Writer: ""Hey, I have a lot of jokes, but don't know what to do with all of them."" Producer: ""Let's write all the jokes down and turn them into a movie."" Writer: ""Great, but what's the plot?"" Producer: ""Who cares, just add loads of CGI to the jokes; it'll work.""This was seemingly the mentality behind 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'. My word, what an awful movie!! The humor was so effective and funny in the first film, but here it is overbearing and so slapstick that only Americans will find it funny. This film is so thickly layered with humor and CGI that there was not an inch of seriousness or reality to the entire film. The feuding sisters, Gamora and Nebula, were so incredibly annoying and laughable that it was cringe worthy. I mean, honestly...!!'Guardians of the Galaxy 2' proves one should never add too many ingredients to a recipe that works well. This was just overdone on every level. The action scenes were cartoonish, the visual effects looks like it was done in a hurry, the use of CGI is so heavy, at times I thought I was watching an animated film or a computer game. A LOT of time was spent on unnecessary silly moments, so much so that I often reached for the remote control to skip past these awful scenes.There's also so much inconsistency in the film and the premise is preposterous, to say the least. There was nothing interesting about any of the characters. And why were there scenes when Drax all of a sudden had piercing blue eyes, while most of the times they were yellow-ish. They were never blue in the first film. Speaking of Drax, he was the only character I liked in the film, and only Dave Bautista made the film worth watching. I didn't consider Peter Quill a hero in this film, Rocket was more annoying than funny, and Halle Berry lookalike Gamora with her avocado facial mud mask was same old, same old.

I am Groot!,"Okay, just let me say really quick: I am absolutely obsessed with of Baby Groot! While he was amazing at the end of the first movie, now he has legs for rocking, defining him as the pop culture king for an entire generation!Now onto the rest of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, which I should call absolutely freaking awesome! We all thought James Gunn outdid himself with the refreshing ball of excitement in a period full of blockbusters trying to be all edgy and stuff. Yet he outdid himself again with a funnier, sadder version of the original, guaranteeing howls of laughter from all ages. Yes, I said sadder, because the production crew did not shy away from an upsetting plot twist, only to segue into the quiet, touching final moments. U-huh, touching, as in, something unexpected happens that leaves a rather reflective note about all that you just saw.Gunn has made the most emotional feature to come out of Marvel Studios thus far, as well as the funniest by a mile. The jokes are bigger in saturation than Volume 1, setting off the most memorable opening credits sequence since Deadpool, thanks to everyone's favorite talking tree! He could have benefited if he were written to be more than just a comic sidekick, but whenever you laugh, perhaps half those moments will be because of him.Everyone else in the cast also delivers their fair share of belly-laugh moments, especially when Drax gets his own chance for romance with a bug-eyed mistress named Mantis, who can feel another's feelings with a touch. These two create the most moving romance, as well as the most quotable!Yet it exists not just for laughs, between their snappy arguments, the encompassing theme of family actively affects almost the whole cast in some way. It answers a question never consciously asked about Peter's backstory: where did his parents come from? In addition, Gamora and Nebula confront their open-ended sisterly conflict from before. However, the conclusion to Star-Lord's father's story feels rather dissatisfying, I mean, it is not dark or depressing, just not fully realized enough.To top it off, the laughs get a bit too consistent, giving no real time to breathe during some of the moments of drama; but it still managed to jump back on its feet and reconnect us back to the characters.Speaking of characters, the fivesome explore more territory of their galaxy in a very down-to-earth sort of approach. New places are seen such as a snow planet filled with robot hookers, a vivid planet built by man himself, remote-controlled battleships run by gold people, and the woods behind a Dairy Queen in 1980 Missouri, where an alien plant thrives. One minor complaint though; I can't quite buy into Star-Lord's space environment as a world that could inspire future storytellers, since everyone speaks English, unlike more carefully plotted out alien worlds including District 9 or Avatar.One last complaint: aside from all the old songs, the original soundtrack resembles the soundtracks of all other films under a similar genre these days. Although a flaw as minor as this one may not even be easily noticed; too many great qualities outnumber the bad ones. I also ought to highlight the phenomenal standout performances that display the best of Marvel Studios, particularly by Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and Michael Rooker.What else can I say? Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 outdoes Marvel's branding, letting go of the offensive dehumanizing stereotypes from all the previous Cinematic Universe endeavors. This franchise appeals to more than just the youth market and their parents; anybody can have a blast! The older folk will love the nostalgic soundtrack as well as some surprise cameos by familiar faces; the teens will love the wild action balanced with some smart humor; the kids, if parents oblige to the PG-13 rating, will want to dance with Baby Groot; and everybody, no matter how young or how old, will love the timeless bonds about family.Can't wait for spidey to come out in July!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"

Another victim to the trilogy conundrum.,"I sometimes wonder if the strength of the first film in a series dooms the following films to a condition I refer to as ""the trilogy conundrum."" If a single film is original and has a strong story that stands by itself, it almost requires the following films to be weaker in comparison, each sequel needing another sequel to tell a complete story. Films like Back to the Future (1985), The Matrix (1999), and Pirates of the Caribbean (2003) are fantastic films that defined their generation, but their sequels were highly dependent on a follow-on sequel, thus making the trilogy complete, but lacking the strength of the initial film.I hate to say it, but Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 (2017) falls into this ""trilogy conundrum."" The original Guardians of the Galaxy (2014) was a fun and meaningful departure from its Marvel comic book brethren. This sequel, however, lacks a few things that made the original as good and as singular as it was. First off, there were almost too many antagonists in this movie. The Sovereign were essentially a ""joke"" antagonist, were it not for the mid-credits scene that sets up the opponent for the third installment, and the actual antagonist of the film (whose name is a little too on the nose) was revealed so late that the final battle almost seemed rushed.I will give Vol. 2 some credit, though. The opening credits sequence had a catchy song and an amusing ""background action"" sequence the likes of which I haven't seen since The Man from U.N.C.L.E. (2015). The character development in this sequel was fantastic, helping bridge the gap between this film and its predecessor, while also setting up the characters for the 3rd Guardians installment as well as Avengers: Infinity War (2018). As was the case with the original Guardians of the Galaxy, the dialogue and nostalgia included in Vol. 2 were fun and lighthearted. Finally, Yondu's (Michael Rooker) slow-motion sequence was just as entertaining as Quicksilver's (Evan Peters) sequences in the latest X-Men films.Another victim to the trilogy conundrum, I give Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 2 3.5 stars out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
I think I like this sequel more than the original,"From the opening credits to the final battle, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is highly entertaining. I think I like this sequel more than the original. It's a bit silly for adults, and it's a little too dark for children, but it feels just about right for teenagers. Is it a perfect movie? No. Do all the (many) jokes land? No. That doesn't really matter, though, because if you just sit back and enjoy the ride, you'll realize this is precisely what a summer blockbuster should be.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
A great sequel for the Guardians story,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 is up there with sequels such as Captain America: The Winter Soldier. It's full of more action, thrills, emotions, and romance while also having a great story for this follow up. After defeating Ronan and saving the galaxy, the Guardians are moving from planet to planet, while being what they called themselves galaxy savers for hire. After one of their jobs go awry in return for Nebula and they're all saved by a mysterious man played by Kurt Russell named Ego, it's revealed that he is Peter Quill/Star Lord's father. When Ego invites Peter, Gamora, and Drax to his planet while Nebula, Rocket, and Baby Groot stay behind to fix the ship, the Guardians are forced to split up in order to get back on track and find out what Ego wants from Peter, while the ravagers led by Yondu is hired to track down the Guardians by the Sovereign race. So first off, Chris Pratt is at his best as always as Peter Quill/Star Lord. Zoe Saldana is fearless as always as Gamora. Dave Bautista as Drax is funnier than ever in this film. Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel are great as always as Rocket Raccoon and newly born Baby Groot. I was really glad we got to see a little more of Rocket's skills in this movie. Michael Rooker's Yondu I was also glad to have a little more backstory and screentime in this film than he had in the first Guardians of the Galaxy as well as Karen Gillian as Nebula. Kurt Russell as Ego was perfect casting. Pom Klementieff as Mantis was probably the most interesting character of the film. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 doubles up on the action, thrills and visuals, while giving us a story that is also just as good as it's predecessor. Rating. 8.5/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Welcomed Sequel,"""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2017) is an action comedy about a team of misfits led by Peter Quill, played by Chris Pratt, as they are charged with saving the galaxy a second time from a foe that is too close to home. The film opens with comedy and dives right into action. It is a wonderful balance of funny and adventure that will pull the viewer into a confusing yet amusing world of violence. It feels like a less vulgar ""Deadpool"" with more teamwork. I enjoy this film and the series because it makes me think of how my own friends would act if we were heroes.I commend James Gunn for his ability to assist his actors in the continued capturing of their characters. The acting is superb for a film that doesn't fit the norm of an action adventure. I do believe that the story of the first film was much stronger, I did find the turning point in this film to be unexpected and equally intriguing. I find sequels are difficult to top the originals, but this film was a great attempt, though occasionally a little cheesy, if not over the top. Overall, I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone that loves a laugh with a side of violence.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Some Parts Are Better than the 1rst others not so much,So going from the crazy graphics of dr strange to this is kinda crazy. Like some graphics looked really nice like the entire movie has so much not real stuff it's insane so it does look nice but there were def a couple things like the monster at the beginning that or like groot being like basically green screened over drax that just didn't look right and took me out of it which is crazy cause dr strange was just before that and it looked amazing idk I feel like the budget was poorer into the final fight but I'll get there eventually. I like how everyone knows each other so we can just jump right in that's usually the part I like about sequels and the music in guardians is always great. But idk a lot of gaurdians feels kinda cliche ig like i like the movies but idk something about them doesn't click with me like some other marvel movies. Groot is funny but it also annoys me how they just are really trying to make him a mascot like it annoyed me more in the first cause they were really pushing it now they're just shameless about which idk feels a bit better ig idk just feels less annoying this movie. I do prefer this movies ending feels less cliche or idk this one felt sweeter and it's the part of the movie the i definitely way prefer. Overall those are my thoughts I really want to like the gaurdians movies but there just not clicking with me I hope maybe three will do that for me but we'll see.,6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Very good,"It was exactly gorgeous and so funny, they didn't overstate fight scenes it would be good if third part came",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
"Not as Good as the First, But Still Really Fun","This movie is every bit as fun and exciting as the first. Right from the opening credits, you're hit with same kind of punch that Gunn dealt with the original. For the first third of this movie, I would say it hit you left and right, joke after joke, and that's what I liked the most. It focused mainly on the camaraderie of this group. What sells the first Guardians of the Galaxy for me is the chemistry between the group, and the back-and-forth they all have. The way Gunn writes these characters, and how he layers the dialogue to create a perfect symphony is incredible. And we got that for the first third of this movie. Then, the characters split up. While what each of them were doing was interesting enough, that camaraderie and that chemistry was missing. It left a hole in the movie, and the static energy of go go go came to a halt. I don't think these characters are compelling enough on their own. If we ever got a Drax (Dave Bautista) or a Gamora (Zoe Saldana) spin-off film, I don't think it would work. Even Star-Lord. It's when they're together, and they are playing off of each other, that's when they are incredibly compelling. But separating them in the manner that Vol. 2 did just froze the momentum...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
YONDU!,"At first glance this movie may seem to serve as a moderate sequel to the original, however, it actually serves as a great progression in the MCU for the guardians. The whole movie is about family. Quill doesn't trust his father until he does, only to realize that his real family died when he was young and that his new friends are his family. The most development is all around not Quill, but Yondu. Yondu we learn has had good intentions from the moment he picked up Quill but never really knew how to express them. Here he is partnered with Rocket (another character who has driven those close to him away) and they bond over their flaws. By the end of the film
*SPOILER* Yondu is finally accepted by Peter as his real father and he gets one of the best send offs ever in an emotional light show. I cried.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
My Sweet Lord,"I had put of rewatching the second ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" film off for a while. However, with the third one approaching I decided to squeeze it in the day before and I really enjoyed it.Now established as a team, and with a growing reputation, the Guardians are charged with protecting a battery array from a large interdimensional being. They are successful and are rewarded with Nebula (Karen Gillen) who was captured and being held prisoner by The Sovereign, a genetically engineered race of golden beings. Rocket (Bradley Cooper) steals one of the batteries anyway and causes the whole Sovereign Fleet to attack them. They are saved by Ego (Kurt Russell) a Celestial who has been looking for Quill (Chris Pratt) for a long time.I think one factor that helped with this viewing is that I've not seen this one as often as the first one. So, I was less familiar with both the jokes, and with the action beats of the film. I enjoyed it a lot, it is funny and with decent action scenes and looks amazing, the CGI work is great. What I hadn't remembered is quite how emotional it is. It's all about, as the song expresses perfectly ""Fathers and Sons"". As Quill who yearned for a father gets one, before realising that he had one all along.I was struck by the fact that Ego launches an attack on Earth that, whilst focused on a very small location, is another aspect never mentioned again in the MCU. I thought that the anti-aging footage of Kurt Russell at the films start wasn't quite as good as the RDJ one in Civil War but was still pretty convincing.I really enjoyed it - and having seen all three films in this series, it's definitely up there as one of the top three trilogies that the MCU has to offer.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
Meanderers of the Galaxy,"Missing a lot of the fun that the first Guardians had. Felt the story meandered and plodded along for the most part.Had a few moments, but felt more like it was filmed as an omnibus TV episode than a fully realised block-buster.The underlying father motif gave the film a little more weight in the feels department(there was a woman further down my row who was balling her eyes out, a complete blubbering mess), but it all seemed a little uneven in the way it played out and the way the story was handled.Not terrible, but not great either. A bit meh. A mixed bag for me.6 – 6.5 trash pandas.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure, Comedy"
