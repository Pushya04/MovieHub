"Underrated and ignored, but a bit of a classic","Tony Scott can make good films and bad, personally I think he can be a bit flashy and trashy and his work obviously suffers in comparison with that of his rather famous brother, but this is quite possibly his best film.What makes this film so great is that Scott gives Denzel (on scorching form, better than Training Day) and the revelation who is Dakota Fanning time to develop a relationship of real warmth and tenderness. The set up is absolutely NOT boring, although it takes time - it is involving, and takes us on a little journey into the characters - including a superb role for Radha Mitchell as the mother. This all serves to make the action so much more effective, as we are so invested in the characters, for all their all too obvious weaknesses. This film has you on the edge for its entirety, and doesn't cop out at the end either.The film would of course be nothing without Washington. I often wonder why he seems to get so many duff roles, when he quite clearly is as good as almost any leading man out there (I can only really think of one, Daniel Day Lewis, who has more on-screen power these days). This film should have been huge, given his status and the strength of his performance, and the quality of the film. It just goes to show you that if a studio doesn't back a film to the hilt, it ends up going straight to video. I wish I'd got the chance to see this on the big screen.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel VS Mexico City... with unexpected heart,"Alcoholic mercenary Creasy (Washington) is all washed-up, until his friend (Walken) finds him a job in Mexico City, as bodyguard for a rich family's little girl Pita (Fanning). The taciturn man and melancholy girl slowly develop a strong bond... that is utterly shattered the day that Pita is kidnapped and that negotiations are sorely mishandled.""Man on Fire""'s title works against it. It proclaims an adrenaline-fueled action film, when in fact what we get is very different. What could be mistakenly thought to be a prologue (Creasy is introduced, meets Pita and the relationship is shown) constitutes a good half of the film's running time. Washington and Faning are on top form, the former tortured and angry and the latter endearing without being cloying, so it is a tribute to Scott and screenwriter Helgeland that the film takes its time showing their odd relationship. This makes things all the more hurtful and outraging when she is captured in a kidnapping that leaves Creasy severely scarred, both emotionally and physically.The film earns its title in the second half, not because of non-stop action - which it fore-goes in order to give us something more pondered and cruel - but because Creasy is literally ablaze with silent fury. As he hunts down anyone who participated or profited from Pita's kidnapping, dismantling rings of Mexico City's tower of corruption, his methods get bloodier while his movement actually get slower. Creasy races against time and his own likely death, as a tragic figure who's newfound reason to live has been taken away from him.The performances are fine, with great turns from the two leads and superb supporting turns by the always reliable Christopher Walken and Jiancarlo Giannini. What sometime detracts from the film's quality is Tony Scott's now signature messy visuals. While some shots are magnificent, reminiscent of brother Ridley's work, some are almost trashy and epilepsy-inducing (some unnecessary hyper-MTV editing). the man redeems himself by handling his actors with care, superbly illustrating his environment and creating a stark atmosphere.This is a precious oddity: a quality blockbuster.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
a genuinely good movie,"i liked this film a lot. it's dark, it's not a bullet-dodging, car-chasing numb your brain action movie. a lot of the characters backgrounds and motivations are kinda vague, leaving the viewer to come to their own conclusions. it's nice to see a movie where the director allows the viewer to make up their own minds.in the end, motivated by love or vengeance, or a desire to repent - he does what he feels is ""right"". 'will god ever forgive us for what we've done?' - it's not a question mortal men can answer - so he does what he feels he has to do, what he's good at, what he's been trained to do.denzel washington is a great actor - i honestly can't think of one bad movie he's done - and he's got a great supporting cast. i would thoroughly recommend this movie to anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Riveting viewing!,"Certainly one of the finest movies I have seen for quite some time. Exquisite direction and flawless acting make this a very entertaining and often moving film. Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end.

The Editing Massacre,"A riveting introduction, powerful performances and yet, I couldn't quite connect. The trendy editing, I hope, it's just a moronic phase that movies are going through to be outgrow soon, very soon. All the dramatic tension vanishes as the editor plays around with the visuals. Why? If you have characters played by the likes of Denzel Washington, why the need to hit us over the head with a self conscious blow of irrational cutting taking me out of the movie completely and forcing me to see the movie as a movie, the actors as actors and the drama as sheer fiction. Washington is superb. Slowly but surely I'm warming up to the man. I've always admired his performances but there was something about the actor, a veil of arrogance perhaps, that stopped me from getting closer. Here, his personal torment and his warming up to Dakota Fanning took me completely until the smart ass editing ruined everything.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Perfect...Just Perfect.  Do yourselves a favor and watch it but...,"...dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial, brain-dead and pointless. The film is excellent, the acting by both Denzel and Dakota (she will go sky high, trust me on that)are just fabulous, and the plot is mind blowing. Actually ""fabulous"" is a small word to use for such talented actors. The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional, a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film. If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films, you still haven't watched your favorite one yet...Trust me, in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling. The film is awesome, see it, rent it, buy it or whatever...just don't miss it",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

A film of two halves.,"Based on the novel of the same name by the pseudonymous AJ Quinnell, which is itself alleged to be based around true events, Man On Fire has previously been brought to the big screen in a 1987 European production by French director Elie Chouraqui. At it's heart, a simple revenge fable, Man On Fire follows the fortunes of a formerly accomplished military man known simply as Creasy, that's Creasy with a C, not a G as it sporadically sounds in the movie. Portrayed in this adaptation by Denzel Washington, Creasy is an amiable if evasive character, clearly troubled by a shadowy past of contentious moral value. This exhibits itself in a pervasively melancholy facial expression and an eagerness to spend rather too much time with his good friend Jack Daniels. It's only through the ever watchable Christopher Walken's character Rayburn, a friend and former colleague, that the viewer is afforded any insight into Creasy's character or past. After we're explicitly informed of the prolific rate of kidnappings in South American states, a bearded, bottle hitting Creasy is cajoled by Rayburn into taking a job as a bodyguard in his adopted home, Mexico. He's immediately hired by the unconvincing couple of Samuel and Lisa Ramos, played by Jennifer Lopez casualty Marc Anthony and Neighbours alumnus Radha Mitchell, to protect their little girl Pita, played by Dakota Fanning. Of course Pita is summarily abducted, Creasy is riddled with bullets, and the subsequent ransom drop is botched, ostensibly meaning curtains for the little girl. Well Creasy needed something to burn about, you didn't think it was about visit to the clap clinic did you? The rest of the film depicts a largely irrelevant criminal network being dispatched in creatively gruesome ways until the inexorable showdown with the architect of the kidnapping.The first half of the film plods along with a pleasantly restrained pace, allowing us to enjoy some truly memorably scenes between the excellent Washington and Fanning. Creepily precocious in previous appearances, c.f. the saccharine I Am Sam, Fanning is charming as a convincingly bright youngster with maturity beyond her years, and a penchant for oral hygiene, rather than some kind of miniaturised twenty-something. Washington performs admirably as a character that is detached and distant, not least because he clearly has little back story to speak of. Walken is used sparingly and his performance is restrained. His only foray into his usual trade of scene stealing dramatic monologues even ends with the assurance ""I don't have anything else to say"". Mickey Rourke puts in a brief performance as a lawyer that appears as though the word bar has no legal connotations to him at all, and all the other supports are of a generally high standard. Anthony and Mitchell, however, fail to convince as either spouses or parents. Mitchell manages to be pert and distressed at the appropriate junctures, but Anthony clearly struggles to make his character credible as an actual human being.The second half of the film, and it does start almost exactly half way through the two and half hour runtime, sees Scott abandon all directorial restrain and turn up the affectation to 11. In a scene which had the potential for Washington and Mitchell to display a deeper emotional side to their characters, Creasy flicks through his departed charge's diary while sitting on her bed, and is interrupted by the grieving MILF. After some cursory navel gazing, Lisa concedes that she doesn't know what to do and solicits Creasy's plans for the future, ""What are you going to do?"" ""What I do best. I'm gonna kill 'em. Anyone that was involved, anybody who profited from it, anybody that opens their eyes at me (!?)"" This statement of murderous intent comes complete with an irritating musical cue courtesy of Nine Inch Nails, and Lisa's response? Clearly suffering from a bout of the ever popular Lady Macbeth syndrome, barely batting an eyelid, she offers ""you kill 'em all"", pecks him on the cheek and sends him on his merry way. The inevitable 'tooling up' montage follows promptly.From here on in, the film resembles some unholy mash of Stone and Soderbergh via Akerlund, filming a Tarrantino script without the dialogue or stylistic aplomb. The soundtrack proceeds to irritate, offering the abrasive cheese-grater on a guitar posturing of Nine Inch Nails to let us know when the action is suitably 'hardcore', and the pseudo mystical foreign female vocals popularised by Scott senior in Gladiator, when something 'poignant' is occurring. The subtitles, required by virtue of the Mexican locale, fade, grow, wipe and move across the frame in manner initially intriguing, but quickly distracting. These two aberrations, on top of the 'kid in a sweet shop' approach to visual effects, serve to totally distance the viewer from any connection they may have established in early scenes. On top of this we're offered a fearless journalist who can seemingly find out anything, Creasy attracting and taking bullets like Rocky does punches, and yet another ridiculous club scene. Aren't there any normal night spots in Hollywood? The violent set pieces are generally well executed, no pun intended, the most memorable being a Reservoir Dogs style extremity deprivation to the strains of the radio. The climax, when it finally arrives is surprisingly subdued, though a tacked on final moment of retribution caused the film to leave me rolling my eyes in irritation.The main problem with Man On Fire is that it's a thin, simplistic story, prolonged to 146 minutes by a desire to show off stylistically. After Creasy sets off on his killing spree, the only thing left is to sit back and count the bodies. There isn't really any interest left in the characters, and the shadowy criminal network offers little more than greedy Creasy fodder. On the whole, it's a good quality action film, so long as you don't mind the bloated run time. Man On Fire is a predictably undemanding, enjoyable piece of entertainment from Tony Scott.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A good story marred by flashy editing,"There are a lot of things to like about this film: the plot, the characters, and the photography are great. Denzel Washington carries the story beautifully, and watching the relationship between his and Dakota Fanning's characters evolve during the first half is in my opinion the best part of the whole movie.Unfortunately, the viewing experience is largely diminished by the editing. I found the fast-forward-like, jittery sequences meant to show time or emotional breaks in the story are a major distraction. I really believe the film would have been as good without all that flash.
As it is, it feels like music video clips or cheap action TV show sequences being forced into a story that otherwise aspires to be something bigger.I was also disappointed to see the tropes of torture and rough interrogation used so heavily in the second half of the film.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

3 Denzels and 1 Dakota For Your Money,"Here's a gritty, get-the-bad guys revenge story starring a relentless and rough Denzel Washington. He's three personalities here: a down-and-out-low-key-now drunk- former mercenary, then a loving father-type person to a little girl and then a brutal maniac on the loose seeking answers and revenge.The story is about Washington hired to be a bodyguard for a little American girl living in Mexico, where kidnappings of children occur regularly (at least according to the movie.) He becomes attached to the kid, played winningly by THE child actress of our day, Dakota Fanning. When Fanning is kidnapped in front of him, Washington goes after the men responsible and spares no one. Beware: this film is not for the squeamish.This is stylish film-making, which is good and bad. I liked it, but a number of people found it too frenetic for their tastes as the camera-work is one that could give you a headache. I thought it fit the tense storyline and was fascinating to view, but it's (the shaky camera) not for all tastes.Besides the two stars, there is the always-interesting Christopher Walken, in an uncharacteristically low-key role, and a number of other fine actors.The film panders to the base emotions in all of us, but it works.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Vengeance In Mexico City,"Although released among a flock of revenge-minded action flicks (KILL BILL VOL. 2; THE PUNISHER; WALKING TALL), MAN ON FIRE works as well as it does thanks in large part to the always-watchable Denzel Washington, one of the best actors around today.In MAN ON FIRE, based on A.J. Quinnell's 1980 novel (first filmed in 1987, with Scott Glenn), Washington plays a down-on-his-luck ex-mercenary who has now stooped to drinking from a flash of Jack Daniels, until his old partner (Christopher Walken) offers him a chance at redemption.  He is hired on as a bodyguard to the 10 year-old daughter (Dakota Fanning) of a Mexican businessman (Marc Antony) and his American-born wife (Radha Mitchell). While he and Fanning work like oil and water first (not mixing very well), he really gets to form a bond with her, encouraging her to do better at swimming, while he at the same time attempts to deal with the demons of the past.  It is that very bond that will force Washington back into his old line of work when Fanning is kidnapped and held for a $10 million ransom, and he is nearly killed.  With almost any other stock action hero (Schwarzenneger; Segal, etc.), the subsequent bloodbath would be the same repetitive schlock we've seen a million times before.  But Washington's character, though he's killing for a reason, does not particularly enjoy doing what he does.  Still, he gets help from a very intrepid Mexican newspaper reporter (Rachel Ticotin) out to expose ""La Hermanidad"" (The Brotherhood), the kidnap gang responsible for Fanning's abduction.MAN ON FIRE is flawed to some extent because of the hyper camera work, nearly headache-inducing montage editing, and various film stocks that are par for the course of its director Tony Scott (TOP GUN; CRIMSON TIDE), but which are not necessarily unique to him (witness Oliver Stone's use of montage in JFK or Sam Peckinpah's in his classic 60s and 70s films).  Still, Scott gets a very good performance from Washington, as well as Fanning, who comes across as far more than a typical movie-brat kid.  Harry Gregson-Williams' south-of-the-border Spanish guitar score is enhanced by soundtrack splashes of Chopin, Debussy, and even Linda Ronstadt's classic 1977 country-rock version of ""Blue Bayou.""  Although the film overall is quite violent, it is no worse than most action films of the last ten years, and overall it is much better than most.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A emotional ride,"This film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. Sorrow, love, laughter , anger. There are so many emotions thrown into this film. From start to finish this film is immensely captivating. The plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown In the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. Washington as always puts on a great performance.The plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. Doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. For instant, TAKEN is a similar film but when you compare them both, MAN ON FIRE wins hands down. The characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. Mexico City feels alive , it looks like Mexico city, it smells like Mexico city. Everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something I enjoyed and brought the best out of Mexico CityThis is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch.

Righteous retribution and the John Creasy redemption.,"Man on Fire is directed by Tony Scott and adapted to screenplay by Brian Helgeland from the novel of the same name written by A.J. Quinell. It stars Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony, Rachael Ticotin, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke and Jesús Ochoa. Music is scored by Harry Gregson-Williams and cinematography by Paul Cameron.Mexico City and kidnappings are rife. Enter ex-military operative John Creasy (Washington). Often drunk and with no discerning aims in life, Creasy is hired by the Ramos family to act as bodyguard to their young daughter Pita (Fanning). After initially being cold and distant, Creasy starts to form a warm relationship with Pita, but tragedy strikes and Pita is kidnapped. This sets the wheels in motion for Creasy to go on a one man war of revenge against anyone involved in the snatch.Directed with a raft of deliriously ace neo-noir flourishes by Tony Scott, Man on Fire is 145 minutes of fatalism. From the outset it's evident that this sweaty part of Mexico is home to a tortured soul, a man in desperate need of redemption. John Creasy will get this redemption, by hook or by crook, we know this, the narrative structure quickly pulls us in to impress this fact upon us. How he finds it, both emotionally and physically, is what drives the picture on. This is no ordinary tale of revenge, an excuse for pyrotechnics and inventive deaths, it is about one man's journey to said redemption, his trawl through hell, his personal sacrifice is his calling.The catalyst is the kidnapping of young Pita Ramos, but where it would have been easy for Scott to jump in early and unleash Creasy hell, the director shows great restraint by affording time to the relationship of John and Pita. Most of the first hour is spent building a bond between them, the child softening the edges of the Creasy exterior, to then enter into his heart as he becomes not just a friend, but a surrogate father as well. It's a very real relationship, a natural one, so when things go pear shaped in the second half of the piece, we care what is happening.Yet constantly that air of fatalism and pessimism hangs heavy as the plot thickens, the unfolding story pulsing with betrayal at almost every turn, classic neo-noir and Scott amps up the disorientation as we enter a hellish world of social decay. His box of tricks contain jump-cuts, film stock, reverse process, over-saturated colours, kinetic camera work, step-printing and slow-mo, all used to create the perfect tonal discord, a marrying up of the anti-hero's state of mind and that of the realm he has entered.The film can be accused of pandering to stereotyping Latino baddies, especially irksome since the source novel was based in Italy, and that is a misstep that could have been avoided, but Man on Fire remains one of the most important neo-noirs available to view. It refuses to take easy options, particularly with the jet black finale, it has a grasp on what is required for quintessential neo-noir. Backed by stunning work from Washington, Scott and Cameron, it's a film equally of high technical merit as it is of narrative bite. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
flawed but gripping crime thriller,"You know you're in for something different when a movie has Christopher Walken playing the part of a professional hit man - and he isn't even one of the bad guys! Although it could do with some judicious trimming here and there, ""Man on Fire"" is a generally effective crime drama that ranges in tone from the openly sentimental to the downright brutal - and just about every tone imaginable in between.Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, a former CIA assassin who has recently quit the business and is seeking some sort of redemption for the sins he's committed. So far, he's been looking for answers in a bottle and the Bible and not doing all that well with either. As the movie opens, Mexico City has been ravaged by a series of kidnappings aimed at the powerful and well-to-do, possibly perpetrated by the very police force assigned to keep law and order in the community. Creasy accepts the position as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy business owner who rightly fears for her safety. The first third of the film is devoted to the growing friendship between Creasy and his charge, Pita, a sweet little girl who, slowly but surely, works her way into Creasy's initially hardened heart and affections. The last two-thirds of the film turns into an Avenging Angel melodrama, as Creasy systematically seeks out and eliminates all those responsible for a tragedy that occurs early on in the story.Based on the novel by A.J Quinnell, ""Man on Fire,"" astutely written by Brian Helgeland and flashily directed by Tony Scott, is a coolly efficient action picture that never shies away from the raw brutality of its subject matter. It takes a risk in asking us to identify with a man who is, for all intents and purposes, achieving his redemption by torturing and murdering (admittedly disreputable) people. These scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful, even if they do at times border on the exploitative. Even better are the quiet, intimate moments between Creasy and Pita in the early parts of the movie. Washington and the wonderful Dakota Fanning establish an natural, easygoing rapport that helps to set the stage for the chaos and turmoil to follow.Washington carries the movie with his quality of stoic righteousness, making us understand his character on an emotional level even if what he is doing eludes us intellectually. In addition to the two leads, there are solid performances from Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Ticotin and Giancarlo Giannini. But it is Washington and the delightful Ms. Fanning who steal the show.""Man on Fire"" would have been better with about a half hour taken out its running time, but this is still a better-than-average crime thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A full-out epilepsy attack,"Tony Scott tried his hand at the trendy ""CSI""-style of grainy images, erratic editing, and excessive use of slow-mo, and if it worked more for effect than as a distraction back when Man on Fire was released in 2004, it certainly doesn't now. What begins as small droplets of woozy camerawork and flashy cuts eventually turns into a full-out epilepsy attack by the final third of the movie. The picture should be taught in film classes as an example of how to overuse stylistic effects. And combined with Scott's predilection for milking narrative clichés, such as Denzel's alcohol problem, or how Dakota Fanning's loving character transforms him from an apathetic drunk into a loving teddy bear, or how he helps her become a swimming champion, this nullifies what could and should have been a rather engaging crime story based on A. J. Quinnell's novel and adapted here by Brian Helgeland (L. A. Confidential, Mystic River). Some movies stand the test of time impeccably, others quite well, but this one has been completely obliterated by less than twenty years of aging. Quinnell's novel was also adapted in 1987, directed by French filmmaker Élie Chouraqui and starring Scott Glenn as John W. Creasy.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pita changes the behavior of the cold Creasy, making him live and smile again, and he feels a great affection for her.

"Denzel Washington is on fire, the film itself doesn't quite","When people think of 'Man on Fire', they think of this 2004 film but some probably don't realise it's a ""remake"" of a less critically well received 1987 film.If asked which from personal opinion is better, it would be a hard choice. As an adaptation of the source material, author AJ Quinnell would choose this easily. It is easy to see why that is the case, there are more lines in this version lifted from the source material and more of the spirit is there, apparently Quinnell intensely disliked the 1987 film going as far to saying that he couldn't recognise any of what he wrote in there. On its own terms, it is not an easy pick. Both films are uneven but both films are also very worthwhile (yes, will admit to liking the 1987 film despite it not being a great film), they have a numerous amount of strengths but both have quite a few faults.Talking about this 2004 film, it's uneven with some things that stop it from being as on fire as its lead performances. As said above though there is a lot to like and enough to make it more than watchable. Visually, 'Man on Fire' has its moments. The locations are both stunning and gritty and there is evidence of a slick atmospheric stylishness and director Tony Scott providing a few inventive touches. The film is hampered quite severely however by Scott excessively going overboard on the visual style, too much of it is more gimmicky and self-indulgent than it is clever and imaginative which is a real shame.'Man on Fire' has a haunting and cool music score that really adds to the film and drives the action well. The script has wit and tension.Storytelling, like with the production values, is more problematic. It is very successful in the first half, the central chemistry between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is truly heartfelt and beautifully written. Really liked that the care and trust were realistically gradual and not evident straight away. In the more action-oriented and thriller-like second half, the action is well-choreographed and suitably uncompromising, it's fun and suspenseful and it makes more consistent sense than the 1987 film.It is let down sadly by the pace being drawn out in places while the ending is more logical, more exciting and more emotional in the 1987 film, it's a bit of an illogical fizzler here. The film is sadly rather too overlong too by about twenty minutes, this could have been cleared up by tightening the pace in the second half.Denzel Washington excels in the lead role as does a charming and beyond her years mature Dakota Fanning. Their chemistry is one of the highlights of 'Man on Fire'. The supporting cast is more uneven, with a fun if underused turn from Christopher Walken and a strong Radha Mitchell but Mickey Rourke especially is wasted in a role little more than a throwaway. The villains too could have been more threatening. Scott's direction succeeds in the action and direction of the actors but is really messy visually.Overall, worthwhile but not the on fire film it could and should have been. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel on a mission,"This is a remake of an 80s movie. But before you go all out and yell at Hollywood not being able to make unique new movies, consider this: The original wasn't that good to begin with. And frankly I'd rather have them remake a movie that had a strong central idea but wasn't executed as well (for whatever reason that might have occurred, money/time/actors/filmmakers), than make something ridiculous and try to sell it to us as the best thing ever.This of course isn't the best thing ever either, but with Denzels strong lead performance (sometimes literally), it does have a way of convincing you. Mr. Scott is known for his visual style and he doesn't disappoint here either. Quite a lot of things going on, that on the other hand might be distracting to some. Supporting actors and a very fast paced narration lead to an enjoyable (sometimes a bit violent) ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

whatever became of Tony Scott?,"This is clearly not Tony Scott's century. Scott made some really cool movies in the 1990s; apparently around 2001, he dropped way too much LSD and his talent went blooie. Maybe he should retire until 2101 just so he can detox.Anything good in this movie is coming out of star Denzel Washington and Brian Helgeland's script. Unfortunately Scott feels he has to shoot the whole script, so we get a half-hour at the end we don't really need - the film should really end when one of the characters (I won't say who) commits suicide to right a wrong; we don't need the ""uplifting"" sequence that follows.Beyond the unnecessary final half-hour, the film is filled with equally unnecessary flashy lights and rapid-edits that distract from the real drama of the first third of the film, and water-down the potential for real action scenes in the second third.What's needed here is direction by John Woo, not a potboiling hack-job from Tony Scott, who has clearly lost any sense of what he wants to do in film.Oh, and just by the way, bits and pieces of this film are borrowed from an underground blaxploitation cult-film, ""Bogard""/aka ""Black Fist"" The existing copy of that film (available on DVD) is a wretched re-edit hatchet-job, but there's enough there to indicate the power of the original - which presents acting as good as we get in Scott's film, and better direction - and with almost no budget, compared with the many millions thrown away by Scott.You don't need a lot of money to make a good film - you need a heart and a head and the right hormones. Scott had all these, once; I wonder what became of him?",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

The film has a certain likeness to Charles Bronson's films of the series : ¨Death Wish¨ for the matter , a relentless revenge.

Over wrought,"A guilt ridden, Bible reading, alcoholic ex-counter insurgency assassin, Creasy (Washington), takes a job as body guard for a little girl (Fanning) in Mexico only to see her snatched from under his nose by a Mexican crime cartel.

According to his compadre (Walken), he's an artist, his art is death, and he's about to paint his masterpiece. ""Man on Fire"", which fared much better with the public than the critics, is a run-of-the-mill action/drama which fills up its almost 2.5 hour run with lots of concocted drama, super macho action, and annoying visual effects which do more to detract than embellish. Washington isn't the usual sweaty, muscular Schwarzenegger or Stallone one man army and subtitles which jump around on screen changing fonts and zipping form the mouths speaking the Spanish don't help.

Depressing Ending + Nauseating Edits = Unsatisfying Mess,"Trust me, this is one let down movie that you want to avoid and this comes from one huge Denzel Washington fan.  The frustrating part is that it's 1/3 of a GREAT film.  The first part of this movie does an exceptional job of setting up the characters and the new relationship between Creasy and the girl he's paid to protect.  The trailers to this movie all mention that she is kidnapped.  So, I'm giving nothing away when I say that the film degenerates into an almost unwatchable mess after she's kidnapped. Whatever the director was trying to accomplish, all he succeeds in doing is making the audience literally nauseous.  Rapid, frantic and choppy cuts follow for the next half-hour as Creasy tracks down the perpetrators.  These cuts are so unnatural and nauseating that all they do is to jolt you out of the story. I'm sure the director thought that this unsettling way to present the story signified a change in Creasy's character and signified that a different movie was to follow.  Well, he was right.  The movie that followed was complete and unsatisfying crap.  The result of which is a depressing ending that ruins even the quality first forty minutes of the movie.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Violent but humane, Man on Fire is a competent and moving film with remarkable performances delivered by Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning","Until the 2010s, it was recurrent in North American films to portray the periphery of the world - Latin America above all - with unhealthy, yellowish filmic images with warm colors, as if to illustrate the underdevelopment character of countries still in growth. Alejandro González Iñárritu in his trilogy of death (Amores Perros, 21 Grams, Babel) uses and abuses unhealthy colors to portray Mexico. As Man On Fire comes to an end, the following sentence appears on the screen: 'A special thank you to Mexico City: a very special place'. Considering that, in the previous 145 minutes, the film has dedicated itself to portraying the Mexican capital as a place dominated by violence, poverty and corruption, it is difficult to interpret exactly what the producers meant by this acknowledgment. Honestly, one can only conclude that this is a cruel irony on the part of the rich Hollywood, who must have laughed out loud at the 'joke' (which, as if that weren't enough, can still work as a political move to avoid some lawsuit by the government of that country).Here, we follow Creasy (Denzel Washington) who goes to Mexico with the desire to see a friend, Rayburn (Christopher Walken), who, like him, was an agent of some secret CIA project that took care of annihilating anyone who was not in favor of northern policy. -American. So much blood flowed through his hands that he can no longer see a reason to continue living. His only faithful companion is Jack Daniels (the whiskey). When Rayburn gets him a job as a bodyguard, Creasy accepts. In any other city, the job would be simple - protecting Pita (Dakota Fanning), a super nice and studious 9-year-old girl - but in the film's Mexico City, where 24 kidnappings took place in the last 6 days, it's just a matter of of time until the blonde is taken to some dark captivity and finally exchanged for several bundles of dollars.One of the (few) strengths of the feature lies in the development of the friendship between Creasy and Pita: talented and owner of a beautiful smile, little Dakota Fanning (A Lesson in Love; Sweet Home) manages to portray Pita as a precocious girl without, with that, turn her into one of those 'adult' children that only exist in the movies. In fact, Pita's spontaneity is precisely what we would expect from a girl of that age, since, with her characteristic innocence, she does not hesitate to ask difficult questions of her new friend, such as asking if Creasy is happy and what the origin of scars he has on his hands. Thus, it is easy to understand the subject's growing affection for her - something that will become fundamental from the second half of the projection.Denzel Washington, in turn, prevents the transitions in Creasy's behavior from becoming artificial - and when the character sets out for revenge, the actor doesn't hesitate to portray him as a ruthless and extremely dangerous man (when someone suggests he 'forgive' your enemies, the subject replies: 'Forgiveness is something between them and God. My job is to arrange the meeting'). Creasy's hatred is such that, at one point, when confronting one of his victims, he appears panting, as if he can barely contain the urge to go on the attack (a brilliantly subtle choice by Washington). Rounding out the main cast is the omnipresent Christopher Walken, who, more restrained (and much better) than in Welcome to the Jungle, is responsible for the best dialogue in the film: when explaining what his friend is about to do, he says: 'Creasy's art is death. And he is about to paint his masterpiece.An interesting aspect of Brian Helgeland's script is its cohesiveness, in such a way that all the filmic motivations are explained, and one thing leads to another as naturally as it should be. Tony Scott works very well with ""recognition"", which is when a character, through the recognition of a symbol that is already familiar to him, changes the course of action of the plot to unexpected points. Here, the filmmaker works well with these recognition scenes, leading the characters to identify symbols or signs capable of changing the dramatic course. The kidnapping scene is an expensive example of this. John Creasy (Denzel Washington), while training Lupita (Dakota Fanning) for a competition, accustoms her to a high-pitched noise, which means she would have to retreat upon hearing it. Knowing this, at a time when she is about to be kidnapped, Creasy shoots it into the air and she, already knowing the signal, recognizes him and runs away.Unfortunately, the qualities of Man On Firestop there: if Tony Scott's (Ridley's brother) hysterical direction worked well in Spy Game, giving energy to the plot, here it simply destroys any possibility for the viewer to get involved with the drama of the characters. Characters, as we can barely see them. Unable to create a shot that lasts longer than a few seconds, Scott 'superdrives' the film, resorting to violent zooms, jump-cuts, rack-focuses, whip-pans and, of course, different exposure speeds (in addition to the expendable grainy photograph). On the other hand, the resource of using subtitles in different fonts and sizes to emphasize some words said by the characters proves to be interesting.Another that fails is the script full of absurdly predictable twists. To make matters worse, Helgeland chickens out in the third act of the story and includes a 'revelation' that practically shoots a mercy shot in the back of the film's head, destroying the logic of the plot and compromising the spectator's involvement (that is, if the spectator was still interested in the film). Production, which, being excessively long, loses its rhythm after the first 90 minutes).What is certain is that Tony Scott does not make the slightest effort to spare the neighboring country. It is true that he did not make a saint out of Creasy. This ex-military, alcoholic, lives with a very heavy conscience because of what he has done in the past in various parts of the world, overthrowing governments and things like that. Hence, when Lupita is kidnapped and killed, revenge becomes his reason for living. It's not very original, as you can see, and the script has somewhat exaggerated (ie, uncomfortable) echoes of past films, starting with ""A Body That Falls"", from which it shamelessly steals the narrative structure.But Man on Fire's biggest problem is moral, not narrative. At first, we could imagine that this is a coincidence, but this would be a superficial, frivolous analysis. The fact is that the mentality of most Americans, instigated by the 'spiritual crusade' led by the genocidal George W. Bush since the attacks of September 11, 2001, is fully in tune with the concept of 'punishing the bad guys' - and it is only natural that this provokes reflections in Cinema. Want evidence? Well, for starters, Pita, despite also being the daughter of a Mexican man, is American from head to toe (she is blonde, has very fair skin and blue eyes). Her kidnappers are Latinos - and their ethnicity is immediately visible; are 'Foreigners' (read: non-Americans) with a capital 'e'. After the kidnapping of Pita (terrorist bombings), Creasy (a former CIA agent) decides to punish the culprits (exactly what Bush has been claiming to do in recent years).What's more, Creasy constantly reads the Bible, just as the US government insists that 'God is on America's side'. Finally, the most obvious: to find the culprits, the protagonist of Man On Fire calls with Mexican officials to search the suspects' phone accounts and bank details, invading the privacy of anyone - exactly what the shameful Patriotic Law does. (Patriot Act) created by the Bush administration has been doing since 2001. According to the 'moral code' of Man on Fire, foreigners are unreliable creatures that do not deserve protection of the Law, whether guilty or innocent (and even both Creasy's Mexican 'partners' in their investigations deserve our repudiation, as they are corrupt enough to break into suspects' private data without judicial authorization).Also the director does nothing to improve things. He has a certain ability to take the strong moments - and he shows it especially in the beginning -, but he buries himself in the weak moments of the action: showing the tough Creasy moved, with a teddy bear in his hands, frankly...As a more than dubious achievement, an exaltation of the lowest violence (torture followed by murder, among others), ""Man on Fire"" relies almost exclusively on its illustrious cast. The filmmaker always manages to make a closed dramatic arc in his films, and here he is no exception to the rule and cohesion is shown as a positive feature of the plot. Violent but humane, Man on Fire is a competent and moving retelling of the 1987 film (Élie Chouraqui), delivering a unique piece with a memorable performance by D. Washington and then child star Dakota Fanning.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Brian Helgeland's average script serves up nothing in the originality stakes, but with a competent director helming the tale, we may have had a pretty good 'avenging angel' flick. Instead, Scott indulges his 'artistic' whims rather than concentrating on telling a story  the result is a 140 minute piece of self-indulgent dreck that irritates and bores in equal amounts. Even when the 'action' kicks in (and it takes a long time to do so), you'll probably find yourself with finger poised over the off switch.

If you can get over the style of filming/cutting etc. (Tony Scott specialities) and whether or not you have children, this film will shock and will make you think.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good But Predictable,"This movie is very good, but very predictable.  The movie goes on far too long, about 2 and a half hours.  It also doesn't do much for the Mexican tourist industry.  Just about every cop in this movie is corrupt.  That said, I did enjoy this movie thanks to strong performances by Denzel Washingtion and Dakota Fanning.  Fanning is so appealing that you feel something when she gets kidnapped.  As always, Denzel Washington is excellent as Fanning's bodyguard determined to find everyone responsible for her kidnapping.  The movie does have plot twists that will only surprise people who have not seen a movie before.  However, there is enough good stuff in here to recommend the movie.  7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Too long,"John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a drunk and an expert at dark ops. An old friend Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) brings him to Mexico City where there's a wave of kidnappings. He's hired by the Ramos family (Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Dakota Fanning) as their driver and security. When the girl is kidnapped and the ransom is botched, he becomes a man on fire.Tony Scott has all the skills of a great action director. He wants to built up Creasy's relationship with LuPita so that it becomes reasonable for him to react that way. He wants Creasy to love LuPita. I'm not opposed but it takes too long. There's got to be a better shorthand or there has to be more interesting insights. At almost 2 and a half hours, it could easily lose 30 minutes. Scott has thrown every camera tricks into the action in the 2nd half. It becomes quite mind numbing. This too could stand to be trimmed. All of it is too long for a fairly simple vengeance movie. It's really an hour and a half movie stretched out for an unnecessary extra hour.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A must see film that highlights all that is good in the film industry.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Good Saturday afternoon fair even if overlong,"Looking back on Tony Scott's career you see a plethora of movies that seemed destined for Saturday afternoon television.  Days of Thunder, The Last Boy Scout, The Fan.all were movies that appealed to the testosterone full male audience while managing to do so-so at the box office.   Over the past twenty years, Scott has had the privilege of working with some of Hollywood's elite including Gene Hackman (twice), Tom Cruise (twice), Brad Pitt (twice) and now, with his new film Man on Fire, Denzel Washington has appeared in front of the camera two times for Ridley's younger brother.With Man on Fire, Denzel goes back to where he is probably most comfortable in the role of a justice seeking authority figure.  This marks the 10th time that Denzel has played the role of a cop or soldier out for revenge or retribution dating back to 1989's The Mighty Quinn.  This in no way suggests that Denzel has not expanded his acting range since he bolted from St. Elsewhere on television in 1982.  His turns in Glory, Malcolm X and The Hurricane shows just how versatile the actor can be and his five Academy Award nominations and two wins are testament to his tinsel town legacy.But I beg to ask why when the script of Man on Fire came across his nightstand, did he jump back into a protector's role that he has done time and time again.  Maybe Tony Scott runs a fun shoot.  Maybe Denzel wanted to get a chance to star alongside Christopher Walken or maybe DW just wanted to spend a few months in Mexico.  No matter the reason, Man on Fire is exactly what you would expect from the same two people who brought us Crimson Tide. And in short, that's too bad.Man on Fire is set in Mexico and surrounds the kidnapping of a wealthy family's daughter.  Denzel known only as Creasy, is the alcoholic bodyguard who is entrusted with her safety and loses her in a dramatic street gunfight that leaves him with multiple bullet holes.  After a remarkable recovery, Creasy is up and back on the assignment gunning down, blowing up and shooting just about everyone in Mexico that ever looked funny at his young victim.As Creasy gets deeper and deeper into the individual cells responsible for the kidnapping, the local police play piggy-back and watch silently as Creasy unravels department corruption, a father's desperate scheme to get out of debt and finally the unveiling of the ringleader of the rash of kidnappings in the country known only to authorities as The Voice'.At a whopping 146 minutes, Man on Fire is about 45 minutes too long for a film of this genre.  It takes nearly an hour before the kidnapping takes place and I was left with a feeling that Tony Scott was unsure of himself and didn't know how to relate to the audience an emotional attachment between Denzel and the young Dakota Fanning.  As a result of this unassurance, we have to spend time with the two in overdrawn scenes including swimming lessons, homework assignments and multiple car rides where the two would talk and argue about things non-relevant to the overall plot.   As trailers revealed a kidnapping plot, as a paying customer, I became antsy an hour into the film and just wanted things to finally play out their course.Also a nuisance was the various styles that Scott tries to incorporate into the film.  He uses various film stock, sub titles that appear anywhere except the bottom of the screen and multiple editing cuts and close-ups that frankly just don't work when combined together over the duration of the running time.  Maybe we should all sign a petition and force Scott to see Steven Soderbergh's Traffic so that he could take notes on how to effectively use these different methods to bring a feel to the film without making us as nauseous as the tea cup ride at an amusement park.And really, it's too bad that this project fails on these levels.  Denzel, Walken and Fanning all give exceptional performances, and I won't go as far as to say they were wasted, but the potential to make something extraordinary was hidden deep in the script and I wonder aloud what a directorial change might have done to recognize this fact.The violence too is unique in its own right.  A scene involving fingers and a car lighter brought back memories of the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs. Another scene involving an explosive butt plug is also something I had not seen before and considering the rash amount of action films that get released every year, that is saying a lot.So I guess I give Man on Fire its chops for attempting to be something different albeit its shortcomings are clearly evident.  This is one of those movies that sits on the fence of being a recommendation or a pan, but then I thought that when I see the commercials for `Coming soon to TBS this Saturday afternoon', I have to admit that I will probably be tuning in.www.gregsrants.com",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Washington still glows, despite Scott's direction","I was very eager to see this one when I read the synopsis and knew who was involved. After making Revenge and True Romance Tony Scott became one of my favorite directors of the 90's. Add Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken with a hard boiled script by Brian Helgeland and you think you've got a masterpiece on your hands.But it's not. The acting is good all around, as can be expected by veterans like Washington and Walken. But director Scott goes overboard with his MTV-style editing, cutting, blow-ups and close-ups. Scotts direction along with the ending and the fact that the lovestory between Creasy and Lisa was cut out diminishes the film and it's cast. Too bad, this could have been something better.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Visually annoying, sometimes touching, but generally disappointing","Wow, man, what's all that jazz for? You can use a TV set with this movie rolling as a freakin' electra lamp for a rave party! The images change one another as if you were watching a Honda advertisement, only the thing's almost 2 hours long... This flickering, which I suppose may be considered a ""stylish approach"", was what made me definitely angry, and I watched the movie with much less pleasure than I could've. Bad move, Tony.But what REALLY surprised was the little Dakota Fanning's playacting. I haven't seen ""I Am Sam"" yet, so I don't know how good she was there, but in this movie she's IMPRESSIVE. And, of course, Christopher Walken as supporting actor is marvelous, no surprises here. The rest of the movie I just can't remember, so I suppose there was nothing worth of mentioning there.To summarize: visually annoying, sometimes touching, but generally disappointing. In my opinion, Dakota Fanning's part in this movie is worth watching it, but then I might just be biased as I haven't seen (or can't remember) her in other movies.",,Anonymous,Crime
A really excellent film!,"This film genuinely was one of the best I have seen in a long time. From the trailer I expected it to be okay, but I didn't imagine it would be as brilliant as it is! My first surprise was the length of the film, and the length of time that elapses before the actual kidnapping takes place. I have not seen a film for some time that was this sad. I loved Creasy (and I'm not normally a Denzel Washington fan!) and the little girl was so cute that I knew I was going to be distressed by her kidnapping.In summary, the two lead characters, Creasy and Pita, were amazing and brilliantly acted. And the ending made me cry (a lot). This film is very heartwarming and even the revenge scenes were better than I expected!8/10 (and that's probably not being very generous).

A furiously underrated movie.,"I've never seen the original 1987 film or read the novel that both these movies are based on, and I'd like to someday. But one thing is for certain. This movie is a very good movie. I wouldn't even argue that Denzel Washington is the only reason why, but without him you essentially don't have a movie. I don't say that because he's the protagonist. I say that because his performance in this in my opinion is one of the best performances of his entire career, and of the year 2004. Often when people talk about this movie, one of the most widespread sentiments shared about it is that it is one of those movies where the performance elevates the movie itself. I find that to be completely true. Because the plot is very simple. A former CIA agent turned bodyguard is assigned to protect a couple's daughter, and she gets kidnapped and held for ransom. He exacts revenge against them. If that's not exactly right, close enough. That's all I'll say in case you haven't seen this by chance. Another performance in this movie that doesn't get the recognition it deserves is also a central performance in the movie. That would be Dakota Fanning's performance. I haven't seen her in a lot of movies but to me she gives one of the most natural performances that a child actress has given in a movie. I don't think this movie would have worked as well without either her or Denzel Washington. There are some other very talented actors in this movie including Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Giancarlo Giannini, and Radha Mitchell to name a few. I don't really have a ton of issues with this movie but after seeing it recently I have one major issue that actually hinders my enjoyment of it a bit. I don't necessarily consider style over substance a bad thing in a lot of movies, but the editing is particularly frustrating at times here. I don't know what was going on, but it's actually kind of absurd. There were occasional freeze frames and slowed down frames that I felt complimented certain scenes nicely, but most of the choices made with the editing felt really excessive. This movie is just really flashy for no reason at all. I just wish there was less of it. I'm not saying that I would want it all gone but it just visually obscured what is a nice looking film by the late Tony Scott. All in all though, I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Pip squeak Lupita wins over the heart of her personal bodyguard and cold blooded killer John W. Creasy,"Okay, so it took me a third watch of Man On Fire to finally get around to writing a review only because to be quite honest, I was tired of seeing Denzel Washington in another action/crime film. But now that the film is well past its freshness date (16 years from its original release date) and after just watching it again for the third time, I saw something magical in the on screen chemistry between a very young ten (10) year old Dakota Fanning and the super star and box office magician, Denzel Washington.Maybe the plot is a bit stereo typed and ridiculous, (child kidnapping in Mexico and corrupt police force) and Dakota's parents (Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony) are more than just shallow parents, but what holds this film well above its peers in the crime/hero genre is the growing affection that hired ex CIA operative John Creasy (Denzel Washington) develops for his protective nine (9) year old child Lupita Ramos (Dakota Fanning). Initially we the audience see the relationship between Pita (as she is called) and Creasy Bear (as he is affectionately called by little Lupita) as nothing more as a paid gig that neither child or protector are too keen on, but each day little pip squeak Lupita wears down the hard drinking emotionless bodyguard John Creasy and when she is kidnapped by a slew of bad Mexican banditos, Creasy swears he will make sure anyone and everyone who played even a tiny part in his clients abduction will pay for it with their lives.The director Tony Scott spared no expense in making sure John Creasy's vengeance mission to make the criminals pay for their bad choice in abductions left no stone unturned, no vehicle explosion too powerful, and no interrogation too brutal that the film had to be rated for adult only audiences.This is the third time I have seen the film and I am sure to want to watch it again over the next few decades as it surely is a film classic in the crime/hero genre. I give the film a decent 7 out of 10 IMDB rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Taken"" before ""Taken""...","It was Gene Siskel who once said that acting in action movies was often under-appreciated or overlooked by the Oscars. Conveying depth and humanity in that genre can be as demanding as for drama if not more, because it's not the action that drives the picture but the motives. Had he been alive to watch Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"", I am sure he would have praised Denzel Washington's performance. His partner Roger Ebert did although he gave the film two stars.I admired the performance too, as the ""Man on Fire"", Washington plays a former CIA agent carrying enough burdens in his past to feel like drowning with Jack and water. His character (John Creasy) is never archetypal because there's a certain unpredictability about him, Creasy can act and look badass like a pro, be casual and funny with a friend or at the verge of a nervous breakdown like Mel Gibson's Riggs in ""Lethal Weapon"". It's not about the job he needs but why does he need a job so bad.His friend, played by Christopher Walken, talks him into becoming a bodyguard, a valuable job in the Tex-Mex border where kidnapping became a juicy business. The film opens with a disclaimer saying that 70% of the kidnappers are never found and so we know that a kidnapping almost equals a death warrant and that the depiction of Mexico won't please the Tourism Office. Watching carefully the opening credits give you a taste of the urban nightmare that make body-snatching so easy and lucrative.The exposition is rather rich and long (for a film lasting more than two hours, it's an old law that the pivot point won't come before the fiftieth minute) and so more contextual information is given in a conversation between a rich Mexican businessman named Ramos (Mark Anthony) and his lawyer (Mickey Rourke) about the necessity of hiring a bodyguard. You'd think it's only for the life-and-death aspect but it's also an administrative obligation: insurance companies request a bodyguard. Ramos is married to an American WASP woman (Radha Mitchell) and has a daughter named Pita (Dakota Fanning).So Ramos meets Creasy who at that point, Creasy shaved his beard and heard and looks like an action hero and he's so impressed by his resume he asks ""what's the catch?"" The dialogue here is minimalist perfection ""I drink"" retorts Creasy and has no problem explaining how it might affect his work. It's obvious that Creasy doesn't exactly believe he's fit for the job, but one's got to do something with his life, or what's left of it. Later he meets the wife and she's so happy that he's American that she doesn't suspect anything about the drinking problem.Creasy's vulnerability with alcohol is obviously the tip of the iceberg, this is a man with demons, who refuses to open up himself to anyone, much less a precocious little girl who asks two questions every ten seconds. He refuses to be treated like a ""new toy"" and from the tension that governs their early interactions, we suspect that the ice will ultimately break. And so from one last-minute swimming training session to a history question, a complicity grows between the two. There's a scene where Pita asks Creasy if he was smiling and both actors are just terrific. Even a deadpan ""what?"" from Washington can speak a variety of emotions, in fact Washington is capable to play 'lack of emotion' as if it was emotion itselfThe interactions are so believable and captivating that once the inevitable happens and revenge time comes, somehow the film jumps into a territory that becomes a tad too familiar and Creasy becomes the very archetype I didn't want him to be. The second feels a little more formulaic than the other, allowing even more characters to emerge: Rachel Ticotin as a Mexican reporter, Giancarlo Gianni and Jesus Ochoa as law enforcers and a mysterious kidnapper known as the Voice. AT that point, we know it's personal and Creasy will climb the whole organization from the watchers, to the snatchers, killing, torturing a few criminal or corrupt agents. Basically, ""Taken"" before ""Taken"" and we are rooting for him because we know what the stakes are and that's one crime we can't forgive (although drugs probably kill more young people than kidnapping)Anyway, the second half stretches the film for a little too long and sometimes the credibility. It's also possible that the jagged editing and the visual effects (yes, it's Tony Scott) get repetitive and anyone prone to seizure should think twice before watching this. This is a flaw that has been pointed by several reviewers and I agree that at times, the film was almost dizzying to watch. I suspect it's to keep a sense of coherence that this kind of photography was used for the first part despite its relative lack of action, as if we needed the swimming pool sequence to be shot like this.Tony Scott was a good visual director but he should have stuck to the heart of the film: It's basically about a man discovering one thing it was worth dying for, and facing one last time the ugliness of the world to save the one thing pure and innocent that saved his soul. It's Washington on fire, it's great to see him punish the bad but a little less would have been more and the ending sanctifies Creasy a tad too much. His final action (or lack thereof) is still a head-scratcher.It's a shame for a film that started so well to get so conventional once Dakota vanishes from the screen. Speaking of her, some complained about an umpteenth precocious kid trope film, well, I'll say the only line that sounded unnatural from a little girl (even if it was a boy) was ""being Black, is it a positive or a negative?"" that didn't sound natural... still a solid thriller and having Washington in it is always a positive.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Dakota & Denzel, What A Duo","When I think of my favorite movies this movie isn't far from the top of my list. In a Mexico City setting of crime and kidnapping on the rise, Denzel Washington (Creasy) plays a retired CIA operative thats lost his luster and picked up a bit of a drinking problem. Disconnected from emotion and self preservation he picks up a job as a security guard for a wealthy family, the Ramos family. Samual Ramos (Marc Anthony), puts his faith in Creasy to protect his daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning).Without giving away spoilers you can imagine what happens. This action thriller, not only gives you that action but can really pull at the heart strings. It's a movie that still brings out all the emotions even after many watches. Denzel and Dakota have many great scenes that gives this duo an amazing story of friendship filled with admiration and endearment. Even though this movie may not be for the faint of heart, if you can see past some violence, the movie does tailor to most viewers.

Flashy and ruthless does not equal great movie,"The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development. That is another disappointing aspect of the movie. If I want to watch an over the top action flick I do not need any justification, but this movie tried to justify the killing spree of Denzel Washington's character and poorly failed in delivering any believable performances. The first half hour or so nothing much happens except that dumb archetypes and clichés are portrayed and when the action machine starts rolling it is so quickly cut that you do not know what really happens. So the movie does not work either on the level of a believable drama/thriller , nor as a pure action movie. Of course the movie is not as bad as some oft the totally messed up blockbusters of the last years, but I absolutely cannot understand why so many people claim this movie to be something fresh and so cool.

A rare 9 star review from me,"I'm really miserly about handing out 9 stars, so this one has been an exceptional watch. I usually enjoy Denzel Washington's films, and this one was exceptionally good even among other films with this fine actor.I read the novel back in the '80s and saw one earlier version; the one with Scott Glenn and Joe Pesci. The 1987 version was very good and fairly close to the novel. I liked it. This latest version tops not only the Man on Fire story versions, IMO, but any other movie I saw that year. It's also very true to the novel as it is set in Mexico rather than in Italy.Creasey's past, in the novel, is in the French Foreign Legion rather than the CIA, but the relationship between Creasey and Pita (Pinta in the novel) is truer to the novel. To me, the novel is brilliant and this version with Denzel Washington is the better of the two that I've seen.Mexico City and Juarez provide the setting. The cast is very good, including some real stars from American films as well as some stars in Mexican and South American films as well as an Italian star, Giancarlo Giannini.I think that Rhada Mitchell is at her most beautiful in this role and that Dakota Fanning is better in this film than in any other role I've seen her play. To me, this movie is infinitely rewatchable and I've seen it several times over the years.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Man on Fire,"Before Denzel Washington struck up a collaborative relationship with director Antoine Fuqua which bagged him a best actor Oscar for Training Day.Denzil already had worked with British director Tony Scott on Crimson Tide. They would make five movies together before Scott's death.Man on Fire is a visceral violent sadistic revenge thriller set in Mexico.Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a soldier turned government assassin. Now guilt ridden he is an alcoholic. His old friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken) also an ex assassin runs a personal security business in Mexico.He gets Creasy a bodyguard job to protect the young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning) of a well to do Mexican Samuel Ramos and his American wife Lisa.Creasy tries to remain aloof as he takes Pita to school and back but cannot help bonding with her. Even helping her when she takes part in swimming competitions.So when Pita is abducted by what looks like crooked cops and Creasy is injured. It is only a matter of time before he goes out to wreak havoc.Complicating matter is a ransom drop off that goes wrong hatched by Ramo's shady lawyer Jordan Kalfus (Mickey Rourke.)Stylishly shot in grainy colours by Scott. It starts off slowly because you can't have a movie with a double Oscar winner without an adequate back story. Scott also goes out of his way to highlight the issues of child kidnapping in Mexico. I don't think he does much for Mexico's tourist reputations. Apart from all the kidnappings the police are corrupt.As the police are in this film, aided by a crusading journalist Mariana Garcia Guerrero. Creasy goes on a bloodsoaked rampage. As Rayburn mentions. 'He's an artist of death and he's about to paint his masterpiece.'Baddies are tortured, fingers chopped off, one man has a bomb inserted his rectum. While all this is happening Creasy has time to quote from the scriptures.Man on Fire could had done with a leaner running time, the ending was also divisive. Like Creasy was on fire but he also had nothing to live for.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Mixed bag. First hour was solid. Second hour was average.,"Director Tony Scott is known for his big action blockbusters. And for good reason, because he is / was the very best at making them in all of Hollywood. Serious. Seeing is believing...The bad: the first hour is the best, with a surprisingly well made SUBTLE portrayal of Denzel Washington as a guardian of the little girl (Dakota Fanning). NO action during the first hour. But that didnt stop me from enjoying this more true to life part the most...ON THE CONTRARY: the second hour is full of nonstop chases, shootouts and torture scenes, with LOTS of flashy, grainy shaky cam footage that started to irritate me pretty quickly. I dont mind some artistically use of the camera, but this was shaky cam OVERUSE I have rarely witnessed.Overall still a worth while movie for the action fans AND Denzel Washington fans, but beware there are some really cruel torture scenes (cutting of fingers) that didnt needed to be included for enhancement of the thrill. And (depending on your preferences) this movie really is a 2 part story, with quite different characteristics that didnt mix too well. But that's just my humble opinion...",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
I would show this in my film class,"On how NOT to edit a movie. It's been awhile since I last this one and my memory must have portrayed me because I thought I liked it the first time around. The story and acting are decent. I believe the cast did the best they could with some of the crappy lines.But the editing is an absolute nightmare. Where to begin... you feel like you're always been pulled from the action or dialogue with these super cheesy, over the top cutaways. The subtitles to translate the Spanish are distracting by the use of animations you'd find in cookie cutter video tools. And I'm not attacking the age of this film, I know it's oldish at this point, but even so, the way they butchered up the scenes makes it really hard to watch. If they would have done away with the cutaways and camera shakes and took out about an hour of footage, this movie could easily have gone from a 4 to a 6.",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""Revenge is a dish best served in cold""","Based on a 1980'ies A. Quintrell novel ""Man on Fire"" as a production sizzles and then flares with high quality. It is a violent revenge movie , it is a touching redemption story , it is a friendship/healing tale....and it succeeds telling all these aspects in an emotional , gripping way. Main creator of this production Tony Scott ( whom I think along his brother Ridley Scott are last of the few creative artist directors remained in CGI/Marketing oriented Hollywood ) uses a non-original but still very good script , high class acting talents of Denzel Washington , Dakota Fanning and supporting cast plus some very stylish , cutting , flashy , clip like camera work ( especially in violent scenes ) to create a great movie. Tony like his brother Ridley is a true artist on my account.Story : Creasy ( Washington ) is an ex CIA operative/assassin who was burnt and now is an alcoholic filled with guilt due to his past career. When a friend of his arranges a job for him as a bodyguard for Pita ( Fanning ) daughter of a young industrialist in Mexico City where kidnapping-for-ransom is the new rising crime wave , he accepts it reluctantly. But when Pita with her child like innocence forms a bond and takes him out of his self pitying he is committed to her. Until she is kidnapped and Creasy wounded while protecting her. When ransom payment goes awry and she is assumed dead Creasy goes rogue and starts a bloody rampage , begins a violent reckoning among these ""professional criminals"" and whoever arranged and profited from this foul deed or ""looked wrong"" to CreasyThe whole movie is tight accessible to regular viewer , filled with themes fills you with emotions along with clip like scenes...Acting especially from Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning is great...Highly recommended",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
decent thriller that goes a bit overboard,"Ex-Marine-turned-despondent and boozing bodyguard John Creasy reluctantly takes a job in Mexico City to protect the precocious young daughter of a wealthy family, eventually forming a close and inseparable bond with the girl. After she's kidnapped by the mysterious leader of an underground crime syndicate, Creasy goes on a deadly rampage to seek retribution against those responsible. Well-crafted with a first-rate cast the film holds your interest, but the subject matter turns ugly, the direction borders on pretentious, and the story loses credibility as it nears the finale. The film's strongest virtue is its sincere relationship between Washington and Fanning who both deliver fine performances. **½",,Anonymous,Crime
Driving Miss Pita,"Maybe because director Tony Scott's background, this film, at times, feels and has the look of a dramatic musical video, or maybe a commercial for weapons of local destruction. The script by Brian Helgeland, the adapter of Mystic River, doesn't live to the original novel in which the movie is based on.This tale of kidnapping and revenge gone wrong, will please a lot of people, but when one sits down to analyze the plot, a lot of things are not clearly answered.We know that Creasy, the new body guard has a drinking problem. He likes his Jack Daniel more than he likes himself, or the young girl he is hired to protect. Gradually, he warms to Pita, who adores him instantly. When he is wounded in the kidnapping attempt, Creasy gets his act together and he is ready to kick ass. Only at that point the film comes alive.Mr. Washington's scenes with Dakota Fanning, the precocious actress who plays Pita, are very well done. They are probably playing themselves pretending to be in a movie. Miss Fanning is an amazing girl, much older and wiser than her 9 years seem to indicate.In the film the bad guys are Mexican. It's ironic that at the end, Mr. Scott has to dedicate the film to the wonderful and magical place that Mexico is. Sure, if I were Vicente Fox, Mexico's president, or the minister in charge of film licenses, I would have declared Mr. Scott as PNG (persona non grata) and would have made him pack up his gear and go north of the border to get the baddies, pimps and prostitutes and make his film in Hollywood spending about four or five times what the film ended up costing in Hollywood South.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"well directed and acted, but long and with a problematic theme","The theme in 'Man on Fire' is problematic relative to the way the movie is being done. Denzel Washington is a tough character with anti-terror background, hired as body-guard to a rich family in order to guard their child daughter. When the worst fear of the parents become true, he swears vengeance to everybody involved, and engages in a killing spree worth a Bronson and Stallone film. The problem is that in those films you know what you buy, and you seldom question the reasons of the violent action. 'Man on Fire' starts differently, it shows a character with sensitivity and morals very well acted by Washington, and the course of violent action he is taking fits bad in the story. It is exactly the moral dimension of the Bible-reading ex-Marine that makes less believable his immediate recourse to weapons and torture against his enemies.Otherwise I liked the way the film was done, some of the cinema and subtitle techniques are interesting and well combined. The cast is good and well directed, with Dakota Fanning superb in the child role, Mark Anthony , Christopher Walken, and Rachel Ticotin catching good supporting roles.The film is a little bit too long, with the last half hour section looking like being added later, in a twist that starts after one may think everything is over - but it is well justified after all, now that I am thinking back. A good film overall, worth watching, although not without some problems or weaker sides. 7 out of 10 on my personal scale.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brutal and brilliant.,"Denzel Washington (Training Day (2001), John Q. (2002)) sizzles up the silver screen in this drama action/thriller. He and starlet Dakota Fanning (I am Sam (2001), Taken (SERIES 2002)) have ways of connecting us even further into the movie. We learn about Creasy's (Washington) new job and his relationship with the people around him that makes him change in the first hour.Then, during the second hour, director Tony Scott shows us his trademark action genre as Creasy ignites his anger after Pita's (Fanning) kidnapping. Now with the help of a reporter (Rachel Ticotin) and a detective (Giancarlo Giannini), Creasy vows to hunt down the mastermind behind the kidnapping, that is ""The Voice"".As we go deeper, we feel a sense of pity for Creasy. With Harry Gregson-Williams' (Phone Booth (2002)) gritty and touching score, we can feel that the villains should deserve to die.Overall, Man on Fire is a solid movie, not for its action, but for its drama.

"Like a Horrific Blaze, the Film Goes Up in Smoke.","A washed-up former Marine (Denzel Washington) with a terrible drinking problem and haunted by demons due to mistakes made in his past goes down to Mexico City to be a bodyguard to a young girl (Dakota Fanning). It seems that her well-to-do parents (Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell) are scared to death of the recent surge in kidnappings within the city and are desperate to keep their daughter safe. Naturally Washington keeps himself at an arm's length from all those around him until Fanning is able to break his shell with her youthful kindness, friendliness and non-judgmental nature. An unmistakable bond develops between the two and when the duo is ambushed and Fanning is taken by a group of thugs (and Washington nearly killed himself), the only solution is for Washington to go after every individual that may have had something to do with the tragedy. Thus his old cold and menacing ways come back in full force in a ""I'm gonna get you!""-styled revenge ploy. ""Man on Fire"" starts out well and hits a good stride when Washington and Fanning's relationship comes shining through, but her disappearance sends shock-waves to a production that was already walking dangerous territory. Director Tony Scott would rather dazzle with crazed camera shots and distracting elements like giving English subtitles when the characters are actually speaking English than going for the throat with character development and story background. The movie is literally on fire it seems as the entire screenplay (adapted by Brian Helgeland, who has done much better work with triumphs like ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Mystic River"") thrives on chaos rather than coherence. Really the movie makes less sense as it progresses. Washington does all he can in the mess, but Fanning is truly the only notable point in the film (she helped turn ""I Am Sam"" into a minor success by splitting time with Sean Penn). When she is taken out of the picture, a tail-spin occurs that cannot be stopped. Good actors like Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Rachel Tioctin and Giancarlo Giannini get lost in a dizzying maze of loud and empty film-making techniques. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,Crime

Scott goes to town - and it works,"In April or 2004 there were three big revenge films out in theaters: this film, Man on Fire, Kill Bill: Volume 2, and the Punisher. Out of those three, Tony Scott's film, a remake of a small 80s thriller, rested right in the middle. It might have been as ambitious as Tarantino's film, but thankfully was nowhere near as atrocious as that ""other"" movie. In this Denzel Washington is a bad dude, but one with principles that stretch to the point of no return as he goes to town to find those bastards that took away the girl he was protecting (Dakota Fanning). It's a visual stroke of, well, almost genius perhaps: Scott is into shooting stuff in such a way that we're in a daze a good deal of the time, and he flips the screw on us in such a way that we only know what to expect in some of the characterizations.But this is Washington digging into a character perhaps just as irredeemable than his character in Training Day- certainly not with too much more range- and yet we end up identifying with this troubled, brutal man because of something Washington puts in Creasy: quiet (or not son quiet) resolve, perhaps? Certainly Scott's approach is daring enough to keep interest, and indeed Man on Fire has become one of those movies that I have seen several times on television. I recognize it's not exceptional or even too great of a revenge picture. Yet I also recognize a craftsmanship to it that doesn't just go for broke but breaks the bank into a bunch of pieces. It's a glorious but decadent excess of style, like with those flagrant subtitles popping up or those fades and dissolves that do backflips on one another.It's a gritty film shot like on a mescaline trip. It's also got some heavy-duty backup (Giancarlo Giannini, Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony- yes, Marc Anthony), and some really grisly action scenes that reveal as much about the lengths to which Creasy will go as much as the director and writer themselves. It's not something I'd say is at the top of any list, or that I'd immediately rush out to buy. But it's got a magnetic quality for all of its ugly bits and pieces. It's about something, which can be said more than other Tony Scott freak-outs major (Domino) and more whimper style (Taking of Pelham 123).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Inconsistent script + style overkill = Underwhelming  (**),"A shifty script and style overkill drowns this over-the-top kidnapping story.Denzel Washington stars as Creasy, an alcoholic former Marine predictably haunted by the past who reluctantly accepts a job in Mexico City as bodyguard to a little girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning).The first half of the movie, which is about Pita gradually drawing Creasy out of his shell, is ok. Washington is his old reliable self and Fanning once again proves to be one of the best child actors working.Then, Pita is kidnapped and apparently killed. Creasy swears to the family that he'll kill everyone responsible. Fun!Director Tony Scott has two great movies under his belt (1992's ""True Romance"" and 1995's ""Crimson Tide""), but this film goes on the pile of his other style-over-substance movies.In ""Man On Fire"" Scott experiments with all sorts of crazy film and sound techniques (even the subtitles don't stand still), which is pretty cool for about 30 minutes. After that, it feels annoying and manipulative, because it's obviously just there to distract from the very ordinary story.What's most troubling is the fact that Creasy's character goes from being a human being in the first half to being a sadistic vengeance machine out of a Chuck Norris movie in the second. If it was a good movie, it might examine what makes Creasy nearly as ruthless and vicious as the people he's after, but instead it just paints him as some sort of big, cuddly, moral hero. We're supposed to love him because he reads the Bible and because Pita names her teddy bear after him (aww!). Probably a good thing she can't see her Creasy-bear cutting off fingers, ears, and blowing people up.It's not a terrible movie - the acting is pretty good, and the cinematography is good when the editors aren't trying to give you an epileptic seizure.

This is a true revenge movie, and has violence in abundance. Denzel is cool, calm and collected as Creasy the assassin/bodyguard. And the ways he disposes of the bad guys is pretty damn cool. This reminds me a little bit of Leon, with the fact that Crease learns how to smile and be happy again with the help from a little girl,(not in a sick way) and when that is taken away from him......people pay.

Denzel at his best.,"Tony Scott seemed to live in his brother's shadow, but I don't think he got a fair shake, may he rest in peace. I loved Crimson Tide and I loved Man on Fire. His signature dish, to create fast paced, Kaleidoscopic, intense adventure stories marked by formula, but very much enjoyable. Man on Fire is one of his finest works and he directs Denzel brilliantly. Dakota Fanning is great and totally believable in her role. You like her so much you actually start to like it when Denzel starts cutting off fingers to move up the ""bad guy chain."" We get a sense of a man in despair, burdened down by he demon of alcoholism, a life full of pain and regret, who finally sees one last opportunity at redemption and meaning. Denzel replicates this in The Equalizer, but not quite as awesomely as he does here. He is truly one of our finest actors.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Heavy Handed Direction Ad-Nauseum,"Few people can refute Tony Scott's previous box office successes (""Top Gun"", ""Crimson Tide""). Armed with such clout, he surely can saunter in to a pre-production meeting and get virtually any tool he needs to craft his latest ""masterpiece"". ""Man on Fire"" is evidence of such power being abused. Like a child who gets everything he wants, Scott's film turns out just plain rotten. Unfortunately, the audiences who have to endure this latest display of of cinematic spoil are left with the dubious duty of shelling out their hard-earned money to try to follow the scent of this tripe.And tripe it is.While the plot (re-hashed from a previous version of the movie) is compelling, Scott ruins his version with his ""look ma, no hands"" jerky camera work, flashbacks, multiple-exposures, frame-dropping, color timing on an acid trip, simulated under/over-cranking etc. etc. etc. His extreme heavy-handed direction not only detracts from the possibility of audiences enjoying the movie, but disables the average viewer from even digesting enough information to follow major scenes.Denzel Washington delivers a compelling performance as man out for revenge, what parts can be seen between the directorial smoke and mirrors. But while ""Crimson Tide"" explores the mental limits of a man with the power to launch Polaris missiles, in ""Man on Fire"", Washington spends most of the movie spreading his hate in any direction he can aim a shotgun.Thus, he ends up being is a hood ornament on Scott's freight train as it plummets off a cliff.""Man on Fire""?

TOO MUCH artsy-craftsy photography!,"I still think it's a good movie but I subsequently discovered at the office water cooler that I missed some key points.

Then it started to wear me down and I missed stuff.This stark limited chromatism really makes a movie quite unenjoyable like Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"".

I was so affected by what happened to her that even when I watched the movie again the next day, I still cried. And not just tears falling, but actually sobbing. This movie made me want to go out and buy or rent every Dakota Fanning movie there is.

Needs some fat burnt off.,"A decent but not a great film. At its core Man on Fire has a strong simple revenge/redemption storyline- pretty basic stuff we've all seen before but can work well if done right. In other words it's all about the way it's mixed together, not the actual ingredients. To a certain extent Man on Fire gets a lot of it right in terms of its recipe but in other ways it drops the ball. The movie is pleasingly gritty and doesn't pull its punches making for some strong visceral storytelling and giving the movie an edge of realism. The acting is good. I'm not generally a big fan of child actors but Dakota Fanning does a great job. Denzel Washington is good at these stoic tough man kind of roles (And not much else- he's kind of good at what he does but is basically one of those actors who is the same in everything he does). The early part of the movie with them bonding could have been truly painful given how clichéd and saccharine the material is but it is pulled of fairly well due largely to the performances by the two leads. The contrast of these scenes with the more violent thriller material later in the movie works surprisingly well, somehow managing not to come of as obvious and manipulative. However, Tony Scott's increasingly 'stylised' style of direction was very distracting and pulled me right out of the movie. Techniques such as coloured lens filters and rapid cut editing can be used to good effect if used correctly in a movie but here and in a lot of Scott's recent films such techniques are used constantly with neither rhyme nor reason. Also the movie needed to be edited on the whole a lot better. It moved far too slowly and could easily have lost at least twenty minutes- the last few scenes really dragged not because the later scenes were badly done but because by that point the movie had lost all impetus. There wasn't really enough story for 140 minutes. The whole thing seemed over-baked with the excessive running time and over-direction. I'm sure there's a better, leaner film somewhere inside Man on Fire.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

You might miss the underlying plot,"I have read a bunch of reviews that call this movie something less than what it is. Although the movie is a great action flick it has a more human side to it. Densel Washington portrays a ""bodyguard"" by the name of John Creasy. We watch this fella, who has obviously got some problems, fall into a bottle of Jack Daniels. What else is new. It isn't like we haven't seen a film with this plot before. What is refreshing and believable is the relationship Creasy has with the child, Pita. Dakota Fanning does an excellent job of portraying, what could be a pretentious child, an intelligent child that cuts thru the hard shell of a bodyguard that just wants to do his job. What we actually see here is the transformation of a man that is been trained to do a job but has lost the flame and passion for doing it. He finds that real life belongs to those that have a passion for something in life. Love blooms, as Creasy realizes that this child expresses her love of him without knowing what he does for a living or what he had done in the past.I thought this was a heartwarming film that catered to the action film freak and also added the touch of human feeling.

Good movie with bad effect,"This has a good story and some great actors in it. So it was bound to be enjoyable and it didn't fail to live up to that expectation.But I've got an issue with the making. The editing of some scene(where the camera shakes, a lot of cuts happens. I don't know the right term for this) was simply annoying. If I somehow saw this in big screen I wouldn't be surprised to see some people get dizzy!! If the movie lacked this annoying bit I would've given it 7/10 easily.One thing I loved about this movie is how adorable Dakota Fanning was. Her acting was superb and complementary to the great acting from Denzel. An on the topic of Denzel's acting we cant expect anything less from the great actor.All in all this is far far better than typical action movies which addressed some real life problem of that time period in an entertaining way.

Action scenes are worthy of John Wick, before there was John Wick.Character development is one dimensional. No one evolves aside from Denzel and Dakota.

Quite Cold.,"Man on Fire (2004)Denzel Washington, Dakota Fanning, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Giancarlo Giannini, Mickey Rourke, Gustavo Sanchez Parra. Directed by Tony Scott.Spoilers herein.Former Marine/CIA operative and depressed alcoholic John Creasy is sent to Mexico to help protect the daughter of an industrialist after a series of kidnappings occur in Mexico City. At first Creasy just wants to do stick to his job and nothing else, but he slow starts to befriend young Pita. Pita is suddenly kidnapped out of nowhere and Creasy is badly wounded, but he vows revenge on those who took her and anyone who gets in his way.'Man on Fire' really could have been another typical, dumbed-down thriller, but it ends up being intense and very different from most in some areas. The plot of course does not sound original at all, and it isn't, but the directing and editing are the main parts that are different.Denzel Washington is simply amazing in his role  he actually gives one of his very best here. I wasn't too big on 'John Q', but I still thought he did great in that film as well and saved it from being below average, and that convinces me that Washington is still one of the best actors working today. Dakota Fanning is very good for her age as Pita, and I think she will probably go on to a higher acting career, as she gets older. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty good too, for those whose faces are familiar.The real only main flaw here is too much of Scott's visual style running wild. The editing and camera work do get very irritating after a while, though they do work strong in some scenes. I really expected this to be a typical Michael Bay-like blockbuster, but I actually think of it as one of the most underrated films of 2004, and it definitely works as both an action film and a character study. 4 stars out of 5.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Ablaze with action,"Denzel Washington as Creasy is a hard-drinking world weary ex-CIA operative who takes the job of being the bodyguard of the nine year old daughter of a wealthy industrialist in Mexico, at the behest of friend and former college Rayburn (Christopher Walkin). Bit by bit, the daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning) chips away at Creasy's hard exterior, which makes him take her eventual abduction all the more harder. And Creasy, now horribly wounded from the scenario, pledges to take down anyone even remotely involved in the kidnapping with methodical brutality that would make the recent ""Punisher"" movie wince.

Enjoyable,"Assuming that kidnapping is a common thing in Central and South America, Tony Scott and his writers deliver an action movie far from being original, but rather striking thanks to, for instance, powerful scenes such as the interrogation in the car.The first part of the movie, which sets and develops the Pita-Creasy relationship, is a bit long — particularly considering the viewer quite clearly knows what is going to happen —, but leads to an ultra dynamic second part in form of a killing spree, with an excellent Denzel Washington, driven by his characters feeling of vengeance.On the whole, the film is enjoyable, however, on the form, two elements are questionable. First, although the cinematography is very dynamic (Scott's trademark), it is sometimes too stylized and almost epileptic with those headache inducing short cuts, zooms and flashes. And second, the soundtrack mixes too many styles and therefore clearly lacks coherence. Finally, and more generally, one could blame Man On Fire for being sometimes a but too cliché, and a bit too schmaltzy with grandiloquent violins, especially in the first part.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good but excessive violence,"The plot is relevant nowadays when gangs are operating freely in several Latin American countries, but the film contains too much violence and scenes of torture. Denzel Washington appears here as a hard man, ex- CIA agent, who knows how to kill and to get the right answers using any abusive method. Everything goes around that explosive area of Juarez-El Paso, where certainly violence occurs very often and kidnapping is a job. The film shows well how corrupted is the police, something that seems to be common in that site. At the end police, lawyers, and even the father of the little girl were all involved in kidnapping an innocent for getting a heavy ransom.

What a Train Wreck,"I gave this film one star because I couldn't go any lower. Those were two hours I can never get back. I like a lot of Tony Scott's movies but he missed it on this one. The story had great potential and the actors were the best. The direction ruined this movie. The camera work was ridiculous; constantly speeding up and slowing down; stopping and starting; cutting to bad angles. I'm sure he was trying to be artistic but it started as annoying and went quickly to aggravating. And the subtitles...what was the deal with those? It looked like his kids got him some subtitle software for Christmas and he just had to use all those cool effects in the movie. It turned out to be childish and insulting. Let's take an example: One of the Mexican criminals gives a speech, mostly in English. Every time the character uses a Spanish word, they subtitle it, like I am too stupid to understand the context of the speech. When one of the characters slurs his speech, Scott subtitles that, too. Direct it right and you won't need the subtitles. The subtitles fade in and out, they blur, they overwrite each other. Just stupid. While I'm at it, was the mother supposed to be Southern? Some of the words she spoke with an overdone, deep South accent but the rest of the time she sounded straight out of California.You might look at my profile and think that I am too old to get it. No. The fact is, this movie was just bad. I watched it with my 16 year old son, who has a much higher tolerance for lousy movies. C'mon. He loved ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""XXX.""

Just phenomenal,"Tony Scott's Man On Fire is one of those films I can watch time and time again and never tire of, a magnificently melancholy tale of South of the border justice, criminal intrigue and a tequila shot of pulpy, blood soaked style that gets me every time. It's loosely based on a 1987 film of the same name starring Scott Glenn, Jonathan Pryce, Danny Aiello and Joe Pecshi (there's a random lineup, no?), but Scott intrepidly branches off into his own territory, and thank god for his vision. This was the first film in which he really explored his sketchy smokehouse of an aesthetic that he would later take to angelic heights with Domino. Colors blur and saturate, editing rockets by with the force of a bullet in a storm, subtitles appear arbitrarily and seemingly of their own volition. It's a jarring tool set that he employs, and many abhor it. I'm as in love with it as he was though, and whether to throw us right into the protagonist's psyche or simply because he felt the need to paint his pictures this way, the rest of the films in his remaining career carried the DNA, in varying doses. Fire is the key word for this film, in many of it's forms. There's a smoldering ember in Denzel Washington's John Creasy that is fed by the winds of corruption as the film progresses, erupting into a blazing inferno of violence and fury. Creasy is a broken man, haunted by the questionable, never fully revealed actions of his military past. ""Do you think God will ever forgive us for what we've done"" he grimly asks his old war buddy Rayburn (a scene stealing Christopher Walken). ""No"" Rayburn ushers back curtly. It's at this heavy nadir we join Creasy, lost in a sea of alcohol and guilt, an unmooored ship with a shattered hull looking for both anchorage and repair. Rayburn hooks him up with a bodyguard gig in Mexico City, keeping the young daughter of a rich businessman (Marc Anthony, terrific) safe from the very real threat of kidnapping. Dakota Fanning is compassionate, precocious and endearing as young Pita, who spies the wounded animal in Creasy right off the bat and tries to make friends. Creasy draws back in reluctance, but eventually warms up. I love the pace of this film to bits. It spends nearly half of its hefty running time simply getting to know these two characters, forging a bond between them before the inciting incident even looms on the horizon. And when the kidnapping occurs, as it must, the stakes are high as can be and our investment level in the situation is paramount. Setting up character is so key, and Scott nails it with scene after scene of quiet and careful interaction. Then he yanks the lid off the pot, as Pita is snatched in broad daylight, Creasy is injured and the kidnappers vanish into thin air. Pita's mother (a soulful Radha Mitchell) works with the dodgy Mexican authorities and her husband's lawyer Jordan (a sleazy Mickey Rourke). Creasy has other plans. Once healed, he embarks on a mission of fury and vengeance, knocking down doors, removing body parts, inflicting gratuitous bodily harm and using every technique in his training (believe me, there are some interesting ones) to track down those responsible and get Pita back. Washington does all this with a calm and cool exterior, letting the heat emanate from every calculated syllable and intense glare. The descent into Mexico City's poverty stricken criminal underworld is a grisly affair, and all sorts of ugliness is exposed, shredded through the caffeinated prism of Scott's lens. Two cops do what they can to help Creasy, idealistic Guerrero (Rachel Ticotin) and battle hardened Manzano (the always awesome Giancarlo Gianninni). It's Creasy's show though, and he blasts through it like a righteous hurricane of blood and bullets. Scott's films have a knack for ending in over the top, Mexican standoff style shootouts, but the man subverts that here, going for something far more sorrowful and atmospheric, ending an intense tale on notes of sadness and resolute calm, gilded by the aching tones of songstress Lisa Gerrard and composer Harry Gregson Williams. Walken provides both comfort and catharsis, the only beacon of hope for Creasy other than Pita. Unlike John, Rayburn has moved on from the horrors of their past, but one still sees the trauma in his soul when he looks John in the eye and gets hit with what is reflected back. Tough stuff to get right, but hey, it's Walken we're looking at here, and he's brilliant. Rourke has little more than an extended cameo, but his flavor is always appreciated, and he's great too. I had no idea Anthony had the chops he exhibits here, but I loved his arc as well as his performance and he holds his own in a blistering scene with Washington. Washington is an elemental beast, shadowing what's left of his humanity under a cloak of booze and brooding contemplation, until he's coaxed out by the life saver Pita. Then he's a lion, riding guns out into a ferocious swan song of a sunset that may just hold rays of redemption for him. This is Scott at his best, his unique brand of storytelling at its height, his creative juices a canister of lighter fluid set aflame with genius and innovation. A masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
My favorite from Tony Scott and Denzel Washington,"""A man can be an artist... in anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasy's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece.""I don't know what it is about this formulaic revenge film directed by Tony Scott, but I absolutely fell in love with it from the first time I laid my eyes on it. As much as I love Tarantino's script in True Romance, I still consider Man on Fire to be Tony Scott's best film. I'm also a fan of Denzel Washington's work so their collaboration together in this film is probably the main reason why I enjoy it so much. This was their first film together, but they went on to make three more action films after this one which I enjoyed to a lesser degree. Scott's last film, Unstoppable was a pleasant surprise, but they never matched the quality of Man on Fire. I'm probably alone in this claim, considering it wasn't received well by the critics. There are two other performances here that I really enjoyed. Christopher Walken playing Paul Rayburn, one of Creasy's (Denzel Washington) closest friend and Dakota Fanning as Lupita, the girl that Creasy is hired to protect. Fanning gave one of the cutest child performances I've seen and you couldn't help but feel enraged during the scene in which she was kidnapped. That believable performance and the strong chemistry she had built with Washington is one of the main reasons why the familiar revenge tale manages to work so well and engage its audience emotionally. These are the roles in which Denzel seems to excel at, and he recently proved it once again in The Equalizer. Man on Fire is over the top in its portrayal of violence and it's very stylish, but I was always entertained. Well I think I've written enough about this film so I'll be off to Blue Bayou now!""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting.""""Last wish?

It was the greatest movie ive seen in a very very long time.  I thought that Mystic River was a great film, but this one may have been better.  It kept my attention at every point in the movie.  It took the perfect amount of time to establish Denzel's relationship with the little girl and left the perfect amount of time for his revenge to occur.  The acting was spectacular.  Everyone played their part to perfection, even down to Marc Anthony, normally a singer but who has appeared in a few movies with smaller roles.  This movie was a step up for him and he did a good job.  Walken and Rourke were good in their supporting roles and Washington, who gives a performance better than in Training Day, and Fanning, who at ten years old is a mature actress, should walk away with at least academy award nominations.

A revenge tragedy for modern time - breathtaking,"Wow! Wow, wow, wow, WOW! When a good director, honing his skills in a particular genre over many years, suddenly brings it all together in one film the result is almost always breathtaking. Tony Scott's ""Man on Fire"" is such a film and is guaranteed to stand out as Scott's ultimate masterpiece for many years to come. ""True Romance"", Scott's super cool breakthrough crime thriller which used a typically brilliant screenplay by Tarantino was fun, funny and dripping with coolness, but ""Man of Fire"" shows that Scott can do heavy drama as well as cool, slick action. Denzel Washington digs deep in this film to some of his darkest demons and pulls out a performance that is inspirational in its complexity and depth. The key to the film's success is in the relationship between Denzel's character, a washed up black-ops mercenary now working as a bodyguard, and his ward, the wonderfully mature yet very vulnerable Dakota Fanning. Once you believe the relationship between the two characters and the degree to which the young girl helps the old bodyguard to find new meaning in his life, the rest of the tragic film just falls into place, and boy, do you believe it! The first half of the film is one of the best character development sequences I have ever seen on screen - perfectly written and inspirationally acted. Scott uses his trademark style to bring the two characters together while continually suggesting in the background the menacing danger of Mexico City's crime-ridden streets and the inevitable tragic turn of events looming over the characters' blossoming friendship. A classic revenge tragedy, ""Man on Fire"" is not easy to watch. The second half of the film, to some no doubt gratuitously violent and at times even self-indulgently so, only works because of the first half of the film and because your sense of sympathy for Denzel's tortured vigilante is overwhelming. If the ancient definition of tragedy is that it raises in the viewer emotions of pity and fear then ""Man on Fire"" is Scott's hardboiled answer to Shakespeare's Hamlet. I doubt Scott will ever repeat this level of intensity, where his trademark erratic visual style is for once justified and where all the elements come together to deliver what is to my mind the most powerful cinematic experience of the last year, if not of the last decade.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Hard to dislike, impossible to love","In the realm of film and other assorted arts, its rare to find a piece that propels a conflicting feeling. Usually you like or dislike something, with varying degrees of each, but ""Man on Fire"" excels in its beautiful direction, acting, photography and then falls face down into mediocrity when it comes to script and plot.If feels almost a waste that such a beautiful work offers little more than the cheap thrill of a vengeful chase. Its purported intelligent twist, which I guessed with certainty past one hour of its 2:30 running time, is nothing if not the old Hollywood compulsion of tying up all the knots and leave people safely satisfied.Another reviewer on IMDb states this is a violent film and that it ignores 30 years of social blablabla, but the only violence in this film(other than the cartoonish deaths and bullet wounds), is the ease on which they turn the very serious issue of kidnapping into a thrill ride, all the while pretending they are serious in their approach.This movie has a lot of good things in it(Denzel is top form in this one), and there are far worse offerings, but it really only works in the shallowest of ways.How this has a 7.7 rating in this site is beyond me.PS: for a truly good film on vengeace, try ""Oldboy"".",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

An average drama/action movie but great chemistry between characters,"The action sequences, explosions, chases are alright, but the angles and camera shots can be a bit annoying, to a few audiences. The thing that makes Man on Fire worth seeing is the undeniable chemistry between Washington's Creasy and Fanning's Pita. The natural performance from Fanning keeps this dark film shining, and when Pita is kidnapped, we can feel Washington transform his character into a much darker, angry, full of vengeance man who will do anything to get the child back.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Off form,"Just seen this film and still find it hard to believe that the likes of Denzil Washington agreed to appear in it, and Tony Scott directs it. Though it was good to see Mickey Rourke appearing in a film and not looking like someone who was on death's door for a change.Brutal and clichéd are how I would describe this film. The idea of the 'lost soul' looking for redemption reminded me of Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven. But unlike the western this slips into sentimentality and veers away from the true darkness of the main character. He can kill ""sweaty and corrupt"" Mexicans but the scripts veer away from the true brutality of the main character when threatening a woman or the girl's father. Not that I'm condoning violence against women, more the fact that the film did not stay true to the character - don't worry little girl, I've killed in cold blood, maimed and tortured individuals but I'm really a nice person and would never hurt any true blond haired, blue eyed American!The choice of music - mournful vocals - was very similar to Gladiator. Were we also have a man of violence driven forward by revenge. But while Maximus was a character trying to escape violence and start a normal existence Creasy just comes across as an unoriginal, unstoppable killing machine. The scene when he was buying guns was right out of an Early Arnie film such as Terminator or Commando.Finally the direction. What was Tony Scott thinking; stop trying to copy the likes of David Fincher and Darren Aronofsky. Stick to what you are good at set piece over the top action sequences - car chases, impossible shoot outs etc. The 'realistic' gritty edgy style here with digital cameras, ragged editing and jarring camera movements became from tedious very quickly.Maybe one to rent on a wet Saturday",,Anonymous,Crime
Man On Slow Motion,"Simply put it's just too long. Nearly two and a half hours for a movie that Bronson used to knock off in 90 minutes. OK so the acting is good, the script is better. But you know as soon as you hear music that's similar to Gladiator, what the outcome might be. The relationship with Creasy and Peta is excellent, the little girl is a fine actress. But it's when things turn nasty. There's little action and we have seen this all before in movies like Payback (fingers instead of toes) Eye of the tiger (explosives where the sun does not shine). The jerky camera annoys rather than entertains. And there's a lack of humour, which makes things grim and to be honest rather dull. Hard to believe that the director of Last boy scout and True romance could deliver this overblown thriller thats far too long.

A dazzling film,"You've never seen a kidnap film done like this before. Director Tony Scott's flashy gem is more than the action extravaganza that it implies. Essentially a film of two halves, the first dealing with the father and daughter like relationship between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning, the second dealing with Denzel's invigorating revenge after Dakota is kidnapped and presumed dead. Scott impressively takes his time with the first half developing a real bond between the two leads. Denzel gives one of the greatest performances of his career. He begins as a burnt out alcoholic haunted by his past as an assassin who's soul begins to heal due to his bonding with Dakota only to be forced back into his old ways demonstrating how ruthlessly efficient he can be.

And it was difficult to connect with any of the characters with any measure of sympathy. But when the plot began to fade then the use of vengeance to bring new life to the movie turned out to be a good strategy, and it worked. The cinematography was not good but I could see that they were doing the camera motion thing to add dramatic effect but it was only working in a distracting way. The length of the film being very long helped to allow the story to tie up loose ends and make the movie rewarding.

Your average action movie. Confusing and over the top editing.,"""Man on Fire"" is your average action/revenge movie, starring Denzel Washington, that does the usual stuff: killing people left and right, taking bullets like a sponge and acting like nothing happened. I really thought that this film was going to be different. The director took the time to build such a realistic friendship between Lupita and John, and then, he went full bezerk, trashing basically everything that he developed in the first hour.The editing is out of this world, and not in a positive way. It seems that the director found out a new effect and decided to use it for the whole length. What he had in mind? Why there is so much flashing during action sequences? Why there is such a strange filter during shootouts? The flow of action scenes is constantly interrupted by unnecessary slow motion. This is a case of overediting and looks extremely unprofessional. Who worked on this? A bunch of beginner film students?The movie is too long. Two hours and a half for a revenge flick? There are a lot of redundant moments, sequences that slow incredibly down the pace, without adding absolutely nothing to the plot. We know that Mr. Creasy has turbulent past and experienced a traumatic event, that is never fully disclosed. The character is not deepen enough to care about him. The first hour is just perfect, but seeing Washington shooting and screaming for the remaining one hour and a half, is a little bit too much. This should have been trimmed to two hours max.""Man on Fire"" was released in 2004, but it feels like one of those generic action blockbusters from the 90s, with worse editing and big consistency issues. I cannot say that I have enjoyed it and I found extremely painful to go through it, to the point that I needed to split the vision in two days. Cannot recommend it at all. I gave four stars because I actually found very appealing the introduction, and I thought that I was going to see Washington on a deeper role, but this was not the case.

Whatever it was, it was damn irritating and left me with a profound headache when the film was over.  I have some good thoughts about director Tony Scott because of The Hunger, where Catherine Deneuve was so so so hot, and The Fan, where Robert deNiro gave a great performance in a bad film---but is he always such a bad director? at least, the cinematographer is brilliant.3.) Is this film absolutely shameless, manipulating every emotion possible in the crudest way--from sympathy for the little girl (boo hoo) to glee at the torture of the bad guys.

The vintage filming combined with newer cameras gives this film a unique look and feel. Great character development. One of the best revenge movies out there.

"""Man on Fire""","Director Tony Scott, who some have dubbed the ""lesser"" Scott brother (and the one to call when Ridley is unavailable), has had a wildly uneven career over the last 15 years or so. He has his own trademark visual aesthetics down pat, and has directed some relentless action bloodbaths in his career (""The Last Boy Scout,"" ""Revenge,"" ""True Romance"").But since the mid-90s, Scott has tried to relieve himself of those stylized action flicks in favor of more ""respectable"" Hollywood productions, and ""Man on Fire"" is the latest effort. While ""Man on Fire"" boasts some terrific visuals and action, somewhere in the middle, things are lost, but the film isn't a failure because of that.Believe it or not, I actually enjoyed Tony Scott's take of ""Man on Fire."" It has a worthwhile star, Denzel Washington, plot and performances from much of the supporting cast. The problem is, Scott's rendition of ""Man on Fire"" is simply too much. It suffers the most from a buildup that seems more perfunctory than dramatic, and bad pacing due to Scott's over-indulgence into the characters.Washington plays Creasy, a bodyguard with a shady past, who is hired by a Mexican businessman named Samuel (Marc Anthony) and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell) to protect their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). When Pita is kidnapped, Creasy embarks on a mercilessly bloody quest of vengeance to find those responsible, and eventually traces those links back to the family household that hired him.The film focuses pretty much, for almost the entire first hour, on the developing relationship between Creasy and Pita. And therein lies the problem: the previews had led us to believe that Washington was going to kick some serious a** but unfortunately none of that occurs until the last 45 minutes or so. So until then, you'd have to sit through a lot of dialogue and people standing around talking.None of that is bad really, except if you're more of a fan of bloody thrillers (which Scott had become famous for during the 90s), but ""Man on Fire"" is made more for those who like action movies with a purpose, other than blowing stuff up.Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning are both flawless, in roles that really are moving and profound, as are most of the supporting players including Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Christopher Walken, and Mickey Rourke. Scott himself is showing signs that he's maturing into a true filmmaker and is not living in older brother Ridley's directorial shadow.""Man on Fire"" does of course contain many of Scott's trademarks, including twisting, beautiful cinematography and visuals, tough, convincing characters, and stylized bloody violence. Scott even makes good use of the lush Mexican setting and uses them substantially in staging the action sequences.All in all, ""Man on Fire"" gets a ""7,"" and I certainly enjoyed it a lot for what it was.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An entertaining-fascist-violent action movie...,"The novel this movie is based on had a first adaptation in 1987, but I haven't' watched that film , so I cannot compare. As for this new adaptation, it is a story about kidnappings, ransoms, revenge, and corruption in the city of Mexico with Denzel Washington playing the main role: an alcoholic ex-marine disenchanted from life that ends up working as a bodyguard for a rich men's little daughter (Dakota Fanning -this kid is just one of the most impressive young actors ever-) . Putting aside the ideology of the film (pretty fascist and violent, just like ""Dirty Harry"", ""Lethal Weapon"", and stuff like that), what we have here is a rather commercial picture directed by the man who made ""classics"" such as ""Top Gun"" or ""Days Of Thunder"", nice filmed action, with bad constructed characters (what the hell is going' on with Washintong's character? Why has he ended up like that? Maybe I missed something...).

One point of excellence was the extensive time taken at the beginning of the film to build the caractures and to allow the viewer to get to know them and understand their relationships.

You wouldn't steal a child.,"'Man On Fire (2004)' is edited with the same frenetic energy as those iconic ""you wouldn't steal a handbag"" anti-piracy ads. It's really quite something. I mean, describing it as 'MTV' is underselling it; it's... well, a bit insane, actually. To be honest, it gives me a headache. It's not bad, don't get me wrong. For starters, it's clearly done that way on purpose. It's a style, not a mistake. However, that style is rather difficult to watch. It's just so in your face that it's often hard to tell what's actually happening. Still, at least it's distinct and has its own energy. It's also used to tell a story which is legitimately engaging and enjoyable. The narrative is a bit bare-bones and we've certainly seen it before, but it's successful at what's it's trying to do. The picture is far longer than it has any right to be, though; it's almost an hour before its main plot actually kicks in. I understand that the first act is long so that can we spend time with the characters and come to care about them, but some scenes could've been trimmed for a more streamlined experience overall. Ultimately, it's an entertaining revenge flick that's let down a little by its aggressive, almost off-putting editing. It's worth a watch, though. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel en fuego,"Redemption via revenge. Starts cynical and unsentimental but loses its teeth along the way; this compromises its moral foundation, which in the setup threatened to be formidable. What promised to be a solid genre piece becomes a muddy, plodding mess.

I don't know who's idea it is to shake the scenes but I wish they would go back to the basics.The acting was fine and the story was OK, even though it was far fetched.

An entertaining movie - though it the visuals ultimately detract,"'Man on Fire' is an action film that tries to go beyond, like A.J. Quinnell's novel. Rather than focusing purely on action sequences, director Tony Scott (Top Gun, Crimson Tide) and writer Brian Helgeland (L.A. Confidential, Mystic River) attempt to build a relationship between the characters. The attempt is admirable but the film ultimately falls to clichés and unnecessary, fast-paced editing.Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an American in Mexico City, hired to work as a bodyguard for a wealthy family. All around the city kidnappings are happening at an alarming rate. Lisa (Radha Mitchell) is nervous and convinces her husband Samuel (Marc Anthony) to hire Creasy as a protector for their young daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning). At first, the relationship between Creasy and Pita is strained but eventually they come to gain affection for each other. Creasy is an alcoholic shell in the beginning of the film and uses the job as an opportunity to stop his habit. He's an extremely mysterious, quiet man who Pita eventually opens up. Nasty consequences ensue, when Pita is kidnapped and a ransom is demanded. Creasy is shot at the scene but eventually recovers and with weapons from Rayburn (Christopher Walken) decides to personally hunt down those responsible. As the film continues the conflict gets wider and wider as he searches for answers. Soon a conspiracy involving a corrupt lawyer (Mickey Rourke) is uncovered leading to even more gruesome violence to a suspenseful conclusion.'Man on Fire' had potential as a film, being based on a great novel but Scott and Helgeland ultimately cut short on the relationship in order for action. Dizzying, MTV-like editing is used for many of the action scene and it feels as if Scott is trying to emulate both his brother, Ridley and filmmaker Oliver Stone. In 1994 Stone released 'Natural Born Killers' which used aesthetics as a focal point to the narrative of the film including some hyper-real scenes. Scott seemed to favor using a similar technique in 'Man on Fire' however the negatives outweigh the positives. The cinematography by Paul Cameron is at once ferocious, especially considering his work on films like 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' and 'Swordfish'. Christian Wagner (True Romance, Mission: Impossible II) edits with the same kind of speed but instead of adding to the film it also subtracts. The action scenes feel unnecessarily disruptive and it's when the violence on screen happens that Scott actually gains momentum. These scenes last more in the memory than the relationship. Helgeland's script dramatically makes cuts to the novel, and frankly it's uncertain that he even read it! Characters are made into two-dimensional pawns, the setting is changed from Italy to Mexico City, and whole chapters of character development are swiftly cut.Washington and Fanning give the appropriate energy for their characters, especially the former. Washington is a talented actor and his performance is one of the good factors of the film. Fanning also is entertaining as always, particularly in the bonding scenes. The rest of the cast is not worth much mention. Walken plays the role straight, which is disappointing considering his good work in 'Catch Me if You Can'.In the end 'Man on Fire' gives into the typical formula. The visuals can be arresting, the action is entertaining, and the leads are worthwhile but the mess created by the filmmakers ultimately drags it down to mediocre or below good.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A great, emotional and tough movie","What a great movie this is. Washington is such a cool, intimidating actor with his, almost animal-like, way of physical acting. His walk, his speech and his glare are perfect for this role. In the first part we get introduced with the story, where the bodyguard meets his job: a little girl, played by a fantastic Fenning. Young as she is, but she's a great actress. Endearing, but believable and the growing relationship is great to watch and adds to the grittiness of the second part where the action takes off. Washington is tough, relentless and scary in his hunt for the kidnappers. The ending is a surprise if you don't know the story. Which I didn't... so this was an extra cherry on this icecold revenge cake. Rourke, Walken and Gianinni deliver great roles as well. Add a great scenery in the form om Mexico-City and there's your movie. Although I could have lived without the desorienting flashes during the scenes.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Tad bit tedious at times and lacks a bit of substance,  still gritty good","This movie is basically about a man with nothing to lose, trying to save a girl that got kidnapped for ransom. Sure it does have some over the top sequences, but overall it was a pretty realistic movie. Denzel Washington is very charismatic in this movie, like his other past movies and is pretty much a badass that will do whatever it takes to save a little girl's life. The plot starts off pretty well and the violence that is done upon the bad guys in this is more than satisfying. But I couldn't help but get bored a few times, cause it feels like body count after body count with the main character Creasy(Denzel Washington) tracking down up bad guy, gets information and moves on to the next bad guy. Which I wouldn't really complain about if it didn't come off as a tad bit boring and dull. It also feels formulaic sometimes as well, but I did like the gritty and realistic aspect of the film. Especially enjoyed Creasy getting his hands dirty to reach his goal of finding the little girl. Overall the movie had plenty of potential and could have been a amazing movie about revenge/redemption/kidnapping, but felt it lacked substance and story for a film that is over 140 min.

A Gripping Tale of Redemption and Revenge,"""Man on Fire"" is a gripping tale of redemption and vengeance brought to life by Tony Scott's kinetic direction and Denzel Washington's powerhouse performance. The movie strikes an emotional chord with its deep exploration of themes like love, loss, and justice, while delivering intense action sequences that keep you on edge.Denzel Washington shines as John Creasy, a broken man who finds purpose in protecting Pita, played with charm and authenticity by Dakota Fanning. Their bond is the emotional anchor of the film, creating a sense of warmth and vulnerability amidst the gritty backdrop of Mexico City. When tragedy strikes, the narrative shifts into a relentless pursuit of vengeance, with Washington embodying Creasy's transformation into a force of reckoning.The film's visual style is bold and frenetic, with rapid cuts and color filters that might feel overwhelming to some but effectively convey the chaos and intensity of Creasy's mission. Harry Gregson-Williams' haunting score enhances the film's emotional resonance, seamlessly blending with its action-packed sequences.What keeps Man on Fire from reaching a perfect score is its slightly overstretched runtime and occasional reliance on genre clichés. Some moments feel repetitive, and the pacing dips in the middle. However, these flaws are outweighed by the film's emotional depth and raw energy.Overall, Man on Fire is a masterclass in character-driven action cinema, blending heart and grit in equal measure.

"good film, stylishly made, well acted, but weak in plot and characterisation","This is a good film, but flawed. I think Denzel Washington is a great actor, and there are fine supporting performances here, notably Christopher Walken in the kind of understated performance he has rarely been given a chance at in recent years. It's good too that the film allowed time to build the relationship between Washington's and Fanning's characters - usually these revenge flicks spend only a few minutes on this, here it's about one third of the movie.Having said all that good stuff, it isn't an excellent film because:* it is self-indulgently long* the plot is formulaic and the twists rather easy to spot.* There is some unconvincing mawkishness, especially around the girl's teddy bear.* shots of Denzel looking moody don't really give him the depth of character that I think the director was trying to convey.

The cameraman who filmed this movie must have drank way too much coffee, the camera moves around wildly giving me, the viewer, a headache.

Firy Revenge Thriller,"'Man On Fire' starts off as a bodyguard-protecting-a-girl thriller and then in the second hour it switches to a revenge thriller. What really stands out is the technical advancement with which Scott directs his film. Though the plot is by no means perfect (due to derailing, plot holes and far-fetched twists) Scott gets the viewer to just roll along mostly because of the hi-tech camera-work and editing. Also the viewer gets to care for the main character Creasy. Even though his fate and actions are predictable, the viewer is interested in how he goes about it. The flashback scenes within the scenes are well crafted. Visually it is impressive as it reflects the unsympathetic Mexican city and the coldness of the heat. Also Scott uses washed out colours and gives it a yellowy tint to give the violence and tense scenes a stronger effect. Denzel Washington pulls off action brilliantly. At first I was a bit skeptical about watching a movie where he plays a bodyguard but he surprised me. Dakota Fanning is good when she acts like a child but irritating when acting like an adult. Marc Anthony and Mickey Rourke are adequate. Christopher Walken is wasted. Sensual Radha Mitchell definitely looks the part of a hot siren mom. The film is more than two hours long but in the DVD there are a few deleted scenes that give extra insight and more depth to the story. There is an alternative ending but I preferred the one Scott retained in the original movie, which wasn't loud or overdone (as would be expected in Hollywood blockbusters).",,Anonymous,Crime

Highly Engaging,"Denzel Washington grabs a hold of the lead role in John Creasy and runs with it. He builds an incredible on screen chemistry with Dakota Fanning who plays Lupita Ramos. In the film, after originally trying to perform his job as a hired bodyguard and not create any connection with Lupita, when things go awry ,Creasy springs into action and is willing to do whatever it takes to save the girl or get revenge on anyone involved in her kidnapping.Watching Creasy develop from a quiet and cold character to one who cares deeply for the girl is excellent character and story development. As he pursues her kidnappers the film is extremely exciting right up to the finish.The downside of the film is that the camera work and cinematography is completely awful. The filters needlessly look like when young teens first found MySpace. The shaking of the camera is just as bad as you know what they're trying to accomplish but failing so badly at. Some of the sets also appear quite cheap. I know it's not the newest movie, but it's not old enough to be so poor in these areas either.Overall, the strength of this movie overcomes its weaknesses.

Washington's display of restraint is as pleasing to watch as Fanning's -surprisingly believable- mix of young eagerness and maturity, and the length of the sequence helps build anticipation for what will surely be an incredible action set...... except that after Pita's -predictable- abduction, the movie never really delivers. Of course, it displays a number of creative ways to dispose of whoever irritates you, but the experience fails to involve the viewer because of a directing and writing shallowness that cannot be overcome. The gang Washington goes against is some sort of lambda bad-guys-bunch, nothing unexpected happens, and the horrible 2000s editing gets in the way of the viewing experience at every opportunity (you'll realize that when a 20s scene between two characters involving no fancy editing shenanigans has you feeling like you're taking a breather). Shaky camera, overlaid shots, ethereal female voices, bloody flashbacks, this movie has them all, to the point that when the finale unfolds, the storyline has seemingly lost all importance.In the end, Man on Fire is an action flick whose best part is everything before the action happens. Or an archeological piece, if you're into that sort of thing :-).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Stop the shaking already !,"Based on a solid (if somewhat classic) story of personal redemption with a very good cast, Man on Fire had everything to succeed had the camera operator and editor not been high during the whole making of the movie. The constant motion, the odd cuts and abrupt transitions, while they may work well in a 2 1/2 minute music video, do not translate all that well to a two+ hour movie. I found it really irritating after about 20 minutes, and I have shot my share of experimental stuff. I even considered giving up on the movie at one point, even though I quite liked the movie, but it really was too much to take.I guess the younger crowd raised on hysterical MTV style images will probably be more tolerant. However the rest of us with an attention span of more that three seconds may find it painful.I really would have rated the movie 8 or 9 if it hadn't been for that issue. A shame really...

"It doesn't get worse than this. A truly ugly, hateful movie","I could say I'd keep this short and sweet, but this excrement of a waste of a movie is long and repugnant. I thought 3000 Miles from Vegas, or whatever that abortion was called was the ugliest most vile movie ever made... now its belt has been ripped from its syphilitic body by this pile of puss. Please, if you have never seen this movie, stay far, far away, because even renting it, and holding the jewel box in your hand will cause a rash and a horrific smell that will make Lady MacBeth's ""spot"" look like a smudge.This truly boarders on a snuff movie. A bad one at that. Tony Scott has always been a hateful, vile man who makes movies that show his own self-loathing. As a ""man"" he is unable to feel for anyone or anything, nor have any normal relationships, so he defecates on the screen and hopes he can spread his unhappiness, and perversions onto the general public, feeling that if they all have his disease, he won't be alone anymore. But why would someone with such talent and soul as Denzel agree to be a part of this disgraceful waste?I've heard that filmmakers with the lease talent and the biggest egos serf the web to read their reviews... no matter where they come from, so obviously Tony will be here. So let me tell you to your face, Tony-boy. You should be arrested. You should be put away. It should be a felony for you ever to make a movie again. There's a reason you hate yourself so much... because the world truly hates you for the projectile vomit that spews from your work. As with the director himself, this smut is tasteless, humorless, and devoid of an ounce of either tension, entertainment, creativity or purpose.In this monstrosity, a young girl is brutally murdered by corrupt Mexican police, and in this movie, it seems anyone who is Latin is dirty. So we have to watch as Denzel, who was her bodyguard, and let her be captured and killed, methodically goes around the slums of Mexico systematically and with psychotic sadistic glee torture anyone who was involved then killing them with childish ""creativity"". So... you want to see this? Tell you what. My dog got into the Bacon-Bites today, and has left massive puddles of diarrhea on my concert porch. Come on over. And look at his handiwork. You'll find it much more pleasant.

Wannabe Léon: The Professional,"I love Denzel Washington & almost all his movies, he has a particular charm to him, especially in Equalizer, Flight & Inside Man. I love him even as a bad arrogant man, because his acting is on point, even if the movie itself isn't great. That's why I hated him, or rather his character in Training Day, but because of his good acting.This movie though, unfortunately lost me completely on the stupid editing, plus the diabolical background sound, which was nothing short of cacophony, even when the credits roll. Even horror movies can do better and make cacophony sound as euphony. I don't know if it took a toll on me because of my ADHD or what (anyone else out there?), but never have I ever been so starved of entertainment in order to like this movie so desperately, just because it uses a unique style & technique, and I never will. A similar technique was later used in the show ""Narcos"", which was way cleaner, and I loved it, because it made sense to use it, unlike here.Among around 900 top movies I've seen so far, entirely from the beginning to the end, with all my focus, I've never found any other movies as seriously irritating as :
1. Pitch Black
2. Man on Fire.
And for both, 75% of the reason was because of the annoying editing. Man on Fire has a better story atleast, and I can't complain about the acting as well, but the choppy editing disconnects you so much that your suspension of disbelief just goes away & you disconnect & now realize that you are just watching a movie, constantly, instead of being invested in the story - and that's never a sign of a good film! Many things just feel like they are happening randomly.This movie wasn't coherent, it felt like a wannabe Leon the Professional, a wannabe biography (ending), but I still rate it 6 because it was not as bad as Pitch Black. Pitch Black was an absolute hell of an emotional torture, plus it's a nightmare for anyone with serious epilepsy! The very mention of it generates an unfathomable wrath within me, especially because I still can't figure out how did so many people love it so much when myriads of better movies exist. Do they really have no other option, or do they really watch a movie once in a blue moon, that they find disgusting B movies cool. If you wanna watch great B movies, watch Tarantino's films.Sorry for the tangential digression though.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Needs a viewers cut,I remembered watching this one in theaters when it came out being pretty good. 17 years later it actually holds up pretty well. I would prefer this to Denzel's latest works like Equalizer.Denzel is at his freaking best. It has the great Christopher Walken that get's to less screen time. Despite some very odd choices in between Harry Gregson-Williams delivers some great tracks for the score and even though the shaky oversaturated camera effect thing is WAY over done it is pretty cool.The first hour is absolutely great. It builds the relationship and is basically a drama without any action. But then for some odd reason when Denzel goes to kick butts Tony Scott decides to drag this out forever. You can easily cut 30-40 minutes without loosing any important information. This is not a complicated plot. It would hold up for 100 minutes but146 minutes should never been green lit by the studio.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel like i like to know him,"So i'm aware that when rating Man on Fire with 8, i'm giving it more than i gave other movies with possible better overall actor's performance (let me revise that, probable not possible), better directing or even better stories. But when i'm rating the movie, i'm not rating each of this aspect and then deliberate what the appropriate rating should be by balancing this marks; no, i'm not a professional movie critic and in any case i don't know how they rate their movies. I'm ratting it as a whole, as an assemble, without actually thinking of each of its components, and that's why Man on Fire gets a 8 rating, because the outcome of more than 2 hours feels like a 8 out of 10. If I like to remember Denzel, i'd like to remember him for roles like this one, if i like to remember Walken it is for performances like this one, same for Dakota. I liked the soundtrack, the story was fine and developed not too fast, not too slow, the direction didn't bother me. I got more than i expected, and i didn't think i'll give a movie with Marc Anthony as an actor such a high rating, but i did and i'm pleased that i did. Certainly, things are always possible to have been made better, but i'm thinking that everything matched the other in this movie, they were all at about the same level. If a better direction would be made it could expose flaws in acting, if a better cast would have been put together, maybe flaws in the story would be more obvious; but just as it is everything seems to be in its place, not too much not too little of it. In my opinion this movie is one of those we'll miss when we'll see the latest Denzel's, Walken's or Dakota's films, because they don't make them like this anymore.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The bodyguard's bloody revenge,This highly improbable story (is it veridical I mean inspired in some real events?) is well told indeed in a bright succession of short plans and brief sequences that rivet your attention all the time with no gaps in the action from beginning to the end. Denzel Washington is superb as the cold blooded bodyguard that starts a series of well planned and executed killings to revenge the murder of the child that he protected. There is not much more to say about this movie because the simplicity of the script doesn't allow great raptures of creativity or imagination. Therefore this movie can be classified more as an honest work of an artisan than a masterpiece of an artist.,6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not a very hot fire,"""Man on Fire"" is a hard movie to like. It is also a hard movie not to like. It could be said that it's three movies in one. The first third of the film is a basic ""getting to know you"" type of movie wherein Denzel Washington's character is hired to be a bodyguard to Dakota Fanning's character. This works well, as he grudgingly becomes her friend as well as her bodyguard. The second part of the film is about her kidnapping and his attempts to find her. It's in this section that the movie goes haywire. You tend to feel, with all the camera tricks, captions with a mind of their own, and jerky, over-the-top direction, that the director was trying to obscure the fact that he didn't know how to tell the story in this part of the movie. He calls attention to himself much too often. Plus, this middle part of the film resembles a Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" type of movie, about a character bent on revenge, more than anything else, which drags the movie down. The final third of the film is more of a mix of the first two parts. Some good moments, some not so good. There was a lot of work put into this movie. When it works, it works well, and when it doesn't work, it doesn't work at all. It would've been better without all the technical wizardry and just told the story.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime

The daddy of Revenge cinema!,"Before i saw this film i had already been a huge Denzel Washington fan anyway with 'Training Day' and 'He got Game' but i have to say this goes above all the rest of any of either Denzel's or Tony Scott's work. The film is outrageously cool and is one of the most compelling and realistic revenge movies ever made. Easily. Denzel gives his most frightening performance ever as John Creasy and is backed up by Chris walken and Mickey Rourke. Both in great roles. When i first heard about it i thought it was'nt going to anything special with films like 'Kill Bill'and 'Walking Tall'just coming out i thought it was just going to be your average revenge film. But its not at all. With the setting being in Mexico City which i have heard is a terrible place for any human being these days,the cracking storyline and twists which regularly pop up and an awesome realism to it it's very different from any of Scotts films and any other revenge thrillers. Altogether i thought it was terrific and was a killer to any other film you would probably see this year. So if you see only one film in 2005, make it Man On fire. You'll love it.",,Anonymous,Crime

Hero Or Brutal Sadist?,"Tony Scott is one of the modern maestros of fancy editing, zippity camera-work, and slick violence. So it's a shame that 'Man On Fire' is closer to the ugly sadism in 'The Fan' than to his wonderful techo-thriller 'Enemy Of The State'. Scott's films are fairly empty and derivative at the best of times, but he knows how to shoot action. Reuniting with Denzel Washington (they made the dynamite submarine drama, 'Crimson Tide') and working from Brian Helgeland's screenplay, this seemed like a can't-miss flick. Well, it missed.What went wrong with 'Man On Fire'? Is it too long? Yes. Apart from the rock-solid Washington and the mere presence of Christopher Walken (playing *GASP* a good guy), is the cast mostly forgettable? Uh huh. Does Scott over-do the visual tricks when he should just let his story work on its own? Yup. Is the movie just too gruesome in the final hour when the hero turns vigilante and shows how they used to do things in Special Ops? Oh yeah. But at least the film is not boring or stupid. Denzel Washington is responsible for a lot of what DOES work, and he's given the opportunity to play a troubled hero in the first half and a sadistic hero in the second half. Actors love challenges like that and it's hard not to root for Denzel when he's kicking the asses of a bunch of guys who deserve it.Dakota Fanning continues to seem like she's an alien from far, far away. This little girl is too grown up for her own good. She can act, though, and her relationship with bodyguard Denzel is nicely developed. They're about the only characters who matter. Everyone else is window dressing. This isn't a terrible film, but it's not one of Tony Scott's best. He usually finds a way to make his violent flicks fun. There isn't much humour or fun to be found here, though. Even worse, there are no surprises in 'Man On Fire'. Geez, if you don't see the plot twist coming from 4 theatres away, you need to see more movies. But I liked the way he used (and sometimes OVERUSED) subtitles.Maybe that's the kick in the head. Here's a movie about kidnappings and children in danger and murders and torture and betrayal and money and Mexico. It's got Mickey Rourke and Chris Walken in supporting performances. The lead is one of the finest actors in Hollywood and his young co-star is the female Haley Joel Osment. The director has made his millions working in the action-thriller genre. And still...all I can remember is the subtitles. I guess that's the essence of Tony Scott, style over substance. In 'Man On Fire', the gap between style and substance was a gigantic chasm.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Tony Scott on Fire,"After flooding the market with revenge movies release in the past two weeks (Kill Bill 2, Punisher, Man on Fire)((""ARE PRODUCTION STUDIOS LOOKING AT RELEASE DATES ANYMORE?!"")) but I honestly thought this one stood out well on its own. Scott's rapid fire and surrealistic directing was what made this film so likable to me and drawing personal comparisons to David Fincher (Fight Club) and Stephen Soderbergh's Traffic, but Denzel, as always, really pulls everything together with another Training Day-esc performance.

Mark Anthony does alright with his role.One thing that really started to get on my nerves about the film. The subtitles began to grow and grow. They even started to come up even when English was being spoken. Sometimes a character would be speaking Spanish....then switch to English...then back to Spanish again. This tends to become more apparent as the movie goes on.I have no real problem with the first hour of the movie setting up the relationship between Creasy and Pita. It really sets the tone for the Bloody vendetta that Creasy goes on when she is kidnapped. It's always better to set up characters and the relationships between them.The rapid jump cuts began to go a little overboard.

Better Than Expected,"I went to this film not expected much, so I was surprised to find out how much I found myself enjoying it. I went to see it on the reccomendation of some of my closest friends, all of whom have completely different tastes. The movie is basically a revenge film, but unlike most others of its genre, focuses most intently on the psychology of the man doing the avenging. The film does an excellent job of showing the hero agonized and haunted by an unknown past, and developing a slow but meaningful relationship between him and his young client. To my surprise, almost half of the film takes place before the kidnapping, thereby increasing the emotional impact later on when the abduction takes place. Denzel Washington does an amazing and believable job, as does Dakota Fanning. Christopher Walken is, as usual, Christopher Walken. Although a bit under-used. The only downfall of this film is the editing, as the story goes on, it employs these strange cuts, flashbacks, grainy images, enhanced by strange music that sounds like someone spinning a radio dial. It gets worse, and at times it was downright annoying, like someone messing with your tv cable while you are watching it. It interrupted the flow of the movie.

Good action/thriller,"Man on fire"" is a good movie that ranges in tone from sentimental to brutal . It's the second adaptation of A.J Quinnell's novel with the same title . The first was made in the 80's . Denzel Washington is great as Creasy , a former CIA assassin who searches for redemption . He's got a death wish and he tries to find meaning of life in Bible and alcohol . A friend (Christopher Walken ) finds him a job in Mexico City as a bodyguard . He has to protect Pita (Dakota Fanning) – daughter of wealthy family from kidnapping . Mexico City in this movie is a grim and unpleasant place where almost every day people are kidnapped . If you thought that only movies from 70's and 80's were able to show big cities as hell on Earth you're wrong. Kidnapping , violence , greed , corruption – it's all here. No wonder Quentin Tarantino likes this movie. Anyway , friendship is growing slowly between Creasy and Pita . The relationship between them kinda reminds me of the relationship between Natalie Portman and Jean Reno in ""Leon"". Creasy becomes a father figure for Pita and she in return brings some joy in his life. Tony Scott (RIP) was able to capture those intimate moments beautifully. Washington and Fanning have a great chemistry together.You have to wait for some action until the half of movie , when the tragedy occurs . The first half of the movie feels like a melodrama ( a good one I must say ) , while the second half turns into detective story (Creasy is searching for answers and eliminating bad guys ) . I was all in tears at the end.Washington gives a very emotional and engaging role . Creasy tries to appear stoic for the whole world , but the viewer is able to feel his pain in smallest gestures or words . Fanning makes Pita an incredible lovely , easy-going but also quite mature character . I'm surprised she didn't received Oscar nominee for her role.Christopher Walken, Marc Anthony, Radha Mitchell, Mickey Rourke also appear in this movie and give a solid support . I wish we could see more of Walken's character . He's good in his role , but I still feel he was kinda wasted in here.Tony Scott makes this movie more than just a simple ""revenge movie"" . His able to capture the drama , while still making the movie entertaining and never boring despite it's quite long time. The screenplay written by Brian Helgeland is intelligent and gives ""MOF"" a feel of 70's movie . Some of the dialogues are wonderful and very memorable :-""A man can be an artist. In anything, food, whatever. It depends on how good he is at it. Creasey's art is death. He's about to paint his masterpiece"".-""Forgiveness is between them and God. It's my job to arrange the meeting """"I am the sheep that got lost, Madre ""Paul Cameron's cinematography is stylish , while the Editing by Christian Wagner has clarity. I still think the movie is too flashy for it's own good . It was probably supposed to create a chaotic feeling matching Creasy's emotions. I understand that , but it was over-used . After some time my eyes were tired and I was really glad for every scene without flashy visuals . Oh , and the movie is half an hour too long.There is some raw brutality in this action drama . The scenes of carnage and violence are both intense and suspenseful . There are some nasty murder and torture scenes here. Good music too. Overall , this is a good movie from Tony Scott . I give it 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"A punchy, intense thriller that unfortunately wastes a fair amount of its potential","Denzel Washington is a troubled hit-man who gradually becomes friends with the young girl who he's acting as a bodyguard for. When she's kidnapped, he literally goes around killing everyone who might have been involved to find the truth. Man on Fire, from the underrated Tony Scott, is a film of two halves. In the first half, Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning (The girl he's looking after) form a friendship and it's touching and well played. Dakota Fanning is excellent, while Denzel Washington once again proves a master of providing compelling performances without being hammy and loud. This has some well handled character development and Washington is a character we can get behind and sympathise with. Then, Fanning gets kidnapped and the film becomes an over the top, hard hitting, brutal revenge film which is good enough, but lacks the emotional dimensions of the first half. The first half is more interesting, even though Denzel is moderately calm and it doesn't involve him killing everyone. However, isn't Denzel going into full on badass mode the premise of the movie? Thus, MOF fails to deliver on the promise of the premise.To its credit, MOF is more emotional than many films of its type. The script is decent enough, although it lacks charisma. Throughout MOF never reaches its full potential. At first, it has some dull moments but then later on it goes overboard. Tony Scott was a good director, and he directs the film well some of the time, but even when characters are just talking or nothing is happening, MOF still looks like it was filmed inside a rave. With indulgent shaky cam, random slow motion and crazy editing which often makes the film look like a terrible hip hop music video about clubbing, you may want to bring the painkillers since this might give you a headache. It works some of the time, but it can get pretty annoying. Combined with the lack of charisma in the script, the film never hits a peak or has a proper finale either so the action can feel a bit underwhelming. Still, its intensity, punchiness and acting is to be admired, although both the audiences and critics got it wrong. 39% on Rotten Tomatoes is too low, 7.8 on IMDb is too high. This is similar to The Equalizer, which also has Denzel Washington in vigilante mode and involves a precocious child actress. This is probably a better movie, but The Equalizer is more enjoyable.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Any message that the film attempts to convey is sunk by its mediocre storytelling and overall bizarre quality. If you absolutely have to see it, don't expect it to be as good as the trailers would lead you to believe. It starts ok but it's one big let down after that.  As for the co-stars, Walken only gets about eight lines in this whole movie and the plot is terrible.",,Anonymous,Crime
Jon Monsarrat review: Good but a little melodramatic,"Man on Fire is a straightforward action flick that spends a little too much time setting the stage. There aren't really any twists, since the movie trailer gives away the main plot twist. Denzel Washington is great as usual, but I just didn't ""buy it"" what happens at the end, the motivations of various characters. They managed to avoid a Hollywood ending, though.Who should see this film:-- Action flick junkies-- Drama lovers who see the occasional action flick, but only on a rainy day. See Training Day first.I'll give Man on Fire a solid 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Good movie  but  they should have lost the kid,"Denzel Washington is sensational as a bitter and world-weary and alcoholic bodyguard hired to protect the little girl Pita (Dakota Fanning) of a rich couple in Mexico. Initailly Creasy ( the Denzel character) is standoffish to the girl and tells her to shut up and let him do his job. But pretty soon he melts and becomes the kid's friend. That's the kind of corny schmaltz the movie could have done without. And the kid is so cute and sweet and innocent and that gets old real fast.Anyway, the kid gets kidnapped early in the movie and then Creasy springs into action and employs his formidable skills with guns and explosives to try and rescue the snot-nosed little darling . Lots of action and some really rough scenes as Creasy is more than willing to torture anyone with some information he wants.A very exciting and, in places, brutal show that would have been better without the kid from Disney. I have yet to see a movie improved by a 10 year old kid.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
denzel washington is a bad mother (watch your mouth),"This movie was a true gem.  Edge of your seat action, maybe a wee bit sentimental at times but Denzel is at his best.  You are really missing out if you don't see this one in the theatres.  Denzel plays a an ex-assassin who takes a bodyguard job in Mexico City, guarding the child of a rich businessman.  At the beginning of the movie he is alcoholic trying to escape his past and his present, but his relationship with the child teaches him that living is worthwhile again.  When she is kidnapped (and he is shot and nearly killed during the kidnapping), revenge becomes the name of the game. As Walken says of him in the movie, his art is death, and this is his masterpiece.  The plot takes some good twists that I don't want to ruin. This is definitely a must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nice work everybody !,"I had to watch the movie twice. The first time I didn't like it very much, but after seeing it again, I realized why : I never paid attention to the small details that are so important, the camera was annoying and I was pretty sleepy :-) But the second time, I was prepared, so nothing could escape me, not a single detail and I can only say : Nice work everybody! Yes, it is a long movie (more than 2 hours), but it is divided in two separate parts. Creases life with Pita and Creases life without her. The acting is perfect. Denzel Washington plays 3 characters in this movie- first, he's the suicidal drunk, then he meets Pita and she awakes Creases will for life & love (or as Christopher Walken well said: ""Pita taught him it was OK to live again."") and the third character is the worst- he becomes this enraged man, ready to do anything to get Pita back. But even in that part when he plays the ""bad guy"" you are with him, because you can feel his rage, you understand that everything he had has been taken away from him, and this time he will not turn the other cheek! A great transformation from this fabulous actor that never stops amazing me. Little Pita is played by young Dakotta Fanning and believe me, she did an excellent job- you just must love her! She looks so fragile and naive, but in the same time you can see that she is a strong and mature girl who already learned that life is not a fairytale. Walken's performance is excellent like always,so I don't have to talk much about his role- he did a great job...again. The story is a cliché, but the interesting thing is that it doesn't end as the other movies with similar plots. It goes further, doesn't stop when you expect it to, but continues to surprise you till the bitter end. That's what is so good about this movie. It's like many others, but it's still original and unique. There are some things that are not explained well, like why is Crease in such a mess? I know that he was in the army and probably killed a lot of people, even had been tortured, but so was C.Walken and he's doing just fine! The main parts are very interesting and, at times, even amusing. It's a warm story about a man who has nobody and meets a little girl who shows him that despite everything, life still has it's good sides. Quite optimistic. The only thing I didn't understand is the end. This is probably a SPOILER : if the kidnapper said I will give you a life for a life, why is he taking his brother and Crease? That's 2 lives, not one. But then I think- he was so wounded by the end of the movie that he would probably die anyway. There is one thing that most people didn't like, but I found it pretty interesting : it's the camera tricks- the blurring, choppy shots and other visual effects that have been labeled as the ""MTV production"" or something like that. I didn't find it annoying, on the contrary, I think it gives the movie that something that makes it different and interesting to watch. Tony Scott did an excellent job. I had no doubts about that. All in all, it's a solid 8 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Story Of Redemption,"In Hollywood, ""redemption"" is a character arc that plays very well in the cinemas. One would be hard-pressed to create a more intense, emotional story of redemption than what can be found in ""Man on Fire"".For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on the character of Creasy (Denzel Washington), an alcoholic with a troubled, violent past. After visiting old buddy Rayburn (Christopher Walken), Creasy gets hooked up as a bodyguard for a family in Mexico City. While at first quite distant, Creasy eventually lets down his stern persona for a bit and forms a relationship with the little girl he is supposed to be protecting, Pita (Dakota Fanning).If you have seen the movie ""Taken"", then you already have a rough idea of how the plot line goes. Yet, under the direction of Tony Scott, ""Man On Fire"" is actually a better, more intense/emotional film due to its gritty undertones. This is a movie that does not pull any punches, so to speak, when it comes to portraying the kidnappings that so often occur in the big cities of Mexico. It is just a very emotional topic and is nailed so perfectly by Scott.Of course, the hallmark of this film is its acting from Washington and Fanning. I would argue that Denzel gives his greatest performance EVER, while Fanning (as usual) shows acting talent light- years beyond her age. The way those two characters interact with each other truly carry the emotional burden of the movie and provide the reason to ""care"" about what is going on. Plus, in typical fashion, the fiery side of Washington's acting persona is able to be revealed on more than one occasion.Thus, I consider ""Man on Fire"" to be one of the best movies I have ever seen. It is equal parts intense and emotional, and great acting performances abound. It is still difficult for me to believe that this flick was not nominated for any major awards (perhaps the graphic violence had something to do with it), because it would have been very much deserved in the acting, direction, and adapted screenplay categories.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brother Tony Dances,"I avoided this for years, because... well because Denzel bothers me. He's probably a nice man. He does a very fine job of projecting a sort of jolly wisdom on screen. But every character and every stroke within that character references this persona. It isn't even him, its his public face. Its the most annoying sort of pseudoacting I know. Unless the movie hinges on this particular and very narrow notion, he fights it.So we end up with a failed picture with a guy in it that we just have to love, or at least admire. Whether we like it or not, race matters in this, because the type he draws on for that personal origin is that of the wise black uncle. He did choose that face after all. Though Forest Whitaker (for example) is in much the same spot, he's chosen to be a real actor, a different man each time we see him.So that bias kept me away from this. My loss. Washington really does work here. Its not because he is any different than elsewhere. But because the filmmaker was intelligent enough to know the man's limits and build the movie around them.And what a construction! Yes, it can be said that Tony also makes the same movie each time. Yes, he uses the same devices each time, striving for the same effect. But he's getting so darned good at it. His dynamic camera is so integrated with his jumping cuts  the most energetic in the business  that while he invented none of it, he surely is the master. I need to go see his TeeVee work on cerebral detectives now. I must.That camera tension is something worth noting, and why it works. Its because the camera stands in for our eye. If managed well, we accept it as our eye, and when it moves, we accept that we would be and are moving that way. When it slides from a face to an object, we believe that we would have done the same, noticing something that may or may not be important.We have the running camera here, making us less of a ghostly, gliding observer, but a human running one, panting, eager. SInce Creasy is so cool, it casts us as actually more in the story than he is. The roles are reversed a bit: though he makes things happen, he is the viewer and we are on the street.Brothers. The Coens. The Quays. The Scotts. Cinematic genius in pairs. I wonder why?Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,Crime
Action Packed But No Payoff,"A better than average action flick that falls short on payoff. The ever top tier Denzel Washington as former C.I.A. assassin John Creasy gives this movie 80% of it's weight.

Wow!! One of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time,"Man on fire, is definitely one of the best drama/crime thrillers I have ever seen. Despite having a slow beginning the story is so amazingly complex and sensitive that it sticks together rather well. This is Denzel Washington's perfect role, in which he plays a body guard, called Creasy that is tormented by his past and is an alcoholic but never gives up on his duty to save his latest protégée, Pita. Dakota Fanning plays Pita, the very smart, enthusiastic little girl that loves so many things, and acts in a very convincing manner, she has a great future ahead of her. As I said the story is somewhat complicated, in order to fully understand it, you must watch it a couple of times.This film is made in two parts, there's the first hour, where everyone is happy, nothing's wrong, everyone's just living their lives happily until the kidnapping of Pita occurs and where Creasy is almost killed. And then there's the second part, the rest of the film, where suddenly everything becomes complicated and somewhat gruesome and disturbing, when Creasy's recovered from his severe injury and starts chasing and killing the numerous criminals and ""La Hermamdad"" that were responsible for the planning and execution of the kidnapping of Pita.Denzel Washington shows us his most up to date acting talents alongside many other talented actors which have a great future ahead of them. It is a real shame that this film hasn't been acknowledged enough, Washington really deserved another Oscar for his performance, and so did Fanning and the director. And even maybe the visual effects which were of very high quality.If you like excellent, slightly deranged, suspenseful thrillers, this is the one to see. The most amazing thing is that elements of this film are actually based on a real story and real characters! 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Everyone has their bad films, and neither of these gentleman can claim this as their 'bad one'.Acting: Everyone did well in this film. Kudos to the little girl, she's a fantastic actor. (Too bad she's aware of that.) I've yet to see Christopher Walken in something really out of his style. Nevertheless, this was good, and he managed well enough with the material he was given. Denzel did what he always does, and that's good enough for now. Mickey Rourke did about what you'd expect as a slick lawyer. The supporting cast was exceptional. I was particularly impressed with the driver of the 'bad guys' car, and the guy from New Jersey.Plot: Well, gee, I don't know. A non-Mexican man in Mexico City walking around in a business suit who is wanted by corrupt officials. Frankly, he stands out like a national monument, and I haven't the experience to say whether this is possible without quick death or not. I didn't see him wearing a bulletproof vest, and anyone can be victim of a good driveby. If a reporter can find him, then so can anyone else who wants to find him badly enough.Script: No problems here. Even the one-liners were delivered with some sense of self-satire.

"Well acted and written, but overtly stylish in cinematography.","Depending upon the story, screenplay and most of all, acting, I could easily give this film 9 out of 10. Released more or less at the same time with a horde of good 'revenge' movies, ""Man on Fire"" shines bright with its linear but bold basic plot, turned into a smart screenplay with measured amounts of action and emotion and with some catchy dialogues as well. Denzel Washington again delivers a powerful performance right from the beginning. Dakota Fanning is indeed a promising starlet, and she developed a unexpectedly nice chemistry with Washington. The supporting cast are also worth mentioning, especially Radha Mitchell whose character changed with a sharp contrast during the course of the film. I personally think the talent of Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke are basically wasted in this film.But the film's technically superior visual style is quite annoyingly overdone, one must say that. I don't mind the use of color filters and high contrast (I even think they're used better than in 'Traffic' too) but what annoyed me is the random use of shaky visionaries and montage-influenced editing which got tiresome after a while. I think Tony Scott is eager to develop his own trademark by using that style but here he could easily avoid its overuse.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

It's getting old. Now he plays the same character, this time named Greasy. Team him up with the charming duo of Christopher Walken and Mickey Rourke and you've got a comedy - only its unintentional.

She speaks like she's 8 going on 48, and that creepy diary? Creepy! Gross!Did anyone else notice that no one was pursuing Greasy? Every explosion scene had him walking in, around or through a giant fireball to save or nab someone, all the while wearing his fancy suits and not breaking a sweat in the hot Mexican sun.

"Buy Man on Fire on DVD, or Denzel will break your legs.","Every once in a while(about once in a decade) a movie comes along that makes what seem like just another film with car explosions and people getting shot full of holes, like an stinky cheese, turn into an true action epic. I will confess something. Man on Fire made me cry like a little schoolgirl. It's an epic and emotional film, that can't do anything besides growing on you. Denzel plays the tough macho bodyguard alcoholic with a harsh past full of regret and death. His client, Samuel, played by Mark Anthony(a surprisingly very good performance, even though I dislike his music) wants him to protect their daughter, Pita(Dakota Fanning) in the harsh Mexico. While their relationship starts off stiff, Denzel can't do nothing but eventually dry up, to the cute and life-happy Pita.But as in any good action movie, the bad guys just can't keep their fingers of the cookie jar. The premise or plot Tony Scotts latest, is nothing new or even surprising, but it's incredible powerful execution makes up for it. Harry Greg-Williams amazing score, helps keeping the movie very intense and deep.This is without a doubt, the best Tony Scott movie ever. With this, he is getting very close to Ridley Scott, who has long mastered the concept of epic films. This is a movie you definitely should be seeing. It has everything you could want.

The supporting cast is also phenomenal. Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning to name but a few all putting in top draw performances. The relationship between Dakota's character and Denzel's makes this film special in my view. Some may call it cliché but I thought it was handled superbly by the actors and Scott's direction.

"Gripping revenge movie, Washington's on fire in this one!","Tony Scott truly delivers the goods with ""Man on Fire"". Having already made the gritty and uncompromising ""Revenge"" some 14 years earlier, Scott takes his contributions to the revenge genre to a whole new level in this excellent thriller.Denzel Washington delivers one of his most powerful performances to date as the world weary retired assassin, Creasy. Through his involvement with the young girl he is paid to protect (Dakota Fanning), he rediscovers his humanity in this moving film.Radha Mitchell is sizzling as Dakota Fanning. In the noughties, Mitchell is definitely one of the silver screen's sexiest leading ladies.This is a great film, full of atmosphere and, as you'd expect from one of the Scott brothers, it's a visual delight.

The Man on Fire is Denzel Washington,"OK, as far as violence, vengeance and virility go, this rivals any Charles Bronson flick.  It also has a grittier ending than the first attempt at filming this novel back in 1987.  (That movie also had a great cast at the time, even though it may have been made in Italy, and was headed by Scott Glenn.  I like Glenn and almost all his work but Denzel Washington brings something extra even to roles that may not be that sparkling.)DW plays the same ""hero"" as in the first film since the two screenplays are based on the same novel.  This one is set in Mexico City, presumably because Latin America now has the kidnapping reputation that Italy once had. Again, the bodyguard Creasy looks after the young daughter of a rich local.  The daughter, of course, brings out the lost humanity of the bodyguard with a past.  Surprisingly, the screen pairing of Washington and the currently ubiquitous Dakota Fanning works, even for a curmudgeon like me.  (I'm sure she is being regularly injected with anti-growth hormones, even as I write this, in order to keep her kid/star power mojo and paychecks at their peak.)Once a kidnapping goes very wrong, Creasy recovers in record time from his wounds and, lacking any other avenue than just returning to his formerly empty life, goes on a meticulous journey of revenge/vigilante justice.  It is implied here, as in the previous film, that this is the only justice available and, therefore, justified in its way.  This justification is validated by a brave reformer reporter and a high police official (the Italian Giancarlo Giannini, coincidentally) who seems to have no other way to fight the widespread corruption in the police and the kidnapping-as-business of organized crime.  More entertaining help is provided by old comrade-in-arms or comrade-in-atrocities, Christopher Walken.  He underplays here, but it is true as Roger Ebert, I believe, once said that he enlivens a movie just by showing up!Objections?  Mercy or due process are missing altogether and some could argue that it reinforces racist or elitist approaches to justice by a lone American.  There may be some truth to this but given the set up of the plot, novel and movie, the people Creasy hunts down are about as mundanely evil as it comes and as well-protected in official circles as they can be. (Essentially the same situation is propounded in the 1987 film in Italy so the same arguments would have to be made there, as well.)  The movie is lengthy, especially when you divine very early the identities and motives of some of the ""surprise"" bad guys.  No, I'm not giving anything away.  What do you think when you see Mickey Rourke as a lawyer?!  If you were watching almost anyone but Denzel Washington during all this time, you might begin to tire.

Lost Under Avalanche of Bad Production,"Man on Fire is a good movie who's story is lost among bad lines, horrible camera work and some of the worst subtitling I have ever seen. Bad subtitling? Yeah you're laughing now. wait till you see the movie.First off the script leaves something to be desired. Despite being predictable, during a handful of key lines you can almost feel the actors asking themselves, `Seriously, would this person really be talking like this?' The good part is that the long drawn out dialog takes away from the horrible camera work.The cinematography for this movie was simple. Buy a grainy film (probably EXR), zoom in really close and shake the camera like your sitting on a vibrating bed. Don't get me wrong the raw, gritty look can be cool if you do it right (Example: Amores Perros, 25th Hour, 21 Grams) but when you over do it, you start to have problems. And Man on Fire is way over done.To make matters worse, for some reason the maniacal editor (or whoever) found it necessary to go do hallucinogens while they were subtitling. Granted the movie takes place in Mexico City, so naturally there is subtitling for the Spanish. Then the subtitling gets a little bit fancier. words don't appear until they're said. Alright no harm done. Then for some reason they decided to start subtitling the English. Yes an English movie subtitled in English. I can only imagine a deaf person having to watch double the subtitles because the editor thought it would be artsy if half-way through the movie he started subtitling in his own language. Just when you think it can't get any worse, it does. the subtitles start changing font, sizes and start reacting to what the people on screen are saying. It hits a breaking point when Denzel's character, Creasy, starts shouting and the subtitles take up the whole screen.

Mexican grit with a Hollywood ending,"Man on fire is the story of Creasy (Washington), an alcoholic ex-agency man living with the demons of his violent working past and trying to find solitude at the bottom of a bottle. He is offered work by a friend and ex-college(Walken)to be a Bodyguard for a family in Mexico city and reluctantly agrees. The first act of the movie is a slow burning story of the relationship between Creasy and Pita, the young daughter of the family he protects. This part of the movie was always going to risk being cheesy as Creasy forms a warm bond with Pita and starts lowering some of the barriers he has to the outside world. The movie, however, deals with the relationship without being cheesy, mainly due to a superb performance by Washington. The first act ends with Pita being Kidnapped and Creasy left shot & injured. From here on, the movie keeps it simple and goes into revenge mode. Creasy hunts down everyone linked to the kidnapping and this ultimately leads to the major plot twist at the end of the second act. The second act, like the first, is excellent and prevents itself from slipping into boring routine because of the performance by Washington. The problem, however, arises in the final act where a typically Hollywood plot point prevents this Urban-noir movie from having the ending it deserves.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Amazing, absolutely AMAZING","This movie blew me away; however not the first time I saw it, I had to watch it twice to truly appreciate the message and the power of this film. Maybe I wasn't fully paying attention or maybe I was too young at the time but I am so glad that I watched it again.If ever there was perfect casting for a motion picture then this would be it! Denzel Washington is unbelievably believable, (then again when is he not believable) and even though Christopher Walken's part is small in this you don't forget him as he helps to develop the story and make Washington's character even more electrifying. Also the supporting cast is more than solid with Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell putting in very strong performances, with Mickey Rourke also worth a mention. However, this is all eclipsed by the youngest member of the cast, Dakota Fanning, who is indescribable as Pita. The chemistry between Washington ans Fanning shines off the screen and you laugh when they laugh, and cry when they cry.The direction is expertly done, but with such films as ""Enemy of the State"" and ""Crimson Tide"" perfection is what should be expected from a director like Tony Scott. There are scenes around 2-5 mins long with no dialogue and just Denzel Washington on screen that are captivating; a testament to the skills of Scott and Washington, which come together with brilliant results.It might not be everyone's cup of tea with vivid violence and quite long at 146 mins, but in my opinion it has to have these things to make it the masterpiece that it is. If you like a film that really paints the picture before ripping it up in your face with twists and turns that will leave you with your jaw on the floor then this is the film for you. This film has so much to it that if I said anymore I would probably end up spoiling parts of it for you.This is one of the few films that has brought a tear to my eye and that was because you care so much for the characters. I think this film has been highly underrated but hopefully it will get recognised for its heart and for the excellence that oozes from the screen on every level.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
great movie!!!!!!!!,"I get teased all the time by family and friends for my tears over movies, and they were not disappointed when I watched this one. I cried numerous times but believe me it was not over sappiness. I ached for the family and I ached for this man as he tried to redeem himself the only way he knew how. Denzel was fabulous as always, and so was Chris Walkin. Mickey Rourke, I did not even recognized though; the years have not been kind to him. My husband is not one to re-watch movies unless they are historically accurate war movies(snore!!!!) He has watched this movie 5 times now and I am going to have to get the DVD to watch it again because he has worn out the tape and it jumped the whole time I was watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Above the usual Denzel Washington vehicle,"There's no denying it, Man on Fire clearly thinks that it's a better film than it is. Tony Scott has obviously tried to make this film appeal to both sets of audiences; namely, those who want to be entertained, and those who want to see 'greatness'. It's safe to say that he hasn't exactly succeeded with this; although it's also safe to say that the movie isn't a complete failure. The film works by presenting two very different halves. We start off with a Leon-esquire plot involving a bodyguard hired to protect a young girl, which then bursts into revenge thriller mode after she is kidnapped. The first half of the movie will appeal more to the 'Oscar' crowd, while the second half is more bent on providing entertainment. I wouldn't say either half is better; the first half is interesting, although it lacks emotion, and the second half is thrilling; but goes out of it's way to show flashy images and Denzel Washington being as nasty as possible. Still, the first half of the film does an excellent job of setting up the second; and considering this is a blockbuster, it's more emotional than you would expect.I've never been a big fan of Denzel Washington, and it's seems more and more lately that all of his movies are merely vehicles for the 'Oscar winner'. Still, he usually puts in a performance worth watching, and he certainly does that here. Washington's starring role also has the added advantage of the fact that he looks the part he is playing, making the film more believable. Man on Fire has implemented a different way of using subtitles than most films, with the words flashing up all over the screen. I don't usually like gimmicky things like this, but it actually works rather well in this film. Tony Scott is a director that I have come to expect nothing from, as his films are usually made purely for entertainment value, and sometimes don't even deliver that; but Man on Fire is one of his better films over the last few years (although he still hasn't topped 1993's True Romance). The ending of the film is particularly good, and surprisingly emotional as well. I'm not the sort of guy that cries at movies; but I could understand if other people did. On the whole; this isn't a great movie, but it's decent enough and definitely worth viewing. It could have done with being a little shorter, though.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Solid Film That Wasted Its Potential,"The slow pacing of this film really works in the first stretch, where character relationships are built and the audience invested. Everyone involved sells the set-up so perfectly you can't wait to see what happens in the second half, and that's why the film is something of a let down.Without spoiling too much, this is a revenge film and the pacing and direction of the revenge section of the story just feels too unfocused to be really engaging. Action sequences are marred by choppy, detached, dream-like effects, and Washington's character seems to float between violent events like an invincible ghost. This leads to a lack of dramatic tension for a long portion of the film, until, admittedly, it saves itself with an excellent and deeply moving ending.I'd say the main problem with Man on Fire is, strangely, a lack of excitement and stakes. What should have been a nail-biting thrill ride becomes... almost boring in places.But that's just one section of the film and, as a whole, it works well enough due to the strong emotions evoked at the beginning and during the ending, and due to brilliant performances by Washington, Walken and, especially, Dakota Fanning.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Masterpiece,"Tony Scott's Man on Fire brings a whole new movie concept, mixed with excellent graphic design and outstanding close face camera, which explains psychological state of all characters. Washington role was amazing, character who's not a saint but a man stucked in wrong time at wrong place, no rules for him except his owns. Walken and Giannini, well as everyone expected were outstanding. Little Dakota was surprising as always, and all I can say is that very bright future is ahead of her movie career.Being a stranger everywhere you go can left man without hope, but when he finally founds a new one, they blow it away... than there is nothing else but a payback... man on fire...Masterpiece !",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Too raw for my taste,"You really need a strong stomach to see this movie. Many movies have violence but this one has it in ""spades"". Normal human beings feel revulsion over killing and everything in this movie is focused to make you feel that revulsion and that's my point: The director has gone too far in emphasizing the killing. There were at least 16 people killed including one particularly gruesome scene where several fingers and an ear were amputated.The plot is simple: Denzel Washington is hired to protect a 10 year old girl, Dakota Fanning, from kidnapping. Despite his best efforts, the little girl is kidnapped. Washington takes his revenge by killing all the kidnappers.Any adult, but especially parents, immediately understand Washington's rage over the kidnapping and his obsessive desire for revenge: Washington tracks down and eliminates all the kidnappers, one by one. His methods however, are brutal beyond description and that's what is so hard to stomach, at least for me.The acting is acceptable. Dakota Fanning is charming as a 10 year old. I would have liked to see Washington emote just a bit more. He shows his natural warmth only in scenes with Fanning. The two actors who play the parents, Marc Anthony and Radha Mitchell, are deserving of special mention. Their roles were not large but they filled them admirably.I didn't feel that I could give this movie more than a 5 because of the excess and florid violence.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Review of ""Man on Fire""","This is an excellent, heartbreaking movie. It is by far the best I've seen that depicts the current reality in Latin America...kidnappings, corruption, ruthless and greedy police officials and heartless mayhem towards innocent victims. Denzel Washinton gives the most moving performance in his career, in my opinion. Dakota Fanning is an amazing young actress. The relationship between Washington and Fanning is wonderfully written and portrayed, I believed every minute. The cast is brilliant, Christopher Walken, Mickey Rourke are great as always. Walken lights up the screen for me like no other actor. I would have loved to see more of both of them. The authentic locations are remarkable. The camera work is interesting and different. There are many famous Latin actors in the cast, making it all the more interesting for people familiar with Latin American cinema. I highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
It was an ok movie nothing great!,Well I came into this movie with very little expectations and knowledge over the basic plot. Unlike the other movies which were heavily promoted this one came in with a little hype and fanfare.I was rather surprised that they would actually pair up the talented Denzel Washington with the promising Dakota Fanning. But it was quite a pleasant team up.I feel that Fanning has continued to grow as an actress ever since I first saw her in an episode of CSI.Denzel being Denzel as usual chose a rather dark character torn by his past and present obligations. At first your see a no nonsense all business man with hints of hurt because of his past. The he becomes a warmer person as he bonds with his ward. Soon of curse we see him change again to this intense and ruthless man bent on revenge. That's what's so good about Denzel is that he is able to easily convert form one character trait to another. I just wish that he would try to get other roles and quit with all this dark characters.I actually found the choreography good at times especially in flashbacks.I did however found the subtitles a little distracting especially when they would jump up in the middle of a conversation.Also there were quite a few characters which I felt was rather unimportant and were placed in there just to fill in some minutes. Walken's role a fine example of such a character.The score was okay but the acapela female voices were not that effective relative to Ridley Scott's Gladiator.Overall it was a good film from director Ridley Scott. Pretty much worth your money,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Bodyguard on duty..,"I love this movie! It's got enough everything.. Action, Drama, Thriller... You name it.. it's got it! Denzel is better than ever! I've seen Training day. I liked it but this one was better. This one is truly himself. Okay okay it's a bit brutal and violent but in this movie it's very necessary. The movie shows how you'd react if something like this would happen to you. You want revenge..! The hardest way you can have it!! In the movie bodyguard Greasy who's become drunk and suicidal finds the meaning of life trough a little girl. He notices that life isn't that bad after all. Until one day.. She gets kidnapped! All his rage comes out of him and bodies start dropping. I think that this would actually work in true life. Because when you've lost something very important and you're willing to give your life for it you do it! In the movie Greasy starts bloody war against the whole underworld and finally destroys every single bad guy. I've heard a lot of negative comment because of the end of the movie when Greasy dies but that fits in this one. He gave his life for what he believed in and finally found peace!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Wrecked 'im?  Blew 'im to pieces, Miss""","Denzel Washington is a fine actor but, for me, he's at his weakest when playing villains (American Gangster), or troubled, moody men as he does here. That's not to say he doesn't give a good performance, but he wouldn't have been my choice for the part of John Creasey, a disillusioned, borderline alcoholic former agent who takes a job as bodyguard to the daughter of a wealthy young Mexican man and his American wife. The Mexican guy isn't as wealthy as many people believe, which is why he employs Creasey, a choice he comes to regret when little Pita (Dakota Fanning) is predictably kidnapped.Man on Fire isn't exactly a forthcoming film, releasing information to the viewer on a strictly need-to-know basis (if that). As far as I'm aware, we never find out how Creasey came by the wounds on the back of his hand that Scott's cameraman seems so fascinated by, nor much about why he is so troubled in the film's early stages. It's almost as if a whole chunk of back story has been unceremoniously dumped in an attempt to trim down a running time which, at nearly two-and-a-half-hours, is still twenty minutes too long.Creasey develops a close relationship with his precocious little charge (Fanning's character is eight-going-on-forty-five) which is over-played a little immediately before her abduction, and he is overcome with a murderous desire for vengeance when he awakens from a coma to discover the handover of the ransom money was botched and she has been murdered. Before you can say 'superhero' Creasey is ignoring the two bullet wounds he has recently suffered and running around Mexico City knocking off members of the shadowy organisation he discovers are responsible for her death.This is an entertaining enough film, and the plot holes aren't too irritating, even though one of the twists is fairly predictable. I was definitely entertained as I watched, and the lengthy running time only started to tell in the last reel as the film seemed to struggle to tie up all its loose ends. Scott's edgy style of direction works very well at some points but smacks of 'look at me' self-satisfaction at other times and, as is so often the case, the flashy direction merely serves to distance the viewer from the story as we focus on all the jigging about the picture is doing (when I was a kid we'd have had the TV repairman out to some of the stuff that's going on here.) The story itself becomes less of a study of one man's slow descent into self-destruction (which isn't really that interesting anyway) and more of a straightforward action-revenge movie following Creasey's emergence from his coma – which is probably when most of the target audience will perk up.Creasey's methods of execution are certainly imaginative: I'm pretty sure that never before in the history of cinema has a character suffered death by 'bum bomb' before so Man on Fire can give itself a little 'pat' on the back for that one, although personally I can't imagine any injustice great enough to compel me to consider going anywhere near another man's bottom to seek revenge. I've got to admit that, for one mad moment, I did think that was going to be the movie's final twist, judging by how gingerly Denzel hobbled over that bridge to meet his fate, but thankfully it wasn't to be.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Excellent movie!,"Man on Fire is the ultimate ""revenge/justice"" movie. Personally, if the rating depended on me I'd give it a 10 out of 10. Many would argue that perhaps the movie was too depressing, because John W. Creasy dies in the end. This is definitely a tragedy, but shows more realism: The good guy doesn't always come out on top. The acting is flawless, and the characters fit their parts perfectly. I loved the film style and it was only surpassed by the soundtrack. The jumpy, edgy movements of the camera and the unnatural colors, along with the music, clashed in an inexplicable way. Harry Gregson-Williams was most definitely the right choice for the music composer. This movie is an essential part of anyone's DVD collection.

Jesús Ochoa (a very bad guy) did good. Gero Camilo (someone's brother) did really good acting too. Overall, good American and Mexican cast.The plot is great from start to finish.

Remake of an Italian 80s drama. (SPOILERS),"The style of 'Man on Fire' is at times annoying. With consistent zooming, scanning, and bleaching, it is more like watching a music video and at times, like a series of movie previews. For a story like this, the attempt to be avante garde, seems wasted, and at times detracts from the story itself as you try to slow down your brain to catch up with what is going on. The film-making tries to be too cutting edge while the movie itself, the story and it's characters, are really nothing new, and not accommodating for these techniques.It certainly doesn't do much to help establish mood. And what's worse, though this may be considered ""cutting edge"" techniques, it seems to be quite cliché.'Man on Fire' is for me, among the better of recent releases, particularly because it recognizes the importance of relationship to it's characters. I have seen far too many action movies where characters fail to recognize the immediacy and the emergency of the situation, even though their adversaries promise swift death if they choose to interfere.The story goes like this: Former counter-intelligence, Creasy (Denzel Washington) is an alcoholic drifter who is hired as a bodyguard for the daughter (Dakota Fanning who plays 'Pita') of a man (Marc Anthony) who's family fortune is depleting fast. (Unforunately, the opening sequence gives away too much about the impending story, including it's sabateurs).Pita, played naturally by Fanning, gives Creasy a sense of purpose and eases his persistent loneliness, something that once influenced his alcoholism and suicide attempts. He no longer becomes just her bodyguard, but he becomes more like a surrogate father and a best friend. Her parents seem to be out of the picture in her life, or at least not willing to listen to her, most of the time.The movie centers on a kidnapping. Pita informs Creasy earlier that there were 24 kidnappings in Mexico City last week (where the story takes place), 4 kidnappings a day. The swift opening credits of the movie probably place fear (at least in us impressionable American audiences) about traveling or living there if we have young children, as they inform you of the formidable statistics: 70% of those children kidnapped are usually not recovered. Yep, it gives you the air of Santa Carla (you know...""The Lost Boys"").Soon enough, Pita, too is kidnapped. And Creasy, broken over his inability to prevent it--being terribly shot in the process--and over her death, which the kidnappers inform her parents of after the ransom drop goes foul.Like a Samurai avenging the death of his master, Creasy, feeling such remorse for the loss of his best friend, an innocent nine year old girl, vows revenge upon all those involved. I suppose that makes this movie much more violent than a Quentin Tarentino production, considering the creative ways that Creasy kills the minions to get to the top.And he's not dealing with a bunch of amateurs. Those behind the kidnapping are actually a heavily protected gang of corrupt cops who head the department that investigates kidnappings, of all things. With the help of a vigilante reporter (a rare breed of journalists, of course), a high level detective who suspects corruption, and a determined friend (Christopher ""I'm in at least one scene of every movie"" Walken), Creasy is going straight to the top to bring them all down.There's a continuous role of religion in this movie, which I find to be quite annoying, but may be appropriate given that it is set in Catholic Mexico City. Creasy asks his friend, Rayburn (Christopher Walken) whether he thinks there is any place for God in the work that they do. Towards the end, while still in the process of revenge, Creasy says something like God can do with them what he wants, but he just delivers them to Him. It wouldn't matter what God thought, because any inclination of that might stop Creasy from proceeding and that to him, may be like giving up on Pita in the end, someone that he was so strongly committed to.One viewer commented how there is not much action going on in this movie, which is pretty much true. After seeing it, I had thought it was a decent 'action' movie (for lack of a better word), but in retrospect, it does seem to be lacking the qualities that would make it much better, let alone just 'pretty good'.That is, Denzel's character, Creasy, seems to just walk along and get his revenge with little or no resistance or pursuit from the kidnappers and their clan--though at the end, he does have to finally do some negotiating (number one rule of action movies: the last boss is always the hardest to defeat). Creasy in a sense, driven by his commitment to Pita, appears invincible. Number two rule of action movies: invincible characters do not make a very interesting story because it lacks all the competition that drives the suspense. And this is a necessary element, considering the entire second half of the movie is dependent upon it (the first half focuses on Creasy's development and his relationship with the young girl).In the end, it seems pretty wasteful considering the potential of your cast--Denzel Washington, Christopher Walken, Dakota Fanning, and hell, even a good-looking Mickey Rourke. Perhaps, more attention should have been given to the story instead of trying to woo audiences with music video production techniques.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
stunning acting and high powered action,"This is not a brainless revenge movie, you begin by being introduced to the characters, with the outstanding acting talents of Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken. Director Tony Scott does a brilliant job at making you feel for the main characters all most immediately. Once introduced to the gifted young Dakota Fanning, you can already see the contrast between her happy character and that of the drunken Denzel Washington. The time spent without action, but where Denzel and Dakota are becoming familiar lasts over an hour but it is clear that Denzel has feelings for his bodyguard subject. When Dakota Fanning is taken, we see a magnificent shoot out between Washington and the kidnappers before Washington finally falls. From then on you see the heavily dismayed Denzel easing his way through the bad guys, killing them off one by one. But does he get what he wants?Man on Fire also shows the acting brilliance of an old legend in the shape of Sin Cities very own Mickey Rourke. Another familiar face is that of Rhada Mitchell famous for playing the wife of Collin Farrell in Phone Booth. But Man On Fire isn't just a small revenge picture with Jean-Claude Van Damme it includes brilliant acting from the offset, and a subtle emotional outlook.In my opinion Denzel should have had an Academy Award for this.

Excellent rapport between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning - interesting film-making techniques too,"Man on Fire is set in Mexico, where kidnapping is an industry  there's one every six hours. Denzel Washington is John Creasy, a burned-out ex-CIA assassin who gets a job as bodyguard to a little girl through an old friend, Christopher Walken.Gradually the alcoholic Creasy rediscovers life as he befriends Pita (Dakota Fanning) and coaches her in swimming. But when Pita's kidnapped, Creasy snaps, hunting down everyone that profited from the kidnapping, with the help of her mother (Aussie Radha Mitchell), a cop (Giancarlo Giannini) and a journalist.Man on Fire is a classic revenge thriller, almost Western-like in its moral simplicity. Although there is the odd cliché, it is a disquieting, atmospheric film, thanks to a committed performance from Washington and a strong supporting cast.Of particular interest are the camera techniques used by director Tony Scott (Enemy of the State, Spy Game) and director of photography Paul Cameron (Swordfish, Gone in Sixty Seconds). They hand-cranked the camera to speed up or slow down movement, used reversal stock to make the colours brighter and shot the film at varying levels of quality, which all serve to increase overall tension and gain insight into Creasy's extreme headspace.Although there's a slightly weak ending, 24's Jack Bauer would definitely approve. ***½/***** stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great - Not Great,"I cant't make just one comment on this film. In one way, it's a great movie, in another way it isn't. The first part is the best.

If the violence-part had been a bit turned down, I would have given the film my applaud. Sadly, there is to much violence for my taste. I understand the use of violence, but it's just not working for me. But as I said earlier, I liked the first part. Denzel is a great actor. Same with Dakota Fanning as a little grownup ladygirl. More questionable is Mark Anthony. But he's OK -. See for yourself. It's a watchable movie. Maby you will like all the heavy violence.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Over-indulgent mess,"The first 50 minutes or so of this film are pretty decent as we see Creasy (Denzel Washington) getting to know Pita (Dakota Fanning), the kid he's guarding. The excessive direction by Tony Scott is tolerable until then because the Creasy-Pita story is engaging.But then the film unravels completely. Scott, who apparently has no interest whatsoever in maintaining a shot longer than a few seconds, over-directs to the point of it being utterly annoying and ridiculous. The excessive jump cuts and flashy cinematography (which really doesn't work here) become more than mere distractions. Scott might be trying to prove he can evoke the film-making styles of, say, ""21 Grams,"" ""City of God"" or even Soderbergh's ""Traffic,"" but here it just comes off as over-indulgent. What exactly is Scott trying to prove or express when he not only provides English subtitles for Spanish dialogue, but also has English subtitles when the characters speak English?It's hard to imagine Brian Helgeland, who did such a terrific job adapting Dennis Lehane's novel ""Mystic River"" for Clint Eastwood, penned this adapted screenplay, too - another revenge story. But whereas ""Mystic River"" packed an emotional wallop with believable characters, ""Man on Fire"" just has characters going through the motions. There's nothing here to keep us hooked. That might be Scott's, not Helgeland's, fault. Under the guidance of another director, someone who cares more about story and less about style, this might have turned into a gripping film.Washington tries hard to rise above the thin material with which he's working. Fanning does an admirable job, too. She's cute, likable and definitely clicks in her scenes with Washington. Giancarlo Giannini and Rachel Ticotin build a nice chemistry between them, but none of the actors in this muddled mess is able to overcome the rather tepid story.The film is about 50 minutes too long. Toward the end, this film really begins to drag. There are twists to the plot, but many can be anticipated long before they happen. As for one very crucial twist, not only is it predictable, but it doesn't make much sense if you think about it carefully, especially if you consider how parents might normally behave.""Man on Fire"" just winds up being a nasty, noisy exercise masquerading as stylish filmmaking. If you want to enjoy Washington, you're better off renting ""Glory,"" ""Much Ado About Nothing"" or ""Malcolm X.""There must have been something in this script that attracted Washington to this movie. What that is, I haven't the foggiest idea. He might want to be a bit more discriminating about the roles he picks. Though, the trailers shown at the screening I attended included Washington in ""The Manchurian Candidate."" What would possess someone, Jonathan Demme included, to remake that masterpiece and set it in contemporary times is beyond me.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gritty and unnerving tale of revenge and redemption,"This movie is not for the queasy among us. There is quite a bit of violence in this picture - hence the R rating.I'm typically not a fan of movies that overdo violence - but make an exception if it is tied to a good story that seems to justify such a harsh reaction. Usually the way a movie gets the viewers sympathies is to tie it to an injustice to a child. Who among us doesn't detest the harming of a child. (In this case, I find it similar to another Denzel film, JOHN Q)Add to that a sympathetic anti-hero. A former special ops assassin in the character of John Creasy, played so beautifully by Denzel Washington. He has done such horrible things in his past that he resorts to drinking excessively to be able to live with himself. He takes the job as Pita's bodyguard almost unwillingly, but soon grows fond of her, in spite of his best efforts to remain detached. He is devastated when he fails to protect her and determines to seek revenge on all involved - and to at last redeem himself from his failures. Denzel has a unique ability to gain audience sympathies - he is the quintessential ""everyman"" that we all can relate to. I'm not sure Tom Cruise or Bruce Willis ( all considered for the role) could have accomplished this nearly as successfully.I have to say the director did an amazing job of capturing the mood and atmosphere of the story and the time and the place. What stands out most is the cinematography that utilizes the hyper camera work - with the shaky, hand-held shots and the jumping cuts and editing. It keeps you on guard and not knowing what is going to happen next. It frames a world that is out of control and you feel it.I loved some of the dialogue and there are some great one-liners in this film: ""A bullet never lies - it always tells the truth""; ""Revenge is a meal best served cold""; ""Forgiveness is between them and God...My job is to arrange the meeting""; ""Creasy's art is death, and he is about to paint his masterpiece.""Dakota Fanning as Pita was simply amazing. The fact that she was only 9 at the time of filming blows my mind. She is quite a natural talent, and has proved she has staying power so far. She and Denzel shared a great chemistry between them.The music was a great addition to the film and had one of the most varied selections I've heard. Some of the more unusual choices was a Spanish version of ""Hey Mickey"", Linda Ronstadt's ""Blue Bayou"", as well as the beautifully haunting music that is the same as heard in ""Gladiator"" by Lisa Gerrard. The classical pieces by Chopin and ""Claire de Lune"" by Debussy were unusual choices but worked - I think it helped to give the movie a sympathetic heart to contrast with the violence. ""Una Palabra"" was also a stand out piece and had an eerie and tragic sound - even though I couldn't understand a word.This is a movie that at times will not only saturate your senses, but also assault them. I guarantee it is not a film you will soon forget.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Superb,"Best film of the Year without doubt was my first thought when I saw this on DVD and my opinion hasn't change.Everyone has already mentioned the flawless Washington, Fanning, and Walken, and I don't feel I need to add anything further.What I would like to share is my view on the direction that I felt was first class. I have seen several reviews that don't share the same view.The direction, cinematography is amazing. The camera angles, fuzziness, shakyness all potray a hot humid, corrupt, modern day world. It portrays Creasy's struggle with the drink, at times you feel the intoxication, the blurryness through the camera shots. It is very effective. I don't feel it detracts from the film at all, in fact I feel it adds to the overall 'feel' of the film. It was correctly placed. Locations are shot wonderfully, and I can say after a recent trip to Latin America it appeared to capture the feel of the continent very well.Was pleasantly surprised as I did not watch the film at the cinema due to indifferent reviews, and so glad reviewers on here loved it and so do my friends who have seen it as well.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Good plot, but no flashy photography PLEASE!!!","Man on Fire has a good interesting plot.  The movie is well acted, but typically flashback photography makes it difficult to understand what is going on.  I guess directors and/or screenwriters do that for the artsy effect.  I would like to see them watch a movie (other than their own) full of flashbacks and give a good accounting of the movie.  This movie, in addition to the flashbacks, had some kind of flash photography where the camera was jerking all around (apparently intentionally) making it difficult to tell what was happening, even when the script wasn't flashing back.  I look forward to the day when directors and/or screenwriters again start making movies for the audience to understand, not psychedilic movies that they make for pure visual art.  They will again be much more interesting and comprehendible than many of today's movies, Man on Fire included.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not flawless, but more then watchable","Despite the film's predictability, thanks to Denzel Washington's presence, it manages to stay interesting throughout. 
A typical revenge story here, with Denzel playing a mysterious bodyguard, who, seeking redemption for his past sins, accepts a job offer to guard rich parents' (Radha Mitchell and Marc Anthony) daughter named Lupita (Dakota Fanning) in the midst of a highly active kidnapping the rich kids season in Mexico City. 
What makes this film standout from amongst it's genre peers is the level of intensity, which isn't lowered from beginning to end, with a few minor coffee breaks here and there. 
It is well acted, with Washington stealing the show with his portrayal of this complex character, with barely any backstory, but still interesting enough to root for. The supporting cast consisting of such well-established names in Hollywood as Christopher Walker and Mickey Rourke felt kinda misused, and their screen time is extremely short. Especially Rourke. With his charisma, there could have been so much more to his lawyer character then we got. 
I absolutely loved direction and effective editing, with it all being flavored by an awesome soundtrack. 
The plot, though, could have been better structured then it is done here. The antagonist is an empty space. As sad as it sounds. I did not buy into the whole ""plot twist"" either. The script just seemed unfinished, as if it was completed as they were going. 
Overall, the film is more then watchable. The ending is surprisingly satisfying, and the production is top notch. But the story and it's main concept was a huge ditch, leaving much to be desired. I'm scoring it 7/10. It's a great film, but could have been so much better.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"You Know It Will Be Good When Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken Are In It,","Man on Fire is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant cast.I had to see this movie when I found out Denzel Washington and Christopher Walken were in it,their both unbelievably good actors that always put a tone of heart into their performances.I only had two problems with this movie,first is that Christopher Walken wasn't in it enough,his character should have had a much more important role,you wouldn't want to waist the kind of talent he has,and I also didn't like how they subtitled certain times when the person was speaking English,I know they did to show how important that sentence was,but if your listening to the movie there isn't any need for that,I just found it irritating.The movie is action packed towards the second half,and its also very violent,I thought it was brilliant,but you shouldn't watch it if your sensitive to that kind of stuff.I would highly recommend Man on Fire to all fans of Denzel Washington and Tony Scott.Joyhn Creasy (Denzel Washington),a CIA assassin turned bodyguard teams up with a crusading journalist to take on a Mexican kidnapping ring to save the girl he was hired to protect.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

This movie was extremely violent. A sharp contrast to the great, yet imperfect, justice system we have. It concerns me to see any one person taking justice into their own hands.Finally I don't understand the context of trg1971s comments about George Bush.

Denzel goes killing yet again - at least there's a supporting cast,"On first impressions, ""Man on Fire"" has the all the hallmarks of another Denzel Washington revenge story: a larger-than-life, repentant mercenary atoning for past sins by helping those he encounters.This is actually only half the story here - devoted character development and a breakout role for Dakota Fanning give a more personal touch, creating a more emotionally charged (if slightly unbelievable) world on the streets of Mexico.Denzel has donned this role many a time, but here plays a man who additionally struggles with drink and he does with demons.His assignment - bodyguard to a wealthy family's enigmatic and fearless daughter - is marred by the ever-rising threat of kidnap in Mexico City. The daughter's presence is what anchors Denzel, and I think her performance is the standout (the mother is also good, albeit with less screen time).You can smell a vengeful Denzel a mile off, and he does fall into the same old tropes; at least the change of venue switches things up a little. He plays the role well, I will concede, but that alone doesn't draw me in, nor does the ideal of a virtually unkillable adversary.I think the environment should have been utilised far more, expanding on the beauty of Mexico, rather than curtailing it within an ordinary city block. This oversight is compounded by the horrible epilsepy-inducing quickshot technique used throughout, a disjointed way of making anxiety palpable (but not to the benefit of the viewer).The story isn't completely linear (affording a twist or two in the tale), but again, revenge flicks just don't do enough beneath the violence to really hold my attention. ""Man on Fire"" isn't a bad film, but there's a reason I don't hear about it - it does nothing different.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Dakota F does a fantastic job especially in her connection to Washington. Frankly all the characters deliver.

The definition of cool,"Okay, so the plot wasn't anything new and I guessed what the big twist at the end was going to be after only less than an hour into the movie but this was an interesting film.

I loved Denzel's character and I hope he chooses to do more roles along these lines in the future. However Marc Anthony is a horrible actor and he looks as good as he acts...how he gets movie deals is a concept way beyond my understanding. Radha Mitchell did a good job and is hot except for that bump right between her eyebrows (it is very distracting)! Christopher Walken had some awesome parts and Mickey Rourke actually didn't appear like a scumbag for once as he dressed up and bathed (both foreign concepts to him).

Superb action film with a running sociological analysis and redemption story.,"Leave your reason behind and get carried away by this relentless movie of another ""justice whatever the cost"" ""enforcer"", but this time, well filmed, acted, and with a woman that can hold a gun. And without any unnecessary ""love interest"". Which was your favourite scene? Mine was the moment before ""crossing the bridge"" near the end *(can't say more for obvious reasons). Like in Gladiator, but probably creating far better empathy for it's more related to ""something we could all eventually do"". The scene with ""Fuentes"" (the Mexican chief of the brotherhood) is also very good, even funny in a sick sort of way. The kind of image you remember long after the film is gone. The script is perfect, just following Poe's ""rule"" of ""not one word in vain"". Thanks to Amazon I just learnt the auteur is Brian Helgeland (Mystic River, L.A. Confidential). A good story can make or break a movie, no better proof than this one! Unlike in Gladiator, here our hero has a black past to expiate, no family to be lost and then revenged. He's got to overcome himself. As the film presupposes a religious view, we sort of know how things have to turn out. Notice the importance of religion: Casey's knowledge by heart of the Bible, and even Samuel's plush sanctuary at his home, full of candles, obviously built for bargaining with the Guadalupana Virgin.The fight at the shanty town is VERY real. The film is not (where did all the dwellers go? How did the dirty copper get caught by a single man?) but we don't want "" reality principle"" to be part of our films, right :)? Characters: Casey, a ""philosophical copper"" who can learn to feel sorry for something external to himself steals the movie, the rest of characters are just filling up space, making things happen. He's no dumb killing machine, notice how he deals with ""Samuel"" among others. G. Giannini plays a small yet pivotal role. Pita is lovable, but doesn't overdo it or get sticky. Such gift for acting is rarely seen. Lisa is ethereal but not as stupid as we'd expect from her stereotyped role. Walken and Rourke act as naturally as we breathe.""Sociology"": Daniel Sanchez ""family first"", Lisa's passivity & machismo and the whole contrast between the isolated ultra rich and the numerous very poor is what sets this film apart from Chuck Norris, Stallone, Van Damme and all the other blockbusters with the same disregard for ""society"" and good taste. The phrase: ""I-I'm a professional"" shows how when the system is corrupt, no individual action could bring lasting change. I think for those of us who inhabit a third world country, this film just shows the future, if not the present if we open our eyes.Director: Judging from his filmography, this is definitely Tony Scott's Masterpiece! It's hard to believe somebody who made films from Spy Game downwards could achieve something really well done but it's good to remain open minded. Luckily I didn't pay attention to who the director was when I saw it, I humbly recommend the viewer to to the same. I suspect the brothers mustn't be very nice people ""Philosophically"" this film is of course dangerous: ""Justice by your own hands"" leads to an anomic society, and probably even a corrupt state is relatively better than ""might makes right"" alla Thrasymachus (Plato's Republic's). Jeff Shannon on Amazon is as usually accurate: ""both repellently violent and viscerally absorbing"". What glues all together: Music is fine (I couldn't help crying in the end), moving but not overbearing. Photography is just the best, finding beauty where there is none. Edition is alluring but a bit overdone, ""it borrows heavily from MTV videos"" as ""Flagrant-Baronessa"" on IMDb writes on another of Tony's lesser films, ""Domino"".Remember: ""there's no such thing as tough"".The sheep that got lost.PS: By the way, this film ""endures a 2nd viewing"" as J. L. Borges would quip. In fact I just saw it for the third time on air TV, dubbed into Spanish, and I also felt for Casey, so I guess this proves what a good product it is.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

When it finally does move, it takes an awkward half roll and comes to a stop, stuck forever. You have no reason to care for the characters and are left waiting desperately for some death and destruction to goad you from the stupor you will find yourself in.

Not bad but bring the motion sickness pills.,"""Man on Fire"" is a remake of a movie from back in the 80's.  Never did see it but I'm guessing it's nothing quite like this. John Creasy is a Jack Daniels swilling,down-and-out former CIA assassin who just happens to come across an old colleague, Rayburn (Christopher Walken) while in Mexico. Rayburn gets Creasy a job as a bodyguard for a businessman's daughter Pita (Dakota Fanning).  If you've seen the trailers, you probably know what happens next. After the first 50 minutes of quiet banter between Creasey and Pita, the movie dissolves into a loud, out-for-blood revenge movie.  This change of pace is fine at first, but couldn't make sense of the direction after that, when the killing starts.  Between the herky-jerky camera styles and washed out colors, it's hard to stay focused on the plot. Can picture Tony Scott on a mechanical bull. Most of the characters look like they could use a transfusion along with Creasey. The actors do great work here, hard to find fault in that at all.  A more subdued style would have worked fine and maybe shaved 20 min. off the final time of 142 min.  The ending alone could have been compressed a little. With so much violence during the last acts of the film, the ending leaves you wanting just a little more to go out on.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Also emotional as one would expect it to be in real life, in negative cases. Also shows us strong character, lack of being naive, and not giving up. But the way it shows all of that is that it displays much more reality, negativity, and authenticity, rather than something more positive, something that usually movie would be worth watching for. It is just too real, to bare, too negative. As if this is not a movie, but bare reality of homeless, wounded, warriors, victims. Negative ending.

"A special, intriguing, discomfiting near-master work","'Man on Fire' is a film in two parts. . . .no, that is wrong, it is a film in two halves – one as bright as a little girl named 'Pita' and the pleasure she gives us -- the other as dark as the terrible density of a Black Hole that crushes even light itself.Unlike so many films which are in two pieces -- for that is their flaw, they don't make a complete, smooth work – the two opposing halves of 'Man on Fire' fit as tightly as the Yin and the Yang, diametric opposites seamlessly welded into a whole.We are first seduced into a rather sweet un-cloying film, as Denzel Washington's 'John Creasy', resists ... then yields to an increasingly swift glide from a shelled and cynical and absolutely alone near-alcoholic into the persistent affection of the 10-year-old Mexican-American girl he is hired to protect. Hired on the cheap, ""because I drink.""'Pita', wonderfully crafted by the very young Dakota Fanning, has a wisdom and a charm that seem to sometimes arise in the only child who grows up in a difficult but not cruel situation, and has the time and space to develop a strong character, a 'center'. Pita is friendly, and so is disappointed when rebuffed by Creasy, but not hurt. After a step back for a long look at him, this musing little girl decides Creasy is worth the siege.She draws him into a game of emotional chess, which he will not admit he is even playing until he is checkmated. In turn he helps her surmount an athletic obstacle, and the reward to him – and to us – is her elation.Creasy and Pita have become close. 'Close' is something Creasy has not felt in a very long time. A friend says much later in the film, ""She showed him it was all right to live again"".This sweetness -- not of saccharine, but of a complex natural honey -- becomes more and more disquieting. For we know he is a bodyguard hired to protect this little girl -- in a Mexico City of 24 child kidnappings in six days. So, we also know the attempt on 'Pita' will come. HAS to come. And because of the dark staccato march of the film, we know that the attempt will be very hard, probably brutal.And after the kidnap comes – chaotic, violent, messy – a wounded Creasy mutates swiftly into an indomitable arsenal of vengeance from which even Dumas, author of 'The Count of Monte Cristo', would recoil. There are many kinds of anger – wild rage . . . molten fury . . . a cold and measured wrath. It is the last that is the most dangerous, because it is an anger that thinks and calculates and cannot be distracted. It is John Creasy's.His friend 'Rayburn', played wonderfully by Christopher Walken, describing Creasy's anger as an art, says – ""He's about to paint his masterpiece."" Creasy formulates a solo raid on the complicated forces of gang greed grafted to official corruption that engineered the kidnapping, with a 'little help from his friends' – a former fellow counter-intelligence operative, a veteran Mexico City newswoman with a mission to expose rotten special police officers, and an honest police official of courage and a profile too public for the corrupt to dare touch.There has never been a Reaper so Grim as John Creasy. His retribution is absolute, merciless, and thorough, with little 'touches' that an artist of any kind tends to apply to a 'masterpiece'.It is often a difficult film to watch, because it is so raw, so real, so visceral and yet so intelligent. Our emotions and our intellects – that is to say, our knowing minds – are drawn toward and into its center, which swallows us like a slow, inexorable python.It's a smart film, an intelligent film, and inside are some of the tightest turns and twists outside of the human intestine, which is where we are taken -- into the bowel of crime and corruption. There are too many surprises to follow, except by rushing to catch up, but none are gratuitous, none are forced. And all are intriguing.Tony Scott's direction of Brian Helgeland's script increases our discomfort with a pace often pierced by rapid, unclear shards of sequence that unsettle us, and a murky frame here and there – 'What the hell was in that pool?', ''Who yelled that?', and just plain 'Hunh?' As with all good films that plot well, there are plants here and there – but some pay off, and some never reappear at all, which adds further to our dis-ease. We can never be certain of anything in this shifting five-dimensional work.And Denzel Washington's craft and depth and range are just splendid. As is the rest of the cast, without exception, that I noted.Though the film may stumble at moments, it dares to do so much that the missteps are forgiven, as might be the few human errors on a wondrous sculpture. The belief one is forced to suspend on occasion is surrendered gladly, for we know that neither life nor real art can be perfect. Both must just do their best.There has never been a 'perfect' film, and never will be. So we must give the well-crafted superlative near misses the 10's. – in lieu of 9.58's and 9.79's.'Man on Fire' is a flaring 9.65 – meaning, a '10'.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Entertaining, visual effects annoying.","Some other comments indicate that the first 50 minutes (which shows how Creasy and Pita formed a close bond) was boring. I have to disagree. That was the best part of the film for me. It was refreshing to see a 10 year old with such compassion and insight, especially since so many children in films these days are portrayed as overly cute and precocious, with no substance or empathy. I had never seen Dakota's acting before but now I understand why she is so admired. The 2nd half of the movie did make me squirm a little, it was rather hard to watch and a little unbelievable a times. Also, the visual effects throughout the entire movie were annoying at times. But all in all, I would recommend this movie and give it an 8 out of 10. Denzel's acting was great as usual, I've loved every movie I've ever seen him in. But what really made the movie for me as the character of Pita.",,Anonymous,Crime
Washington asserting family values? Not so much. But it's a thrill ride.,"You kind of get exactly what you expect out of ""Man on Fire."" Denzel Washington kills people, there some seriously innovative and abstract camera-work and editing from one of the finest action directors in the last 20 years (Tony Scott), and there's even a mystery to unravel. The film even bravely attempts to bring in a family oriented theme in what it tries to sell as an unlikely relationship between Washington and Fanning. But understand that this is an action film first, and even if it takes about an hour to get that, it's the truth. It's good, but it's mostly an artistic action piece.Washington's bad ass named John this time is known as just ""Creasy."" From the start he is an enigma. All you can really tell is he's sort of a war-torn alcoholic ex-US Intelligence assassin. With no other direction in life, he agrees to take a job as a body guard for a wealthy guy in Mexico City (Marc Anthony), where many kidnappings have been happening recently. There he forms this ""unlikely bond"" with the daughter Fanning, who of all her roles, this is the least annoying I've seen. She breaks his tough skin and then things take a scary turn when she is kidnapped.Unfortunately, that above paragraph is the first hour of the film. I understand the need to establish the relationship, but it all kind of becomes amoral anyway when Creasy decides he's going to kill everyone tied to the kidnapping. The rest of the film is Creasy seeing red and just taking it to everyone. As much as you understand the motivation, it just doesn't click right when he goes on this spree. He's very good in the role--outstanding I would say, but as a film the cohesiveness doesn't exactly work. I would give high marks to both halves of the film, but they don't exactly mesh together.Scott's use of flashing and repetitive images that he slows down and speeds up works better in the second half to accommodate the intense revenge/action scenes, but it feels a bit out of place in the beginning. Scott usually only uses it as it ties in to Creasy's past, but his past is not exactly something the film explores--it sort of takes it for granted. In general though, it's cool and unique and shows why Tony Scott is capable of handling any action film.I think what I'm saying is go in for Denzel and for the action, but I think that's what most people interested in watching ""Man on Fire"" are looking for anyway. Perhaps the family element will go over better with some more than others, but I see no family values in a film where Denzel is depriving people of fingers, no matter what they try and convince me. This is a great premise and an entertaining film and worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the greatest movies of all time,"This movie is truly remarkable. There is no doubt in my mind that story to this movie is one of the most under rated of all time. Man on Fire gives such a emotional look into the life of ""Creasy"" that even the ""strongest"" of people will choke up. This movie is a must see for anyone who is comfortable with some intensely violent scenes. However, the violence does serve a purpose and it is not merely for the sake of pleasing the gore addicts. This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Be sure to pay close attention to Creasy's change in attitude during his encounters with ""Pita Ramos"". The score also provides an amazing effect to the characters' emotions. Tony Scott is a genius film maker and I would be very interested to hear why anyone would dislike Man on Fire. If anyone has any questions regarding the film, post them and I would be more than happy to help you answer them if I have the time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Decent Fusion of Action and Drama,"2 May 2004. It's not easy to blend the movie genres of action and drama into a composite whole successfully along with bits of independent film editing and photographic techniques. Tony Scott has presented the audience with a toned-down action film with a heightened sense of drama between Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning (from SciFi Channel's ""Taken"") and included ""Proof of Life,"" and ""Traffic"" concepts to make a rather marketable product with a new look. While the ending is a bit Americanized and there are some rather ludicrous plot devices involved with Denzel Washington's skill and almost superhuman stamina (compare Sylvester Stallone in ""The Specialist"") the overall movie is a solid presentation with a much stronger emotional content, meaningful dialogue. Seven out of Ten Stars.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Better than the original. . . WAY BETTER.,"There really aren't enough revenge films anymore, which is shame because there not a much better genre when your looking for real all out action. This film really doesn't disappoint in this area. There is certain amount of violence but this isn't a Disney movie, it's about revenge so you kind of expected it didn't you. Out of the several ""interrogation"" Sequences only one is noticeably Violent but I still wouldn't let the kids see, or you can if you want, see if I care. Be a bad parent.I'm not a big Denzel Washington but I have to say he made this film, not to cast aspersions on any of the other cast members but I think that casting him as Creasy was spot on. You can really believe him as the rage engulfed bodyguard and he seemed like a real tough guy, the kind you really don't want to mess with. All this and he can still use the term ""catches my fancy"", how cool is that?! Having said that all the cast are great, but the three names you will know are Mickey Rourke, Dakota Fanning (of war of the world fame) and Christopher Walken! They all play their roles well and I got the sense that Mickey (I can call him that because we're close friends) was born to play the sleazy and corrupt family lawyer. The only draw back is the fact that the film takes it's time to get started but the story really helps the time pass and when Creasy gets down to business you'll be glad you waited.I loved this film through and through; it is one of the best if not the best film of 2004. It's worth watching.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Over-edited and overlong,"The violence of 'Man on Fire' isn't the problem here. In fact, the hard-as-nails approach we were promised is the reason that I was looking forward to seeing the film.However, this film is prime example of how to run a potentially good film into the ground. The story is good enough and provides amble motivation for the violent second half. The chemistry between Dakokta Fanning and Denzel Washington is superb and gives the film some heart at least. In fact, the performances are all very good - so why five out of ten? Because Tony Scott and co. can't let a good film speak for itself.When you've got great locations, a trio of fantastic actors (Fanning, Washington, Walken) and a emotionally charged premise, why do you need over stylised techniques to make the film work? Just about every single frame is spoilt by flickering, blurry or jittery camera-work. For instance, a simple interrogation sequence becomes a pop-video, full of freeze frames, sped-up imagery and so on. What's wrong with just letting the story flow in its own way? The film is also a bit too long. While it takes the time to build a relationship between the leads, it could still have done with taking 20 minutes out or so. But thats not what makes the film nearly unwatchable, its the director who tries to show off every few minutes and massage his ego.With a different editor and director, the film could have been much better but as it stand, Man on Fire is disappointing.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
worth it,"This movie was worth watching. It lasts longer than 2 hours, one of the things that surprised me about this movie. I think the casting was excellent. The storyline was unexpected. I never saw many ads for this movie and only wanted to see it because I think Denzel Washington is one of the best actors in America today. I have always been disappointed that he had to win his Academy Award in Training Day. This movie makes up for it, and I think it redeems him as a good actor. (I think everyone will agree that Training Day was not his best effort as an actor.) This movie appears to be filmed entirely on location in Mexico City. Many views of the city are presented. You see the very affluent neighborhoods and the very poor neighborhoods. In Mexico, you are either in poverty or rich. There are very few in between, which is why so many make the trip across the border in hopes of a better life not just for themselves, but for their entire family. I think the characterizations were fabulous. I felt real empathy for the characters. The script was fantastic. A bit predictable. But, for me, there is no ""unpredictable"". Tony Scott directed the film. I think he did a great job getting great performances from the actors. Dakota Fanning was made for the role of the kidnapped girl. She presents herself as very intelligent and yet vulnerable. I think -- if she can keep herself from being exploited by her parents and from falling for the falsity of Hollywood like most child actors -- that she has a career ahead of her that is worth following. The action in the film was great. Who doesn't enjoy seeing vigilante justice? This is a ""what comes around goes around"" film. If you like crime drama, action, good scripts and story lines, you should enjoy this flick. Keep the Kleenex handy if you are sentimental. Who wouldn't love Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning together? They were incredible on screen.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

You come back and act your ass of in a kick-ass movie. Hail to you, mr. Denzel Washington.He's playing 'Creasy', a hardass, tough but somehow likable former agent in need of a job. This is provided by an old time buddy (Christopher Walken) and consists of protecting a young girl in Mexico from getting kidnapped. But not even Creasy can stop this from happening, and he vows to avenge her death (after some rather crappy negotiations).I won't give away any more, as this is one to watch by all accounts.

This was not a movie Washington will be remembered for.,"I really don't think Scott should be proud of this work. Although he has produced some good movies, this one will fade quietly into the realm of the forgotten. Washington's performance was, as always, excellent. Dakota Fanning was superb. Micky Rourke was lacking. But even the best performances can not shine through poor direction and production. The photography during the action scenes was poor at best. The use of profanity by Radha Mitchell was unrealistic. The painted backdrops were much, much too obvious. The closeups were far too reminiscent of the old Spaghetti Westerns. The constant switching of languages, especially between the same people in the same conversation, and subtitles jumping all over the screen were extremely distracting. And I really don't believe, even in Mexico, dancers at a rave would continue dancing and cheering while someone fired a sawed off shotgun several times in their midst. But worst of all were the extremely bad visual effects. The story line, although old and tired, was somewhat revived by good acting and an unusual locale. All things considered, the movie was very unbelievable. I rented it as a PPV via satellite dish. Although it was an ""all day ticket"", I didn't think it was worth a second, free viewing.",,Anonymous,Crime
A nice change of pace for Denzel,"Granted, I saw this as an in-flight movie, so I probably didn't get the full experience -- though my audio was fine, my video consisted of two choices -- a seven-inch screen twenty feet away with proper color or one four feet away at an angle where everything is tainted greenish-brown, or wholly inverted color, so dark blues show up as pale greys, and so on. Adds a wrinkle to the viewing experience, to say the least, and they told us up front the movie had edited for screen size, content, and time. And they weren't kidding; the credits rolled as we were just about to land (I half-worried they would cut off the finale).All that in mind, Man is still a pretty good film. Denzel Washington plays Creasey, a hard-edged ex-agent who's seen better days and is set up by his pal Rayburn (Christopher Walken) for some bodyguard duty in Mexico, where apparently kids are kidnapped with alarming frequency. While Creasey is kind of a crab, the child, Pita (Dakota Fanning) is enjoyably precocious, but in a good way. Her infectious good humor rubs off on Creasey, who slowly begins to crawl out of his shell when of course she is kidnapped.Most of the rest of the film chronicles Creasey's efforts to resolve the situation, with varying degrees of inventiveness and violence (though I imagine some of the worse violence was trimmed from my version), and surprise, surprise, Denzel is incredibly effective in the type of role you associate more with someone like DeNiro. Denzel plays the hard-ass amazingly well, and he gives the role a nice subtle emotional undercurrent. Walken is good, but he's not in the movie enough for my liking -- a little more of him would have gone a long way. Fortunately Denzel gets to play off Dakota Fanning, so we can understand his quick bonding with the girl. Fanning is her usual excellent self (she's given more terrific turns than most actresses ever do, and she's what, eleven? What a future she could have!) and her Pita is really easy to like.The film is violent, but not more so than most R-rated fare, and at least it offers some character and emotional context to go with all the explosions and gunshots. While Man might not be everyone's cup of tea, itâs certainly worth a rental if you get the chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Superb..The Alternate ending on DVD would of been better,"Man on fire is the Best Denzel Washington movie I've ever seen. It was the Best film of the year, and i was glad to see a Great Action movie after a long time. Denzel delivers a power house performance and deserved an award for this movie. We have seen Denzel in powerful performances in the past in great movies like Malcolm X, John Q and Training Day. Another surprising actor was the little Dakota Fanning. We have seen Dakota in I am Sam, Hide and seek and War of the worlds. Dakota gives a excellent performance and the chemistry between Denzel and her is very heart warming. Christopher Walken is good in a supporting role. This is Tony Scotts Best movie he has directed. The violence is superb. The scene where he cuts of the bad guy's fingers is Superb. The bomb planted behind the mans private was very amusing. I have seen the alternate ending of this movie on the DVD. I think the previous ending would of been better.

One of the best films of 2004,"Man on Fire is a heartfelt drama/action that is about a bodyguard named Creasy(Denzel Washington) who spirit is rekindled by a little girl named Pita(Dakota Fanning)but when she is kidnapped he unleashes a one man war on all her kidnappers. I never really looked at Tony Scott's work prior to this but he did an amazing job in this film, every angle captures the setting beautifully and the action scenes are well choreographed. The acting is great, Denzel makes the movie hitting every emotion that is needed to drive the scene, Dakota hit the spot as Pita being bright,graceful and intelligent and Christopher Walken is as good as ever as Creasy's partner.

Intense!,"Violence that might seem exploitive in other films just seemed so right in this picture. And, there's just so much to like about 'Man on Fire', that I think its weaknesses are easily forgotten. It's strengths, like the acting by Washington and Dakota, are superb. For a young child, Dakota comes across with an amazingly mature and intelligent screen presence well beyond her years. Even her voice seems to belong to a older actress. It's actually a bit bizarre on second thought. Denzel is just great in this. He doesn't have a lot of lines it seems but does connect the story with the viewer in almost every scene, often with just his expression.At first, I wasn't sure I liked the directive style by Scott, which in parts reminded me of the way music videos are shot. But the film grew on me until I actually started making mental notes about certain scenes and some nice artistic touches. Some scenes give certain sequences a sort of hazy air about them, where time passes quickly (even for movie time) resulting in an overlapping of sequences where one seems to fade out while the next comes into view, hanging around longer. This interesting technique just underscores the internal struggle Denzel's character goes through. He is the textbook textbook antihero I think, he drinks, he coldly murders ""the bad guys"" (and there are plenty of them in Mexico it would seem) after wringing information out of them. There is rarely mercy shown, and his acts would make Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry blush. There were moments when I felt Washington just seemed too nice and looked to handsome for any of this to be believable, not even a scowl on his face as he pulls triggers left and right. In the end, what he brings to the picture is allowing the audience to get inside his character's head to make a connection or bond. Understanding what he's trying to accomplish is easy, together these helps propel viewers through the violence, and we relish, maybe squint, but believe it deserved. The ending was a bit Hollywood, but who cares, he's a 'man on fire'.",,Anonymous,Crime
Drama in the Mexican streets,"This is the most sedate, focused, and emotionally resonant film that Tony Scott probably ever made. It's also got those same hallmarks that have held back most of Scott's other better efforts: namely some issues in the backend of the script that he shot without, seeming, much question. It kind of descends into revenge porn while leaving its emotional resonance behind until it tries to grasp at it in the final moments once more. It's a disconnect that takes what should have been Scott elevating material above pulpiness into just luxuriating in it.John Creasy (Denzel Washington) is a drunk who has extensive experience in counter-insurgency tactics through his sixteen year military career. Brought to Mexico by his friend Rayburn (Christopher Walken), he takes on the job of bodyguard for Pita (Dakota Fanning), the daughter of a Mexican business man, Ramos (Marc Anthony), and his wife Lisa (Radha Mitchell), making it clear that they're getting a discount bodyguard because of his alcoholism. The first third of the film is really dedicated to Creasy as a character, especially the burgeoning father-daughter-like relationship between him and the young Pita. It's a surprisingly well-done series of scenes as she tries to get close, he pushes back, he decides he can help her win her swim meet by getting her used to the sound of a gun (foreshadowing) to start the race better. Real time is spent on this. It's not one scene and done, it's a solid 40 minutes or so, and it's where the film establishes all of its goodwill.And that hinges a lot on its actors. Through all of my ups and downs with Scott, I've consistently noted that he's a quality actor's director, getting good performances from his movie star casts over the previous twenty years, and matching him up with Denzel Washington, one of the best of the Hollywood movie stars from an acting perspective, was always a good sign. Washington really brings that pathos and charisma to Creasy, forming the underlying necessary emotional resonance through his growth as a character within the context of his relationship with Pita to make it all work.The film's second act is really dedicated to the inevitable kidnapping of Pita by a band of powerful men called La Hermandad, mostly made up of corrupt policemen in Mexico, starting with Creasy getting shot. One of the interesting things about this script is its embrace of the complexity of living and navigating a corrupt judicial and legal system where everyone is against you, giving it that depth of corruption and tactile feel that grounds it well in a single time and place. This is offset by the seemingly necessary inclusion of the good reporter, Mariana (Rachel Ticotin), almost always an addition that feels off (massively corrupt and powerful organizations not getting control of media outlets? That's just nonsense). At best, she's a plot device to get Creasy information that he might otherwise not be able to get...except that they established Rayburn already who could have done it. Whatever.So, the exchange goes bad (why ends up a complicated mess that the film explains poorly, but that's not for a while), and Pita dies, leaving Creasy alone as the one who can deliver the justice necessary in a corrupt system. And, this is where the film kind of disconnects for me. I think it's the absence of a ticking clock mechanism. There's nothing that Creasy is moving against in terms of what could be limiting him. Not only does he become something like a ghost and unkillable movie thing rather than a broken man trying to find redemption through terrible violence, the stakes seem somehow depressed because he's just kind of taking his time going from one target to the next. I feel like there should have been something he was moving against, like the guy behind it all, The Voice, has decided that he's made enough money and is going to disappear. So, Creasy needs to move faster to get to him before he's completely out of reach, sort of thing.And that lack of a contrast to the violence ends up just feeling like Scott is reveling in the violence. Sure, there's some thin fun to be had with Creasy cutting the fingers off and torturing those who had a part in the kidnapping, but without something else driving him forward, it ends up feeling kind of empty. The point isn't to get anything, but to wallow in the torture. This is where the movie's first act becomes a real asset because, despite having almost completely disconnected from it, that backing is still present, giving a patina of emotional cover to what's going on.And then the film has its final ten minutes that is supposed to reestablish that connection, and I found it to be more manipulation than fulfilment. I didn't buy into it, essentially, which prevented me from really investing in the pathos that the finale held in store. It may just be a me thing. I dunno.However, I don't want to undermine what is actually quite a good script by Brian Helgeland. The use of the gun in the swimming competition and its recall during the kidnapping, the use of scripture as an element of Creasy's character journey, and the core relationship between Creasy and Pita are all based in the script. That's solid stuff, and it makes me wonder whether the disconnect I feel in the back half of the film comes from the script or from Scott's influence in the edit.So, I think the overall package is quite good. It might be Scott's best film. However, I just feel like something is missing in the back half that would give Creasy's actions more immediacy. Also, Scott's visual flare continues to become a headache in increasing intensity, flashing needlessly in sections but, thankfully, not all the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A real review for real movie lovers...,"This is my first ever reveiew for IMDb, I felt it was necessary, allow me to explain. When I came across the reviews for ""Man on Fire"" I was amazed by the sheer and unfiltered venom of some of the reviews that I was reading. Shocked even. The way the reviewers described the movie made it seem like the only thing worse would be to get gang raped by a tribe of HIV positive silver-backs. I mean Tony Scott is a good director, right? Denzel Washington is one of the finest actors of our generation, right? How could this movie be that bad? Well, I rented it from the local video store, sat down with an open mind and watched...those reviews were... well...full of crap, and that's the only way for me to put it without being forever banned from the web site.""Man on Fire"" is the story of a former assassin who has fallen on hard times. John Creasy(Washington)takes on a job to be the bodyguard of a little girl, Lupita Ramos(Fanning). In the beginning the hardened Creasy rebuffs the childs attempts at friendship, but eventually softens up and they develop a sweet relationship. This was a little cliché for me but not totally unexpected in a movie like this. Eventually young Lupita is kidnapped and Creasy is gravely injured trying to protect her, some say the first half of the movie moves to slowly, but it's a tool used to build up the relationship of the main characters to the point when Creasy does go on the offensive, we, the audience can be on his side(he does some pretty sadistic stuff). The movie flows very well, it's around 2 hours 25 mins long but you barely notice the length. The movie is engrossing, action packed and has some great elements of suspense and intrigue that I wasn't really expecting. The actors were good, the direction was good, the location and sets were good, everything about the movie was good. To me that equals a good movie, not a great one, but a good one... a really good one.So, If you haven't seen man on fire yet, and are surfing the web, trying to see what it's all about, and you come to IMDb I really hope you get a chance to read this review first, or at least it be one of the first, those other guys will lead you down a dark road full of silver-back gorillas griping a handful of condoms, just kidding, everyone has the right to their opinion.

"Slightly overlong, but solid revenge flick with Denzel in nasty-man mode.","At the opening of this film we are told that kidnapping for ransom in much of South America is less a crime than an occupation for some. A business transaction if you will. We are also told that many of those taken are not returned successfully Gee what an odd stat to open a film with! Wonder what this is about? Denzel plays a burnt out special ops soldier name John Creasy, visiting Mexico city to catch up with ex-colleague played by Christopher Walken who, seeing Creasy purposeless and apathetic hooks him up with a job as bodyguard for the daughter of a well to do businessman named Samuel (J-Lo's missus) and his wife Lisa (Rahda Mitchell).The girl's name is Peta (Dakota Fanning), she is about 8, bright, friendly, a little precocious and a lot inquisitive. Initially Creasy doesn't care, he tells Peta that his job doesn't extend to being buddies or caring, as long as she is alive he can punch in and punch out a contended man.Creasy spends the days protectin' and the nights drinkin' and contemplatin' after one such comtemplatin' leads to a botched incident though Creasy decides to see the scotch glass as empty – as in from now on. He and Peta start conversatin' with Creasy enjoyin' a new lease on life. They start to bond over her swimming training and after much practise after the 'big race' they have a firm relationship in place.So we know exactly where this is going don't we? The event is inevitable and bloody. Both 'sides' take hits, to the bad guys (including cops) there are 4 down, to the good guys – namely Creasy – he is left for dead in a pool of his own blood and awakens days later from life support to be told that Peta is dead. A victim of a failed ransom handover that turned into a shootout.Furthermore he receives the good news that as the 'America' he is initially somehow to blame for all of this.Well Creasy ain't havin' it. Without waiting around for the proper rehabilitation he heads out; not to solve the case but 'kill anyone there, anyone associated or anyone who profited' from the abduction of Peta. He receives Lisa's full endorsement, asks Walken for help and is offered assistance from a female reporter tired of the injustices who feels that a rogue Creasy will achieve more than the cops who are all either corrupt or focused on 'live' cases.Man on Fire is actually far more violent and aggressive than 90% of Denzel movies, as he uncovers the truth and traces the leads back to those who ordered the kidnapping Creasy leaves a trail of tortured, bloodied bodies in his wake. He doesn't mince words or waste time moralising, if you fit the criteria as being marked for death then death is what you shall have and you ain't gonna like it when it arrives (ummmmm, ass-bomb?).I should also mention some of the more effective use of subtitles this side of the Crank films (for different reasons I guess), in Man on Fire the subtitles become part of the film, making them easier to read and interpret (I mean from an urgency and intensity standpoint, not language.) As always Tony Scott proves he is a better director than given credit for, especially for 'movies' instead of 'films'. His 'movies' are action packed and always geared more towards the entertaining than the preaching, teaching or seeking critical acclaim. His recent runaway train flick Unstoppable was way more entertaining than it had a right to be and Déjà vu is a totally underrated and too frequently ignored gem.It is all too easy to complain about a director getting things wrong and then clumsily inserting your own 'if only he did this' stuff, but with Scott it is quite often the case that revisiting the film in retrospect shows that he got it all right. He seldom aims for the stars with his flicks but always seems to make the best of what he has available to him, thankfully that often means Mr Denzel Washington, one of the most reliable men in Hollywood.That helps.In saying that if I had a diss at Man on Fire it is too long at 140 minutes. But rather than just being a question man I will also be an answer man: the swimming training sequences could have easily lost 10-15, the casing the bad guys another 15. This film loses 20 odd minutes and it is instantly a lean, mean 8 / 10. As it stands it remains a slightly bloated, violent revenge flick that builds speed nearer the end.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. Not as good as Déjà vu and probably less entertaining than Unstoppable, but Man on Fire gives Tony Scott and Denzel Washington 3 for 3 in the 'worthwhile' stakes.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Acting saves this one,directing nearly kills it","I just saw this movie this afternoon. The summary I wrote about sums it. This is,by and large,a well-fleshed out revenge pic,and the actors do their best to make this one credible. Particularly,it's Washington,Walken,Mitchell and Dakotah Fanning who add weight to the material. The violence of the last hour and a half contrasted with the quiet charm of the first fifty minutes could almost make TWO movies.   It's tempting for your more cynical audience member to laugh off the heavy-handed sentiment and morality of the film,but given the set-up of the story, it would seem rather out of sync if it became completely amoral and dark. Director Scott's overusage of jump-cuts,fancy editing and(for lack of a beter word to describe it)subtitles threaten to turn this film hokey,so the pressure is on the leads to deliver something sober and true and they just achieve it. Denzel in particular is very good at switching from reflective,depressed former government op to steeled,enraged and efficient killing machine,and it is nice to see Walken play someone who is NOT a creepy,edgy baddie for once. Overall,watchable and satisfying. 6 out of 10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel Washington at his best,"""Man on Fire"" - I'd rather change this title into ""Man of Fire"" because Creasy's (Denzel W) revenge causes only fire and death...This is my favourite film. No more, no less. It's not just action movie, it's also a touching story of a bodyguard, who wants to avenge the death of a young girl he was supposed to protect. ""She showed him it's all right to live again""....I strongly recommend everyone this film. It should've received many awards but it didn't. Another underrated movie, honestly... I'd even dare to say that if you don't like this film, you'll never ever appreciate Denzel Washington's roles.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Depressed macho saves the film,"Man on fire is an okay movie about the sweet revenge of a seriously angry bodyguard.A positive point of the film is Tony Scotts obvious touch to the style. He managed to give the film more character by using a creepy, modern style. It is as if the viewer is brought closer to the scene of action. In this respect, Scott has done a good job. Also, a clear positive point is the great casting and performance of Denzel Washington. I am not a Denzel fan, but in silent, image driven characters I think he is one of the best. Training Day is a good example. In Man on Fire, Washington manages to attain a certain deprived attitude, as if he has gone through a history of violence. He is silent yet revealing. It are these elements of the movie that kept my attention to the somewhat simple story.Negative points of the film are easily recognized also. For instance the length. 146 min is a long time, especially if you realize that in the first half hour one can make predictions about the coming two. The length also tends the viewer to become annoyed by Scotts style, which is totally unnecessary. I gave the film a good 7 out of 10 since it is just not special enough to report an 8.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best action flick of the year,"They finally got it right! It's about time someone released an action movie the way we've always wanted it done. I'm sure I'm not the only one who is sick of movies with a moral or movies that cop out at the last minute. This is a movie about bad things happening to good people and a person standing up and dealing out natural justice to those deserving. Juvenal once said that ""The man who deserves to die is already dead in his soul"" and this is bourne out very well in this picture. With every step Creasy made, I felt his pain and his rage. I was so pleased with the 'pull-no-punches' attitude of this movie, I even saw it twice. (A big call with the tickets costing NZ$14.00, these days.) I mean, there's a place for cutesy-poo Diznee movies about neon fish or friendly bears or whatever-the-hell the latest marketing ploy is, but it was great to see an adult action movie where the bad guys get exactly what they deserve. Let's have some more of that...",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Don't cross Denzel!,"4 years before Liam Neeson would have his daughter ""Taken"" that story had already been told in a little movie called Man on Fire. I suppose you can't say that Denzel Washington was quite as old as Neeson when he starred in his revenge thriller, but he was close, and this movie is infinitely better. Perhaps it's the fact that I love Denzel, but I also love the way Tony Scott directs the film as well. It made me genuinely laugh when there was a credit at the end of the film calling Mexico City ""a special place,"" because he shoots this entire movie like it is a more wretched hive of scum and villainy than Mos Eisley. It's a dark film and they set it up so you feel that this is a place where those with money are never completely safe. I didn't mind that so much because it is a good backdrop for a no-holds-barred gritty revenge film like this one (I just wonder how Mexicans feel about it.)Man on Fire takes full advantage of Denzel's range as we see him jump around from heartless, to vulnerable, to kind, and even a little doubtful of himself. It's a perfect casting choice, and somehow I found myself rooting for him despite the utter brutality of his actions. Of course, part of the reason you want to see him get his revenge is the fact that they do such a brilliant job of setting up the story. This isn't the kind of movie that rushes to the action. Instead they slowly set up the stakes, they spend some time with the characters so you care about them, they build the tension of the looming danger, and then it's off to the races. Admittedly, there's a lot of far-fetched elements to the plot. It seems that people can get away with virtually any crime in Mexico, as if it were a lawless wasteland, and people survive more physical harm than I think is plausible. However, by the time the movie was pushing to those extremes, I no longer cared. Man on Fire had me hooked and I loved every minute of it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A good movie but with some problems.,This movie started off soo good. I probably would have given it a ten if not for its needless addition of all the god stuff instead of just keeping it realistic. The acting was great and the story had you on the edge of your seat although somewhat predictable.This movie is about an alcoholic ex military man who goes to Mexico to be a body guard for a rich familes little girl. He has never does any body guard work before and is not really a people person but he develops a strong relationship with the young girl. A relationship that is tested while on his watch she is abducted.This movie is really good and at some points heart wrenching but like I said somewhat predictable and the adding of nonsense took away from this movie in my opinion overall though still very good.,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Denzel's Best Work,"Went into this movie not knowing what to expect. By the end of the movie, ""Man On Fire"" had entered my top 10 movies of all-time.The movie has lots going for it. A great cast, a great story and great directing. At face value this movie is about an angry man trying to exact revenge. It's about so much more though- love, redemption, sacrifice...and more. There's some violence, sure, but I think this is one of those movies where it's required to truly reflect emotion. Definitely worth catching on DVD, which features an alternate ending (although it wasn't what i expected, still good). Definitely some of Denzel's finest work, up there with ""The Bone Collector"" and ""Hurricane"". Good jobs also by Dakota Fanning, Marc Anthony and Rahda Mitchell.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

worth seeing,i really liked the movie. it starts quite peaceful showing the connection between the girl and the bodyguard. it successfully combines action with love and friendship and revenge.Denzel Washington is a great actor. but i have to admit the little one (i'm talking about the girl) is amazing. she is so natural and sweet. the plot is really interesting and even though some scenes are quite violent they are not the kind that make you sick. i like the methods he uses to revenge :) the end is quite sad but then that's one of the reasons i like it. because in real life it doesn't always turn out great and everyone lives happily ever after.all in all i think it is a movie worth seeing.,9.0,Anonymous,Crime

I've been a huge fan of Denzel Washington's work, but for me, this movie takes the cake. It's raw and gritty and sees Denzel step away from the family man and good cop roles he has traditionally played.The cinematics and scenes were great and really added to the feel of the movie and plot.The story sees Denzel playing a drunk and burnt out ex cop who has been hired to protect a child of a wealthy family. After she is kidnapped, he tracks down the syndicate responsible and issues his own form of justice.Well worth seeing if you haven't already, but be warned- it is at times, quite violent.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The redeeming power of love,"Incredible, stunning and spiritually moving story about justice, and the redeeming power of love. The hero, Creasy (played by Denzel Washington), is obviously haunted by something that he did in his past, although we never learn what it was. What we do know is that he is racked with guilt and despair, and doesn't really want to live-until he takes a job as a bodyguard for a 10 year old girl, Pita Ramos (Dakota Fanning). Pita gives Creasy a reason to live, and for that, Creasy vows revenge on her kidnappers. Man of fire, indeed.

Boring over long and not worth the hype and the good reviews it got!!!!!!!!

Denzel's Best Work,"I rated this film a 10 and I'm normally very stingy with 10's but I certainly feel that in every respect of this movie it deserves every point. Denzel was fantastic and played his part perfectly. His character was very complicated emotionally and mentally and watching Denzel play this part was witness to genius. The supporting cast was cast incredibly well. Dakota Fanning was adorable and her lines and acting were second to none. She made you love this character like one of your own children. The rest of the supporting cast gave an incredible performance. Exactly what you would expect from the likes of Micky Rouke and Christopher Walken for a few examples. I can't say enough about this film. The directing, Camera angles and story were superb and flowed flawlessly throughout the film. Man on Fire was not predictable as are so many other action/drama films. This is not only a must see film but a must ""BUY"" film because you will watch it again.

Truly Amazing-Two Films in One,"Tony Scott's masterpiece plays like two films in one: a heartfelt drama and a scorching revenge saga.The first half enters John Creasy (Washington) into a violent world of kidnappings and corruption. He is a former assassin who is bored of life and is an alcoholic. By his friend's suggestion, he becomes a bodyguard to a young child named Pita played fantastically by Dakota Fanning. His alcoholism and crankiness would chide most children away from befriending him, but the relentless Pita defrosts his heart and makes him feel like a person again. He puts down the bottle and picks up the Bible. And laughs. And smiles.But one day, corrupt police officers attack him. Being outmanned, Creasy is left for dead as Pita is kidnapped before his eyes. A negotiation occurs between the kidnapper and the family, but the result is heartbreaking, and destroys Creasy's world of happiness.Creasy puts the Bible down and picks up the gun. Assisted by a reporter and a police official, he swears to destroy every last person who had anything to do with Pita's kidnapping. Thanks to his experience in the military and covert operations, he goes on a murderous rampage against the brotherhood, La Hermandad, notching an incredible body count. He leaves few people still alive and many dead. Creasy is relentless in finding the truth behind the failed negotiation and Pita's kidnapper. And no one can stop him.Watch this film if you get the chance. It is brutal yet brilliant, bloody yet beautiful. Wonderful acting and a good script highlights this masterpiece of an action movie. You won't be sorry for the two and a half hours you've spent.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
is it better to burn out than fade away?,"Denzel washington gives an great performance as creasy, an alcoholic with a military background who is hired to protect a young girl(played by dakota fanning). The story is set in Mexico city where kidnappers target wealthy families to make huge amounts of money from their ransom.Tony scott directs a fine cast that includes christopher walken and mickey rourke. The whole film is a blur of various shooting techniques and a vivid soundtrack that suits the mood of a very threatening and alien Mexico city backdrop.Dakota fanning is excellent as the young girl who creasy must protect, and washington himself is quietly convincing as a man with a past he isn't proud of and a future he knows is empty. But its his friendship with the girl that becomes the heart of the movie. As they bond after an uneasy start, we can see just where tony scott is taking us..so when things do take a turn for the worst, we are fully prepared for it. In fact, we are just waiting for for it to happen. And thats when the pace of the film begins to pick up. Scotts direction revels in showing us the mindset of each character, and soon the plot becomes a by the numbers trail of revenge and information gathering.However, man on fires strength is the emotional weight that these scenes carry. Scotts investment in his character's relationships almost justifies the violence. And as an audience we are made to feel that creasy's dark side is completely reasonable, no matter how grisly his actions. That might disturb some audiences, but in todays society, it seems that an eye for an eye attitude is not so terrible an idea- at least in scotts vision of society.If this film has a fault, it isn't the plot, the script or its execution. Its the wealth of good actors that are neither used or developed nearly as much as they could have been. But as in scotts earlier movies (true romance being a prime example), the cast,even if under-used, add a rich quality to the proceedings and audiences will feel in good hands throughout.Strong story, strong cast, and confident direction make this one of the most interesting releases this year. And if you don't mind your action with a spoonful of sentimentality then you'll enjoy the fact that this film chooses to fade away instead of burning out at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Insult to Mexico,"Denzel Washington plays a man whose soul has been leached out of his body by the demands of his job (the back of his hand shows the scars of cigarette burns.  Sustained only by the bottle, he travels to Mexico City to go to a friend and former comrade in arms (the always good Christopher Walken) to seek a job.  Walken suggests going into the bodyguard business.  There's an epidemic of kidnappings for cash in the country and protection is a growth industry.  Washington's character, Creasy, hooks up with a wealthy Mexican business who has a darling daughter played by Dakota Fanning to protect.Now Dakota does a fine job of acting but even with a blonde American mother she's about as Latin as her namesake.When Dakota does eventually get kidnapped, Creasy goes Death Wish on the corrupt Mexican citizenry.  You see little Pita (Fanning) has brought a bit of humanity back to Creasy so his logic tells him it's acceptable to get medieval on those he feels responsible.The producers thanked Mexico City for being a special place.

Denzel Washington plays one of his most engaging and emotional roles to date, and the rest of the cast perform beautifully. Christopher Walken is of course superb in his part although he did not appear as often as I would have liked. A story of ultimate greed that backfires is offset against a childs innocence and love. This is also a film for action movie lovers as it has its fair share of bullets, rockets and revenge. The location of Mexico City adds a feel of seediness and corruption which in itself is an eye opener. All in all, a truly gripping film from beginning to end. Highly recommended",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Has virtually everything.,"I'm beginning to seriously believe I'm going soft, becoming too mellow now than is good for me. I think this is probably one of the great films I've been fortunate enough to see. A good story that comes out of the reciprocated loving bond between a young child Lupita Ramos (Dakota Fanning) and her bodyguard John Creasy (Denzel Washington). From a novel from a guy named Quinnell it tells the story of hard drinking, hard arsed ex CIA Creasy and goes through the pain and suffering for the kids parents and Creasy and what it takes and what he does to find her in Mexico when she is kidnapped with the collusion of the Police and local criminals. Based on a real gang of Mexican Kidnappers working at that time. A real host of stars include Giancarlo Giannanini, Rachel Ticotin, Christopher Walken, Radha Mitchell. After seeing Washington's acting it's hard to imagine some of the top notch actors considered for his role being able to better it. Respect, love, fun, revenge, poignancy, violence and selflessness are just some of the qualities involved. I personally found myself quite 'choked-up' in the last 5 or so minutes.

Redemption,"Man on Fire, a powerful film on the theme of redemption. Indeed John Creasy (Denzel Washington) , plays a former operative agent now turned body guard to a young girl (Dakota Fanning). She is kidnapped and Creasy will be on her search without pity for anyone involved. All through the film, we will learn more about John Creasy and his past. One of his dialogues with Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken) Creasy will say: Will God forgive us for what we've done''? Rayburn's answer is a small smile and says: ''No''. In addition, a recurrent scene appears many times showing a person in the water then blood fills the pool. You can't have a better symbol of a the redemption process gone through by Creasy as it will foreshadow the failure of his quest. One can go on and on in the analysis of the character's search for peace and answers to what he has gone through in the past and the will of a new beginning. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves to talk about a subject, in this case redemption, which the movie has a lot to offer in terms of content.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

South America seems to have a kidnapping problem, and Creasy needs a job..well what happens next isn't hard to figure out!

An action film for people who don't like action films...,"Every now and then something comes along that transcends its genre. This is such a film. The plot summary reads like every ridiculous Charles Bronson vigilante revenge flick you hated in the 1980's, or like half a dozen over-hyped efforts by Mel Gibson for that matter. And in most respects this film does not strive for much more: don't look to it for ""deeper significance."" Do look to it for a shining example of what the genre could be, in the hands of a serious director. The slightly edgy, stylized editing (rapid scene changes, copious cuts, black-and-white flashback stills, and even occasional subtitling in varying fonts and sizes) seems informed by a music video sensibility,but is effective and not at all annoying. Washington's performance is pitch perfect; he is entirely believable as a haunted soul slowly healed by the innocence of his charming child client. And the young Flanning is affecting in a way few child stars have ever been. In short, this film steers a wide berth around the action genre's most common pratfall: unlike 99% of action movies, we actually care about the characters in this film, and while they are in jeopardy--basically the whole film--we cannot peel our eyes from the screen. If you are like me, in that you cannot recall enjoying an action film since Luc Besson's ""Leon,"" then ""Man on Fire"" is definitely the film for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Revenge and Redemption,"The two main elements in this movien which are revenge and redemption are often explored in cinema, sometimes such explorations do well and othertimes and 3not so well. Man on Fire falls far on the positive side of the scales, for many reasons which I will elaborate upon. Man on Fire sees an ex US military office named Creasy (Denzel Washington) who's personal deamons include being an alcoholic, albeit a functioning one. Rayburn (Christopher Walken) his friend finds him a job in Mexico City as a bodyguard for a small girl of rich family due to the fact that kidnappings for randsoms are becoming very common in Mexico. The small girl called Pita played by a young and charismatic Dakota Fanning initially tries to get Creasy to warm to her but fails in her attempts. However as he starts to slowly warm up towards her. She is kidnapped by criminals looking for a large randsom sum. This leads ultimately for Casey to go seeking revenge for the kidnapping whose journey is entertaining to see. The movie stars great actors and actresses and it has very structured character arcs which are pleasurable to see. Character arcs are sometimes left out in such movies. A sad aspect about this movie after reading deeper into it. Is that people workkng on the movie where robbed in mexico, although none were hurt. It shows how vulnerable people are in mexico to falling victims of kidnappings, especially women. The movie deserves a 9/10 . The one main negative of the movie I disliked was the disorientating grainy cinematography at times. Making the movie a slight struggle to watch. Besides I can't fault the movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hope or no hope,"Some see hope from the movie while the others suggest that if you think deeply you will find it is actually hopeless rather than hope. In my opinion regardless of the original expectation of the director what I see from the movie regarding hope subject is hopeless.Start with the issue high frequent kidnapping, it depends on nothing but the corrupted society, only reform the regime can help. Along with the development of the drama it is found that the cops is helping and the officers are not helping but filling their own pockets. The only force citizens depending on to against crime is part of crime, so where is hope, there is only hopelessness left.Then Pita's successful rescue is due to a well trained agent in other word luck the possibility of which is one in thousand or much less. It is typical American film tie all the hope on a hero then the hero saves the world. If you come out of the film facing the realistic world, well you put you hope into wrong bank. You are gambling as stupid as gambler.Finally it seems this society has hope. There are people representing justice like the journalist and the special department officer. However after watching the sexual trade between them it needs to rethink about the justicial side. As if the justice can be bribed by sex this time it cannot make sure it cannot be bought by money or power next time.In conclusion, the emphasis of this film is not hope or justice but the heroic action. However under a dim background like this this film not only fails to show the audience hope but owe they a happy ending as well.

Denzel is on fire!,"I've heard of Man of Fire with Denzel Washington when I was a kid but nothing came to my mind about it apart from I heard that Tony Scott directed it. But on the other hand as I got older and I saw the reviews that mixed and positive and different websites. On Rotten Tomatoes it had a 39% from the critics and 89% from the audience and then on IMDB it had a 7.7/10 and I was gutted, so I thought ""You know what, screw it, I'm gonna see it."" So I popped it in and watched it and you know what, I'm really impressed by it. I am one of those people who really loved it. No wonder why critics hated on this one, it is impressive. A former CIA SAD/SOG officer, John Creasy played by Denzel Washington, meets his old friend, Paul Rayburn played by Christopher Walken, who runs a security firm in Mexico. He convinces him to take a bodyguard position to protect Samuel Ramos' daughter, Pita played by Dakota Fanning. Creasy is struggling with alcoholism, burnout, and guilt over his actions with the CIA, He teaches Pita to become a professional swimmer, not to flinch at the gunshot. Waiting outside Pita's piano lesson, He realises that she is about to be abducted, killing those including police officers who try to kidnap her but wounded from his injuries. He's thinking that he is a suspect but AFI agent Miguel Manzano stated to him that two officers he killed are corrupted. So now it's up to John Creasy to find those who kidnapped Pita for ransom. You know, the film does have some cuteness in the first act because of Dakota Fanning. I mean, yeah she is a kid and all, she really does give her performance a unique taste. I can't believe there would be a scene where Denzel tell Datoka to burp while in piano lesson. The cinematography is really great even if it look like Mexico. The action doesn't kick in until about fifty minutes later. The first half is just some kid family friendly stuff and the second half is where the revenge action takes it's place. What can I say this movie that hasn't been said? All I can say is that it's an underrated unique action film, that is if you were looking at Netflix you will see that it is mostly liked by many who have seen it.

This film definitely did not reach its potential,"First of all, this movie could have easily gotten a 8 or 9/10 from me, if it weren't for a few key flaws. The acting is great, the story is decent, and the soundtrack is amazing. So what went wrong you may ask? Well, the cinematography is absolutely atrocious. I could not believe how distracting some scenes were, with subtitles or names and dates flashing all over the screen. The constant use of overexposing shots was neat to watch for the first 3 minutes, and then you realize with horror that they use the same method for the whole length of the movie: 2 hours and 20 minutes. It honestly makes the movie feel more like a long trailer, music video or tacky commercial.

"A must see, it kept me on my seat.","I went to this movie with expectations that it would be a massive action movie with Danzel Washington's Character being a gun carrying vigilante, who would stride across the screen into a hail of bullets and come out unharmed, but I was pleasantly surprised. And Dakota Fanning was a breath of fresh air, hopefully she will continue getting roles like this one and be assured to become a great actress.The movie it's self seems to be at first a little slow, but as it goes one I realized that Tony Scott was just ensuring that we, the audience, got to understand just what motivated the character of Creasy, to show us just why he does just what he does.

"A very, very  disappointing movie","I looked forward to seeing this movie because of Washington's great performances in most of his other works. However, my eagerness was dampened early on, not so much by the performances, but by the visual component. This movie made almost incessant use of special effect zoom-ins and -outs. Visually the story was buried in this. I was quickly irritated by this from the outset, and felt like changing DVDs. But because I had just plunked down hard cash for it, I endured it a little longer. Finally I couldn't take it anymore and didn't watch the rest. They used effects like this in Enemy of the State, but with great restraint, mostly when they showed the satellite zooming in on two main characters as they tracked them. But here it was overburdening. This factor alone made it, in my mind, one of the worst films I've ever seen. As for the acting, Washington, with his clean-cut looks and ways, just wasn't convincing as a drunk. His overall performance was less than stellar as well, as was, I felt, everyone else's. For me, a clear Thumbs Down! I'm only surprised at how many IMDb respondents actually thought highly of this trash. This is artistic cinema?",1.0,Anonymous,Crime
a work of genius if you love films don't miss it!,"Great movie, Tony Scott does it again, the ensemble cast and the power of the characterisation (by them) make this film watchable in a way that many of films of this genre sadly lack.The acting, script, levels of realism, passion, tight editing and moments of outstanding cinematography make this film, although sometimes difficult to watch due to the violence ,which unusually is not gratuitous, stand head and shoulders over most films this year. This movie is unrelenting and holds no punches, a breath of fresh air.....don't let it pass you by. For some reason this movie was not in UK cinemas long enough for me to check it out on the big screen, but I (on recommendation alone) purchased it on DVD and I am pleased to understate hugely just how impressive the package is.Four hours of extra goodies and as I have said already the film isn't half bad either.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Scott and Denzel were just working so well together and we're amazing collaborators. All the cast just works so well together. Fanning and Walken were so great in the movie as well.

Wow.,"I happen to come across this movie, as I was flipping' through the channels. After watching just a few seconds of it, I was hooked. This is a GREAT movie and probably the best role I've seen Denzel in. You know its a good movie when points of it actually make your heart flinch. Worth watching for sure! 10 lines of text is required for my post to be submitted, so I'll go on to say, that the girl that acts in this movie is great. Without given away the movie, the ending is something worth watching this movie for. My wife had already seen the movie before me, and I kept asking ""what's gonna happen"" and she would just smile and say, just keep watching. The only problem I had with this movie, though, was it is a long movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
too much fire kills it,"In 1987, Quinnell's book was adapted for the silver screen by Elie Chouraqui, a minor director, responsible of ""Paroles et Musique"" (1984) and ""les Marmottes"" (1993). This version was not a masterpiece and is now virtually in limbo. Unfortunately, it's not this overlong remake by Tony Scott which will set the record straight.Leaving Italy for Mexico, ""Man on Fire"" is split in two drastically different but globally weak halves. The first one deals with Creasy (Denzel Washington) who is hired as a bodyguard in a well-off Mexican family to protect a little girl named Pita (Dakota Fanning). He's a man with a sad past and a strong bias for alcohol. Maybe will he find solace and redemption thanks to the Holy Bible. Ouch! How original. Actually, this first part piles up the clichés linked to Crasy but also to the unlikely friendship he stroked up with his little protégée. First, sullen and distant and then friendly, he has found a way to approach her by developing in her assertion and setting new targets for herself thanks to a swimming competition. But the evolution of his demeanor and especially his liking towards the little girl is showed in a quite shallow way to be really conclusive.Now, what about this second part? It completely changes the tone of the film which takes a leap into explosive violence and linear investigation. After his coma, Creasy turns into a real killing machine who exterminates all the ones who were involved in the abduction of Pita. Blood abundantly flows, explosions succeed themselves with stunts and knock-out images galore. Scott and his scenarist Brian Helgeland also felt compelled to include sequences which shelter free violence. One of them was influenced by Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). It's the sequence in which Washinton is with one of the kidnappers in a car and tortures him to make him speak with loud music on the radio. But in parallel not to stay confined in this assumed perspective, Helgeland tried to introduce twists to boost the interest of the viewer in Creasy's vengeful adventure. Thus, in the middle of this second part, we learn a far-fetched revelation whose nature makes a little think of ""Fargo"" (1996) by the Coen brothers.The content of the film is made of thin substance and is still plagued by the flashy form. Scott didn't jettison his trademark which mar his efforts. His visual, sound excesses that are supposed to impress and gain the audience's approval make the film distressing to watch in the long run. Hyper images, sophisticated camera work, sharp editing are supposed to be here to compensate the weak potential of the story and it only helps to plague it. Worse: these features sometimes arrive at the most awkward moment in the story and action. Then, the soundtrack is extremely loud and mixed forward. Sometimes, you have to listen very closely to decipher what the characters say. This drawback is more irritating in the second half. ""Man on Fire"" is also ruined by an ugly cinematography. What's the consequence of all this? A large proportion of shots are distorted by one or the other of these drawbacks.Overrall the other directions that the scenario could have taken to enable the film to take a subtle, rich dimension have been shelved or lightly touched. For instance, the major problem of these abductions of children in Latin America falls in the second category. Instead, Helgeland created a linear, stubborn revenge story which Scott filmed with a festival of shock images and by this ruined the reduced potential of the story.Even the direction of actors seems absent. Denzel Washington who is a commendable actor is here unable to shade his acting. Christopher Walken, a big American actor isn't given a chance to shine and his part is blatantly underwritten. But the little Dakota Fanning which Sean Penn's fans discovered in ""I Am Sam"" (2001) gives a quite mature offering.On its release, ""Man on Fire"" was made alluring through an eye-catching cover but this blazing film left me cold. As a scenarist, Brian Helgeland saw brighter days before: ""L.A. Confidential"" (1997), ""grandad"" Clint Eastwood's ""Mystic River"" (2003)...",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
Awesome tale of revenge,"Brilliantly acted by all involved, simple but well played plot focusing on ruthless, calculating revenge at all costs. The way Denzel Washington's character carves up the ""bad"" guys is a sight to be behold, without him seeming like a bulletproof superhero. If you like a well thought out revenge story, where the lead character is not a Rambo-wannabee but a trained, calculating, intelligent, and totally ruthless professional, then this is the movie for you. The cinematography can be jarring at times, but is clearly used to drive home the emotions of a scene. Definitely a masterpiece in the full sense of the word.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Great movie, bad camera work","Quickly, I love the movie. the charicters, the arc, and the pace of the film. Denzel was on top of his game, although he should have been dead ten times over. Walken had yet another class speech in the ""masterpiece"" bit. And ever the smaller charicters were played with great energy. Any one of them could carry their own movie. The soundtrack was haunting, done by the same woman who sang on the ""Gladiator"" soundtrack. My biggest problem with the film ? The camera work made me wish it was over much faster. The constant cuts,  and splits and double and triple vision drove me crazy. This is one of the rare instances that the camera distracted you from the story. That little girl, Dakota is going to be a very big star. Over all a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Creasy and Pita suddenly become bonded to one another. When Pita is kidnapped; Creasy, seriously wounded, vows revenge against those who were involved with the kidnapping. With the help of a newspaper journalist (Rachel Ticotin), Creasy discovers that the crime was committed by a organization of corrupt Mexico City Judicial Police officers and her father as a way to get his company out of debt. Determined to get Pita back, Creasy must risk his own life to get the bad guys off of the streets and get the girl that he was meant to protect back to her family.

True movie magic,"The chemistry between Walken, Washington and Fanning was something rarely witnessed in movie-making. The emotion conveyed was real and genuine.

Years from now when Dakota Fanning has had even greater film success, people will look back at this movie as a classic for its time. Everything about this movie is vivid and the drama is real.

"Fairly intense film for the right audience, but has some structural flaws","Do you like ""MTV-style"" editing and cinematography? If not, steer clear of Man on Fire, because visually, it's two and a half hours of non-stop ""extended techniques"".The bigger question, for those of us who at least do not mind that style is whether it works for the film. It's not always clear why Man on Fire was composed in this unusual manner, but it's at least usually interesting. There are occasional elements--like the ""floating subtitles""--that seem ill advised, and there are other flaws, but during a good chunk of the latter half, Man on Fire is a solid ten. For me, the film averaged out to a low eight, or a ""B minus"".Although it's just implied in the film, we can tell that Creasy (Denzel Washington) and Rayburn (Christopher Walken) have known each other for a very long time. Rayburn is living in Mexico, where Man on Fire is set. He's well off. Creasy has just arrived in Mexico, and we learn, partially through implication again, that he's been basically ""on the run"". Apparently, Creasy and Rayburn have some dirty secrets in their past, although we never learn exactly what.Through his Mexican contacts, Rayburn discovers that Samuel (Marc Anthony) is looking to hire a bodyguard for his wife, Lisa (Radha Mitchell), and daughter, Pita (Dakota Fanning). Creasy ends up taking the job.Meanwhile, we've learned during the opening credits that per the film's world, at least, there is a kidnapping in Mexico about once every sixty minutes. When you put all of this together, it's pretty clear where Man on Fire is headed.And that's one of the problems. We know that surely there's going to be at least a kidnapping attempt. Yet, director Tony Scott takes an hour just to establish his characters and set the scene. The first hour of the film tends to drag. Yes, it's nice that Scott decided to add some depth to his characters, but an hour is simply too long. There's an unofficial ""rule"" in screen writing that says you should arrive at your principle dilemma by about twenty-five minutes into the script. That's stretched out to sixty minutes here. Man on Fire is actually a remake of a 1987 film by the same name directed by Elie Chouraqui. That film was only ninety minutes. I'm not sure why Scott and scripter Brian Helgeland decided to extend the story so much (although I'd suspect that it was to try to incorporate more of the original novel by A.J. Quinnell), but it just wasn't a good idea.Related to this problem, there's a ""false climax"" at around the two-hour mark that seems like a natural stopping point, but the story continues for another half-hour. This material is engaging enough, but except for the very ending, it seems like it would have been better for most of it to appear before the ""false climax"".At any rate, structural problems aside, what makes Man on Fire work as well as it does is the gradual transformation of Creasy from a bit of a sad sack, drunk has-been to an unstoppable vengeance machine. The middle section becomes fairly brutal, and the combination of intense violence and ""arty"" cinematography works well.The performances are all good to excellent. Fanning has been impressive in every film I've seen her in so far. Walken is a bit underused, but the focus is on Washington, who is somewhat in a Training Day (2001) mode, and excellent at that.The Mexican setting is very attractive visually. For most audiences, it gives Man on Fire an almost otherworldly feel that helps sell what turns into almost superhuman abilities for Creasy. Scott also tries to make the film more believable by having a ""where are they now"" tag at the end. That can backfire for some viewers--my wife was impressed thinking that it was based on a true story, but actually lowered her score when she learned it wasn't, because of believability factors (she also was bothered by the same structural problems that I thought were troublesome, plus, unlike me, she often dislikes endings where not everyone walks away happy and satisfied).As for the MTV-styled visuals, Scott's camera is almost constantly in motion. There is a lot of hand-held work, a lot of shots going in and out of focus, a lot of quick cuts, a lot of superimposition or ""cross-fading"", a lot of unusual film and color processing, and so on--even though I like arty cinematography a lot, and I found much to praise here, it even began to make _me_ dizzy after awhile. The visuals are oddest during the beginning, as otherwise it's fairly straightforward dramatic material. The energy of the visuals provides a very strange contrast to the deliberate pacing of the character development in the first section.But the bottom line is that this becomes a fairly intense actioner/thriller. It's nowhere near ""perfect""--you need a lot of patience and a lot of time to spare, but viewed under the right conditions by someone who doesn't mind the flashy camera-work, Man on Fire is definitely worth a viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"This movie had action and suspense, it was very entertaining.","I thought his movie stared off slowly, but when it took off...It really took off.

Denzel did a good job of giving us a peek inside the mind of a remorseful assassin .Again Denzel's performance was superb! I was also very impressed with Dakota Fanning's performance.
