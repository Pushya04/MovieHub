"Three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel. Got it?","I distinctly remember the collective groan from the James Bond fan base back in the mid 2000's when the announcement came that Daniel Craig would replace Pierce Brosnan as the new James Bond. Fans were up in arms because Daniel Craig has blonde hair and baby blue eyes, instead of themore traditional darker traits that were synonymous with the James Bond character. Funny how once 'Casino Royale' was actually released, those skeptics immediately disappeared.Daniel Craig proves he has the charm, elegance, presence, and confidence that the fans have come to expect from James Bond. He just has a very powerful aura about him from that start that easily establishes him as the next James Bond.Mads Mikkelsen plays the main antagonist Le Chiffre, who is one of my favorite James Bond villains. The film actually provides insight into his backstory to shed some light on the motivations behind his actions. Le Chiffre is humanized because the audience simply understands his reasons for being ""the bad guy"", which makes him much more relatable and interesting as a character. This is the antithesis of traditional Bond villains that have a tendency to be very over-the-top and evil just for the sake of being evil.Eva Green plays Vesper Lynd, who is assigned to supervise James Bond during his mission. Not only is Eva Green stunningly beautiful, she also perfectly portrays the charm, wit, determination, and overall likeability of Vesper. Not much can be said without getting into spoiler territory, but I will say her story arc is one of the highlights of the movie. The women in the James Bond franchise have historically been shallow sex objects, but Vesper's character contains significantly depth than female characters in prior films.The action sequences are perfectly placed throughout the film and choreographed beautifully. However, some of the most suspenseful scenes in the film aren't even the scenes with action. The high stakes poker game itself unfolds in a way that creates enormous suspense and excitement. These scenes at the card table are so perfectly crafted, the audience is left with even greater anticipation and excitement than any action scene in the film.Every part of 'Casino Royale' is extraordinarily well-written. The characters are interesting, relatable, and have depth. The plot is stimulating and compelling. The movie is beautifully shot. There is so much attention to detail. There are so many small moments scattered throughout the film that add massive amounts of depth to the story. There are many elements of cinematography utilized, like lighting/colors/camera angles, that perfectly complement the storytelling aspect of the film.'Casino Royale' is not just a good James Bond film, it's a good film altogether. It's a must-watch film for anyone, whether or not you're a fan of the James Bond franchise.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

One of the best Bond movies in years,"I saw this at a cast and crew screening in London last weekend: I'm not a huge Bond fan, but I do enjoy them on a purely popcorn level and this was definitely one of the best in recent memory. The tone is much edgier and nastier than the Brosnan movies, harking back more to Dr. No or For Your Eyes Only. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited for maximum impact and are some of the best out of any Bond movie. Martin Campbell, who also made 'Goldeneye', was an excellent choice and, for me, is one of the best Bond directors. What gives this the lead over recent Bonds is the more realistic feel: the exotic locales, fast cars, spectacular action, beautiful women and many other Bond hallmarks are all here but gone is the campy tone that marred, say, Die Another Day. Yes, the whole franchise is based on an entirely ridiculous and cartoonish notion but the more serious and harder-edged tone works really well here. In this context, Daniel Craig gives an excellent performance as Bond. I'll be the first to admit that I raised an eyebrow when I heard he was cast but he really makes it his own. It's hard to say whether he's better than any of the other Bonds: Connery and Brosnan felt right for the style of Bond movies they were in. Here, as suits the overall tone of the film, Bond is much more of a sadist, a cold-hearted killer with very little sense of empathy and Craig, with his piercing eyes, suits the role very well. He's charming and funny when required and totally convincing in the action sequences. The violence is less cartoon-like and flippant, too, with every punch, kick and shooting looking like they really hurt. Also, the story is just much more engaging than many a Bond film; the script's not going to win awards but it's consistently inventive and intriguing. Whilst the film has enough of it's fair share of action, the emphasis is equally on character and storyline and less on gadgets and sheer implausibility. When there isn't a huge action sequence happening, you don't miss it: the film's longest set-piece, the poker game at the Casino Royale, is as (or not more) gripping and entertaining than any of the chases and shoot-outs. The only minor gripes that I have are a slightly too long running time: the film drags a wee bit towards the end and, although it helps the tone of the film, we don't hear enough of the Bond theme tune! However, great directing and performances from everyone involved, along with Phil Meheux's excellent cinematography, Peter Lamont's as ever superb production design and all the other top-notch craft and technical departments make 'Casino Royale' a classy and very enjoyable night out at the movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"An impressively dark, engaging and exciting entry in the Bond series  just what it needed after Die Another Day","Having just achieved his 00 status, James Bond is assigned to uncover a plot by tracking a bomber for hire. The mission could not go worse as Bond kills the man in an embassy in front of CCTV cameras. Removed from the mission by M, Bond nevertheless follows the only lead he has to Miami where he finds himself working round the edges of a plot by criminal Le Chiffre to invest his clients money in the stock market just before an engineered event should send shares in a direction favourable for him.After the poor CGI and overblown (if fun) affair that was Die Another Day, the series was at risk of just throwing more and more money at the screen in an attempt to exaggerate and increase the Bond formula to keep fans happy. And, in fairness it seems financially to be working for them but this is not to say that the drastically scaled back feel of Casino Royale is not a welcome change of direction for the series, because for me it most certainly was. Opening with a gritty, short and violent pre-credit sequence, the film moves through a cool title sequence with a typically Bondian (if only so-so) theme song. The film then immediately marks itself out as a step away from the previous film by launching on a great action sequence that is as overblown as the series requires but yet is all the better for seeming real  no ropy Die Another Day CGI here. Casting free-runner Foucan was a great move and this sequence was the high for me. After this the film develops nicely with a solid plot that engaged me easily enough, with interesting characters along the way.Of course this isn't to say that the series has suddenly put out an introspective character piece, because the world of Bond is all still here. So we have superhuman stunts, gadgets (albeit a practical self-defibrillator as opposed to a mini-helicopter) and the usual types of characters going the way we expect. Those expecting this self-styled ""reboot"" to provide a depth and emotion that isn't there will be disappointed but regardless this does the Bond formula well  fans will enjoy it and those that were turned off by Die Another Day will find it a welcome return to darker territory. With all the fanboys tired from bemoaning Craig, it is nice to actually see for ourselves what he can do and mostly he is very good. He convinces as a heartless killer and has the presence that suggests that he could do ruthless damage if he had to. I was a bit put off by how regularly he pouts but generally he brings a gravitas to the character that it benefits from. Green is a pretty good Bond girl and brings much, much more to the role than Berry did in the last film. Mikkelsen is a good foil for Bond and is given more interest by his lack of stature (he is essentially facing his last role of the dice in several ways). Dench is as solid as ever while Wright makes a shrewd move in a small character that offers more of the same for a few years to come.Overall then this is not the brilliant, flawless film that many have claimed, but I completely understand why it has been greeted with such praise. Sat beside Die Another Day, it is a wonderfully dark and brooding Bond with great action replacing some of the CGI and gadget excesses of recent times. Those upset at his blue eyes are best left fuming on the net, because Craig is a great Bond  capable of being dark with the violence and offering the potential for more if the material comes to meet him. A refreshing film with the bond formula in place but with a dark and comparatively restrained tone that makes it realistic enough to get into while still existing in the spy fantasy world.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Excellent prequel to the series,"Though it doesn't care too much about the series' continuity (it's supposed to be Bond's first mission as a 00 agent, but it takes place after the Cold war and Judi Dench is already M), ""Casino Royale"" is a great re-creation of the series. Cool action, great thrills and a more humane Bond more than make up for the purported lack of gadgets. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a rough secret who only gradually acquires the class and cold demeanor we all know and love. He makes mistakes in the course of his mission, but that makes him even more of a hero. Although I found it hard at first to cope with Craig's looks, he is more than suitable as the character. Bond is portrayed as a man with flaws and weaknesses, which makes him look even stronger. The story is not your usual Bond plot and relies more on classical thrills than technology, though the action is extremely hard-boiled. Kudos to the creepy Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre and Eva Green as Vesper Lynd for creating remarkably believable characters. A definite must-see for Bond fans : it should reconcile at last Ian Fleming aficionados and fans of the film series !",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bond isn't just back, he's at the top of his game","James Bond is back and he is alive and well. Any questions about Daniel Craig's worthiness are thrown out almost immediately as we are handed a film filled to the brim with exquisite action and explosive emotion. I squirmed in my seat with delight as I have not done since I was a child. What ""Batman Begins"" did for that franchise, ""Casino Royale"" does, and more, for Bond. For a while it seemed that he might not be able to well exist outside the confines of the cold war, but here we are given an entirely modern Bond with enough nods to the original that we can't be too upset. Maybe it's because this is the last novel yet to be filmed in the traditional Bond manner and it is Ian Fleming who has stolen our hearts not this incarnation of the super spy. However I like to think that someone actually just got their act together and concentrated on the film itself as opposed to who they could get the most product placement money out of. Congratulations. James Bond will live on for at least one more generation, and maybe forever. Great set pieces and one of the best chase sequences not involving cars ever put on screen, blended with beautiful locations and even more lovely women add up to the perfect cocktail with the twisting story line acting as the lemon peel in the martini, holding it all together. Many will come out saying that this is the best Bond film ever and I can not rightly say they are wrong at this point. Only time will tell that tale. However every fan can be assured that this ranks amongst the very upper crust of Bond movies, and Craig is no Lazenby. He lends a harsh wit and a thuggish charm to the character and by the end he's no longer the new guy, he is Bond, James Bond. A masterpiece of popular film-making and the movie we have been waiting for all year. See it early and often as it is sure not to diminish upon reviewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Name might be Bond; but everything else is different,"OK, it's a good film  in fact it is a great film. It's just not a Bond film.I've got a few bits of ranting to do here, so excuse the lack of clear narrative.Casino Royale has just had its opening weekend here in the UK and it's the HIGHEST GROSSING FIRST WEEKEND FOR ANY BOND FILM EVER!!!. That's because cinema tickets are even more expensive than they were three years ago when Die Another Day came out. Also, since when has the weekend started on a Thursday? That's when I watched it, along with a load of other mugs who netted the cinemas £1.7m on the first day / preview.Daniel Craig is undoubtedly a fine actor. I was particularly impressed with him in the virtually unseen The Trench. He has also put in some time to go to the gym, which is something I certainly don't have the discipline to do. He also looks bloody great in a suit while toting advanced automatic weaponry. I'm not so sure about the whole swimming trunk issue - if you want equality, fine, but that means some girls in bikinis too  that's how equality works. The whole taciturn, monosyllabic persona is great for Jason Bourne or possibly The Terminator, but this is Bond, with a cheesy quip for every situation: Sean Connery' - That's quite a nice little nothing you're almost wearing. I approve.' George Lazenby - 'this never happened to the other guy' (perhaps Craig was thinking of that when he was putting on his trunks). Roger Moore - elevated eyebrow, Pierce Brosnan - 'I thought Christmas only came once a year'. It takes Craig the entire film to unfreeze his face for long enough to say 'Bond, James Bond.'Then the gadgets oh well. James Bond is not a real person. He was never meant to be, he is a construct and a very important part of that construct is the gadgets. He is defined more by the car he drives and the clothes he wears than he is by his hair-colour or physique. To take this away from him is to empty him out rather than 'strip him back' as everyone is so fond of saying of Craig-Bond. To be honest I've not been happy with the whole Aston Martin thing since Ford bought Aston Martin, the '64 DB6 is a great hand-built bit of kit. The DBS is built in bulk for dull bankers who need something to blow their bonuses on. The whole travesty of the hire car at the airport is just completely beyond the pale. Okay Ford gave them £15m and a load of Jaguars and Astons, but Bond works for Queen and country, not for the highest bidder, and he is met the airport, not hanging about the Hertz desk while some fat tourists complain about their car not having a/c. So what have we got left? He has a defibrillator in the glove box of his car  old men with inappropriately young wives have defibs in their glove boxes.Eva Green is pretty easy on the eye, but her real name is better than her Bond name (Vesper Lind sounds like a limited edition chocolate moped  sorry Mr Fleming). Her accent was weird and all over the shop, and her motivation was pretty confused for one supposed to be so bright. And can we not have any more Bond falling in love? Please? Weirdly Lazenby and Rigg managed to pull it off, but really Bond is a swinger at heart and modern girls can get their kicks with them too. This debacle just makes the end of the film drag on and on.Speaking of the ending, basically wtf! Bond films don't end like that. They just don't. I can't believe I'm not allowed to spoil it for you, but I can take solace in the fact that it spoils itself.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Never say Bond again,"It is a wee bit surprising that Casino Royale is rated so high. Though its a very good smart action flick with all the works, chase and stunts and blowing up a house in Venice and you know what, but its absolutely not a Bond movie. Well, i love movies like MI, Bourne Identity, Munich, etc., but its not the same when you are making a movie based on a cult figure here. Its like Mart being remixed and played in a nightclub. Craig is a good action hero but when you are playing Bond you have to restrain yourself because for heavens sake Bond is not a cowboy. Bond is not about muscles and thats where the director misses the plot. We have been flooded with remakes and a more ""realistic"" and ""original"" portrayal of our legendary figures which is accepted as creative license, but sometimes its better to leave a few things as they are/were.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Great Actor As Bond,"What a difference a great actor makes. Daniel Craig is superb as James Bond and parting from that point everything in it is enjoyable, frightening, thrilling just because we're with him. He conquered us from the word go. The initial chase is one of the best in film history and as soon as we get to know this new incarnation of the iconic Ian Fleming character, we're hooked. He's virile but there is room for ambiguity. He's elegant but as, the sensational Eva Green, points out is more acquired than inherited. More working class than even Sean Connery and that works wonders for Mr Bond. The script is more compact and organic. The locations are breathtaking and what else I can say? The series have been reinvigorated, rejuvenated and in one single stroke have secured that this franchise will live forever. A note to Barbara Broccoli, the producer, your father would be so proud.

Daniel Craig you are here to stay!,"This is among the best bond movies!

The movie as a whole is extremely entertaining and exciting.The acting is awesome Eva Green actually does a great job and has really improved her acting from the last time i saw her (in kingdom of heaven), but then this is a totally different movie.There's a lot of action mixed with great story which i am sure will please the true Bond fan.Please go and watch this because you will regret if you don't, forget the past this is the New Bond.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"""Millenium"" series James Bond - top-of-the-line!","In the original Bond series, only a handful of films really attempted to touch base with the novels of Ian Fleming. ""Dr. No"" showed the Fleming feeling for character and action, but introduced elements to the plot that detracted from the 'hard-boiled' spy story that Fleming thought he was writing; ""Thunderball"" came close, but that was because Fleming developed the story on commission for the film. ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" had the book's plot pretty down pat, and was made in a kind of 'grand adventure' style, but of course it suffered from the choice of Lazenby - a professional model, not an actor - as Bond. ""The Living Daylights"" showed the producers' interest in returning to the roots, but Dalton was uncomfortable playing Bond, and uncomfortable with the wisecracks which had become part of the character's schtick - and which were really badly written for the Dalton films. ""Goldeneye"" was admirable attempt to update the Fleming milieu for the end of the Cold War, but left the character himself as yet without an 'updated' definition.The decision to make a 21st Century version of Fleming's first Bond novel - and, beyond the update, to remain true to the novel, sans comic patter, sans sci-fi techno-schtick, sans major rewrite of the basic plot - promised to present Bond fans of all ages with a direct challenge. Do we want the hard-boiled spy Fleming first envisioned - patterned after Chandler's Philip Marlowe and W. Somerset Maughm's Ashenden (""or: The British Agent"")? Or would we really rather have the suave stand-up comedian and Playboy magazine contributor introduced by Broccoli, Maibaum, Young, and company, in the second Connery film, ""From Russia With Love""?Well, the votes are still being tallied on that.As someone who came to Bond reading ""Goldfinger"" at the tender age of twelve (the phrase ""round, firm, pointed breasts"" has been an inspiration to me since), the closer the films came to the sense of the novels, the happier I was.So of course, this version of Bond is a joyous surprise for me - my youthful daydreams have been vindicated and at last fully satisfied. There are indeed elements added to the plot, but they are completely congruent with it. There is the use of current technology, but no techno-schtick - i.e., no Q. and no ""gadgets"". There are the luscious Bond babes (2 - the minimum Bond requirement), but there is no attempt to reduce them to photogenic sex-toys.Fleming's plot actually requires the film's addition of some heavy action sequences (all done very snappy, with a brutally realistic edge), because the novel is very claustrophobic; the original TV version of the story (1955, with Barry Nelson as 'Jimmy Bond'), only used three indoor sets, because it could - except for the car chase and an attempted bombing at an outdoor café, Fleming's novel took place almost entirely within Bond's hotel suite and the gaming room. The film's opening this novel out to the world is actually quite welcome, and does not affect the central plot or its theme.The character of Bond presented in this film may disappoint followers of the original films, but the news is, this is FLEMING's Bond - an orphan uncertain of his own identity, a disillusioned romantic trying hard to pretend he's incapable of emotions, a middle class, middle-brow, middle-level management type who just happens to kill people for a living. But he does it extremely well.The other problem some general viewers may have is the level of violence in the film; having determined to film the novel realistically, director Martin Campbell has decided to ditch the 'B-movie' violence of most of the earlier films, and present us the violence with a hard 'British neo-noir' edge to it. Given the romantic plot twist toward the end, this would be a perfect date movie - except that the violence left some of the female viewers in the theater I attended clearly unsettled. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is part of the gestalt of the film's experience.Cambell's direction is very good; the writing is crisp; production values are very high; the photography is stunning. Some of the stunt work is truly remarkable, worthy competition for Jackie Chan. The acting is rock-solid and believable for these characters. There is plenty of muscle for the action-film fan, and some real brains for the more general viewer to ponder later.This film is best viewed with minimal reliance on knowledge of the previous series. In fact, it functions perfectly well as a 'one-off', a film without a series.But of course, the ending invites a sequel. In Godzilla terms, Connery and Moore having given us the 'showa' Bond, Dalton and Brosnan the ""Heisei"" Bond, we now have the ""Millenium"" series James Bond - not a prequel nor even a 'reboot', but, really, an entirely new series about the same character. It is probably too much to hope for, but maybe they can make the sequels just as good as this.As a genre film it never quite lifts above its genre; so normally I would only give it ""nine stars"" as a film.However, as a film within its genre, it is top-of-the-line - so it gets a ten.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Not the Bond I Grew Up With,"I miss the Bond I grew up with. Thought the film was about 30 minutes too long. If the goal of the producers was to take Bond back to his roots, then why bring back the actress that played M in the role for the past four films. Also, if their goal was to make Bond appeal to a younger audience then based on who I saw at the theater last night, they missed the mark. The action scenes were great and Daniel Craig is a very good actorbut I miss my Bond I have come to know. I must say I was disappointed in the opening title sequence.

Something Must Be Wrong With Me,"I'm going to level with you all, straight up:I prefer gin martinis, stirred- not shaken (though I actually do like Vespers).My favorites Bond Movie is Live and Let Die.My Favorite Bond Actor is Roger Moore (except in Octopussy).I actually like the Dalton years.I find no redeeming value in George Lazenby's portrayal,That said, I went into this film knowing it was going to be different. After all the producers have been promising us that since the end of Die Another Day. Well as anyone who has seen any long-running franchise can tell you, reinvention isn't always a good thing. I like both the book and the film interpretations of Bond, but I think they work better when they are separated. Everyone who is a fan of the books, wanted to see a serious adaptation of Casino Royale, and to be honest I did too. But as the old saying goes, be careful what you wish for. I sit on the fence on this particular film. It wasn't the worst, but there were many little things that bother me. First and foremost, the product placement really stood out this time around. I know it is nothing new, but it just really was distracting, at first I would chuckle at the appearance of Sony cell phones, because the movie was co-produced by them. Then I sorta giggled at the appearance of the stacked Smirnoff vodka at the Miami airport (both because the bottles were far too large to be allowed in that area of an airport, and because by law, liquor can't be sold that way), but by the time they had a near close-up of the logo of Bond's tux jacket, I'd had enough. Also, even in the books, Bond doesn't kill with a cold heart, he does it because he has to, and essentially because it's the only thing he is good at. In this, although we see the physical difficulties of his work (which I must admit were rather impressive stunt scenes), the psychological aspects are simply paid lip service, an occasional ""Gee, this is bad"" but really we didn't see any progress or growth. Bond's trademark wit is missing, though it's early in his 00-career (btw, 00-status is an invention of the movies, in the books agents are merely given sequential numbers, the last Flemming novel makes mention of the death of 016 for example), it's not unrealistic for him to make the odd quip or two, which are although kinda outlandish, actually they're pretty realistic because it's a defense mechanism. Bond is bad ass, but he's not a hard ass. Even Dalton knew how to toss out one-liners with a certain amount of irony. And I miss the real gadgets, cell phones and laptops don't count, unless they explode, release tear gas, or also make espresso. One more minor gripe, why the heck doesn't Bond go back to the Walther PPK? Ever since Brosnan switched in Tomorrow Never Dies, it's driven me nuts, and you'd think for ""getting back to the basics"" they'd use that too. That said, considering the unremarkable script, the acting is above par. The action and stunt sequences are impressive. And the location shooting is absolutely stunning. However I missed the traditional theme, which didn't appear until the end, and even then sounded like it was rather poor cover. One of the great things about the theme is that it can be adjusted to the situation on screen and makes for an outstanding running soundtrack, here was a wannabe theme, that devolved from the unremarkable opening credits song.Update 2008: I gave this film another star, because my early evaluation of some of the music elements was based on the theater I saw the film in. With a sound system that's actually geared for more than explosions, the theme sounds much better.Call it a double standard, but I like the traditional movie Bond. Allowing for the 3 Billion US Dollars earned by the 20 preceding films, I think it's fair to say that most other people did too. But the producers decided to mess with an otherwise winning formula. It'd be fine as an action film, but it just isn't a true Bond film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An all-time Bond favourite,"I've long been a fan of the James Bond series but I couldn't help but feel that Pierce Brosnan was the worst Bond: smarmy, ever-knowing, hammy and taking the films as a joke. So I was pretty pleased when I heard that Daniel Craig was to take over the role, and that CASINO ROYALE would attempt to take the Bond series back to its roots. The good news is that CASINO ROYALE is a great Bond film, the best since Timothy Dalton starred in the role, and it ably offers all that fans would expect from the spy genre: tense stand-offs, lots of brutal fight scenes, assassins, globe-trotting hijinks, lengthy chases and double-crossing galore. The film is criss-crossed with intense action scenes and, indeed, things kick off with a hi-stakes chase atop a crane as Craig chases after a ""free running"" villain.The action can't get much better than this but it frequently proves to be top-notch, with a great truck chase at an airport and a sinking building in Venice. The hand-to-hand combat is intense and punishing, really pushing the boundaries of the film's 12 certificate. Elsewhere, Bond bags the sexiest Bond girl in a VERY long time – I'm talking about Eva Green, a French newcomer who popped up in KINGDOM OF HEAVEN. Thankfully, she's not swathed in heavy robes here, and she's a real stunner.I liked the fresh feel that this film bought to the franchise. Much of the suspense comes from a lengthy game of poker; doesn't sound too interesting, you might think, but it's got more tension than a dozen Vin Diesel movies. There's a layer of finesse and style over the whole proceedings and the locations and cars are as breathtaking as ever. Craig puts in a very good, concentrated effort in his first outing as Bond; he recalls Timothy Dalton's dark, angsty turn in the role and blows Pierce Brosnan clean out of the water. Although this is the longest Bond movie ever, it never becomes boring, and even the romance and exposition is interesting for a change. I can't wait for the next film!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond with a touch of the the Bourne supremacy,"I saw this at a special premiere and i was amazed. having never been a Bond fan i wasn't really expecting much from this. After watching Brosnans invisible car in the previous incarnation I thought it could only get worse. How wrong was I! this film is gritty and sharp. the dialogue is sharp and well thought out with Daniel Craig being the DEFINITIVE Bond. He exudes confidant menace. They have gone back to basics with this Bond ie character and dialogue driven and not thankfully gadget driven. Not only is it the best bond film out so far its one of the years best films out. They have borrowed some elements from the Bourne series of films which is long overdue on the franchise, more realistic fight sequences and with Daniel Craig actually looking like a physically capable man instead of the middle aged paunch of Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan who both quite frankly couldn't beat up a Ritz cracker.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Reboot with a bang,"Daniel Craig stars in this reboot to the Bond franchise. The prologue sets the darker and grittier mood right away. It's black and white, and it's hard violence. Just in case you didn't get the message. The story goes pretty quickly to Daniel Craig jumping on giant cranes, in a crazy parkour chase. This is not your daddy's Bond.This Bond starts off as a brash guy who just got his double o designation. He's physical. The action is more visceral, not as much cartoon violence. Bond as a physical specimen is epitomized by the bikini shot. It's not a Bond girl that gets the big bikini reveal. It's Bond.The story does have a slowdown after the crane to pick up all the pieces of the story. Once it gets going again, and this time he doesn't stop. But it's not simply more action that's the difference from Pierce Brosnan. It's the rejection of all that is Bond cheese. The smirky tone, and the perfunctory womanizing are all gone.Mads Mikkelsen provides a good menacing foil. And Eva Green provides the proper love interest. However she comes in an hour into the movie and would be better to have more screen time. At least, she and Bond have good verbal exchanges with the time they have, and the movie really takes off. Bond is monogamous. Who knew?",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Royale without cheese.,"Casino Royale is a major step-up from the flamboyant Die Another Day. Pierce Brosnan has been replaced by a young-ish Daniel Craig, there is no Q, no campy gadgets, no silly naked women silhouettes in the opening credits, no world-dominating super-colossus villains, no Miss Funnyfanny (or whatever), and no silly one-liners after killing bad guys. Basically everything that can date Bond film very quickly is gone. I never expected international espionage to look the way it has in past few Bond outings and I'm glad someone had the balls to go back to the hard-edged nature of the series, last seen in Licence to Kill.The longest Bond movie so far, at 145 minutes, but it breezes by even though it reigns in on the normally excessive action scenes and depicts spying a more 'mundane' and 'realistic' manner (or at least as true as the series has been so far). But the one-thing that bugs me about action movies, particularly the Bond franchise, is that they are, most of the time, childish male fantasies with an indestructible hero who has fun shooting up the place and beds beautiful women. I would like something new for a change but Casino Royale does have Bond get hurt and go through more pain than he has previously.Daniel Craig got a lot of hassle over his casting as Bond but not only does he have his youth as an advantage (he's the first 30-something to be cast in the role since Lazenby), he's also pretty damn trim, has the intensity Brosnan lacked and is surprisingly loose in a role that usually requires actors to be stiff and unemotional. It's also good to a fresh face in the role and who cares if he is blonde? Or the shortest actor to play him so far? I would have preferred that composer David Arnold went too. They didn't seem to be holding back on the amount of regular production team members who got axed. Even Vic Armstrong didn't return. I've never liked Arnold's work on the movies and I hate to think of it as something that's now exclusively HIS baby.Unfortunately, as good as this fresh start to the franchise was, all of the goodwill that director Martin Campbell earned was completely undone by the follow-up Quantum of Solace, which is not only the worst Bond film so far, but one of the worst action films, and one of the worst films overall, that I have ever seen.If Craig and Co. ever get around to making another, they've got a LOT to make up for.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A movie not focused on the car race itself, but its consequences","I grew up watching James Bond movies, enamored by the gadgets, cool cars, femme fatales, and timeless, quirky villains. The soundtracks were top tier, featuring greats like Shirley Bassey and Paul McCartney cataloged nicely on one CD. :)But this momentous fascination with the Bond series, unfortunately, did not carry on into adulthood. I began to ask myself critical questions like, ""Why does a secret agent introduce himself by his actual name everywhere he goes?"" And when you start with that line of questioning, the Bond series does not hold up, with a few exceptions.Eventually, you realize the entire Bond persona is an act. Bond is supposed to be, in a way, the epitome of manliness and he is in fact simply the opposite: a womanizer, a psychopath, a cold exterior with no humanity behind it.I say all of this about the Bond franchise and yet none of it describes Daniel Craig's portrayal of Bond in Casino Royale. And if songs, movies, or productions in general are popular upon their release and then slowly fade into obscurity as they are reviewed more harshly, what is the fate of Casino Royale?This movie is a classic. It will be perceived as perhaps the best Bond film of all time. It is a great film that happens to have a character named James Bond in it. It is at times a brainless action thriller, and at times an emotional rollercoaster. The clever dialogue makes you laugh, cry, and shout. You CARE about the characters! Bond here is the man trying to be fearless, trying to be tough, and yet what we witness is a constant undercurrent of fear. Fear of failure, fear of inadequacy, fear of loss, etc. We, for the first time in the Bond franchise, witness REMORSE, sorrow, self reflection, and stone cold betrayal. We see a movie not focused on the car race itself, but its consequences.Yes, we have to suspend our disbelief because this IS an action movie. A ten minute sprint still does not render this man out of breath. Hand to hand combat in a building where floor joists are inexplicably coming lose and falling still does not leave Bond with a single scratch. If we can tolerate this, there is so much more substance here than any other movie in this franchise. And yes, we receive an explanation, FINALLY, for a secret agent introducing himself as his ACTUAL NAME!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Where was the James Bond?,"I was a big fan of Pierce Brosnan and his shoes will be hard to fill. Craig was adequate, but would not have been my first choice as a replacement. The bigger issue i had with this movie is the script. It is a complete departure from a proved formula for the James Bond movie. Bond was not particularly suave or witty. The first car he drives is a Ford! Are you kidding me?! (He does eventually get he's Aston Martin.) I know they are trying to give the female character more depth by creating some depth to the relationship, but there are two problems here. One, it goes against everything that is the Bond character and two if you're going to have these characters fall in love then let it play out. The biggest flaw was the villain himself. Bond must have a nemisis. The big-shot evil-doer is a dirty accountant, a screw up and a wuss. We don't need Bond to clean up Enron. All that said the movie isn't as horrible as i've made it out to seem. It was worth watching, once. This just isn't your typical Bond movie and in my opinion simply isn't as good.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""A Dazzling Dance of Danger and Deception""","""Casino Royale"" is the first bond movie i ever saw. Casino Royale, the 2006 reboot of the James Bond franchise, is not just a film; it's an exhilarating experience that redefines what a spy thriller can be. Breaking away from the glitzy excesses of its predecessors, this film takes us on a thrilling ride through the gritty underbelly of high-stakes poker, featuring a raw and vulnerable Bond portrayed brilliantly by Daniel Craig in his debut.The plot centers around Bond's mission to thwart a terrorist financier, Le Chiffre, played chillingly by Mads Mikkelsen. The tension builds as Bond engages in a high-stakes poker game at the titular Casino Royale in Montenegro, where fortunes are won and lost not just with cards, but with lives. The stakes are not just monetary; they are existential, creating a palpable sense of suspense that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Director Martin Campbell masterfully blends breathtaking action sequences with character-driven storytelling. The film's cinematography is stunning, showcasing the opulence of European casinos juxtaposed with the stark reality of Bond's violent world. Each card dealt becomes a heart-pounding moment, effectively pulling the audience deeper into the game.The development of Bond's relationship with Vesper Lynd, played by the enchanting Eva Green, adds emotional depth rarely seen in previous installments. Their chemistry is electric, and Vesper serves as a formidable counterpart to Bond, challenging his emotional detachment and ultimately shaping his transformation throughout the film.The score by David Arnold complements the film perfectly, enhancing the tension and excitement without overwhelming the narrative. From the opening parkour chase to the hauntingly beautiful ending, every note serves to elevate the film's emotional stakes.In essence, Casino Royale is a masterclass in storytelling-balancing action, drama, and character development flawlessly. It revitalizes the Bond legacy, presenting a more human and relatable spy who grapples with his demons. This film is a must-see not just for Bond fans, but for anyone who appreciates a sophisticated, artfully crafted cinematic experience.In a landscape filled with spy films, Casino Royale stands out not just as a new beginning for 007, but as a style and substance tour de force that redefined the genre.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Finally a good ""Real"" Bond!","Casino Royale is a Bond film that finally manages to pull of the ""real"" style correctly. There have been admirable efforts such as On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and the Timothy Dalton films, but none have quite pulled it off right. This is the 21st film in the ""never-ending"" franchise and also introduces us to our sixth actor to play Bond and the first to be based directly on Ian Fleming's initial novel, Casino Royale (excluding the 60s comedy film).Martin Campbell, who also directed one of my favorite 007 adventures in 1995, GoldenEye, returns to the director's chair to introduce us to yet another Bond-actor. This is the most real James Bond to date and is very believable portrayal filled with some of the best camera work you'll ever witness. It comes across as real, but it also keep to classic Bond roots by including cars, beautiful women, and even some more realistic gadgets, such as a tracking device inserted within his vein and a few others kept handy within the glove box of his Aston Martin. He may not wield a laser wristwatch, but he gets the job done.The action sequences in this film are perhaps the most intense to be put into any Bond film and shall keep you on the edge of your seat, because this may be the one film where you actually feel like James Bond is in danger. All previous films you knew that ""Hey, this is James Bond. He'll make it."" This one you can still think that while watching, but you certainly worry more for the title character than you have in the previous entries.Daniel Craig does well as the title character, and is very believable as a young James Bond starting his career. He walks as if he has a chip on his shoulder and you can tell this is the angriest Bond to date. He has yet to transform into the coolheaded Bond seen in Connery, Moore, and Brosnan, and he shows it in every way. This Bond hasn't even grown accustomed to wearing a suit! But he is however a good gambler and enjoys himself some cocktails.Judi Dench returns as M, the head of MI6. Dench who first took the role (being the first woman in the role) in the Brosnan film GoldenEye has always played a good character, but this time around she comes across as being a different type of M. This time she seems more like a worried-parent character, who treats Bond as though he is a child, because she knows he is not the Bond of legend at this point, and he needs guidance or he shall never turn into the coolheaded super agent that we all know and love.This is one of the best entries in the James Bond franchise, there is no denying that, but I do worry of how the Craig run will end. After Campbell left Brosnan he got pulled down by scripts that relied too heavily one gadgets and comic one-liners, and now I fear that Craig may end up being weighed down from becoming overly serious (see: Quantum of Solace). We must remember that Bond is a basically a comic-book type hero who is basically a superhero who wears a suit instead of a costume.Regardless of whether or not Craig's run ends on a good or bad note Casino Royale shall easily remain one of the best James Bond films ever made. Campbell should stop running off and stick to Bond, because it seems things start to go badly when he leaves his Bond actor in the hands of the sponsors.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Raw and close to being perfect,"One thing I just love about movies is when they take place in different countries and cities. Casino Royale is the best Bond film in my opinion, with Daniel Craig delivering a raw, more human portrayal of 007. The movie blends thrilling action, like the opening chase, with a tense poker game that keeps you on the edge of your seat.The relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd, beautifully portrayed by Eva Green, adds emotional depth to the story, making the tragic ending hit even harder.That being said, there are a few moments that influences the believability (I guess that's a part of the francise), such as the defibrillator scene and the dramatic car crash. However, these flaws barely detract from the film's intensity and style. For me, Casino Royale is a solid 8.5: a near-perfect mix of action, emotion, and classic Bond flair.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Outstanding, riveting, and refreshing","The 2006 debut of Daniel Craig as the new face of James Bond had extraordinary expectations of a long legacy to live up to, if not also high standards. 'Casino Royale' far surpassed them all, and in retrospect still remains one of the very best of all Bond films.Craig's incarnation of the master spy is written as much more raw and imperfect, distinctly contrasting with the finesse and refinement of his predecessors. This is reflected in the risks Bond takes, and his relationship with M that is notably rather contentious next to the more casually wary representation in past films. Even in dialogue with other characters, Bond demonstrates a brash attitude much less suave than we're used to seeing.This all makes particular narrative sense given that 'Casino Royale' represents Bond at the beginning of his career as a ""00"" agent, as seen in the pre-credits sequence. Action scenes are thrilling, and showcase a forcefulness that seems more physically demanding in appearance, if not in actuality. And extreme though some of it may be, at no point is it so over the top as to approach anywhere near the silliness or absurdity we became accustomed to with the films of Roger Moore, or Pierce Brosnan. On a similar note, there is no novel gadgetry on display in this film; Q Branch isn't even mentioned. Any instruments or devices employed throughout the plot, mostly computers or other electronic devices, are close enough to reality that their inclusion is more a necessity than it is a gimmick.Film-makers made a conscious effort with 'Casino Royale' to return James Bond to the basics, eschewing the excesses that have bogged down so much of the franchise. So, too, is Bond's approach to women noticeably restrained by comparison, as his only targets for romance are someone he uses to get close to an antagonist, and this feature's ever-requisite ""Bond girl."" Vesper Lynd is portrayed with intelligence and dueling severity and charm by the incomparable Eva Green, an actress whose skill is rivaled only by her beauty. Green is such a fine casting choice for Vesper, matching wits with Bond as they butt heads early on, and breaking hearts with the vulnerability she shows as the plot progresses. The burgeoning romance between the two leads is natural and believable, a rare welcome departure in the series from Bond's usually relentless, awful womanizing.And emphasizing once more the producers' effort to renew and transform James Bond: for all the action of the film, including the explosive climax, some of the greatest suspense comes with the quiet tension of the card game central to the narrative. Every actor present for these scenes bears such intensity in their countenance, conveying the extreme stakes of the event without any true need for verbal language. Moreover, it's during the game especially that we get to see Mads Mikkelsen embody the stewing malice and brilliance of chief antagonist Le Chiffre. And here, too, we meet Jeffrey Wright, a solid choice to play frequent Bond ally Felix Leiter in the latest Bond films. Between the screenplay and Wright's performance, Leiter is given more personality than he has at any other point in the franchise, even despite limited time on screen.We're still not done, though, because of course another iconic aspect of James Bond movies is the music. Composer David Arnold's original score is quite good, perfectly complementing the mood of any given scene and at times echoing the chords of the main theme. But as in previous films, it's the theme song that's most notable, and in this case especially: ""You know my name,"" performed by the late great Chris Cornell, is a bombastic, energizing rock song, immediately more sharp and grabbing with its combination of guitar and horn than any other theme song since perhaps Lulu's ""The man with the golden gun,"" 32 years before. The raw vigor of the song meshes neatly with the new version of James Bond we meet in 'Casino Royale, and at least in my mind it's one of the very best theme songs of the series.It's such a finely, carefully crafted film that its edge hasn't dulled one bit 15 years later. It's so good that there are only a handful of 007 pictures that can truly claim to keep its company. 'Casino Royale' was a much-needed shot in the arm for a series that had grown formulaic and heavily reliant on overdone tropes and self-indulgence. The emergence of a new lead actor, a greater emphasis on realism, and the purposeful effort to sidestep past immoderation revitalized the Bond franchise and primed audiences for more to come. Perhaps more than any of its brethren - with its intent of rejuvenation in mind, I think this is the Bond movie to watch for people who don't like Bond movies.If that's not a high compliment, I don't know what is.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Disappointing film is more revisionist/re-imagining than simply a grittier restart...,"At one point Ian Fleming thought the greatest of 007's Sean Connery might not even be fit for the role, as he may not be ""refined enough""... After seeing the camera tests a few times, he did become a believer and filming progressed. The rest was, as they say - history.I had high hopes for this new 007 film (which I anticipated greatly), and I must say after finally seeing this film Daniel Craig just doesn't fit. I watched, and this film unraveled itself as more of a ""pc"" re-imagining bit than simply a grittier Bond series restart ""as advertised"".To anyone who's actually read Ian Flemings novels (yes, they are indeed a tad darker), Bond nonetheless is still a smooth, sexy, and sophisticated ladies gent who prefers his martini's ""shaken, not stirred"". Craig felt forced... at times he even walked so stiff (like he had just finished up with his catwalk instructor and proceeded immediately to set) it seemed he was pretending so hard to be someone/something he wasn't. For a proper Bond casting it should all come off so natural.I don't know, Craig just didn't work, and neither did the revisionism writing/direction despite some decent action sequences. Ian Fleming himself had an official artists rendering ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Fleming007impression.jpg ) ordered up as to what he thought the Bond he created should look like - why stray from that vision? The films just needed to go die-hard to the source material and move away from the campy Hollywood direction to which they had digressed...",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
No No Seven,"The Bond franchise seems have taken a curious decision here, going back to the roots of the Bond legend and therefore giving us a Bond movie that isn't really a Bond movie at all, but rather a pre-Bond movie. Daniel Craig's Bond is something of an arrogant hothead, more smug than suave, who finds himself in the kind of predicaments that Connery et al never would. I can't imagine Sean having his goolies whacked while strapped naked to a seatless chair somehow. Definitely a tougher, more cynical Bond, the fact that he isn't the finished article shouldn't be held against Craig, who does reasonably well (although using an actor with the rugged features of Craig in a story going back to roots of a character previously portrayed by the suave likes of Connery, Moore and Brosnan seems a bizarre casting choice and just made it that more difficult to believe I was watching a Bond flick).The ending possibly bodes well for future instalments (the introduction of the Bond theme only after Craig has uttered Bond's immortal intro line was one of the few high points). Let's hope so - because all through this all I could think about was how much I missed the old Bonds.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Enjoyable, but hardly anything to go nuts over","To me, Bond movies are very low on the cinematic totem pole, occupying the space right above Elvis movies and right below non-Pixar CGI talking animal movies. The new Casino Royale has been hailed as a reinvention of the series, and in some ways it is. It loses most of the high-tech gadgets and takes itself a bit more seriously than its immediate, Pierce Brosnan-starring predecessors (which I'll admit are the only ones I'm really familiar with, with the single exception of Dr. No). But honestly, the differences have been exaggerated. It still relies heavily on huge action set-pieces with drawn-out chases and loud explosions. It's very much an action movie of the current generation, and in no way represents anything trailblazing, in Bond or anything else. The story may be more down to Earth and more complex (or complicated), but the action sequences are just as ludicrous as anything you'll find in your average summer blockbuster. Plus, the thing runs on forever, a ridiculous two and a half hours, and there are long stretches where I was getting rather bored (especially during the completely unbelievable and uncharacteristic sub-plot where James Bond falls in love). It does have its good points. Eva Green is chief among them, as the most interesting woman Bond has ever been involved with, and by far the best actress that I've ever seen in the series. The villain, played by Mads Mikkelsen, is also quite good, though perhaps too reminiscent in his appearance of some of the earlier Bond villains like Dr. No and Auric Goldfinger. Judi Dench is the only returning actor, and she's wonderful as always. Also Jeffrey Wright, packing a fun surprise, and good ol' Giancarlo Giannini  nice to see he's still kicking! And Daniel Craig? Well, he's great. But so was Brosnan. The filmmakers involved with Brosnan just gave him crap to work with, and I guarantee you the same thing will happen to Craig. Casino Royale is definitely better than all of Brosnan's Bond films, but only by a slight margin. Remove Denise Richards as a nuclear scientist from The World Is Not Enough (and the line ""I thought Christmas only came once a year""  one of the biggest howlers of all time) and that movie would have been just as serious and dramatic as this one is, and just as good. And neither would be as good as either of the Bourne movies, and, sadly, for 2006 movies Casino Royale comes in second behind another spy thriller, Mission: Impossible III. There are similar scenes in both films where the heroes have to shock themselves to stay alive. That scene in M:I:III is a hundred times more well done than the one here. Despite my complaints, I do think the film works perfectly fine as popcorn-munching entertainment, but to suggest that it's anything more than that is frankly laughable. One last note: this film ought to have been rated R. It's too violent to be PG-13.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Their word was their Bond.,"The producers promised us something new, and their word was their Bond.Once I acclimatised myself to the level and tone it's pitched at I absolutely, thoroughly enjoyed it. Best Bond film since Lcence To Kill - and it is a ""Bond film,"" despite some flailing critics deliberately manufacturing garbage diatribes to the contrary because they are at a loss to develop a truly functional critique.It has the character of James Bond in it played by an actor with a rare understanding of what that character is all about. This is not a Bond for Brosnan or Moore only fans, but holds appeal for those whose preferences included Connery, Lazenby and Dalton. Those used to and entrenched in hopeless love with the schoolboy targeted pseudo-Bond of the Brosnan tenure will not understand nor possess the capacity to accept or enjoy this movie.It is produced well, directed with dynamic flair and instinctive Bondian comprehension and conceptualisation (which surprised me, I admit) by the much evolved and improved Martin Campbell, and underpinned by a thoughtful and literate screenplay. It's a classic Bond updated to the modern world. I had reservations, but it's more or less what I wanted to see. There are flaws, it's not perfect, but I think it's a brave and positive forward step.Much spleen has been vented upon issues of Daniel Craig's casting, continuity and anything that constituted change from the well-worn formula. Twenty minutes into the film, all these concerns and considerations evaporate with the realisation - for anyone who has ever read the books - that Craig's portrayal is the closest to Flemings concept of the Bond character than anyone else's (including Connery and Dalton). It is so refreshing and exciting it gives that ""Yes!"" feeling when you realise that Craig has nailed it.On the downside, it's overlong and would have benefited from trimming by 15-20 mins for cinema release. The expected director's cut DVD will be even longer - not a problem for me personally - but some with limited attention spans may feel their interest waver slightly. Plus, the character of Le Chiffre isn't given enough to do and never fully makes his presence felt until the expertly handled torture scene - by which time...well, you have to see the film.Personally, it's one of the best Bonds and I think it's going to grow in stature (much like OHMSS) as time moves on. I eagerly await the next instalment. After years of treading water, Bond is back where he belongs.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Why all the accolades?,"I have to tell you that when this was being made, I didn't expect much other than a standard bond movie which had ditched the subplots and was nothing more than a 90 minute action movie. I was pleasantly surprised when the initial reviews came out and it had a 2 + hour running time and subplots.I cannot believe I saw the same movie that people are giving a 8.1/10 as of current.I found the new Bond to be very boring and rougher around the edges. I don't mind the rougher around the edges part but I think people have forgot what made bond MOVIES so good -- he was what every man wanted to be. He was a secret agent that always found a way to get out of danger, always got multiple women, and while completely over the top -- at some level every man would want to be James Bond.I realize this is a reboot but not Q or R, no Shaken not Stirred, no good car chases, a lame opening, and lack of a real super villain? Come on, Bond movies never relied on realism.Obviously this film is doing well so they do need my input but for the record, I would get someone more suave to play Bond with a dark side but with a sense of humor. Both Connery and Moore had the sense of humor to add to the fun. Lets face it, some of the best parts of the movie was Q or R showing the new gadgets off. Bonds gadget of choice on this outing -- a freaking cellphone.I do like the fact that they had the subplots but the stakes weren't high enough to make them interesting.I also never minded the campiness of the super genius villains. Yes, Austin Powers had a blast making fun of this but they were paying homage to it because it was classic movie making.Everything in life is subjective and maybe the plot wasn't that interesting to me. Bond and Texas Holdem just seemed stupid. British Intelligence certainly has gone downhill if they cant find a better way to get the money than Bond winning at high stakes poker.I hope they bring out the go for broke over the top villain in the next movie who is hell bent on ruling the world through mass destruction. I don't care if he in a wheelchair or a psychopath who wears a cape. There has to be a mix in there that appeals to the old bond fanatics and the younger generation.Also, it didn't feel like a Bond movie. There was something else missing that I cant quite put my finger on.Heck, I even liked Timothy Dalton as Bond. I liked the Rogue agent bit to revenge his friends death.Also, please have some sort of great opening sequence. Almost all Bond movies have a great opening sequence to quickly draw the crowd into the movie.I gave this one a 5/10 but according to IMDb, I guess most people like it a lot more than me.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond by name only,"Having seen the Bond franchise become little more than an action blockbuster machine, first in the Timothy Dalton era and then seeing a steady decline from there with Pierce Brosnan, I was duped into thinking that things would be different this time around. This time the special effects had been stripped back, there was less gadgetry and perhaps most importantly, a new Bond. I had also filled in a few blanks myself; this Bond movie would have more style, more COOL!Of course, had I given it any serious thought and not been caught up in the hype, I would have realized that without a new director (and probably a completely new crew) what we were going to get from Martin Campbell would be more of the same, just with a different Bond. After all, this is the director who is responsible for The Mask of Zorro films. I made a big mistake.Casino Royale is an action blockbuster without enough action. A spy thriller without intrigue or espionage or any of the cool stuff that made Bond so great in the 60s and 70s. It's a James Bond film by name only. Change the main character's name and you have a very average action film that could easily star Bruce Willis or, dare I say it, Arnold Schwarzenegger. I have no problem with Daniel Craig as Bond, but a good actor can't save a bad film. I won't even go into the glaring plot holes which are, quite frankly, insulting.What amazes me is how Martin Campbell and his team could not look back at the old Bond movies and at least try to get some ideas from them. They are in the perfect position to emulate stylistically some of the best films of the genre and put their own modern spin on it.

hit and miss,"I've never read the original books so I have no idea how faithfully this movie portrays them.But I DO know that this took a franchise and watered down into 'just another action flick'.As some have already pointed out, the action is well-filmed - especially the ""urban gymnastics"" at the beginning. But the film needs more than great fight scenes to be a memorable movie.I found myself unconcerned with the Bond character and wishing, hoping, for some more sexy women and gadgets. The Bond character is uninteresting, flat, and dark. Not at all the Bond we all know and love. Those of you who've seen it - think about it; did he say ANYTHING remotely interesting, humane, or charming throughout the movie (aside from when he was flirting with women)?And frankly, I could do without seeing a man punched in the balls over and over again. It doesn't fit the Bond style and didn't make ANY sense in the script. At that point in the movie, all the baddies had to do was threaten to torture his love interest and he'd have folded.There were just too many things that didn't make sense in the script, and too little reason to care about the main character. And the writers seem like they couldn't decide whether the movie was for adults (torture, violence, blood, etc), or for kids. I mean, the sexuality was VERY tame (even for a Bond flick) and they felt the need to beat us over the head with literal, verbal narratives of things that were plainly obvious. For example, all through the big card game, they have a supporting character whisper play-by-play explanations to a female observer as if she's too dumb to figure out what's going on herself. Yet, she's SUPPOSED to be this intelligent, analytical professional. And that's BESIDE the fact that every moron in the theater can figure out for themselves that when Bond pushes all his money into the center of the poker table, he's gambling all his money.For an action flick, the movie hits in many ways. For a legendary franchise, it misses in many more.If you liked Triple X or the Transporter or any other modern ""extreme"" action flick, you'll like this one too. And just like those, you'll forget you ever saw it within 6 months. It's not Braveheart or Schindler's List and should be given the 5-7 (out of 10) rating it deserves.Hope this helps you decide whether to see it or not.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bond, but better than ever.","Wow....Wow. The only reaction I could muster after this film. This is by far and away the best Bond film to date. This film is gritty, it's action packed and it's finally removed all of the crazy stupid gadgets and improbable stunts.Whilst it's fair to say Daniel Craig wasn't everyone's first pick as Bond, he certainly won't have any critics after this.The film has a genuine storyline, real world issues and dilemmas to navigate, the fight scenes are intense and bloody, Bond gets hit, he bleeds he bruises, he props himself up with booze and blinding determination.Eva Green is stunning, both in her acting skills and her visual persona. A women who challenges Bond, pushes him and forces the human inside to come to the surface.This film is fast paced, action packed, has a depth and direction seldom seen with these sorts of films and it has you yearning for more.A truely great film that has it all. I'll say it again. WOW!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Fleming's Bond,"""Die Another Day"" garnered average, but not altogether poor, reviews from critics and was the biggest financial success of Brosnan's era. The franchise could have continued from that point into even more silliness, gadgetry, bad jokes, product placement, and celebrity Bond girls, but in one of the best moves a franchise has made in ages, it didn't. ""Casino Royale"" is the most drastic reinvigoration of the Bond franchise in its history. Sure, ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"", ""The Living Daylights"", and ""GoldenEye"" might have all been turns in a new direction, two of them sadly short-lived, the other ill-fated, but ""Casino Royale"" marks the purest return to Fleming's vision of Bond since ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service"" and it is a move that has created a vocal minority sad to see 'movie Bond' go and a much, much more significant majority that was thrilled and captivated by ""Casino Royale"" from start to finish.""Casino Royale"" was the first Bond novel by Ian Fleming, and though this film is not all too faithful to the book's events- keeping the main points of the story but changing it to obviously set up ""Quantum of Solace"" and update it to a modern setting among other things. ""Casino Royale"" has many strengths, chief among them Craig as Bond, perhaps the best Bond since Connery, with the potential to, dare I say it, be better. Combining just enough suavity with a very strong physical presence ala Dalton, and delivering his one-liners (thankfully kept to a minimum) just as well as Brosnan did his. Then you have the action scenes, in this film only one which even has a significant amount of gunfire, the rest a merciful return to the sort of hand-to-hand combat we haven't seen in a Bond film in decades. The action is well-shot and well-edited, with Martin Campbell keeping the film moving at a swift pace much like he did with ""GoldenEye"". There are one or two scenes which go on too long, one or two lines that don't quite work, but these things are minuscule complaints given how hugely enjoyable this film is as a whole.The entire cast is exceptionally good here, Judi Dench continuing to prove that casting her as M was an inspired choice. Mads Mikkelsen makes an excellent LeChiffre, and Eva Green is one of few Bond girls who is a quality actress and seems effortlessly classy. No bimbos to be found here, that's for sure. The film is very well-written and paced and for once it's hard to pick holes in it.""Casino Royale"" takes the Bond franchise in a bold, new, and fresh direction. Following installments will hopefully not become too formulaic and can certainly afford to be slightly more light-hearted and traditionalist (Q & Moneypenny never harmed anybody), but the tone was set just right by ""Casino Royale"" and hopefully it will stay this way at least for the duration of Craig's run in the role and not fall apart as Brosnan's era sadly did following ""GoldenEye"".9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond ever,"Super charged testosterone popcorn movie with a great love story at its core. What more could you want? How about locations that will gob-smack you and state of the art action sequences. This is the must see film of the holiday season. Want to forget about your daily grind and live in the fantasy world of a great tough-guy hero? Paul Haggis scores again with a screenplay far beyond most action films. And it's faithful to the book, has humor but no irony. Aren't we sick of irony? I never thought I could love a blond Bond, but he's fantastic. And instead of watching girls in bikinis come out of the ocean and fall into Bond's bed, we get to see the man himself come out of the ocean in a tight little Speedo. The six pack delivers big time. See it all on a big screen with the best sound. This is not one to wait for the DVD. It's a MOVIE.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
You Know My Name,"Okay so I like Chris Cornell's title song  don't judge me. And before you ask, yes, the film is THAT good. Although it boasts of a massive 144 minutes worth of running time, it feels completely condensed in each scene, making you want heaps more of each character, storyline and setting. In short, Casino Royale is to the Bond franchise what Batman Begins was to the dead-and-buried Batman: a well-deserved kick up the arse, a blunt diversion from the run-of-the-mill 007 films of recent years, but still retaining faithful key elements from the saga.The difference between the two springboards Batman Begins and Casino Royale is that while Christian Bale seemed tailor-made for the role of Bruce Wayne, Bond heir to the throne Daniel Craig appeared a dark horse, and attracted much criticism because of it. With rock-chiseled features, an imposingly muscular physique and clear baby blue eyes, I take no shame in admitting he is, by far, the sexiest James Bond we have seen. This may sway my review. Be that as it may, cultists and agnostics alike should recognise that Craig's more human and realistic nature should serve as a mark of his character's credibility in the film. Bond has just been promoted to 007 status  still wet behind the ears  and botches his way through many missions, bleeding, sweating, letting his guard down and pouring his heart out, which further heightens the realism of the otherwise extravagant extravaganza.I say extravaganza because the core of Casino Royale still retains strong Fleming elements like high-staked poker playing, eccentric villains, gorgeous femmes, unspeakably exotic locations, inventive torture scenes, high-speed car chases with shiny Aston Martins, madly acrobatic stunts, furiously adrenaline-pumping combat, epic aerial shots, high-tech gadgets, product placement by the bucketload and dutiful plot twists. The difference between Casino Royale and previous Bond installments is that all of the aforementioned take a backseat to the story, its central cast and its heart. Sometimes the difference is merely a subtle one: the opening credits are dazzling and Bond-like and at the same time not  there are no naked dancing ladies but a hard-boiled super-agent in the montage. Bond orders a vodka martini, but he does not give a damn if it is 'shaken or stirred'. The mandatory Bond girl is stunningly pretty but also remarkably intelligent. The main Bond villain is theatrical, yes, but he is not a bad person.The latter, if you want to nitpick, is Casino Royale's fatal flaw. There is a distinct lack of a satisfying villain. The much too peppy-looking Dane Mads Mikkelsen is far too likable in the film and what is more is given a very limited amount of screen time. What good is a superb Mikkelsen if you are not going to use him? Here is a creative and capable actor who is never given the chance to get his scumbag on, even though we are given a taste of his sadistic antics in the notorious torture scene (as well as the explanation why Bond never impregnates his one night stands). As the menacing-sounding Le Chiffe, Mikkelsen is not playing the high-staked poker game in Montenegro for prestige or money; he is doing it because he owes the top of the hierarchy an obscene amount of cash. This creme de la creme group of villains are given screen time much sparingly and there is no ultimate showdown, except perhaps on the poker table at Casino Royale. The good news that needs to be interjected here is that although I do not know a thing about poker, the film crafted its playing sequences so assuredly with perfect angles, tense atmosphere and music that is was impossible not to be entranced in the whole thing.Luckily (er, I guess) James Bond has enough demons to face without the presence of a clear-cut template villain. The warping of gender roles turns Eva Green as Vesper Lynd into a feisty colleague  not the desperately mouthy and tough-chick politically correct kind (no offense, Halle Berry) but a real, complex individual who shows vulnerability in more ways than panting, pouting, screaming with wide eyes like previous Bond girls. Her character is one of many showcases for how well director Martin Campbell succeeds in taking the middle-road approach in the film. The dialogue is witty and fun, but not desperately punchy. The plot unfolding is unpredictable, but not desperately twisty. James Bond is hard-edged and hard-boiled, but not a pure-bred killing machine. He is good-looking, but not an in-your-face pretty boy. There are some neat gadgets, but there is no over-the-top sci-fi plot fodder developments á la Q.Casino Royale is as hard as it is hearted and as action-pumping and kinetic as it is introspective. This should be enough for any film and following the low standards that the abysmal Die Another Day set, this may as well be the Godfather of the James Bond franchise. There are one or two films from the franchise that I would perhaps rank higher but it is probable to suspect that nostalgia greatly clouds my judgement there. Best of all is that Casino Royale will not date at all  the setting is timeless and so is the action. I have not met a person who has not enjoyed this film immensely, which should serve as a mark of its high entertainment value. A must-see for cultists and agnostics alike.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Some of the best and most spectacular stunt-work I've seen in a long time.,"Before this movie Superman 'returned', Batman 'began' and now it's James Bond turn to get a complete 21th century make-over. The character is revised and the makers begin with this movie from scratch, with showing Bond on his very first mission. We learn more about the character, such as why he threats women like he does. Bond in this movie is still a rough diamond that needs polishing. He doesn't respect his boss (M) and is very self-centered and uncontrolled in his actions and emotions. It shows Bond as a more humane and realistic character.I wasn't unhappy with the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies (even though ""Tomorrow Never Dies"" and ""The World Is Not Enough"" weren't exactly the greatest), so for me it wasn't really needed to revise the character and give the series a complete make-over. Needless to say I was quite reluctant about this movie at first. That however ended after seeing the first trailer of the movie. Bond seemed to go back to its basics and the character seemed so much more interesting. My biggest complaint about the Brosnan Bond movies always had been that they featured to many (needless) SFX and massive big gun fights. I had always preferred the good old fashioned fist fights from the earlier Bond movies. This movie surely spoiled me with that! The action was raw, bold and straight-forward and Bond used his fists more than his gunThe action is definitely one of the best I've seen in a long time. I already knew that Martin Campbell was a great action director, with movies such as ""The Mask of Zorro"", ""No Escape"" and the other Bond movie ""GoldenEye"" behind his name. But the action in this movie surely surpasses his other work. The stunts are absolutely phenomenal and the action is brought well to the screen, also thanks to the editing from action movie specialist Stuart Baird. The action was filmed realistic, rather than just big and spectacular. In a way it made the action more intense and exciting to follow.Daniel Craig also proofs with this movie that he can play a great action hero. Step aside Ethan Hunt and Jason Bourne, Daniel Craig as James Bond is the new kid on the block and he is great! He doesn't only handle the action well and convincing but also the Bond character. He makes the character more humane with emotions and shows that Bond can still be seriously wounded and emotionally touched. So he makes the action as well as the emotions work out. A real accomplishment, that not just every actor would had succeeded in. It shows that Daniel Craig is the perfect man to revise the character and form the base for later Bond movies and Bond actors as well. Because after this movie I'm sure of it; Bond movies will continue to be made for at least the next 25 years and the series is far from dried up. The cast and crew really puts some new- and interesting life into the series. Craig succeeded in what Timothy Dalton tried to achieve with the Bond character and movies. (But please note that I for one really liked the Dalton Bond and movies though.)The rest of the cast is also good. The movie is well cast, rather than just putting some big names in it. Eva Green is a good and different sort of Bond girl and Mads Mikkelsen who already was a big star in Denmark now also introduces himself to the rest of the world, as the main villain of this movie.The movie isn't as casino game focused as the title and plot outline might suggest. Above all ""Casino Royale"" is still an action movie, rather than just a character-thriller with action in it.The movie is rather simple written with a simple story but than again, stories never really had been a big requirement for any James Bond movie. Still it doesn't make the characters all work out as effective as they could had been and it makes the movie also drag at points. There are some moments in the movie in between the action sequences in which nothing is really happening. It makes the movie sometimes unnecessary slow and unnecessary uninteresting. If I look at this movie purely as an action movie, it isn't the best one around. If you look at this movie as a part of the James Bond series, it's definitely one of the better ones. It explains why I can't really rate this movie any higher than an 7 out of 10. Technically the movie is too lacking in story-flow, plot and characters to be considered a perfect one, even for action movie standards. Still I'm enthusiastic about this movie and can recommended to everyone, even if you aren't really familiar with any of the other Bond movies. This is the perfect movie to get (re)introduced to the character.This movie lays a good foundation for later 'new' James Bond movies and I'm convinced of it that the movies, just like Daniel Craig as the character, will only get better and more like the 'old' Bond movies (so with gadgets, more humor, more sex etc.) but still in the same new and more serious 'realistic' approach of the character and the movie in general.Bond is dead, long life Bond!7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Bond lives!,"I just watched this film and i thought it was brilliant! Although i am not a die-hard James Bond fan but I have watched my fair share of Bond films. Firstly, Daniel Craig is a brilliant Bond in his own way, of course.Daniel Craig plays Bond as cold, charming agent; which is nice to see because it gives the story a realistic undertone because if James Bond were a true character then he would have to be if he roams around the world for Her Majestys Secret Service killing terrorists and madmen! The story is set almost like an origin story where Bond has just finished attaining his double 'o' status and embarks on a complex storyline involving a villain and a couple of organisations in the backwaters, the settings are nice and again Craig plays a very cool but stern Bond. He encounters many challenges and he doesn't easily beat them all at first and even struggles in some tasks, all playing towards a more realistic Bond.There are no flashy gadgets unless you count the Aston Martin that Bond drives around but it compensates by giving some raw action scenes like the initial fight scene where Bond flushes his enemy's head several times! This new franchise for 007 is definitely worth seeing and it is great to see how well Craig fits into the role! His cold cruel Bond really plays well here and the raw action is brilliant!

Here It Is/Where It All Began,"This Bond film is well written and exciting, It shows us the way that the 007 legend began.

He is also a gambler who is managing to make one hundred percent on his investments, Bond has to use every manner of effort to confront the barriers placed before him, including winning at cards. I remember the asinine first Hollywood version of this book, which came in the wake of some of the best ""serious"" Bond films. It had comedians Peter Sellers and Woody Allen and more silliness than you could shake a stick at. One thing I noticed is that the card game played was poker. In the book and the original movie, he plays Baccarat. Of course, hardly any Americans understand this game.

Is this the beginning of the end for Bond?,"Welcome to the new James Bond, who enters the franchise through the first book of the adventures of the British superspy by Ian Fleming. Sadly, that's about as exciting as it gets. The filmmakers seem to be trying to reinvent Bond according to the Jason Bourne mold, which is fine. Except they left out the fun aspect of the earlier Bonds, while the pace here is not as consistently thrilling as what you get in the Bourne series. I miss Goldfinger, and On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and The Spy Who Loved Me, and Die Another Day, and even The Living Daylights. I miss the Bond girls with charisma like Ursula and Honor Blackman and Diana Rigg and Jill St John and Jane Seymour and Barbara Bach, to name some. I miss the larger-than-life villains, and i even miss Q and Moneypenny. Thank goodness Dame Judi is still around to save the day as M. Daniel Craig is a potentially good Bond, but he needs better material to work with. The story here is lame, and it's not helped by the lack of more memorable characters to make up the fun factor at least. In the Jason Bourne series, the villains are low-key too, but at least the movies pulsate with gripping action. Here, the action sequences come in spurts, and there are more witty one-liners from an Arnold Schwarzenegger movie than one would find here. Sorry for having to make comparisons like this, but i am just trying to comment within the context of the movie's genre. While one does not wish for more of the same done-to-death formula exhibited by some of the earlier Bonds, the next Bond movie with Daniel Craig again needs to have better plot and character development, with the former being more involving and the latter being more engaging. Otherwise, this new start may just spell the beginning of the end for this lucrative franchise.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond Rating is Down,"Craig seems to be the wrong choice to take over the role of 007. He is serious and mean-spirited instead of suave and witty, as we have come to expect of Bond. Unlike other Bonds, the pre-credits sequence is dull. While some of the action scenes are well executed, the excitement is not sustained because the plot is choppy and convoluted. Bond is newly minted as 007 in this one but the film takes place in 2006, totally oblivious to all the previous Bond films. There is no chemistry between Craig and Green and their romance becomes too sappy. Bond films are supposed to be silly and fun, laced with babes, gadgets, and double-entendres.

Are they taking away all the gadgetry's from 007 and making him more human?Judi Dench is effective as ""M"".Eva Green was charming.Daniel Craig is admittedly rugged, but sadly wooden.

Bond doesn't get much better than this.,"Daniel Craig's debut as Bond is a smash and hands down one of, if not the absolute best.The Bond we see in this movie is again unique to the ones before his. He's a lot more driven and willing to do absolutely anything to complete his missions, even if it means using those closest to him to do so. It's hinted through the entire film as a sort of a prophecy that you'll kick yourself for not seeing the why sooner.That being said we see the more resolute Bond soften opposite his Bond girl for this instalment played by the beautiful Eva Green. When she witnesses a man die before her she's visually shaken, and rather than tell her to get her self together as we would expect from 007 instead we see a more compassionate and understanding side to him that I don't think we have had before.Action sequences are exhilarating and even the poker game which takes up a bulk of the screen time is fascinating when it could have so easily come across as boring.Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffre is brilliant casting and its clear he and Daniel Craig have so much chemistry whilst on screen together which is what makes the Poker game so engrossing.A fantastic cast supported by the best Bond script to date makes it really hard to pick out any faults.

New Bond in a good action flick,"I can't say I'm a fan of James Bond films - I've seen them all (except the original spoof 'Casino Royale'), and Goldfinger is the only film that I rate highly; but I was interested in seeing this one for the fact that there's a new Bond, and he's so different from all those who have gone before. Director Martin Campbell is no stranger to making Bond films with a new lead as he was the man that helmed the well-received Pierce Brosnan debut Goldeneye back in 1995. This one, however, is wildly different from the rest for reasons other than just the new Bond - as we have an unfortunate lack of gadgets, as well as an overall darker and more serious tone. The plot line isn't the most megalomaniacal of the series, and simply focuses on Le Chiffre; a terrorist accountant with a talent for playing poker. He decides to set up a high stakes poker game in Montenegro after his other plan was thwarted by MI6's newest agent, James Bond. Coincidentally, Bond happens to be the best poker player in the organisation and so the government funds his ten million dollar entrance fee...but he has to win, otherwise Britain will be directly funding terrorism!Being a talented poker player myself, I was a little worried that the film may focus on the turgid 'stud' form of poker; but fortunately, it's the more exciting Texas Hold'Em that takes centre stage. The film doesn't focus too much on poker, but what we do get is completely overblown; along with the rest of the film. Of course, I'd be complaining more if it wasn't; and Martin Campbell provides a good mix of big stunts and smaller one on one fights. The real star of the show is, of course, the new Bond; and Daniel Craig does a really good job in the central role. The James Bond series really needed some new life injected into it, and Craig adequately provides that. He is joined by the stunningly sexy Eva Green who takes the 'Bond Girl' role, while Mads Mikkelsen is a distinctive baddie and the film is rounded off by Judy Dench and Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini, who starred in the classic Giallo 'Black Belly of the Tarantula' with no less than three Bond girls! Overall, Casino Royale is certainly an enjoyable slice of celluloid, but despite its overblown emotional scenes - that's all it is. But even so, it would be difficult to get bored during this film, and it gets a thumbs up for that reason.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best James Bond Movie In the Last Years,"After receiving license to kill from the MI-6, the secret agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) follows his leads and avoids the destruction of the greatest airplane in the world in Miami plotted by the evil banker Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) to crash the bonds in the stock market and break the air flight company. The banker loses the funds of international terrorist organizations and organizes a poker game in Casino Royale, in Montenegro, to raise the money of the investors. James Bond travels with the British accountant Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) to bet and defeat La Chiffre and force him to look for protection with the MI-6, disclosing the names of the terrorists. James wins, but is double-crossed, in a game of betrayals and murders.The model ""007"" was completely exhausted in the last Pierce Brosnan movies, with silly plots and cartoonist scenes. All the previous actors were handsome, with the stereotype of the British gentleman, exactly the opposite of Daniel Craig. This actor is surprisingly responsible for the renewal of the franchise, presenting the best James Bond movie in the last years, with a violent and tough character in a great adventure.

"Raw, visceral and disturbingly homo-erotic","I finally saw the new Bond last night and was really surprised by it. I knew that they were refreshing the franchise, but hadn't expected such a raw and visceral version of Bond. The action scenes were breath-taking and totally Martin Campbell, but this time the producers really allowed him to express himself in all his perverse glory. Gone is the camp, humorous charm. This Bond is truly dangerous, mainly because he is not always cool or in control, and he can be hurt, very badly hurt. Daniel Craig's astonishing blue eyes flash and smoulder. This is a very physical Bond and the opportunity to show his very developed, glistening, often injured torso is rarely missed. There are disturbing sado-masochistic undertones to this film, never has a Bond been so viscerally mashed, which culminate in the homo-erotic torture scene, which frankly disturbed me. Exquisitely photographed by Phil Meheux, a still from this scene wouldn't have been out of place in a Robert Mablethorpe collection. Mads Mikkelsen gives a superbly subtle and effete performance as Le Chiffre, and Eva Green is utterly beguiling in her beautiful quirkiness. Only the brief love interlude feels clumsy, reverting to the tone of a rom-com in its sweetness. I would have have liked a bit more charm, but perhaps that's the next developmental step in Bond's evolution.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Action filled and mind blowing,"I was immediately attracted to this stunning film by the opening scene in black and white it gave a fantastic feel to the start of the film. The opening action scene was also fantastic with the drama and action involved being full on, nail biting and fully entertaining as James Bond runs across buildings and cranes! I also enjoyed the whole concept of basing it around poker and the rich and glamorous casino. It really dove into Bond's character as he outwits others in a simple but devastating way.This film has everything; action, tension and lots of emotion.This has to be one of Daniel Craig's best acting performances as he brilliantly portrays a character who deals with death, betrayal and love.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good Movie, Bad Bond","Last night, I went to see the long awaited Casino Royale and came away with mixed emotions. I enjoyed significant stretches of the movie but at the end, I went home unsatisfied and thinking I could've waited for this to hit the DVD shelves.I thought the movie and the plot was characteristic and ""Bond-Worthy"" enough. However, the new 007 is at best ""Forgettable"" and it's my sincere hope that he will have the same tenure of George Lazenby (1 film, Her Majesty's Secret Service). The Bond Girl was her usual worthy hot self!!! Granted, not Hallie Berry but very sultry and sexy nonetheless. I did miss Q and his introduction of the gadgets that Bond uses to ultimately best the bad guys. Q's moments in the previous films prepare the viewers to better understand the action scenes and hopefully, his character will return in future Bond films. Speaking of ""Bad Guys"" ""Ho Hum""! A lot could've and probably should've been done to better develop their characters.Overall, I thought the film was worth viewing (even at $10.50), 007 notwithstanding. It is my prayer that a new Bond is discovered in time for the next film.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"As Great, as ever!","(Casino Royale) still holds up to this day one of the greatest spy movies in the last 30 years and it is also one of my personal favorite action movies overall. It has the perfect athmosphere, a perfectly casted James Bond played by Daniel Craig, fantastic acting overall, greatly shot in a way that makes it look one of the late 80s spy classics giving tou the perfect amount of nostalgia, and last but not least the pacing and length of the film being just perfect, giving you a heartfelt nearly 3 hour long dramatic Mr. Bond story, mostly driven by the fantastic on screen duo of Daniel Craig and Eva Green!!Im really glad that they started Daniel Craig's Bond outing out with the masterpiece being the book Casino Royale!(10/10)",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Very Disappointing,"James Bond, a name the is phenomenally well known to so many people. The bond franchise has had its up an downs with regards to the films ranging from the very good ones to the truly awful ones. When I heard that Casino Royale was in production I was very pleased as it was one of the better bond books written by Flemming, I was seriously looking forward to the film, I went to the Cinema, watched it, couldn't believe what I thought so I went to see it again the next day, it was awful!!!!!! I will break down why I think it was awful in to categories.1) The Story  As bonds go this one had by far the weakest storyline of them all. There was no point to it, there was no ultimate goal for bond, there was no really good bad guy there was just a mish mash of poorly conceived story sewn together into a very flimsy finished product. Martin Cambell obviously had bigger things on his mind when he made this 2) The Stunts- Just pathetic randomly placed awful 'just for the hell of it' stunts. The main stunts include a ridiculas chase for one man which involves jumping up solid walls at least 8ft high, blowing up buildings and killing innocent people to get to one unimportant man. This is a sign of weak directing, stunts for no reason just to show off special effects 3) The bond girl- Oh my lord she is awful! She can't act and is awful looking! I think if you pull a random member of the public off the street they could act better. Just awful, AWFUL!All in all avoid this film like the plague! Its that bad!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Incredibly weak plot, non faithful to James Bond series image.","Anyone, who states that the new type of directing and other ""twists"" favored the movie to be better, is terribly wrong.I was fed up with the non-stop nude male body scenes, there were no decorative girls, which are essential in my opinion to a James Bond movie, and the dialog was absurdly bad. It was almost like a romantic B category movie.I went to see it because the reviews were good, and i just realized halfway the movie that it is really, REALLY bad.There were only two action scenes, worth mentioning, the rest is history... Is it a good James Bond movie? No.Is it contains unexpected twists? No, you know everything about halfway through...Is it well directed? I think no.See for yourself, i'd say stay away...",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Where the hell was the music?,"i thought the opening sequence was wonderful, the follow on to the titles was OK. But in any Bond format, there is an opening - titles- then an action sequence that usually ends up with that big blaring orchestra line - daaaah daaaaah daaaaaaah etc. Nope. not here. he lay behind a wall looking at a mobile phone when he shoulda been running like hell with the world after him. Action beat was very uneven. Opening was full of sudden changes - fine- great beat all the way to the casino (if a little forced and unfounded at times) but spare us the post casino hiatus. Slow , uneven and stuttering. Very poor storytelling, lacked earlier suggestion and just bored the hell outta me. Too many layers, too long and just not held together coherently. It seemed like it just went from one storyboard scene to another without joining the dots. Pity really, it started so well. ""let's go from the casino to a beach to sinking a building in Venice to that line""""my name is Bond, James Bond"" ""and not worry about how. A movie of three parts and two halves. The second was rubbish. And where the hell was the music when it was needed?",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This Bond movie is a royal flush.,"I really enjoyed this film and it is the best movie I have seen this year as it is the only one I have given a ten too. Usually in a year there are at least two, and sometimes more, this year seemed destined to have none until I saw this movie. What can I say, I just had to have a little faith that 007 would save the day and movie year. Granted I enjoyed ""Die Another Day"" a lot too, it was all gadgets and special effects...this one I liked because of the simplicity of it all. The gadgets are all but gone, the action is more stunt work than special effects and this one really looks at the character of Bond like no other Bond film has because this is the beginning of his 00 career. Craig is really good as Bond as I would say he is rather close to the best Bond Sean Connery. Though I have enjoyed all the actors who have played that character so far. The action is great, but that is to be expected, the emotional twists in the story were not expected and were welcome by me, this movie shows us just what has made James Bond who he is. Judi Dench returns as M and is solid as usual, and she was rather funny in some of her scenes. The story has Bond tracking a man who is sort of a banker for terrorist. This man has a plan that Bond foils and costs him quite a lot of money, which this man hopes to win back in a game of Poker. So Bond gets in on the game and is joined by a lovely lady whom he apparently is falling for bad. This movie plays out very well and I look forward to seeing it again, as I also look forward to seeing Craig as James Bond again.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""But you yourself are nothing so divine. Just next in line ""","You don't review James Bond movies, you evaluate them, rate them according to how well they meet expectations. There are certain things one has come to expect, even demand of a Bond film and each individual effort either delivers or it doesn't. So, here are ten elements that make a Bond film a Bond film and how the remake of CASINO ROYALE rates on a scale of 1 to 10:Title: CASINO ROYALE: At least it suggests class, which oddly is the one thing this film seems to be trying to avoid. 7 points.Pre-Credit Teaser: The first wrinkle in this so-called reboot of the series is that it begins in black-and-white. Whether intended as an homage to the 50s TV version of the story or just a clumsy reference to THE WIZARD OF OZ, the monochromatic flashback is hardly original. Since the whole film is essentially a flashback, the gimmick here seems self-consciously self-important. 5 points.Opening Credits: Daniel Kleinman foregoes the traditional optical tricks and gaudy montages and actually goes retro with an animated opening. Cleverly using a gambling motif, he turns crosshairs into roulette wheels, spades into lethal weapons and hearts into puddles of blood, equating the spy game with a game of skill and chance. Really nice. 10 points.Theme Song: Paradoxically it is entitled ""You Know My Name,"" odd since this is supposed to be Bond before he was a legend. Chris Cornell's opening theme provides a strong beat but the lyrics are rambling nonsense (""When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me? By the merciless eyes of deceit?"" Huh?). Still, if it were performed in the seductive tones of the best Bond ballads (Shirley Bassey, where are you?), rather than Cornell's blaring screech, it might have been better. 6 point.""Bond, James Bond"": Supposedly the youngest actor to play Bond, Daniel Craig nonetheless looks older than either Connery or Moore in their final Bond epics. There is just something unpleasant about Craig's appearance, which makes his 007 neither likable nor sympathetic nor even particularly memorable. Craig is stiff and cold and prone to mumbling in monotones. Unfortunately, that seems to be just what the filmmakers wanted. Go figure. But, there is the hint that the style, charm and wit will materialize in future adventures. God, I hope so. We'll take a gamble and advance him 4 points.Bond Babes: As Vesper Lynd, Eva Green certainly isn't the voluptuous temptress that Ursula Andress created in the 1967 spoof, but instead gives us a character who is smart, witty and beautiful in a realistic way. Indeed, she hardly deserves to be classified as a mere ""Bond Girl."" But, the film traps her in an unbelievable plot twist and an even more unbelievable romance with Bond. But you can't blame Green, she's the best thing about the film. 10 points.Bond Villain: It would seem the strongest qualification for Mads Mikkelsen being the villainous LeChiffre is that he is even less attractive than Craig. Not that it matters, since the problem is that he does nothing with the character. In fairness, the role was played previously by Peter Lorre (in the 1954 TV play) and Orson Welles (in the 1967 spoof) and they really didn't do much with the character either. But, at least, they were Peter Lorre and Orson Welles. But then, the character is basically an accountant with a gambling problem and that isn't much to build on. Mikkelsen's LeChiffre cries blood and apparently has asthma... and that is about it. 4 points.Bond Baddies: Thugs and terrorists seem to be around every corner and fights break out at regular intervals, but they all have a generic quality and are totally forgettable. 0 points.Sinister Plot: LeChiffre is the moneyhandler for the bad guys (this time terrorists rather than the Soviets) and his gambling habit prompts him to foolishly borrow funds from his clients, who aren't happy when he loses big and can't reimburse. Thus he faces off with Bond over the poker table to win enough to cover his debts before he is eliminated. It is a very silly plot and yet possibly a clever metaphor for the way governments gamble and bluff their way through diplomacy. Still, if Bond wants LeChiffre dead, why doesn't he just shoot him? 6 points.Production values: For all the jabbering about introducing a new sense of realism into the series, the extravagant stunts are just as ridiculous as ever. But removing the humor from the story doesn't make it serious and denying the self-awareness that the humor exists is not realism. Once more we are getting a comic book farce that doesn't have the good grace to be honest about its absurdity. 5 points.Bonus Points: One of the more annoying features of the last few Bonds has been Judi Dench as ""M."" Dame Judi opted to play the bureaucrat as stern, petty, condescending and just plain rude, berating James at every turn. And though they have given the boot to ""Q"" and Moneypenny, they opted to instead reboot Dench's insufferable ""M"" into a kinder, gentler despot. Her ""M"" is still a bully, but she seems to have some unexplained respect for the new Bond, even though he is ruthless and at times incompetent. 5 points for giving Dench a more complex role, minus 5 points for the inconsistency.Summary: I fail to see the point of all the hullabaloo about this being a rebirth of Bond. Take away the five minutes spent on James earning his 007 status and everything else is the same old same old.. With its accent on violence and sadism, the tone is more Tarantino than Playboy, but that is how the series has been evolving -- for worse more than better -- for the last two decades.Bond-o-meter Rating: 57 points out of 100",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"not an all-time champion Bond film, but one that makes me anticipate Craig- and more Bond movies like this- in the future","Casino Royale goes back to the basics in the sense that it's from an Ian Fleming novel, the first time in many years that the franchise reaches back into Fleming's old bag of tricks. That the filmmakers also decide to transfer the story- however much it sticks to the original source I can't say- from communist villains to just plain terrorist dealers and the like. It still has the formula going for it, but not cranked up as it has been in the Pierece Brosnan James Bond films as of late. And it's great to see that the sense of humor is not too keyed up on itself, but rather back to the sly, almost sophisticated lines and moments of innuendo. It's also overlong by at least five minutes, if not more, and despite a good romantic angle in the story with Daniel Craig's 007 and Eva Green's Vesper, that too could've been trimmed just a little. But the dramatic power is matched only by the ruthless abandon of the action from director Martin Campbell; not even as twisting and double-crossing a plot like this can get can get in the way of the real delights of a Bond film, which are exploited well.In fact, I'd say if for nothing else go to see the films to see Craig run, and then run some more, and kick ass and take as many names possible. The franchise decided with Craig to go back all the way to the beginning to Bond's first major assignment after making rank, by taking devious part in an ultra high-stakes poker tournament with its main guy Le Chiffre (Maks Mikkelson, excellent as a tearing-blood villain who may or may not be the middleman-bad guy). But even before this we've already seen Bond at work chasing down a hired-gun in Madagascar (quite the almost opening action sequence if I do say so), and another at an airport, which is the highlight action sequence for my money. These action scenes are done unpretentiously, and with an equal voracity on hero and foe- it's really a question of who can get who off one's back, or run faster or drive harder during these scenes. And in all of this Craig, if not as handsome as previous Bond stars, is assuredly up for the challenge of being rough and gritty in all of this. It helps to see him in this almost cold and detached secret-agent mode, as it does help make the romantic sub-plot- the usual one- with a little more depth.This romantic plot unfolds already after Bond's first semi-rendezvous with a lady in the Bahamas, with Vesper, played by Green in the great tradition of sultry leading ladies. But this time, being that she's not as big a star as some of the more recent Bond ladies, adds to her appeal. You might wonder what side she's on at first, but it's hard to question her vulnerability. One of my favorite scenes of the film, following a daunting fight in a stairwell, is in a shower, but not at all in the usual seductive way you might think once Bond enters into the shower with her. It's actually really touching, showing Bond's humility in calming her down after being frazzled like that. The romance then unfolds as one might expect, though perhaps to far too quick and extreme lengths (then again, what else do you expect from 007). There is a climax that does lean more to the emotional than the usual catharsis of 'he kills all the bad guys, yey', and actually helps to make the Bond character much more cynical and ready for detachment from his love interests than before thought.But I'm making this sound a little more ponderous than I should. Casino Royale isn't a great picture, but for the bulk of its time on screen it's extravagantly good entertainment, even when scenes are meant to be more about psychological tension like in the poker game scenes. Seein Craig and Mikkelsen face off at the table is just as enthralling as a good chase scene is. And it assuredly makes me anticipate more adventures with 007, particularly with Craig, who I think should now be poised for a great career as both Bond (for however long it will last) and as a leading man too.

The music is wrong!  And Eva Green?,"The new blonde bond is refreshing. The edginess that Daniel Craig brings to Bond meshes nicely with Sean Connery's Bond. The filming locations are spot on! Mads Mikkelsen is the perfect villain for this Bond. Unfortunately, the music and graphics for the opening credits were WRONG! Where are the silhouetted babes? Why wasn't a female singer picked to sing the title song? Perhaps Wilson, Campbell, and Cornell are too politically correct to make a proper Bond flick. I grew up on Bond films  wondering which female performer was going to sing the title song  and who the new bond girl would be. They blew it this time, and I am very disappointed that they either haven't done their homework, or are afraid to step out of bounds. Too bad! For all the hype about the new music for Casino Royale it falls far too short of the mark. I'm not sold on Eva Green, either. She seems a bit mousey, and forced.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond Is Back,"Or should I say 'Bond Begins'? After the box-office smash yet critical disaster of Die Another Day, the owners of the 2nd most profitable movie franchise decided it was time to start fresh. They found a new Bond, toned down the gadgets, turned back the clock, and turned up the action/violence. Yet they zeroed in on the characters and drama with the help of a revamped script by Academy Award Winner Paul Haggis (Crash). The result is a refreshing and much needed change that makes Casino Royale not only the best Bond adventure in 20 years, but one of the best movies of 2006.From the moment the movie opens, we know this is not the Bond we've come to know so well. He's rough, sometimes careless, but definitely a force to be reckoned with. And Daniel Craig plays the part to perfection. If you have any gripes about how he isn't a good ""Bond"", go see the movie, and I almost guarantee you'll change your mind. Bond was not conceived as a suave, good-looking ladies man that had a license to kill. He was a deadly spy that did whatever had to be done to complete his mission. Later, he grew into his charming self, but in Casino Royale, we see the unpolished version. He also has a heart, as he falls for the beautiful Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). She is also not the typical Bond girl. She's smart, independent, and not just someone for Bond to save.The story is toned down, too. Bond isn't even trying to save the world. In the post 9/11-era that we live in, the worry is terrorists. Casino Royale takes this fact and uses it to create a much more realistic threat. Bond ultimately has to gamble to try and stop the villain from funding terrorists. If he loses, terrorists get more money. If he wins, they don't get that money. While this may seem boring, it is actually very thrilling, especially the poker game between Bond and the villain. This allows the story to focus more on the characters than just having drama to get to the next action scene. But understand one thing, there is definitely action. A lot of action. Actually some of the best action of any Bond film. This may not be the normal Bond, but it is Bond. You get chases across the tops of cranes, a terrorist incident at Miami International, shoot-outs, a fist-fight in a tight stairwell, double-crosses, torture, triple-crosses, cool cars, great locales, and, of course, hot women.Casino Royale is a great time at the movies. It's edgier and darker than previous Bonds, but that makes it that much better. In the final minute of the film, a very important question is asked: ""Who is this?"" We've been waiting 4 years to hear the answer. ""The name's Bond. James Bond."" And when that familiar tune finally begins to play as the credits roll, we know it was worth the wait. Bond is back.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"It wasn't completely awful, but it stank","I can't believe how many positive reviews came for this movie. Its only clear qualities are that the film is more on the realist side, rather than weird gadget and eccentric villains, and that they reverted to the good old Aston Martin... but that's it. Craig is a good Bond, but he has nothing from the appeal of Sean Connery or the humour of Roger Moore. But even so, I have nothing against the man. The movie, though, sucked badly! The dialogues are inept, the plot is jerky and ambiguous and the adrenaline inducing effects and action scenes are not that good.All I can say is that we find ourselves in a trend of prequels, and as a prequel, this wasn't particularly good. Taking into account the disastrous recent movies from the Bond series, though, it is a definite improvement.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
7.9 my a**e,"Never in a million years is this film as great as you're all making out! This film is different (NOT BETTER) than the other bond films and so has all the tired, boring sequences that you are just waiting for the 'hero' to sidestep so you can go and do something more interesting instead. There is a 'twist' (two in fact) and if you're over the age of ten i'm sure you'll get them within the first thirty minutes (although it feels a bit longer). I'm totally fed up...tell me, are you all being paid to give this film a high rating or are you just so in love with bond that you will give any film of this nature a thumbs up?

boring ... and I don't like this Bond either,"Sean Connery and Roger Moore did a fantastic job. And how many different Bond actors have there been since those 2 guys? Gosh, I lost count.

Very slow moving. No high-tech gadgets to speak of, which is very odd for a Bond movie. And no Q. How disappointing. I think this Bond may appeal to the female audience because he is so politically correct when it comes to females.

Best Bond film in 25 years,"Wow, what can i say? Not since the early days of roger moore has bond been so exciting, fresh and original. Such a good idea of the producers to go back to the source material, albeit with the modern twist. You just have to put all the chronology aside for a while and enjoy pure, gritty bond fun. And Daniel Craig...instantly places himself as the third best bond ever, (Connery, Moore, obviously) with an amazingly realistic understated and human performance. As for the action, two words...Free Running...WOW again. It has everything, a perfect mix of old tradition, and new invention. And if you're as big a fan as i am, when you hear that theme kick in you won't be able to help but well up! Bond is back to his best.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig is cut out for this,"I have read up on many reviews on Casino Royale, Well all i would like to all the reviews is that first please go and watch every James Bond movie made then compare Daniel Craig to the rest. Its easy to watch one movie and say oh well he is not as good as that, to be honest I will only listen to a critic who has spent time, money and some pleasurable hours watching james bond. All said and done I respect everyone's views and I amsure if they had something nice or bad to say they probably have their reasons. Well enough of an introduction here is the most important question that everyone wants answered, Is Daniel Craig fit to be James Bond? YES! There is not doubt about it, he has the skill, the accent (The best so far) and foremost the caliber to pull it off. One look at Casino Royale and you know that Daniel Craig is going to be the most brutal James Bond yet. The movie starts with Daniel Craig receiving his double 'o' status by executing a rogue intelligence agent, with two kills under his belt (The first being the rogue agents contact), one look and you know that Daniel Craig has lived up to the role, Casino Royale is the story of how James Bond becomes what he does, a calculated killer who trusts no one. Daniel Craig has done full justice to the role he has been handed, he makes mistakes, learns from his mistakes and moves on.Eva Green has done a brilliant job as Vesper Lynd the representative of HM Treasury, (Her Majesty's if you are wondering what the HM stands for). Her role in Kingdom of Heaven was what made me take notice and I feel she has surpassed herself in her current role. Kudos!. The movie's plot is brilliant and I like the way the director has stuck to the book as much as possible extrapolating to fit the current day's scenario. Daniel Craig however has actually done something that is not easy to portray, he as withing a span of 2 hours shown how a normal gun for hire type of person becomes a double 'o' agent. As a scene in the movie transpires you see what has happened.M: ""You don't trust anyone do you James?"" James Bond: ""No"" M: ""Then you have learn't your lesson..""From a person who tell Vesper Lynd that he loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her sailing the oceans, to a person who says ""The b***h is dead"" in the end. One can truly see how brutal the world around a secret agent can get, if Ian Fleming were to choose a movie that has done full justice to his books, he will go for this one no doubt.Back to Daniel Craig, he has pulled of the action sequences like no other James Bond ever has, not even Timothy Dalton or Pierce Brosnan, he is beat up, tortured, poisoned and there is no doubt that Casino Royale is probably the first movie that has shown James Bond being battered so much. So yes Daniel Craig has pulled it off no doubt, however if there is one thing that would like to mention here is that theme song of the movie has to be the most pathetic yet, I hated it and it could have been much better. The scene where James Bond is actually getting his privates pounded on by a rope is perhaps a true reflection on how well double agents handle adversity. The dialogue of the movie is no doubt from the same scene.James Bond: ""I have an itch down there, do you mind?"" Le Chiffere, proceeds to pound James Bond's privates with a the rope James Bond (Laughing):: ""Now I can tell the whole world you scratched my b**ls""Now that is what I call pissing someone off.So to round up, should you watch this movie? Oh yes! and once again, Daniel Craig is cut out for this. As always no revealing the plot.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""I'm sorry, that last hand... nearly killed me""","Casino Royale.Was a bit hesistant about going to see a Bond film at the Cinema. If I was 12 years old again, I'd probably have snapped your hand off. That said, I'm glad I did. And while Casino Royale is seriously bathing in the limelight and hype right now, it is pretty damn good -- even if I have some reservations.To the point -- Daniel Craig is a good Bond, probably the best since Connery. Nothing beats Connery tho. The thing that immediately bugged me about Craig, is he doesn't have a northern accent. We're not asking for a thick accent here, but if we're re-inventing Bond let's get him away from sounding like a politician. On the plus side, he looks the part, his character is crazy instead of suarve.Casino Royale does share similarities to previous Bonds, and so it should. It also reflects todays big crime - terrorism and its sponsers. Rather than your typical Bond tho, where we have a larger than life evil villain, Casino is split over several bad characters, who non of which, are particularly ridiculous or ""pet"" lap cats. Shame.For what it is, Casino is super-looking, intelligent, harder & more daring. It is a brilliant action thriller. It has probably the best on foot chase scene ever, great fights, nice women and probably my fave scene -- Bond being poisoned. What bugs me about all of this is (apart from him getting loved up), none of this ""new era"" Bond would have surfaced if it wasn't for the Bourne franchise (Bourne Identity & Supremacy). For me, Bourne is definitely the new leader,this is the reason why we're watching Daniel Craig pummel his enemies in the way he does. Is that a goodthing or bad thing..I'm not sure? I just think this new James-Bond-worship is yet to be earned.-Paulo",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Smashing action sequences but the gambling scenes are too lengthy...,"First, let me say that DANIEL CRAIG makes a very believable James Bond and is certainly up to the demands of all the action sequences. What he seems to lack (in between all the brawls and stunts) is the sort of charm that characterized Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan when they weren't engaged in stunts. He has piercing blue eyes, a cold look, a nasty temper when aroused and all the other attributes needed for Bond--but he could work on the charm.Two more minor complaints: I wasn't at all impressed with either of the Bond girls--each with accents that hindered understanding their words when they whispered--which was often and neither one a great beauty.And secondly, that theme song under the opening credits added nothing to the credits which were, in themselves, stunning to look at with gorgeous graphic art. The song was a complete throwaway and ""you know my name"" was about the only phrase I could decipher from the lyrics sung at full blast.Other than that, no complaints except that the gambling scenes went on a little too long--with some exciting intervals between playing a card game involving millions which Bond had to prevent from going to fund terrorist activities. All of the Bond action scenes were superb, the best of their kind, with realistic beatings and risks being taken at full steam ahead. How anyone managed not to get injured during the making of this film, I'll never understand. Those stunt players (and Craig himself) deserve kudos for what they pull off here in the way of action-filled moments. One of the most memorable is the chase up and down construction sites that gets the story off to a flying start.JUDY DENCH does a great job as ""M"", giving Bond a tongue-lashing for what she calls his overgrown ego that is stifling his judgment. I've seen better villains in other Bond films and nothing particularly memorable here to make me change my mind--except that the torture scene is almost unbearable to watch.Overall, it's a stunning Bond action film with just an occasional lag but it manages to hold interest throughout with some choice bits of editing and direction. And DANIEL CRAIG comes through with flying colors except for that one ingredient--sophisticated charm. He could work on that as he grows into the part.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A fresh gaze at the bond films.,"I'll admit, I never saw any Bond films in my younger days. I am in my early thirties, and I have always loved to watch action movies, but I never considered the Bond films before, and with new, and different things happening in this new film, I rented all the Bond films I could...and then I went to see this movie. I LOVED it. I'll admit, I wish I had been more of a fan in the know of the character before this film was released, but oh well, I had a lot of fun. I can't wait to see more bond films with Daniel Craig. I liked him in ""Layer Cake"" and the recent biopic film ""Infamous"", so I wasn't too surprised...I was actually blasted with amazement! This guy is a real actor...not a 'star', but an ""Actor"". I really like this guy. I also liked this film.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Sometimes it's a good thing to reinvent the wheel.,"And this was fun, fun all the way. Daniel Craig is the sexiest Bond ever, a crystal-clear-blue-eyed, outwardly machismo guy, with an inward vulnerability and abs to die for.Standard Ian Fleming plot updated for 2006 with (surprise!) less of the gizmos and gear than prior Bonders,and more character development of the female lead, Vesper Lynd, played by Eva Green.Everything was just about predictable from the get-go, some incredible stunt work on cranes and speedy switching of locations which makes seeing it in a wide screen theatre the best choice. The denouement in Venice is stunning, the collapse of an old building riveting.Craig brings an authenticity to the character not seen before on film, and I have seen quite a few of the prior Bond films albeit as a reluctant partner.The torture scenes are brutal, they would make even the most virile of male viewers whimper, the poker scenes were ho-hum, the baccarat called for in the original books disappears, the villain, played incredibly well by Mads Mikkelsen, is underwritten, not enough back-story to engage the viewer.I'm sure it is the beginning of a long and beautiful series, I'm glad it's attracting the full female audience quotient, I accompanied a 90 year old female who thoroughly enjoyed the afore-mentioned eyeful of Daniel Craig and the spectacular locations shots (Lake Como has never looked more lovely). 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What am I missing?,"I don't get it. I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was unbelievably disappointed. I must be really stupid. Besides being massively confused (too many subplots and way too many characters -- who was I meant to despise? -- who really was the villain?), I kept waiting for some resemblance to the 007 I know and love. Maybe it was true to Ian Fleming's intentions, but not to my view of James Bond -- but more importantly, it came nowhere close to my idea of a movie with a solid plot. Again, I must be missing it. The action was great, the vulnerabilities of this James Bond were evident and I honestly liked the persona he created as well as that of M, but it left me with too many questions. What was the point?

Casino Royale: The Ultimate Rebirth of 007,"After watching all the Bond films in 2024, one of the few movies I was eager to revisit was Casino Royale. This film stands as one of the finest reintroductions and reboots in cinema history. James Bond deserved a flawless reintroduction to modern audiences, and Casino Royale delivered precisely that.There are numerous aspects that make this film exceptional. Beginning with the plot, it is the closest adaptation of an Ian Fleming story we have seen. The flow and pacing of this film are impeccable, with not a single dull moment. The action scenes are all memorable, maintaining high engagement even during slower moments.Daniel Craig's portrayal of James Bond brought a fresh perspective to the character. While previous actors offered glimpses of this depth, Craig's portrayal is on another level. He created his own persona rather than mimicking his predecessors, making his Bond uniquely special. Craig's Bond is young, ruthless, and reckless, yet he strives to do the right thing. He is classy when needed and undeniably charming. The challenge for any actor following Craig is substantial, given the high bar he set.The supporting cast is equally impressive. Judi Dench returns as M and delivers a fantastic performance. Eva Green, as Vesper Lynd, is stunning and a superb actress, with palpable chemistry with Bond. Mads Mikkelsen, playing the villain Le Chiffre-a banker to the world's criminals and terrorists, a mathematical genius, and an expert chess player-delivers a standout performance. He is one of my favorite villains in the series.I am delighted they chose Martin Campbell as the director again. He has a unique talent for crafting great Bond films, and it's a pity he directed only two. The choreography of the action scenes is extraordinary and unlike anything seen before in the franchise. The score and soundtrack are also excellent, reflecting the love and care put into making this film.Casino Royale was a stellar reboot, marking the dawn of a new Bond era.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Casin Royale A Worthy Addition To The Series,"Casino Royale is a worthy addition to the series there are a few flaws but it's still an entertaining action adventure. The film tells the story of Bonds early years when he's promoted to 00 status. Daniel Craig has the difficult task of playing the iconic British spy James Bond coming in after Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and most recently Pierce Bronsan who have also played the character. Craig is great in the role and completely believable as Bond the British spy who is willing to kill in order to protect his country. The supporting cast overall turn in solid performances including Eva Green as Vesper Lynd a potential love interest for Bond, Mads Mikkelsen as the villain corrupt banker Le Chiffre, and Giancarlo Giannini as fellow agent Mathis. Jeffrey Wright as CIA Agent Felix Leiter and Judi Dench as M make the best of their small roles in the film who are Bond's allies in his quest to stop Le Chiffre. The rest of the cast also turn in good performances. The action which can get over the top sometimes is exhilarating and everything else in the film works. One of the movies flaws is the the running time of 144 minutes did make it feel sort of long and the pace was slow at times. Another one was the lack of a real bad ass villain (which some recent films also lacked). I mean Mikkelsen does what he can with Le Chiffree but his character isn't that menacing or scary (like most recently the late Heath Ledger's Joker or Anthony Hopkins Hannibal Lecter to name a few). He seemed like an average villain and not much of a threat to Bond. But other than that it's still a good action movie with equally impressive performances by it's cast. Well done.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Edgy and Elegant,"I've recently decided to watch or re-watch all of the James Bond films. I have probably only seen about 25% of them, and none of the Daniel Craig turns until I saw Skyfall in the theater last month. I knew going in that Casino Royale has a high reputation, and I feel that it lives up to it.This is a sharp, fast-paced film with an elegant aesthetic. Daniel Craig works for me. His stoic physicality and sky-blue eyes give a real edge and seriousness to the role. To me, Pierce Brosnan never had that sort of edge. Eva Green is just luminous, and her part is significant and well-written, not a throwaway gimmick to add cheap sex appeal. The cinematography and settings are beautiful. There are some terrific, relentless action sequences, but also some very studied quiet and casual moments. Just a pinch of humor, as well.I regard Casino Royale far more highly than Skyfall. The latter is entertaining and has some great moments, but the former is to me just so much better as an overall film. Not just a fun action film, but a work of art. Very nice.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Martin Campbell brings us a satisfying reboot; this is how Bond is meant to be seen.,"Bond movies are at the core of the action film genre. Not only is this series the most financially successful of all time, but the films appeal to nearly every generation. Make no mistake, though; Casino Royale abandons the cheesy and light-hearted demeanor of its predecessors and instead focuses on an in-depth analysis of Bond's beginnings... including one hell of a poker game.This installment begins with a summing-up of Bond's first two kills to achieve his ""00"" status. Here, we begin to realize that Bond will be displayed as a far more vulnerable and deep character. At the helm of the most difficult role in 007 history is Daniel Craig, who proves that he is a formidable addition to the cavalcade of actors chosen for Bond. It soon becomes apparent that we'll be seeing more of him in the series. Eva Green is introduced as Vesper Lynd. This is interesting. If you watch this movie expecting a beautiful broad with a name you can't say twice on television, you're only partially correct. Vesper features an individualism only seen in such roles as Honor Blackman's Pussy Galore, and ""Agent Triple X"" in the Spy Who Loved Me. Bond succumbs to Lynd's beauty and impeccable character which has faint reminders of... Bond himself. They ultimately fall in love when Lynd has ""stripped Bond of his armor."" Without spoiling anything, I'll just say that the result from this relationship is the Bond we've all come to know and love over the 50+ years since his initial birth in Ian Fleming's legendary series.Aside from our leads, Mads Mikkelson gives a great performance as the lead villain, Le Chiffre. This particular megalomaniacal genius has an unfailing ability to calculate the odds in a poker match, and--thank God--he's physically deformed! Le Chiffre has a scar over his eye (reminds me of Donald Pleasance's Blofeld) and weeps blood. Judi Dench returns to the role of M. A feature of this reboot is the development in Bond and his superior's relationship, which is one of the many differences from Bernard Lee's character.Casino Royale has small and satisfying reminders of Bonds long past; such as the gun barrel intro, the best opening credit sequence since ""Live and Let Die,"" 007's famous ""Bond, James Bond"" line, Felix Lester (Jeffrey Wright is excellent here), and a couple of snappy comebacks.It's almost insulting to call this and action movie. In the action genre we see henchmen firing machine guns at the hero/heroine when no bullet actually hits, and features melodramatic acting with a terrible script. Casino Royale is the polar opposite.I've fallen for every aspect of Casino Royale. A must see for every Bond fan, I give it a well-deserved 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Weren't OO'S meant to be suave and sophisticated. I.E. Sean Connery. All Craig does is beat some guys up straight away. So predictable. The Bond girls are alright but again predictable as before.

"A Revitalized Bond with Thrills, Class, and a Dash of Imperfection","""Casino Royale"" rejuvenates the James Bond franchise with a fantastic blend of action, story, and character. This film stands out for its exhilarating action sequences that are not only intense but also creatively executed, setting a new benchmark for the series. The visual aesthetics of the movie are both beautiful and sophisticated, perfectly complementing the film's high-stakes atmosphere.Daniel Craig's debut as James Bond is nothing short of brilliant. He brings a fresh, gritty realism to the character, effectively balancing suave sophistication with a raw physicality. The supporting cast complements Craig's performance admirably, adding depth and intrigue to the story.The narrative of ""Casino Royale"" is well-crafted, striking a fine balance between high-octane action scenes and quieter, more introspective moments. This pacing allows for a more rounded and engaging storytelling experience, keeping viewers both thrilled and emotionally invested.However, the film occasionally falters with its dialogue, which at times aims for profundity but falls short, coming across as forced rather than insightful. These moments can be somewhat jarring, momentarily pulling the viewer out of an otherwise immersive experience.In conclusion, ""Casino Royale"" is a standout addition to the James Bond series. It successfully revitalizes the franchise with its intense action, compelling storyline, and strong character portrayals. Despite minor missteps in dialogue, the film remains an immensely enjoyable and refreshing take on the iconic spy saga, making it a must-watch for both Bond enthusiasts and newcomers alike.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Technically Polished, Dramatically Bland Prequel","""Casino Royale,"" the only prequel in the long running James Bond series, introduces the sixth actor to play James Bond on screen (discounting the silly 1967 spy spoof of the same name), is technically polished; all it lacks is suspense, mystery and entertainment value. As a rule, I hate prequels, the exceptions being ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" and ""Batman Begins;"" unfortunately, ""Casino Royale"" is no exception. Sure, it's realistic, in the ""Bourne Identity"" mold. However, after watching James Bond as ""Superman"" all these years, how excited can one get watching two hours of him as ""Clark Kent""? I keep hearing what an ""exceptional"" Bond Daniel Craig is, as though my previous misgivings were SO wrong. Well, anyone who had seen Craig in ""Layer Cake"" or ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" knew Craig has the acting chops and action chops to play James Bond. Unfortunately, Craig lacks the spark that has tied all previous James Bond's together (even the morbid Timothy Dalton), and that's empathy. I don't care what happens to Craig's Bond; and, given the very little action in ""Casino Royale,"" that's murderous to enjoying the movie. Worse, Craig looks older than his predecessor, Pierce Brosnan. Eva Green's cleavage is the best element of her performance as Vesper; she's not bad, just forgettable, and has little chemistry with Craig.Barbara Brocolli would have better served herself if she'd ""kissed and made up"" with Pierce Brosnan, and had ""Casino Royale"" rewritten as his swan song. Maybe have a terrorist attack be blamed on Bond's incompetence, and ""M"" being forced to retire him after one final ""small potatoes"" case. ""Casino Royale"" would then have been a story of redemption. Maybe add one final twist as Brosnan's ""Bond"" goes off to marry Green's ""Vesper"". Have ""M"" reveal that, like ""Bourne,"" both the name ""James Bond"" and number ""007"" are assigned (as suggested in the 1967 ""Casino Royale""), and that another agent will eventually be assigned the name and number. Now, that might have made an entertaining movie.""Casino Royale"" is certainly one of the better made Bond films; however, without a doubt, it's the least entertaining in the series. I feel I have been vindicated in my previous misgivings about Craig; and despite the explosive notices and box office for ""Casino Royale,"" I predict Craig's next outing as Bond will be a box office failure. I give ""Casino Royale"" a ""6"".",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Spectacular stunts and scenery, disjointed plot","This movie had incredible stunts and exotic venues, from seaside villas to magnificent wood-carved rooms. However, the plot unfolded like an I-Ching reading--resembling a loosely related pile of entities which could only be interpreted by filling in the blanks and by having some intuitive luck at figuring out how this bunch of scenes is supposed to be tied together in one movie. With any Bond film, we have to suspend belief as James flings and contorts his way through bombs, skewers, and third-world assassins. However, in previous Bond films, it was clear that the character was a figment of Fleming's imagination, akin to no real-life hero. Not so with this film, that unsuccessfully blended the reality of torture with the an occasional funny moment. Leading the list of disjointed characters is M, which may stand for ""mother"" or ""murder"" depending upon the scene in which we catch her. No one is constant in this film except Bond, and even he is unremorsefully guilty of cold acts of violence. This movie should have ended after the sweet pseudo-denouement, which would have spared us from the last roller coaster ride into puzzlement about the final scenes. Perhaps the last part would have sufficed as an alternative ending, but it did not ring with a satisfying note as a full-fledged movie conclusion. A movie of this advertised caliber should not have been edited by minimum-wage teenagers, but that's what it felt like by the end. I prefer my Bond as a character who knows he's playing Bond, not as an attempt to make him a nitty-gritty reality. Put more reality into the plot, so we can follow the action unfettered with confusion.",4.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Worst Bond EVER!!!!,"This is by far the worst Bond movie ever. There is nothing Bond about this movie. The character was Americanized and dumbed down to a level even XXX and Jet Li fans would find boring. No cheeky one liners, no sophistication, no resemblance of 007. If you enjoyed the Dalton Bond movies or you enjoy half-hour chase scenes and an endless poker game by all means have at it. If you are a Bond fan skip it, and pass on the DVD (rental or otherwise). At first, I thought the film was trying to go back in sequence and produce a legitimate Casino Royale (as the previous was a spoof), but really, no continuity, no originality, just a horrible production. He drove a Ford Escort for pity's sake. They even went so far as to bring in terrorism and 9/11. Did anyone even catch the irony of them dredging up 9/11 and airport security then had the balls to shoot the final scene with a building toppling down. I regret sitting through the entire film and hope this saves anyone else the trouble.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Refreshing,"Casino Royale gives the Bond franchise a decent injection of adrenaline that it needed to be relevant again.Chances are, you already know what Casino Royale is about, so I won't go too much into details. It is a difficult film to review, mainly because it will obviously be compared to all the other Bond movies (which I can't say I'm a fan of, they're mostly hit and miss decent enough action movies) and also because there is quite an odd structure to the proceedings. (Though, this may be because it doesn't follow the same structure as most other Bond movies.) I'll just get into it, the film succeeds due to the reinvention of the Bond character and becoming a back to basics film, this can be credited to both Daniel Craig and the scriptwriter for the former, and Martin Campbell for the latter. I'm sure I'm not the only one who is annoyed at the level of CGI used in films these days, it's usually so obvious it detracts from the film and lessens the impact due to it being completely fake looking. Thankfully, Casino Royale ditches this in favour of a more realistic approach, including the likes of Sebastien Foucan, parkour extraordinaire (the reason I wanted to see the film) to create some realistic, hard hitting action scenes.Another aspect where the film succeeds is the relationship between Bond and Vesper Lynd, which was a joy to watch, and a welcome change from the bordering on Benny Hill antics that the likes of Roger Moore got into.So, it's got solid realistic action, rounded enough characters for an action film (including the main ""villain"" Le Chiffre, who despite his eye gimmick keeps up with the reinvention of Bond, given decent reasons for his villainous actions, not just a madman bent on world domination.) The film fails on a few levels, as big and action packed and Bond as it is, I felt it may have worked better in three short episodes due to it's odd structure and pacing, it feels like three films pasted together. This is probably due to the fact that I was expecting a typical Bond structure, (Bond tracks villain, Bond beds women, Bond beats villain, Bond gets his girl, end) which the film was brave enough to ditch, so not really a big failure. The other main failure is the now mandatory product placement, (the scene with the Ford looking particularly just like a car advert) but I usually look upon product placements as tongue in cheek myself, and have a bit of a giggle about it rather than kick up a fuss.In a nutshell, Casino Royale is a meandering journey with James Bond, complete with hard hitting scrapes, gambling for the Queen, and relationships with women. A very entertaining film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

I love it!,"It's impossible to overstate the radical nature of this Bond entry. After the disappointing Die Another Day, Bond was struggling to keep up with the times. But bringing Bond back to the beginning and adapting the first Bond book was a masterstroke that injected new life into the series. It's remarkable that Martin Campbell managed to reinvent the Bond franchise twice, with the two most radical departures from the Bond formula. Casino Royale owes its very existence to GoldenEye.Craig is the quintessential rough and tough Bond, unlike any other actor who has taken on the role. He's more athletic than his predecessors, as demonstrated in the parkour chase scene. But he doesn't sacrifice his wit or his command of the poker table either, especially when he's paired with Eva Green.And speaking of Eva Green, her death is by far the most impactful and emotional death in the entire Bond franchise. It feels genuine and weighty, and her relationship with Bond gives his philandering nature in the other films more context.And let's not forget that music cue! The way they keep you waiting until the very end is masterful.In summary, this isn't just a top-tier Bond film; it's a top-tier thriller and action movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Great Start,"'Casino Royale' is the first James Bond film starring Daniel Craig and it's a fantastic start for him.The acting is generally good; Craig gives a great performance as 007 despite concerns and he has made this role his own. Judi Dench returns as M and acts very well as expected; she also provides quite a lot of comedy throughout the film. Mads Mikkelsen plays a great antagonistic role here but more screen-time would have been better. Eva Green was a bit of a disappointment; her character worked well but Green spoke to quickly and quietly meaning it was difficult to hear most of her lines except from towards the end where the film is quieter anyway.The script was well-written but because the beginning and the ending are both so high-octane, action-packed and simply brilliant, the middle of the film felt a bit flat and sometimes ever boring.Overall, this is a fantastic film which I would recommend to fans of previous Bond films or even action film lovers who have yet to see one.

First time seeing any James Bond movie,"Yeah it was good. I think I've seen a lot of it before through other movies but I guess at the time of its release it might have been pretty original which I understand. The action is very good and looks incredibly real which is quite scary and makes it even more tense than it should be. There are some bits of action that are incredibly exaggerated which made me laugh but it's understandable for a high budget movie. The music is excellent but quite loud, sometimes I actually struggled to hear the dialogue because of how loud it was this added to my confusion with some of the plot. The plot itself is pretty good also, I personally don't think it's anything spectacular but it does the job and has some twists here and there that kind of feel flat for me but where still achieved well. The characters are kinda dull, I mean James Bond himself is supposed to be a secret which is fine and could work well but they maybe could have added some development to his character.

If you saw any of the other bond movies, you will always see him sleeping with at least 2 girls, always being charming with the women, and always introducing himself as ""Bond, James Bond"",and (I think ) in this movie, it never happens. *SPOILER* This movie ends, and Bond is alone and seeking for revenge.... WTF???? and only for a girl... my god he only loved one girl and married her, but was killed that same day (never heard before he had another girl that got killed).

The mobile phone bond,"There was the one I'll always remember as the diving bond, there was the skiing bond, the space station bond, the train bond, the voodoo bond, the one with the jetpac, the one with the hat, the one with the cat (or was that the pussy). This bond, this ""reinvention of the series"" bond will for ever after be stuck in my head as the one with the mobile/cell phones. It seems that every plot twist involves the use of a mobile. And after a while it feels like a very cheap plot device. But of course there is nothing cheap about it, there are so many mobile phones in this movie that one has to wonder how much money the different brands paid to have their latest model included. Speaking of product placement one of the worst moments in the movie happens when our new and fresh Mr. Bond meets the main bond-girl and she comments on his watch asking if it is a Rolex, he replies no that it is an Omega. And to make matters worse she replies ""Nice!"" Yes people I think Omega will pay a bit extra for that one word. And now guess what every yuppie grown-up boy bond fan will be wanting from his missus for Christmas. ""Nice!"" They should have cut some bits out of it and tidied it up a bit. And for me the whole bit with the crane was just too unbelievable, I hear laughing at some of the stunts during that aerial chase scene. I'm not saying that bond should be believable; it has to bend rules and strive for the spectacular. But if they go to such lengths to re-energize the series with a grittier and more realistic bond then perhaps they should have kept the matrix-like leaping from building to building to a minimum. Spectacular, maybe if you are 15. And the defibrillator in his car thing, (with the loose wire, come on!) surely there could have been a better way of dealing with the fact that he was poisoned. This is a good bond movie, not a classic but certainly not an embarrassment.

One quick observation though: did anyone else notice a quick cameo by Richard Branson, Billionaire owner of Virgin Airways? I think I saw him in the scene in the Miami airport as Bond was heading through the metal detector screening area. I know it's not a big deal but someone else take a look and let me know what you think.Considering the plot point at that time in the movie it kind of makes sense that he would be there. After that time I kept looking for other cameos and the camera seemed to linger on some other characters but I didn't recognize anyone else.The movie was great, though. I heard one critic say that it was made kind of in the same vein as the Bourne series. I concur.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Bond Film,"I grew up on the Bond series since my parent's first date was to a Bond movie. I love them, and probably have seen all of them more than once (especially the Connery Bonds since my mom had a sweet spot for him), but I found that this one if by far the best Bond I have ever seen. It had more heart, a more natural characteristic to it and was about the ability of bond, not his toys. Some very cool tricks to be awed by, first action scene in particular. Daniel Craig handled himself very well in the role and I guarantee that any one who goes to see this one will not be disappointed. action scenes are amazingly well put together and there is no question about the special effects (which are minimal). The wit alone would be a reason to see this film...very much a raw talent that Craig delivers in flawless time. It has heart, action, charisma, charm, and a repertoire that left my twenty year old room mates wishing they could be like Bond.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
bond's back!,"saw it today, loved it! If your a bond fan, please ignore all those who weren't willing to give the guy a chance in the 1st place, he's proved them all wrong! He's an excellent choice for a younger bond. He plays him with a darkness not seen since the Connery era, dark, bit ruthless but suave. If you want to know how good an actor he is, I recommend you watch a very good British gangster movie called layer Cake, he does a screen test of sorts for the bond role in it but is also very good! Great actor, great choice in my opinion.the movie form the opening credits is all go and the story's one of the best as it shows Bond in his early days and at his rawest emotionally and in his methods of dealing with his opponents.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good bond film,"I think the best James bond was Pierce brosnan - I know you disagree with this, but that's my opinion.Despite the hype surrounding CR which many people claim is the greatest Bond movie ever there are a few flaws to it . One is that it follows the novel a bit too closely in the second half . In the novel Le Chiffre doesn't really do anything evil except play cards and wallop Bond in the genitals and this is recreated on screen . However this is rather small fry for a movie bad guy and you do find yourself wishing his cruelty could have fleshed out more . There's also an obligatory daft sequence where a defibrillator comes in to play which leads you to ask if Bond's a clairvoyant . CR also feels overlong by about half an hourThat said the first half is superb and the African scenes where Bond pursues his quarry back to the embassy are amongst the most exciting action sequences you will see in any movie . Likewise the attempted bombing at Miami airport that shows Bond can be a callous assassin when he has to be . Craig is wonderful in the role and he's helped in no small part by a lack of comedy situations and characters as seen in previous entries . Some people might miss Q and his gadgets but I didn't . I much preferred this serious character driven Bond.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Old school made,"The best action movie ever. This film has everything it needs to succeed: simple plot built with tension, no CGI, no politics/agenda, good soundtrack and dialogues. The essence of 007 is all in there, always standing out the manhood and giving us visceral scenes that draw our attention; James here couldn't be more authentic, the acting of Craig is flawless just like his stunts. About the ending I confess I wouldn't expect, its kinda a plot twist but I understand it was necessary for the sequencies was to come.If we could mix up the entire franchise that one would be Cassino Royale, an old-school-made for modern era.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Such a shame...,"Simply giving a guy a big gun, an Aston Martin and Dame Judy Dench as his boss doesn't make him James Bond.There are things Bond, and Bond movies, must have and do to be Bond, and this guy, and this movie, just hasn't got any of them.Sure he's ruthless, dispassionate and tough as a paid killer should be, but so was Jason Bourne. It can be no coincidence that Robert Ludlum called his amnesiac trained assassin Jason Bourne  JB right? It even sounds like Sean Connery's pronunciation of 'James Bond'. Has the Bond franchise been bullied into hardening up the character to compete with the Bournes, Ethan Hunts and XXXs of the cinematic world? I can see the need to compete, but not to the extent of compromising the character. Don't they realise that all the others are just wannabe Bonds? They're trying to reach his level, so why make it easy by dropping down to theirs? The producers would have us believe that this is a new Bond. 'Forget the past' they say. But how can we? I've often said that Bond should go back to its roots and be started all over again afresh, it needed to and this was their golden opportunity, but they've done it half-heartedly and made a hash of it.It's already established in the Bond timeline that Bond is the veteran agent (no matter who played him), that he's been married (Lazenby wed in OHMSS, but the relationship was also referred to in OCTOPUSSY and LICENCE TO KILL, Moore and Dalton movies respectively), and that Judy Dench's 'M' is the newcomer. Now we are to believe that she is the veteran 'M' and Bond is the newly promoted agent. If this is supposedly a new Bond, why is she even there? She links the character with the previous movies. Having a completely new 'M' also would have helped enormously, Dame Judy's presence just screws it up.As to Bond himself, Daniel Craig, no matter how gifted an actor, is NOT Bond. The character is clearly defined and described in the books, and Craig just does not fit in any respect. The obvious starter is the fact that Bond as described is definitely not blonde. He certainly doesn't look like an ex-boxer. So, is this 'Ian Fleming's James Bond' as claimed in the credits, or is it now 'Micheal G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli's James Bond'? Also this is supposed to be a younger Bond at the beginning of his 00 career. Can any of you really tell me that Craig looks appreciably younger than Brosnan? Yes, Bond is a hired killer, and as I said earlier, ruthless, dispassionate, cruel even, but he's also handsome (sorry Daniel), suave, sophisticated, well educated, well heeled, has good tailors and knows his food and his drinks. He has to in order to mix in the circles in which he may find himself. Bond would never respond to the question 'Shaken or stirred sir?' with 'Do I look like I give a ****'. Bond was often shaken, but never stirred. James Bond was also an accomplished bullshitter. If you've ever read 'The Book of Bond  Every Man his own 007', supposedly written by 'M's Chief of Staff, and Bond's friend, Bill Tanner, but actually written by Kingsley Amis, you will find examples from the books to illustrate that if Bond doesn't know something he deftly makes up something, based on his experience, intelligence and education I hasten to add, totally feasible and believable in order to maintain his aura of total infallibility. Still bullshit all the same, but never, EVER would he allow himself to appear to be a simple thug (unless it suited his purposes of course). This is what makes him James Bond and the character that all other movie spies have aspired to since the franchise began. Think of all the characters, movies and TV series Bond has inspired: The Man from UNCLE, The Avengers, Mission Impossible and yes, even Jason Bourne, in fact any spy character created since 1962's DR. NO you can guarantee the creator has had James Bond at the back of his mind. If they can't BE James Bond, they counter James Bond with characters like Harry Palmer, David Callan or Alec Leamas, or they spoof James Bond with Derek Flint, Matt Helm and Austin Powers (though how you can spoof something that was a spoof in the first place). Bond also doesn't live in this world, and trying to make him a part of the real world just doesn't work. Bond lives in an exotic world, a world some of us wish we could be a part of, but our only link is through the screen. I don't go to see a Bond movie expecting reality, human frailty, serious drama  I want to see James Bond! It's been famously said that Bond is the man most men want to be and the man most women want to be with. There's a magic, a surrealism to Bond, and this movie just hasn't got it. It's a good movie (which is why it gets a 7), but it's not a Bond movie.Craig's character, and I mean that quite pointedly, states at the end of the movie that 'The name's Bond. James Bond'. Well, sorry, but no it isn't. It could be anybody. Maybe it was just put in to remind us what, and who, we were watching, either way it's killed my future interest in the franchise.Such a shame.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the Best Bonds,"Casino Royale (2006)*** 1/2 (out of 4)I'm not much of a fan of James Bond, although I've seen the early Connery films and the first three films with Brosnan. I'm really not in a hurry to see the others but I was somewhat fascinated by this film because I enjoyed Daniel Craig so much in Munich. I'm not sure how Bond fans feel about this film but I personally thought it was very good and certainly more refreshing than those boring films I had seen from Brosnan. I've read a couple reviews that said there wasn't enough action but I thought the film worked perfectly after the rather silly opening. Yes, the stunts were great in the first action piece but it seemed like a deleted scene from a Spider Man movie. After that opening sequence I thought the film really took off, which is mostly due to Craig who I thought was terrific in the role. I could have done without all the chest shots but I guess if I had a chest like him then I'd be showing it off anytime I could. The one problem I did have with the film was Eva Green who I thought was one of the least interesting girls I've seen. I didn't really feel any strong connection between her and Bond and thought the first girl (in the hotel) was better. The poker scene was wonderfully directed and it's not too easy to pull off scenes like this. The ending was also quite nice and thought the closing shots were near perfect and really makes me want to see the next film if they go for brains instead of action like this film did.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A rare reboot success that saved the franchise from mediocrity,"Casino Royale saved the franchise's legacy after the mostly underwhelming run of Pierce Brosnan.

Wow is the only word that fits,"OK I'm convinced. I've been a Bond fan since I got to see the older stuff on TV back in the 70s when I was a kid. The movies have gotten wackier over the years, partly because technology has allowed the movies to get that way and partly because people come to see the craziness that is a Bond film these days,not that I minded. They were what they are and didn't pretend they were anything else. Well fans of the early Sean Connery films can rejoice again because the Bond from the early 60's has been resurrected. Daniel Craig is about as perfect a choice as you can have in 2006 terms for a Bond film based on what was the first book in the actual series. The script is excellent, the acting first rate across the board, and even Judi Dench gets to show some backbone and toughness along with the human qualities she has been always been able to bring to it. The girls are beautiful and lethal when necessary, the stunts are fantastic and realistically performed, the only reason this didn't get my first 10 is this is one long movie, apparently the longest in the series, not that it drags much but I'm sure the editors could have chopped some down somewhere. In any case a fine ride for fans and might get a few converts along the way.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
All bets are off. Daniel Craig as Bond.,"All of the gnashing of teeth about Daniel Craig taking over as Bond can end. Craig doesn't even try to fit the mold created by Bond's previous avatars. He breaks the damn thing by making Bond his own, and he becomes the man that Ian Fleming originally envisioned in the process. Don't get me wrong, this Bond is sharp, smart, and cool like the Bonds before him, but that's where the similarity ends. Gag lines are held to a blessed minimum, making even Connery's Bond seem like a wisecracker by comparison. It's a darker Bond we see here -- one that truly seems at ease killing people and for whom audacious risk-taking seems not only natural, but obvious. Craig also brings a visceral physicality to Bond that we've never seen before. The man actually looks like he could be a secret agent. That is to say he looks like someone who has put in years in an elite commando force -- built to fight and to endure when the going gets tough. (We get to see quite a lot of Craig's physique in this film too.) I will have to see him in more than one outing to say Craig has dethroned Sean Connery, but he's definitely put Connery on notice with Casino Royal.I will add that this is the tightest plotting I've ever seen in a Bond film. The story makes sense and there is motivation and an emotional connection with the characters that has been lacking in most of the Broccoli franchise Bond films. This is one Bond film that will definitely be added to my collection on the day the DVD hits the stores.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Good movie that stands on it's own.,"I saw Dr. No with my father when it first came out and have been a Bond fan ever since. I did not know what to expect going in to see this film as I have never seen Daniel Craig in a movie before. The thing that struck me about Casino Royale was that I enjoyed the movie on its own merit; it did not feel like I was watching a ""Bond"" film. I don't know how to explain it, but until the end of the movie, I did not think of Mr. Craig as Bond. I don't know if that was what they were trying to do, but he didn't look like Bond and he didn't act like Bond. However, the character did grow on me and in the end I completely enjoyed the movie. Craig had managed to make his own character, that his name was James Bond, was something that I had to get used too. The story was intriguing, the action was intense and realistic without being over the top, and the acting was spot on from everyone, I really liked Giancarlo Giannini, Eva Green, and Judi Dench. All in all, I would recommend this film to everyone, the cinematography in all the locations was great, typical of a Bond film.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

There is a lot of fun and ""internal jokes"" for fans, villain Le Chiffre is Charismatic and you may like him. This is second time, when director Martin Campbell brought 007 to new era.

Best bond ever,"If you grew up reading Ian Fleming's books, I suspect you will love this movie. If, however, James Bond means nothing more to you than a cinematic event, you may be disappointed--but then again, maybe not. This movie has the best chase scene I have ever viewed. The new James Bond is less showy, in my opinion, and far more dangerous. He does not rely on gadgets to save the day. His hands and his lightning quick decision-making skills make him a powerful adversary. He is all too human, while proving once and for all that he his king of the super spies. And then of course there are the bond girls, who likewise are better--I'm not talking about actresses, but the characters themselves--than previous bond girls, in my opinion.

"Decent, but ultimately a disappointment","The famous secret agent's first mission as a '00' agent. He must win a high stakes poker game at a luxurious casino in order to thwart the operations of Le Chiffre, an elusive criminal who funds the world's most dangerous and richest terrorists by playing the stock market.It has been 4 years since everyone's favorite spy has been on an assignment and here he is, back on the job. Well, continuity-wise, this is a flashback in the series as it is Bond's first mission as 007, but for fans that should hardly matter, since it's all about seeing Bond doing what he does best. And Daniel Craig fits the role quite well with his more rugged approach to the role. He's suave and handsome like the previous actors who have played the spy, but is undoubtedly better at portraying the cold-hearted nature of Bond's job. The rugged looks, cold expression, and intense fight scenes push Bond into a slightly more realistic world and the action is hardly glamorized here. It is just serious and intense stuff, no holds barred. Having seen all the other Bond movies, I have never seen Bond so bloody or have that ""holyshit that nearly killed me"" look.However, that is not the Bond that people have come to love for the past 40+ years. Another problem is the plot. It is a pretty big deviation from the previous Bond formula - very little gadgets, no Q, though continuity-wise within the series this makes sense, but gives the film a sense of dullness especially since it takes place in present day, not 1962 when gadgets were in fact rare. Also the villain and his presentation is a huge disappointment. Bond plots have usually revolved around hot political topics (oil reserves, ethics of news reporting, drugs, terrorism), but in their own fun way, and here we get another interesting topic - funding for terrorists. But the film never takes it to the fun and ridiculous heights that Bond has been to before. The plot seems contrived and, especially by the end, confusing and silly. Even as a Bond film it doesn't hold enough water as it should with the story and characters taking some really dumb turns by showing James Bond as a 3D character with inner and outer struggle. Bond has only outer struggle - stop the villain. It's what makes him an enjoyable escapist character. Also the big card game (of Texas Holdem, nonetheless) is shown in a surprisingly dull manner with little style and barely enough tension to merit such a key moment.Then there is the ending, which is tuned for the next entry in the same vein as many other blockbusters films of today. That is yet another deviation from the Bond formula. Innovation is good, but the fact of the matter is Bond is formulaic and has been for over 40 enjoyable years. Even Shakespeare's sonnets are formulaic so formula isn't bad, it's the playing with the details and creating new rhythms and rhymes while presenting new ideas is what fans want.Casino Royale senselessly tries to show Bond as a more realistic character which he is most definitely not, but it remains a fairly good action film that spares the audience CGI that Die Another Day, for instance, overused. --- 6/10Rated PG-13 for violence and intense action",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond in ages!,"In all honesty, I thought Casino Royale was the best 007 movie since Roger Moore's A View To A Kill. While many felt that wasn't a great Bone outing, I thought it was terrific, especially with the great Christopher Walken as the villainous billionaire Max Zorin, and Tanya Roberts as the beautiful Stacy Sutton. Casino Royale had two beautiful women, an excellent plot (far better than any of the flicks after ""For Your Eyes Only,"" and fighting scenes that would impress Steven Seagal. So there is a non-spoiler review of the film. Whether you are a Bond fan or not, this movie is enthralling and involves one of the most tense poker scenes in movie history. Highest rating.

No Sex Appeal in Daniel Craig,"Sorry...everyone else seems to really like Daniel Craig as James Bond; but I didn't. James Bond is English, a gentleman and a charmer. Craig's Bond was none of these. This Bond wasn't even likable. I couldn't fathom how Solange or Vesper Lynd should have found him attractive because he didn't even flirt with them. Somehow, his scenes with them lacked sparks. To me, he had no sex appeal. Also, while M seemed to be fond of Bond there was no justification for it in the movie. Was it mother instinct or a sexual attraction to a younger man? We had no basis to guess. With her he was truculent and rude. I just didn't discern any warmth in this Bond. He could as easily have been an android. Also, thought Craig was overly bulked up on the shoulder musclessomehow it didn't look natural. The original Bond would not have been so obviously muscular.

The baddie was excellent. I will definitely be buying this on DVD as soon as it comes out. I recommend other people to think about watching this film. It was amazing.

"New Ground, New Space","We have a new level in cinematic motion.This movie is in three parts, each part engineered excellently, much more so than the norm.In this case, the Hollywood system really did give us something cinematic and newly artistic in its way.The first part consists of an introduction to the world we will inhabit for two and a half hours. It's a few moments in grainy black and white. In any movie, the filmmaker has a challenge in letting us know where to snap our cinematic imaginations to. They have to do that in the first few moments, using cues and shorthand. Its a special challenge for a Bond film because we have come to expect a certain sex as humor, adventure as gadget stance. A certain notion of open space and global movement with cartoonish, bloodless intrigue.These filmmakers had to overcome that in a few moments, and they did. You immediately know where you need to place your mind with this strong reference to noir plus the notion that it will be diluted. This is followed by the title sequence which has more realistic components overlain on iconic cartoons. The theme is guns shooting hearts, spades and so on. The message is concise: fate, chance, human intervention. This isn't the most amazing introduction I've seen, but you can see that they understood the problem and addressed it with a very clean and direct engineering of the cinematic world.Part 3 is the main movie. Its good enough, as Bond works up the levels of the organization and escapes many times. I liked the fact that its nor flavored in the sense that a man is pitted against what seems the way the way the world is put together. The one glaring flaw in this part was Eva Green. She was miraculously perfect in ""The Dreamers,"" where her job was to represent the embodiment of desire in the context of counter-culture as adolescent, sex as movie. Allure is a relatively simple act.Here she has to be a powerful person, intriguing, intense. Willing to deeply go together but with knowledge of her own way. She is supposed to be every bit the equal of Bond and in half of the universe his better. She isn't. In fact, I cannot think of any actress alive that could have pulled this off and still fit within the constraints of the ""Bond girl"" which implies certain appearance.But forget all that. The reason to see this is because of the second part. The Bond formula is to have an exciting chase scene at the very beginning. It need have little to do with the main plot, and is there to circumnavigate expectations. If the movie will be heavily dependent on amazing gadgets, you need to display some in this section. In the past, these have been adventurous and clever.This time they have done something so well I want to send you to the theater just for it. They've broken new ground cinematically I think in how they have put this together. Its a chase sequence, Bond chasing a guy that is a suspected bomber. No cars, airplanes, skis, purely a footrace except for one use of a bulldozer. The action itself is remarkable, with these guys moving in space with such grace. And they readily move in three dimensions, up and through cranes and a building skeleton. Naturally there are explosions and objects moving dangerously. But that by itself is not the magic.The magic is in how the camera places us, our eyes. The characters move and we move with them, more energetically. Some of the eye positions we find ourselves in are where cameras would ordinarily be: at eye level with a steadycam or jiggly hand-held; in a helicopter, swooping over a crane. Other eye positions have us confabulated in the action, tangled in legs or the swirl of a fight. Yet others are familiar from animated adventures, those few new camera swoops that must be preprogrammed into compositing software. And then there are some new positions that seem to have been selected only because of their oddity. Plus we have mistakes, the eye getting too excited and looking in the wrong place, as if we were pushing ourselves in the chase and occasionally looking about or getting our situation wrong.And it isn't just where we are, its the pacing of how these are interrelated. We don't have time to shift position, so we are carried along in ALL positions, us in a way being the whole space that they rush through. Us as space. Our eye not as simple sensor of a world but our whole selves redefined as what we can see and blended in a say, 60 foot diameter snake chasing these two guys as mongeese, containing them and threatening them.Its new space, new territory. I wish it were a whole project that had more purpose than collecting our coins by giving us a rush. But there you are.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"After watching Quantum of Solance, Skyfall and Spectre...","... I realized what a Masterpiece Casino Royale was. I was never a big fan of 007. The Bond of my youth is Pierce Brosnan, and I can't say I like him too much. The movies were relatively cheesy, ludicrous and plain boring. When I watched this one here, I was 14 and didn't really realize what of an amazing movie I had just watched. I watched it again just yet, after watching Spectre, and was blazed by this movie. To make a long story short: This movie has it all. James Bond is a cool, modern Agent, with less finesse than his predecessors, but more power, action, tension and actual coolness. The movie was exciting, had great chasing scenes (especially the opening scene), great dialogue and great humor (Bond: Vodka Martina! Waiter: Shaken or stirred? Bond: Do I look like I give a damn)... For me, this was an impeccable movie experience. The movie has humor, action, a very cool poker match, the (IMO) best Bond girl of all time (Eva Green was great in that role!), a great bad guy (not the plain bad, ""I just want to rule the world"" bull crap.)

The Best Bond movie ever made,"Daniel Craig's James Bond portrayal is the definition of what acting can and should be. Casino Royale is not just a great Bond franchise reboot but it is a great movie and not just an action movie but a great spy model for others who follow will struggle to strive for and in all likelihood will never equal. The components of Casino Royale and Ian Fleming's Bond played by Daniel Craig has meet all the levels of the past Bonds and added so much more. Unlike some Bonds in the past , Craig's Bond appears physically fit enough to perform the stunts, capture the hearts of the girl and perform any required maneuvers that the job of spying requires. Daniel Craig rebooted this franchise in a manner that those before him playing the role of Bond should appreciate and recognize that his acting talent and physical present is far above any of the past Bonds.

I admit I did have to close my eyes during one or two graphically violent sceness. Daniel Craig has a very strong scene presence in the this film. He's young, and of course very handsome, with a sculptured body that most ladies would love and has beautiful blonde hair and very stunning baby blue eyes.He's starting out learning how to be a British Secret Service agent, and his methods for handling the villains are a little bit too messy. It is an updated version of the Ian Fleming classic book that was written in 1953.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig is no Bond,"The actual movie is alright. The storyline, dialogue, the cast, acting, locations etc is alright. It's just that Daniel Craig is no Bond. He had no charisma, style, flair, he seemed rather dull and stale throughout the movie and showed no signs to make even think this is Bond and I've seen all the Bond movies. There wasn't much chemistry with the women. It really seems like he had no interest in playing Bond but only did it because Bond has become a legendary status in the film world and if somebody remembers you, it will be from a Bond film.The other problem with this film is that it does not feel like a Bond film. There is a pure distinction between Bond films and general action film. Casino Royale is a general action film and if they changed the name ""James Bond"" in this film to say Scott Becker or something, you wouldn't even have the slightest clue or idea that this film can be a Bond film.A lot of people who are praising this movie are saying that this film goes back to the 60s Bond. I disagree, the 60s Bond are likable and lovable.I like Daniel Craig and I do think he's a decent actor however, I have a hard time time seeing him as Bond. Daniel Craig had 2 hours and a half of my time to convince me that he is Bond. That did not happen. He will be in the next 2 Bond movies so he'll have his chance to convince me then.I do like the dark and gritty style of this film but I think I would have liked the movie way more than I do now if they had somebody else play Bond. I have so many other things to say but then this would get too long.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Casino Royale puts on screen the story based on Ian Flemming's first novel in the secret agent series.,"Finally, a film that pays true respect to Mr. Ian Flemming's vision and is based on his first ever novel in the series, Casino Royale. The whole acting ensemble is remarkable and the cinematography is breath-taking. With all respect, I believe this is a far better film than director Martin Cambell's first attempt at bringing back 007. Daniel Craig is the most convincing Bond since Connery and the most lethal since Dalton. Of course I can't forget about the sensational score that assists in making this film the definitive Bond film in my opinion. Casino Royale brings back the gritty, realistic Bond that Ian Flemming originally imagined. This Bond is certainly Fleming's Bond!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Whats all the fuss about?,"Well, I saw this today and I honestly cant imagine why there's been so many people going on about how good this film was. To me, it seemed like the film was all backwards.There were some really good action sequences at the beginning, and I quite enjoyed the Parkour chase scene, but the film slowly seemed to die down from there. Now personally, I'm a massive fan of bond films, I grew up on watching them and my brother and I spent hours pretending to be Bond as kids. So I was really looking forward to all the classic bond elements, beautiful women, fast cars and most importantly, the gadgets! OK, so they often provide a bit of a comic element to bond films, but who didn't at some point want a car with a rocket launcher built into it? On to the film itself then, well, Daniel Craig did fairly well in the movie, but personally I didn't really feel that he came across as the cold ruthless killer he was supposed to be, Pierce Brosnan did a much 'colder' bond in a few sections of the other bond films. Personally I saw him as being just a tad whiny - poor me, I'm an orphan and I have a chip on my shoulder...Plus, I felt that the whole poker sequence went on for way too long, and there was no feeling of intensity during it, neither Daniel Craig or Mads Mikkelsen gave the feeling that this was a life or death kind of game.Two more quick points, the twist at the end of the movie was really obvious to me, and probably will be to any bond fan, and the ending of the movie was a tad dire as well.All in all it felt that there were too many potential sub-plots left unaccounted for, and the movie had no real urgency to it. Don't get me wrong, for what it did it wasn't too bad, it just felt more like a really great scene setter for a movie. If they'd condensed it all into about an hour then explored all of Le Chiffre's out of pocket and no doubt angry war lords with the requisite action sequences then I feel it would have made a better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The new Bond (actor) was great; the movie was pathetic.,"The new actor was great, I was impressed at how he settled into such a well known role. There was a sense of history - this is where Bond came from after all.You felt that he was working his way through situations, making decisions, not simply a smooth, scripted (and inevitably successful) character.The rest of the movie however... The romantic scenes felt like they'd been written by Lucas. The action scenes felt like they were aiming to be out performed by every other Bond film ever. There were no gadgets, some pretty poor attempts at Bond girls, and there was no villain. That's right, there was no villain - you might think there is when you start watching it, but wait till the end, then see how you feel.This is quite possibly, the worst Bond film ever.The first ten minutes, they were awesome. Best chase scene ever. Watch that much (on TV, DVD, youtube - not at the cinema) and turn the movie off. You'll have had your introduction to the new character, without this terrible movie to put you off seeing the next one.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best bond film ever made,"Casino Royale is the best bond film ever made, a thrilling and intense action thriller that's an exciting and much needed reinvention of the franchise whilst also staying true to it's roots with satisfying callbacks.Daniel Craig gives a perfect lead performance as a much darker but still extremely charismatic James Bond and has amazing chemistry with Eva Green, who is incredible. Mads Mikkelsen is a perfect villain and Judi Dench is reliably great as a different kind of M compared to her Brosnan era interpretation.Martin Campbell's direction is fantastic, it's extremely well filmed with some of the best action set pieces in the entire franchise. It's extremely well paced and the music by David Arnold is excellent. The song by Chris Cornell is the best one so far.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

It's amazing what story and good acting will get you,"The beginning of the end for the Bond series was when the schtick began to overtake the story. Though generally entertaining, guys like Roger Moore, Dalton and Brosnan didn't have the swagger or acting talent to save the series from its descent into a parody of itself. Story took a back line to expensive casting. Acting took a back seat to looks. Gadgets and high dollar special effects were left as the only leg the series had to stand on, and in this era of excess, that leg wasn't a very strong one.Daniel Craig is a workmanlike actor. He doesn't look the traditional part of Bond, yet this in itself makes him a shrewd choice to breathe new life into this franchise. He brings back to the Bond character the sobering fact that the man is a killer, and that his legendary confidence didn't come without its dark side. From the start, this movie dives right into a gritty, brutal groove. What tongue-in-cheek is salvaged is delivered with the sort of finesse Connery once brought this role. Real emotions and drama make their way back into the franchise, and the high dollar sports cars, tailored suits and designer martinis gain life in the backdrop, rather than serving the dominating effect of past efforts. The performances all around are commendable. Craig plays Bond without a care to what came before, yet with such confidence there is no doubt he is Bond. A brutal, headstrong, arrogant and yet troubled Bond, a dark Bond, the sort of Bond that might have been forged into the man he eventually becomes. If the Bond franchise is to be saved, this film was exactly the sort of remedy required. Bond has returned as a vital, interesting character rather than a glorified comic book hero. It works so well. While I can't say with assurance this is the best of the franchise, I find myself very hard pressed to name its superior. It certainly makes the Bond movies of the last three decades almost forgettable, and it has me looking forward to the next installment of a series I assumed all but dead many years ago. To all involved, a triumphant job!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Nutshell Review: Casino Royale,"In short, the answer is a resounding yes, and more. Daniel Craig brings to the table a sense of that everyday man, rather than the polished slickness of a seasoned spy with that double- oh license to kill. And understandably so, as Casino Royale is the first Ian Fleming book written about Bond, James Bond.So it's back to the basics, back to the very first time of almost everything. There is no fancy futuristic gadget to assist Bond out of tight situations - he has to rely on his fists and bulging muscles and the ever reliable Walter PPK handgun. Although we have the beautiful Aston Martin as his wheels of choice, there is an incredible amount of running around on foot. M without Moneypenny, no gadgets and no Q (or R), the dry martini created on the fly, that's how basic Craig's Bond is. The trademarked opening, with the cliffhanger styled big stunts, the tracking gun barrel panning across the screen (now replaced with one quick shot set in a toilet!) are inconceivably missing. Even the theme song cum stylized opening credits is done without a gyrating female silhouette, something quite unthinkable for a formulaic Bond film!But it's one heck of a refreshing change and feel to the franchise given the break from convention, after the successful stint by Pierce Brosnan built too much implausibility in the gadget department, and virtual indestructibility together with Q's lab hinging on a product placement overload. What you've read so far about Craig's Bond being a more physical and violent one, yes, you've read them right. He gets tortured, he gets injured, he even makes a lot of mistakes. But don't forget, like Batman Begins, this story tells of the time of how Bond became the renowned spy we all know, set just after he got promoted to double-oh status and earned his license to kill. He's wet behind the ears, a rookie in the business, and has a huge lesson to learn on trust and letting his guard down.Which is where the Bond girls come in. While decorative, Casino Royale boasts Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), as THE femme fatale from the British Treasury sent to be Bond's bankroll as he tries to bring down chief villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) on the high stakes poker table of Casino Royale. You'll probably chuckle at the first time seeing Bond flirt with a trademarked decorative Bond chick, and it has this really awkward feel to it all. But with Vesper, you'll see how he bares his heart and soul for her, without trading too many sexual innuendos or impatiently trying to get inside her. It's probably something like first love, and after this episode, you'll probably begin to understand how his love-them-leave-them attitude towards beautiful woman developed. It's a cruel twist of fate in the love department that leaves you with some questions to ponder.What about the story? It's nothing to shout about. Basically it's Bond up against Le Chiffre on the poker table, one which proves to be quite interesting to watch, but got dragged by too many meandering interruptions. The relationship and love scenes between Bond and Vesper feels extended in the longest Bond film to date (clocking in at 2 hours and 24 minutes), and does get mushy at times. But this I feel is the focus of Casino Royale, the microscope put onto Bond to see how he learns and develops his skills and persona. Though the main villain Le Chiffre looks sinister enough, there is a severe lack of world-dominating ambition, and doesn't reach the highs of Bond villains of the past. The lack of memorable villainous sidekicks too relegates the baddies to cardboard characters.In short, Casino Royale builds its strength in providing a good way to bring about a change of actors into the Bond role by adapting Fleming's beginning, but really, while I think Craig will have a field day with this stint as Bond, I'll pity the next actor who has to take over him, without the safety net of going back to basics.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
a little bit boring as it has been so much talked about it,"I didn't like so much... because i think is a little bit boring and not so willing to see the end of the movie. The others Agent 007,with Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan were much interesting to see.. If i have to see it again..at TV for example i do not do it... Sorry,but this is my opinion. Thank u for letting me tell my own idea about a movie.. bye.. see ya next time, at another James Bond's series.. And to end my idea...I am seeing the end of the movie right now and I think is not the best end of a movie I have ever seen. And another idea,here is my boyfriend too...the principal actor is a good looking one,but it's a little to full of muscles,but not so good in his way of acting...For example,Pierce Brosnan acted naturally,Daniel Craig is more superficial.

"The ""Casino Royale"" Movie","For all you 007 fans out there, I just want to say without giving anything away about this movie, ""Casino Royale""... The movie truly provides action that keeps your attention, but I personally missed the James Bond flavor like the past, which he was introduced with a host of special gadgets, firepower galore and fully armored exotic sports cars.Casino Royale has a brand new actor name Daniel Craig, who showed some potential for the character of James Bond who does ""style and profile"" in the Aston Martin exotic car, but I have to admit, it's going to be a tall order to top the noble Sean Connery who stands on top of the list as the best bond ever hands down! Then comes Pierce Brosnan who also played James Bond to the tee!Fans, all I can say is that you will be entertained with the action and drama of this new bond character who shows both mental and physical toughness, but having only two or three little gadgets just looses the special ingredients that gives the typical James Bond the trademark of being the ultimate secret agent we all been use too... Nevetherless, I still enjoyed the movie somewhat :-)!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good spy film but what about Bond?!!!,"We've all been eagerly awaiting the arrival of Casino Royale, the first James Bond movie after a four year gap since Die Another Day, especially without Pierce Brosnan and the excitement of a new 007.The creators behind the film have tried so hard to make this Bond film different they have effectively removed what we all loved about Bond in the first place; the way he says ""Shaken not stirred"", the car chases, the theme tune and the girls (there simply aren't enough).Firstly, the plot is a mess; it is over complicated and unclear; names are not properly presented so by the end of the film I found myself unsure as to who Vesper really was (luckily the credits cleared that up). The villain is not properly developed and the beloved theme tune is not used until the end credits? Furthermore, where is our beloved Q and his gadgets? Where is Moneypenny? Nowhere to be seen is the answer.However, some credit must go to Daniel Craig who does give a far better performance as Bond than Pierce Brosnan could ever have hoped to. He is more sinister, more mysterious and arrogant; quite frankly better and more entertaining. There are gripping action sequences as well as some impressive stunts but I could not help feeling that I had been short-changed: yes it's a good spy film but it's not the Bond we have all grown to love.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Daniel Craig: Blond, Brutish, Short, and the Best Bond in Years!","I saw the new, gritty, pulse-pounding CASINO ROYALE (CR) on opening weekend, and *IT ROCKS!!!* I sat grinning smugly from ear to ear, my faith in Daniel Craig as the new James Bond proving well-founded as the pumped audience cheered and carried on! After seeing him in LAYER CAKE and MUNICH, I knew Craig would make an awesome 007, despite all those tiny minds out there ready to reject him as being too blond, brutish, and short. :-) CR totally reboots the Bond series. Right from its spectacular, stylish black-and-white opening sequence in which Bond earns his ""license to kill"" status and then some, this movie kick-starts James Bond as an ass-kicker with shades of vulnerability and reserves of ruthlessness that do both Ian Fleming and Sean Connery proud! Even my mom, who swore she'd never love another Bond after her fave Pierce Brosnan, gushed about Craig after seeing CR, and there's much to gush about. For one thing, Craig's got the rugged good looks of a Cro-Magnon Steve McQueen, with bristly blond hair and laser-sharp blue eyes that could drill right through you, plus a buff physique that's shown off delightfully when he emerges from the surf in the Bahamas. It's the male version of Ursula Andress' introductory scene in DR. NO -- yes-s-s! :-) Heck, Craig's naked body is so amazing to behold, even villain Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen, who'd be an intimidating presence even without Le Chiffre's unnerving tears of blood, the result of an old eye injury) makes approving remarks about Bond's build as he tortures him in a scene that's faithful to Fleming's original novel while improving on it at the same time. However, I didn't appreciate the decision to change the film's high-stakes baccarat game to Texas Hold 'Em poker. Maybe they thought more moviegoers would identify with a poker game, but it seems to me that the sophistication of baccarat is more appropriate for a Bond movie. Despite that quibble, in addition to balancing intensity and dry wit that deftly kids the time-honored Bond movie traditions/clichés (as opposed to the overdone, forced jokiness that's plagued the series off and on since the Roger Moore years), Craig has a humanity that I feared had been formula'd out of 007. Take Bond's ever-evolving relationship with British Treasury Agent Vesper Lynd, as played by THE DREAMERS' Eva Green. While Green doesn't quite possess the screen presence or charisma of such classic Bond leading ladies as Andress, Honor Blackman, or Jane Seymour, she and Craig still strike enough sparks to be a good match physically and emotionally, each of them hardened loners who slowly grow to love each other (the result of Oscar-winner Paul Haggis contributing to the script, perhaps?), plus I like the wry twinkle in Green's aquamarine eyes. Most of the cast is terrific, including Dame Judi Dench returning as no-nonsense spymaster M (the flinty relationship between Dench's M and Craig's Bond feels more like a battle of wills here -- wholly appropriate, since this is essentially Bond's first case as a Double-0 agent), and Giancarlo Giannini as the shifty Mathis. Jeffrey Wright, another fave in our household, has a nice moment or two as Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA contact, but overall he gets surprisingly little to do. Oh, well, maybe Wright had scenes left on the cutting room floor, or maybe he'll have more to do in subsequent Bond films. The action scenes owe more to films like RESERVOIR DOGS than previous Bond films (which should make original CASINO ROYALE fan Quentin Tarantino happy :-), and I'm not just saying that because two of these scenes take place in bathrooms! :-) There's a down-and-dirty, kinetic fleetness to CR's action scenes (with some cool and unexpected locations, including the macabre Body Worlds exhibit and the Miami Airport. Between CR and the 2002 comedy BIG TROUBLE, the Miami Airport is certainly an embattled place, at least on film! :-), especially a wild foot chase between Craig and Sebastien Foucan that takes them through a construction site and into Foucan's embassy -- and with this new, no-holds-barred Bond, if this creep thought he'd be safe in his embassy, he was kidding himself! Forget Shaft -- the new Daniel Craig version of James Bond is a bad mutherf***er! :-) Long may he reign!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
After the hype...,"Now that everyone's calmed down a bit perhaps we can find some perspective on this film. Casino Royale is not a particularly good Bond film that will not play well on television and in years to come will be regarded as one of the most pedestrian of the series. First, the good points. Daniel Craig. He can clearly act, looks muscular, has a nice line in economical humour and is to the point, often ruthlessly so. Some of the dialogue is snappy and crisp, particularly the male/female exchanges - you could almost smell the Haggis. But that's only SOME of the dialogue - a lot of it, and there is a lot of it, is dry. (Great last line, though.) The trouble with the movie is that it is deliberately joyless. Much of what made the Bond universe such fun - the over the top villains, the ludicrous gadgets, the massive set pieces - have been jettisoned. With the exception of the initial chase and the Miami Airport scene, there's little memorable action going on. A film that has as its central scene a game of cards, for that's what it is, has a problem. The game just isn't cinematic, and no matter how simplified the rules are for us, it's not 100% clear what's going on. Cards with a banker. What thrills. Very long, often slow, rarely electrifying, Casino Royale will sell a lot of tickets and give Richard Branson a little giggle, but won't go down as a great Bond film, or even a great film.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
boring,"I must be getting too old for James Bond. (60) I was certainly not impressed with the film. I found the action veeeery boring, and I was very much disappointed with the new Bond. I could'nt understand a word he was saying! He just mumbled with that pouty little mouth of his! I'm danish - but I'm used to watching films in their original language without text. Dame Judy gave me no problems whatsoever. It makes me proud though, that the danish actor Mads Mikkelsen did a very good job and was the only memorable character in the movie! And where was the hum? A good James Bond movie must have hum. Action films you can get anywhere - but a James Bond film is supposed to be something special.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Now THAT'S James Bond!,"Casino Royale is like a minty-fresh mouthwash, eradicating the vile taste of that CG puke-fest known as Die Another Day. I literally felt CLEANSED after seeing it. I'd gotten so used to the same old same old that I had ceased to think something like this could happen. Mike and Barb - with an assist from Purvis/Wade, Haggis, Campbell and DC - have given Jimbo a long-overdue spring cleaning - made him more real, more relevant, and ultimately more INTERESTING.I really liked Brosnan's Bond  at the time. I think it was the hair. With GoldenEye, the Bond 'do' definitely reached its peak. Pierce was good in the part, too - convincing as a heavily Rodge-influenced (but slightly darker, more athletic) 007, spouting unfunny Bruce Fierstein-penned quips about frequent-flier mileage. Certainly, he seemed equally adept at coming to grips with a Kalashnikov, a Smirnoff or a Scorupco, but it is now clear (given fresh perspective) that by the end of his tenure both Pierce and the EON crew had LOST their grip on the character of JAMES BOND, as conceived by Ian Fleming.DC has OPENED MY EYES. Sure, he has taken the Bond 'do' to a disappointing low (the flaxen hue doesn't bother me so much  it's just a bit scruffy), but the character has been roused from his torpor, woken from his coma, resurrected from the dead - a bit like his literal 'resurrection' in a scene from this movie. Given the new toned-down realism, the handy in-car defibrillator seems a tad convenient (and therefore unrealistic), but at least he's able to FIND HIS CAR this time. Imagine if a drugged, cardiac-arresting Brosnan-Bond had staggered out of Gustav Graves' ice palace, looking for the one thing that could save his life...'Now, where the bloody hell did I PARK that thing? DAMN YOU, Q-BRANCH! LIGHT-EMITTING POLYMER MY TWITCHING, BLOODSHOT EYE!'DC's Jimbo has a real 'no bulls--t' vibe to him, which is one of the major differences between him and Pierce. He isn't worried about rumpling his absurdly well-tailored clothes. If you prick him (or punch, shoot or stab him) he bleeds, and wears the marks for longer than one scene. His knuckles are scabby. His face is scratched. If Pierce's Bond was a prize poodle, DC's is a fighting pit bull in comparison.But it's not only DC's acting skill and grasp of the character that make this movie great. It helps that they've got Fleming back as a foundation - which, considering how unlike any of the recent movies this is, only goes to show how far from Fleming's creation the films had strayed.I do not lament the loss of Dr. Evil-style lairs or idiotic gadgets or one-note henchmen or stupid Bond-girl names......or TERRIBLE clunking puns! Don't get me wrong, I LOVE a good pun. A well-considered and subtle play on words really gets me going. But after forty years' worth of increasingly insipid wordplay, it's refreshing that the writers this time resisted the urge to try and squeeze the unlikeliest of lines from the least conducive of situations. Sure, it's disorienting at first, so accustomed are we to the dodgy one-liner as a fundamental law of the Bondiverse. Upon my first viewing I sensed awkward gaps after murders and close calls, the only sounds being the chirping of crickets and the expectant intake of breath from an audience bracing itself for something lame. But it never came. Wonderful.Eva Green is a fantastic actor, and the script actually allows her to give a performance worthy of her talent. Let's face it, even the more accomplished Bond-girl actresses have come off looking a little superficial in the past (eg. Dame Diana, Carole Bouquet, Halle B). But Vesper is given a depth almost equal to that of Bond - and their relationship is more compelling for it. And it doesn't hurt that Eva is one of the most aesthetically-pleasing life forms ever to exist in this or any parallel universe.Mads brings depth and humanity to the blood-weeping, asthmatic Le Chiffre. Yes, Bond Villains can be realistic AND have cheesy gimmicks.Jeffrey Wright is excellent - but criminally underused - as Felix. I hope he's here to stay awhile (which would be another trend-breaker).Caterina Murino: Yum.Judi Dench: Scary - but it's her best M performance yet.David Arnold's score is far less ostentatious than his previous efforts. His restraint with the Theme is very clever and far more sensible than I thought he could be.You Know My Name: best theme song since Live 'n' Let Die.Chris Cornell: cooler than Wings.The action scenes are all superb - you can almost smell the blood and sweat. Sebastien Foucan is a superhuman freak.The title sequence is fantastic. I'm gonna go out on a limb and say it's the best yet, despite the absence of naked female silhouettes. But who needs naked female silhouettes when you've got Eva wearing......THAT DRESS. I damn-near wept blood MYSELF when I saw her in that thing!Discipline, 007...What more can I say? I LOVE this flick. Is it my favourite? It's too soon to tell - but it makes Pierce's movies look like Rodge's movies, and Rodge's movies look like - like - Peter Sellers' Casino Royale!Bond has begun, and I can't wait to see where he goes next.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Fantastic Bond for the 21st Century,"I loved this movie and have seen in twice already! I'm happy I can watch Bond again. I loved Sean Connery so much that all Bonds since have paled in comparison and I stopped seeing the movies when Roger Moore was Bond. Just too stupid to sit through. But Daniel Craig IS Bond not only because he's the Bond that Flemming wrote, but because he brings this gritty, physical toughness that's so sexy and compelling. I loved the fighting, his blood-drenched shirts, his sweating and constant movement. The franchise had gotten tired and needed an infusion of new blood and I commend the film makers on all of their choices. The titles are beautiful, the music contemporary, the women smart. M was more human and not just an initial with one scene. The dated gadgets of Q were gone and the scene where Bond gets poisoned and almost dies when the defibrillator disconnects was one of the most exciting I've ever seen. The writers had an awesome task and they did a great job. They had to keep millions of fans happy, introduce a new Bond who wasn't well-received in the beginning and pull all future Bond films into the 21st century. I think they achieved what they set out to do. There are people who have complained about the film being dark and not fun. I disagree. I think the fun comes from the edginess and depth (relative depth, it was still an action flick after all!) and from the fun it makes of itself. The new Bond, when asked if he wants his martini shaken or stirred, says ""Do I look like I give a damn?""

While some of her banter with Craig falls flat, the character development the writers give her makes her the most complex and fascinating female character since Rigg's Tracy Di Vicenzo, and Green is a good enough actress to pull it off.Also, Chris Cornell's Bond Theme Song, ""You Know my Name"" is the best one since Paul McCartney's ""Live and Let Die.""The Bad: As dark and serious and true to Ian Fleming's original incarnation everyone tries to keep the film, Martin Campell (of ""Goldeneye"" and ""Mask of Zorro"" fame) is still just a run-of-the-mill action-adventure director, which means he can pull off some fun stunts that look great, but he has no sense of style to carry off some of the more intense moments. He seems to exist only to dangle stunt-men from various objects in midair, which makes the opening chase scene at a Madagascar construction site the most entertaining bit.The Ugly: I appreciate everyone's desire to strip Bond back down to the basics, but he needs a villain to play off, and the asthmatic poker playing terrorist power broker who cries blood (dumb!) just didn't cut it. Give the audience something to chew on. Nobody complained about them keeping the one-liners, the hot girls, or the hot cars...so let's get a villain worth routing against next time.The product placement (especially when he drives a Ford in Montenegro before getting his Astin-Martin) is so in-your-face it becomes distracting--so was the ridiculous Richard Branson cameo in the airport. This is just bad movie making no matter how you cut it.Finally, this felt like the longest movie I have sat through since ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"" and I think this was at least forty-five minutes shorter. That's not a good thing for a franchise action movie, no matter how much reinvention was going on.Bottom Line: Wiping away most of the silliness of the last two Brosnan flicks, a leaner, meaner Bond has been delivered that still has many flaws. Comparing this to similar and more recent franchises, this is far superior to the ""Mission:Impossible"" episodes, but not nearly as deliciously convoluted, clever, or emotionally involving as the Jason Bourne flicks.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond for Bond sakes ( may contain spoilers),Fine the movie was gritty and darker BUT that is not what Bond is. No Q no Moneypenny no one liners no gadgets no MR. Bond you are going to die and I will now tell you my whole plan... NO big scale mass good guy VS bad guy army ending...The whole point of the Bond's is the slight camp. I mean not to include Q and his little factory well that is blasphemy. The car which is in some cases the silent partner who dies in a glorious save the hero type way. Not this time it was killed simple by swerving ( sad )If I want gritty and dark I will go see other spy movies when I want a Bond film I want to see the gadgets the girls the chases and the getaways.This was just an action movie with a guy named Bond OH YEAH and the whole martini thing WTF it is and will ALWAYS be SHAKEN NOT STIRRED,,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bueno, Muy Bueno","Greetings again from the darkness. I have never really understood my fascination with Bond as I prefer to think of myself as too intelligent for this type of movie. Maybe it was the great clothes, beautiful women, playing with guns, wonderful toys, fast cars and world travels? Well despite all of the hoopla surrounding this latest Bond production, feel relieved knowing that the 007 franchise is not only safe, but dare I say, better than ever.Daniel Craig (although a bit long in the tooth) plays the just promoted to ""00"", James Bond, and is flat out terrific! The acting ability he has shown in ""Road to Perdition"" and ""Layer Cake"" really take the story and script to another level. Sure he can strut and pose and gaze with the best of them (Pierce Brosnan), but Mr. Craig can really ACT, which this somewhat complex script actually demands.The action in the first 20 minutes is heart-pounding and incredibly fast and dangerous. Luckily the pace slows down a bit as the plot develops. Yes, there is a plot and this time it is not world domination. That is good news and bad news. One of the two disappointments in this fine film is the bad guy played by Mads Mikkelsen. He is a fine poker player and pretty evil in his torturing (all males will squirm), but he just lacks the real charisma of the best Bond bad guys over the years. The other disappointment is the underuse of the greatest film theme song ever (yes, better than Star Wars) and the extremely weak Chris Cornell opening credit song.Of course, there are beautiful women. Eva Green as Vespa Lynd is not your typical Bond girl. She is smart and smart-assed and goes toe-to-toe in a couple of ways with Bond. What a nice change of pace to see a woman's role written in a full scale, complex manner. It makes it much more interesting and entertaining.Did I mention fast cars? The brand new Aston Martin is almost as cool as the 1964 model we get a couple of shots of. Since there is no Q, the wonderful toys are not in full swing yet, but the incredible settings in Prague, The Bahamas and Italy more than make up for it. The scenery and architecture are awe inspiring.There may be no Q, but there is definitely an M. Judi Dench reprises her role, this time showing her frustrated side with her newest agent. She recognizes Bond's rare abilities, but worries about his mental state. By the end, she knows he is ready for more.The supporting cast includes the underrated Jeffrey Wright, the always great Giancarlo Giannini and super model Ivana Milicevic in a strange role. The cast is fine and second time Bond director Martin Campbell (""GoldenEye"") really lets the action and story and setting do most of the talking. His action scenes are not filled with close ups or rapid fire editing ... we actually get to see the fights and chases. He does a nice job of keeping the viewer in the story. I couldn't help but chuckle as Craig steps out of the waves and onto the beach - almost identical to the classic Ursula Andress scene in ""Dr. No"". Being a huge Sean Connery fan, I find this difficult to say, but here goes ... this is the best Bond movie to date. Wow!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Bond films I've ever seen,"For those of you saying terrible things about the film, about how it destroyed the Bond franchise blah blah blah. The chance are most of you probably DIDN'T see the film. This film is easily one of the best Bond films I've ever seen.I had been skeptical about Daniel Craigs, mainly because he didn't have the Bond look, but after watching the film, I'm sold. The acting is great, the one-liners are great, the action is great, and the Bond girls are great. My blood was racing the whole way through the movie.The only negative part of the film is probably the intro. I much prefer the old intro, the card suits just didn't cut it for me.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Daniel Craig elevates the series to a whole new level, a level which is above spectacular","2006 has easily been the year of the action movie, with standouts such as Pirates of the Caribbean 2, Mission: Impossible III, X-Men: The Last Stand, Waist Deep, Running Scared, Crank, and Snakes on a Plane. Now, add Casino Royale to the list. Add it to the top of the list as the best action film of the year. Casino Royale is easily the best Bond film of the last few decades, and possibly the best of all 21 of them. Daniel Craig stands out in so many different ways that make him the best actor to portray the legendary character. In a word, Casino Royale is phenomenal.'Royale' starts with an unbelievably cool introduction to Daniel Craig as James Bond, followed by a spectacular chase scene through the African outback, a construction site, and a national embassy. This is just the prelude to a movie following the spy as he investigates the dealings between terrorists and a banker (Mads Mikkelsen), while constantly upsetting his supervisor, M (Judi Dench), and forming an unorthodox yet beautiful relationship with a strikingly attractive woman, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green).The best part about the film, obviously, is Daniel Craig's performance as James Bond. It is a treat and a half to study this actor as he transforms the character into something we haven't seen says the Connery days. Craig makes Bond a human being, comparable to how Christian Bale did the same for Batman last year. 'Royale' explores how all the constant killing and disregard for morality affects Bond as a person. Bond is finally shown in a true light, as flawed and rebellious, while keeping him the witty, intelligent, and ultra cool superspy he is. Craig's nonverbal acting is phenomenal. Some of the best moments of the film are when Craig and Mads Mikkelsen are staring straight at each other, attempting to read the other as they play the biggest poker game of their lives. Daniel Craig's performance is simply stunning, realistic, and captivating. Mads Mikkelsen as the villain of the film, Le Chiffre, is very well casted. Mikkelsen makes a fine villain indeed, despite the fact that it can be difficult to understand him at times. Eva Green's Vesper Lind is a great character. You'll grow on her more than you will on any other Bond girl. Her chemistry with Daniel Craig helps create a heart wrenching connection between the characters. Judi Dench as M is, well, you know. Once again, Dench is just cool as hell, whether it be when she's telling Bond off, counseling him, or commanding him. Also in the film is veteran actor Jeffrey Wright as the recurring Bond character Felix Leiter, and Wright is great despite not having a lot of screen time. He is really a great actor to watch, and his performance in this film is a great example of that.The action of Casino Royale is simply fantastic. While the traditional Bond gadgets are toned down (it was getting to be a bit much), the incredible realism of the scenes more than makes up for this. The opening scene of the film is extraordinarily shot and performed. Director Martin Campbell does his job to near perfection, providing us with delicious action, beautiful shots and sets, and gets extraordinary acting performances out of Daniel Craig, Mads Mikkelsen, and Eva Green. All in all, Casino Royale is the top action film of 2006, one of the best Bond films, and one of the most entertaining films around. Though long at 144 minutes, the film rises above that with an involving and intricate story. I recommend Casino Royale to anyone above age 12, due to the sexual content and complexity of the film.10/10 --spy",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Cool but missing a good director,"When I saw the rate of the movie on this site and rotten tomatoes , I saw that the movie was beloved by the users and the critics also .. SO, I decided to see the movie and I was deeply disappointed .. I saw a movie with old fashioned director and story .. I Think the story was too weak I could say .. the film started with too many actions then the rate went down so quick .. after too many actions , all the movie was just a bloody poker game nothing else .. and the director was moron .. he played so well with the prestige of the evil man with the scar face and lost it well in the half of the film when he made him a fool man who easily can be cheated .. and the way he died was so funny .. a lonely man was able to kill his men and break into easily and kill him !!!!! ..

"Above average action flick, but strangely paced.","The 1st half of this film is a big 10 for me. It was nonstop action and not just any action, but very well choreographed action that leaves you in awe. Without giving away spoilers, let's just say the stuns were well performed, all natural no CGI crap and it was just amazing.However, after that they hit the main block of the film, which is in the title, the gambling part. The whole film took a huge slow down as they hit the brake and tried to go into story, drama, romance, etc... I mean, I know they're somewhat following a book, but the shift was so dramatic, it felt awkward like a completely different movie.Being it is 2 hrs and 24 mins, I think this can benefit from some editing. The whole casino scene can be dramatically cut down honestly, it was so boring. As an Asian, I've seen plenty of gambling movies that were done much better such as God of Gambler, Poker King, etc...I would actually give the 2nd half a 5. So the combination of the whole film, a 7 is quite accurate.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""I'm The Money!""","You certainly are 'Casino Royale'!!A perfect reboot, the film takes the inadequacies of the original Bond series (fun though it was) and brings 007 into the Twenty-First Century!Yes, for Fleming die-hards, it would have been great to see a vintage Bond adventure with old 1950s cars, styles, mannerisms and locations, but the production costs would have soared and the producers would still have been left with the question of how to repair the franchise after the frivolous excesses of 'Die Another Day' (2002).This way, rebooting the franchise allowed the film-makers some artistic licence over Fleming's original (and probably most celebrated) Bond novel. Events taken from the novel are ramped up a bit to appeal to modern audiences (i.e. changing Soviet agents into terrorist cells, switching from chemin de fer to Texas Hold 'Em Poker, the climax in Venice) and others are added in afresh, but the essence of the novel is there.Even though this was sold as a more realistic Bond film, 007 still drives a sporty new Aston Martin DBS; travels to exotic locations such as Nassau, Miami and Montenegro; dresses suavely, and is a killer with most of the ladies.One lady in particular, Dame Judi Dench, is the only obvious reminder of the previous twenty Bond films (or at least Pierce Brosnan's entries), but even she is altered from her previous form, making her more aggressive and giving her a personal life this time around. A new 'M' (in a way) for a new James Bond. She even starts to sympathise with the new and rebellious 007 towards the end of the film...But, 007 is also more human here, despite being Fleming's cold government-sanctioned killer who dislikes his job, but is good at it.Without a doubt, beautiful French actress, Eva Green is the belle of the ball. Just as the other elements of the novel have been updated, so has the bewitching Vesper Lynd. Whereas previous Bond Girls have claimed to be 'the female 007', Vesper is James Bond's intellectual equal, as accustomed to reading people as he is. Rather than being an MI6 operative, she is a Treasury official and highly sceptical of Bond's uncontrollable ways, pinning down his weaknesses in seconds. However, there is a deeply touching story here, magnified beyond Fleming's concept of Vesper by Green's perceptive and honest performance, by which she lights up the screen whenever she appears on it.The villain, Le Chiffre has previously been portrayed by the great actors Peter Lorre and Orson Welles. However, for his performance as the disfigured, cold, ruthless and sometimes even a little humorous banker to the world's terrorists, Dutch actor, Mads Mikkelsen has become internationally renowned. He is supported (if that is possibly the word), by fellow Dutchman, Jesper Christensen, who plays an important role that hints back to the days of the shadowy SPECTRE organisation.The locations, pacing, action, dialogue - all are great, not least because this is the second Bond outing of Martin 'GoldenEye' Campbell, who once again invigorates audiences by introducing the latest incarnation of James Bond. But, this time, it is a James Bond who is earning his stripes and is walking a perilous tightrope between falling victim to his dangerous adversaries and being eaten alive by a Select Committee of MPs investigating the actions of MI6. And only by winning the trust of Dench's 'M' can he prove that he deserves to be on her team.'Casino Royale' also gradually reintroduces the elements that have always made Bond great from the beginning - from the action, the cars, the girls, the playboy lifestyle to the attitude, the shaken not stirred Vodka Martinis, the tuxedo and, of course, the James Bond Theme. This film strips it all back and then subtly reintroduces it all to show us what James Bond is really made of.Another modern classic that effectively merges the cinematic James Bond with his literary counterpart!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The new Bond falls short of filling the shoes of Connery or Brosnan,"It had been a long wait for a Bond movie after Die Another Day four years ago. After Pierce Brosnan had done his job deftly and established himself possibly as the best Bond after Sean Connery, newcomer Daniel Craig had very big shoes to fill. Four years had raised the expectations and the fact that this movie is the last of the Fleming originals to be screened made the wait even more difficult. Well, who knew that this would be a forgettable flick for the Bond Fans!Casino Royale, incidentally the first Bond story is being rehashed after there were 20 predecessors. Here, bond is introduced as a new promotee to '00' status. Tracking terrorists leads him to many operators and then to their banker Le Chiffre who bet in the stock market just went bad is planning to raise $150Mn in a poker game. MI6 assigns 007 to play the game with a view that if Le Chiffre lost, his clients would hunt him down. He is joined in his mission by the pretty government agent Vesper Lynd.To begin with Casino Royale had a bad script. No, I aren't pointing fingers at Fleming who gave to the world the larger than life bond, but the scriptwriters who modified it to suit the present world, i.e., post cold-war and post 9/11 terrorist attacks, the writers have definitely forgotten to keep the story in track. Firstly, a story of a card game makes the story devoid of gadgets & guns. Secondly, too much of romance is injurious to the image of the Bond we all know. Third, a mix-up of these two leaves the story nowhere. Music sucks too! The signature Bond tune of Monty Norman was grossly missing too!Coming to the New Bond, the rugged & blonde Bond, I felt he was a let down from all the earlier Bonds who were stylish and smooth operators with both gadgets & women. True, Craig has a better chiseled body than his older counterparts, but did the producers miss out that brawn over brain doesn't make a Bond. I guess there are numerous other men in Hollywood with a similar body and better looks. Why only Daniel Craig; Plain luck?Well this movie has a rating of 8.2 on IMDb, highest rating for a Bond flick, the closest being 7.8 for Connery's Goldfinger. Well, if it's working this well at the BO, I'm sure there must be many who must have liked Bond's ruggedness, his skills without the assistance of gadgets or just his body or the romance element! I don't know what to say. The discerning audience needs to rethink before they dish out their cash to see this flick!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Nightmare for James Bond,"Stop it!!!! I've watched all 20 James Bond Movies. For each one, I have watched more than 20 times. Even there are actors like George Lazenby, it still fits the Bond formula. But this one, Hell, No. No matter what kind storyline we have, we gotta look into the actor who plays Bond. Daniel Craig??? No way! I'd rather have Hugh Jackman, Clive Owan, OR Jason Connery, son of Sean, who also played Ian Flemming in SPYMAKER(1990) and Casablanca Express (1989), Bullet to Beijing (1997). Even Tom Cruise can do better than this Mr. Craig. Now, the storyline. When we talk about James Bond, we do not want a realistic tough guy. We want a legendary suave spy. Girls, Violence, Gadgetry. It gotta follow the certain formula even though we know its not for real. Pre-Title sequence, then the opening, debriefing, Q-Branch, lovely babes, easily turn the girl who works for Bad guy working for Bond. Then the girl is killed. Afterwards, Bond get the job done with style. Thats James Bond Movie. This Casino Royale is just a 2nd Rate action movie, like Dolph's upcoming movie DIAMOND DOG.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This Movie Sucked on ICE!!! here is why.  A few semi spoilers,"1. James bond films and all good action usually require a good chase sequence. I'm sorry but the old hanging off the top of a truck thing has been done since the keystone cops days and Much Much better, Indiana Jones, Mad Max, Abbot & Costello, Beverly Hills Cop, etc. That chase scene sucked. As did the 23 second car chase that ended when James tried to avoid his girlfriend.2. The opening chase was okay but there was nothing emotionally driving it you know? It just sort of happened, see the movie B-13(?) maybe 14 can't remember but that was fluid and joyful but still a chase scene. This was just I don't know okay.2. D. Craig was great and has the potential to be a great bond. But this film sucked, The direction was awful. I don't know about you but I didn't have to know how to play bacarrat in the early S Connery films but still there was tension created. The Texas Hold Em scenes were ridiculous, with the Giannini commentary "" That's his tell...."" "" that means the stakes are 12 million..."" whatever totally dumb. Boring No tension.3. Bond films always have a great moment where they exact revenge... Le Cheffre was killed by others after repeatedly banging the guy in his nuts we the audience really needed to see the revenge. The final revenge of a character hardly introduced just doesn't cut it.4. The opening black and white scene was drawn out and frankly boring. If you want to see Brutal cold hard killing please see Dr. No, when Connery kills the guy in cold blood in the same way but it has an added Hickock like tension. (This director sucks)5. Terrible opening sequence, Bad crappy song. Chris Cornell has lost all hard, cool credibility with this one lame, forgettable theme. The graphics blew... uninteresting.6. I know, I know, it's the origin of the character but to not have the theme till the final moment is unforgivable. The theme is bond. It needs to be there not some generic music during action sequences. Come on. it's like doing a remake of the Wizard of Oz without ""Were off to see the Wizard, or Somewhere over the R....""6. Bond placed a tracking device in Le Chefre's Inhaler and it was left on the table but he was able to track Le Chefre during his girlfriend almost getting her arm cut off. Do the producers think we are stupid.7. The girlfriend relationship was pretty cool but almost undercooked, I swear to god there was more emotional depth and loss between Lazenby and Diana Rigg in On Her Majesty's Sercret Service.8. Maybe my biggest complaint. Bond not reacting to near death experiences. What mad Connery and some of the others so good was the sense of real danger. There were so many scenes of Craig not even flinching when a guy was shooting like 200 rounds at him while he was hiding behind a pillar. No reaction from Craig, No reaction from me. Come on. I know, I know he's cold blooded but give me a break. It separates us from the experience.I swear I can go on and on. Please don't think I'm being too hard but I really had high hopes with all the hype that this was back to the old brutal but suave bond.... it just is more of the same with a new much more bond like character. If this is the first one out of the box, the other ones are going to be gadgets and crappy quips galore.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
best Bond movie in decades,"If you knew my wife, you would understand why this is the most telling review of this film: When we walked out of the theater, she turned to me and said, ""I want to own this one!"" What you probably don't know is that I'd spent the preceding 2 or 3 weeks trying to explain to her that not all Bond movies are a string of crappy sexist jokes and goofy gadgets. I'm glad this film supported my point, because if it had featured an invisible car, a one-liner about James being a ""cunning linguist"", or a character named Pussy, she might never have believed my point that there is really nothing fundamentally flawed about the franchise.Anyhow, long story short: This is the first Bond movie in about 20 years where I've left the theater wanting to see it again.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Way Bond is Supposed to be...,"Finally, Bond gets back to basics; that is, he is finally masculine and cold-hearted while at the same time exuding charm and confidence. This formula has been missing from the Bond franchise for awhile now. I went and saw this movie with my mom and sister who usually don't care much for action movies, but they both liked this one due to the masculinity of Bond 's character coupled with his new Daniel Craig look. I really enjoyed seeing Bond as someone who turns it on/off, much like we all do between work and home. He admits to the conflict but like the rest of us who work, feels best when he is killing and doing his job. This movie reminds me of Chris Nolan's ""batman Begins"" because both show real men who are trying to overcome their own failings and weaknesses and in so doing show their resolve and determination to do what they are supposed to do. Batman Begins got Batman to where he is supposed to be, much like Bond returns to his rightful place as a man whom men admire and women adore. I liked it and really felt that Daniel Craig did an outstanding job as Bond. Yet, I must admit of two gripes I have with the movie: 1) too long as far as Bond's rehab and subsequent love w/ Vesper. 2) Not enough Bond dialogue. But overall, I was pleased and look forward to the next one. One last point, it is refreshing to see action movies and male stars acting masculine again. We have shifted so far to the left in all we do that past action movies w/ lead male roles tended to seem soft and feeling oriented. I see male emotion and political correct behavior everyday, I do not want to see that kind of nonsense in an action movie.

"""A Bloody Royal Treat From Martin Campbell""","CASINO ROYALE blows out all the action, adventure, thriller films before it with a marvelously entertaining and rollicking film that knocks your sox off and keeps you glued to your chair with wonderment in how one man, JAMES BOND, can keep up with all the action and hard work and intrigue. However, in Daniel Craig, this JAMES BOND is the best ever with a ""tongue in cheek"" manner about him in a body that a West Hollywood man would die for. Can hardly wait until the next Daniel Craig BOND film.Tremendous locations-although the opening scene in Prague in a skyscraper is one in which I don't recall architecture, nor buildings like that one in that city-but the other sets in Nassau and Venice and along the Italian/Swiss lakes area, were breathtaking and really lent to the story and characters. Judy Dench as M is once again such a great actor and her lines were superb. The whole cast is tremendous.CASINO ROYALE is written and developed in a very clever way by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade and certain scenes stay in your mind forever.

A mixed feeling,"Being a Bond fan and reading the positive critics I got anxious to see the movie.But afterward I got a bit of a mixed feeling on this latest Bond film. On the one hand I thought it was a very good movie which really lets you see how Bond develops in the Bond we all know. On the other hand we see a Bond, who is portrayed by Craig in a convincingly matter, but who looks more like a construction worker than a classy agent. That was my first little problem. My second problem was that the movie was too long. The last part is interesting for the real James Bond fans to see how Bond develops but gets the pace out of the Movie. So from a series perspective its a smart step but from a movie perspective it does not make the movie better. I can not wait for the next Bond movie.

Bond gets a new face. And a good one!,"I never liked Bond. Too much stereotype, too much cliché-based. And the last two films definitely blow. I mean, come on, an invisible Aston Martin, what garbage. The last Bond movies were one visual effect. Louder, faster, dumber. And I wasn't sure if the new one could do any better. I saw it two days ago. It could. Hardly any visual effects, but more solid action and suspense. Great! And Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond. A little more rough and dirty than the last ones, but always with a little humor. He always seems a sympathetic character, in contrast to Brosnan, who was an arrogant and one-dimensional character all the time. The new Bond is three-dimensional, he goes through a journey and changes within it. He is a man, not a hero. As I said, the film strictly avoids clichés, the gangsters are no Nazis, no Muslims, no evil Russians. They don't want to destroy the world, they don't have any superpower weapons. They are criminals, only with a bit more money.... The film is perfectly set and played, director Campbell did a great job as well. Amazing scenes, like the very first chase in Africa, which is breathtaking, great camera movement, superb actors, the film is by far the best Bond I've ever seen!

Daring experiment for the Bond series which mostly succeeds very well,"I'll admit something first up. I enjoyed the much-criticised Die Another Day, Yes,the Madonna song and CGI were awful,but as a ramped-up,escapist action movie it certainly did the job. However,Casino Royale is a different beast altogether. The opening sequence is is black and white and shows Bond shooting a man,with flashbacks to Bond's first,decidedly messier,killing interspersed. Both the violence and Daniel Craig's intensity are quite shocking. After the eye-popping title sequence,cleverly based around cards,and a perhaps unusual but good title song which does grow on you,we are thrown into quite simply the most stunning action sequence done in years,as Bond chases a man up and down scaffolding,on top of a crane and through an embassy. It's undoubtedly over the top,but really is thrilling,and seeing Bond fall and get hurt a bit is refreshing and helps maintain,just about,believability.It's possible that action wise the film never tops that scene,but the other three action sequences are all excellent and have superb editing that is fast,furious yet still lets you see what is going on,a lesson to some of today's other action directors. It's almost a throwback to the 60s Bond editing,only quicker. There was a sense in the 80s and 90s that maybe the Bond style of action was a little outmoded,it had certainly been imitated to death. Here,Bond becomes leader of the pack again,and the other upstarts need to keep up.Daringly,the two and a half hour running time is not devoted to more action but chiefly two other things. The lengthy poker game IS long but maintains suspense even of you're not sure what the rules are and is broken up every now and again anyway. Then there's Bond falling in love. The World Is Not Enough and The Living Daylights had flirted with genuine romance for Bond but On Her Majesty's Secret Service up to now is the only real Bond love story. The time given to Bond's romance with Vesper Lynd is unusual but it needs the time allowed it to become convincing ,and,eventually,moving. After all,the main thrust of the film is not Bond fighting bad guys,or even playing an important poker game,but Bond becoming Bond,and this is brilliantly conveyed throughout.It is this aspect in which Craig really succeeds. Yes,he is rough and ready at first but that is the film's character. He grows and matures throughout the film,and when he puts on the tux he's earned it and certainly carries it off better than Timothy Dalton,whom Craig is probably closest to. Perhaps the film's villains and girls are not as memorable as one might hope for,but here it's Bond whom you remember,whom the film revolves around,and for this film that's exactly as it should be.Possible Casino Royale might be embraced by die-hard Bond fans more than general action movie goers,what you won't get here is constant action,silly gadgets,corny laughs {though there is humour,and in exactly the right places,such as during the otherwise horrible torture scene}. What you do get is an artistic triumph,a daring experiment that almost completely pays off,that takes us closer to the character of James Bobd than any other film. Roll on the next one,and definitely with Craig....",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
In the top 5 Bond movies!,"Bond is finally back. Sure he's done 21 films now, but not since the heady days of Connery at his peak, have the Bond films excelled, and been beyond cartoony gadgets, outlandish set pieces, and cheesy double entendres. Now all those elements have always been part and parcel of the Bond series, but as the series has progressed through the Roger Moore period, it's been less about the stories and the character of JB himself. A few have been different to varying degree's of success, such as the not so popular Dalton entries, to the most recent decent Bond, Goldeneye. However CR succeeds in bringing Bond down to earth a bit more and inviting us to delve into his character a bit more.Goldeneye helmer Martin Campbell returns once more, with success again. Not only does he have an edgier script to work with, he's allowed to put his stamp on some outstanding action scenes too. The action feels necessary and part of the story, not merely an excuse to do something outlandish for the sake of it, such as the hideously gimmicky Thames set action in The World Is Not Enough, or just about everything in the near Moonraker cheesefest, Die Another Day. Here the action fits into the story, and excels without feeling gimmicky. Indeed CR features some of the most jaw dropping set pieces put to film including a superb free-running chase, and a car chase on an airport runway. Aside from anything else, it's all captured with some flair, sadly lacking from the flat direction of the last two Bond films especially.The main question of course, is about the validity of Daniel Craig as the latest 007. Many were sceptical, questioning the blonde hair, the height, the looks, amongst other things. Plus the worries that Bond would become too po-faced and serious like Dalton. In truth Daniel Craig is most like Timothy Dalton if comparing to the Bond actors canon. But he's got the material to make an edgier Bond work, which Dalton didn't have in the far too Americanised films he did. Craig is a far more serious Bond, playing him on his first proper assignment. However Craig is allowed to express some Conneryesque charm too. And when the action kicks in, he holds his own, performing most of his own stunts. Without doubt Craig is a worthy Bond. Similarly Eva Green represents one of the best Bond girl's in years. A near unknown, she works in her role where the previous three Bond girls (the rather pointlessly sassy Halle Berry in particular). Green is also extremely attractive and with the kind of European look that evokes the Bond girls of yesteryear. Bond villains too have become quite lame in recent times, yet Mads Mikkelsen is excellent and has a real intensity as Le Chiffre.The film isn't merely a lazily and sloppily produced effort (or lack of) that the producers have been guilty of in previous years. This is brilliantly shot and cut, and the cinematography is eye-catching and atmospheric, not flat and DP 101 like the last film. Elsewhere David Arnold makes up for his overwrought last few Bond scores with a more low key and effective one here, although his and Chris Cornell's theme isn't great (then again anything beats Madges Die Another Day). The only negatives really are a somewhat segmented feeling in the plot, and the very lengthy running time, but these are minor quibbles in a top class Bond outing.Overall this is a great action film that has taken a leaf from the Bourne books, and kept things grounded, and remembered the plot. It's every bit as good as those movies, and ranks in the top 5 Bond movies. ****1/2",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A different James Bond - but wow what a show!,"I've been a fan of James Bond movies since the beginning - OK, I'm dating myself. Seeing the new James Bond in previews etc, I wasn't sure I would like it, as he does not resemble the former smooth talking, debonair 007 of the good old days. Don't expect a rehash here of what the movie was about, you will get plenty of recaps in other member commentaries. Right off the bat though, I was surprised to see 007 shoot and kill a man who was not armed, and James knew it. Former James Bonds never took out a bad guy unless he was trying to do in our hero (as unreal as that is in real spy life). The new James Bond is rougher and tougher with no holds barred. OK, you get the idea. Daniel Craig was most believable in the part and the stunt men did a wonderful job, but it looked like Craig also did a lot of hard work himself. Eva Green was perfect for her part as she was both vulnerable and yet matched James quip for quip with her own kind of toughness. Being that beautiful doesn't hurt either. The bad guys and the supporting cast were most outstanding as well. Special effects will wow you. Don't try to compare this with the 1967 Casino Royale. Same title, different movies. Don't try to compare it to other James Bond movies either. Just enjoy each for itself. I hate to give any movie two thumbs up, but that other hand is trying to raise a digit.

They finally got it EXACTLY right!,"Reading some of the negative reviews here, it breaks my heart plenty of the supposed Bond fans here who say Bond lacks charm and wit, and that this doesn't feel like a Bond movie.If you've read the books, then you'd know that Bond, in the books, really was a nihilistic, cold hearted punk who constantly got into trouble left and right, screwed up nearly plan he had, risked his- and his allies'- lives for no reason and furthermore, asked carelessly and constantly annoyed MI6 with his careless actions. He isn't the suave playboy the movies make him out to be. Then again though, I guess it's no surprise considering there are more people familiar with the books. But if you say that Bond should be like the films, then you have no business really saying that you're a true Bond fan.Alright, now I got that off my chest, this is an amazing movie.Sure Bond being blonde was a bit of a bafflement. But he did indeed have blue eyes like the book said he did. Before this the closest we got to a REAL Bond was Timothy Dalton, who looked exactly like Bond, and was very tough too. But no, Craig IS Bond. Craig plays Bond exactly how he should be played. He brings out the toughness in Bond, as well as the naivety and the slight idiocy. If Fleming were still alive, he'd cry tears of joy knowing his wish for a TRUE Bond had come true.Anyways. The plot is almost exactly like the book. Sure there are a few Changes, particularly in the poker subplot, but all around this is exactly like the book. As for the other things... Well, the opening theme is just AWESOME. I love Chris Cornell's theme. He achieves what many didn't do with their themes. He doesn't try to be too much like the old themes, but he gives it his own spin, a reserved and natural approach, and it works. I love the opening titles too, its like an animated story of how James became Bond.In short, excellent movie. One you CANNOT miss.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Maker or Breaker ?,"I have always been a big Bond fan. Contrary to most critics Brosnan next to Connery was my favorite Bond. I just thought he had all the dimensions it took to make a good bond. After seeing Casino Royale this weekend I was left on the unfulfilled side but not sure why. Part of the problem is the plot is so layered or for lack of a better word confusing, I will have to see it again to be sure of who the bad guy actually was. I think the writers were so concerned with telling the story of how and why Bond became the cold hearted assassin that we all know and love that they lost the actual Bond vs. the villain that wants to rule the world story. I know the creators wanted to get away from the ""cartoon"" Bond films of the past but I for one thought they overcompensated. Where was Q ? And not one neat gadget to be seen.

One of the best action movies around,"This is a movie that has taken me by surprise. I had long lost my interest on Bond movies since they were too sci-fi for my tastes. I have been convinced by some friends to go to a theater and watch the movie and I admit that it is one of my best action movies in general. The hero here is vulnerable and human. It takes a beating and bleeds like a human. In the films from the past, especially with Moore and Brosnan, the central hero could kill 50 enemies and destroy a whole city without a scratch or wound. Also, the character of the hero here is warmer, with feelings and remorse. Mr. Craig is perfect for the role. He is a good actor and a ""tough"" guy without showing off. Eva Green is gorgeous, innocent and smart. The action scenes are realistic and there is more physical contact between Bond and his enemies than in older movies, where gadgets had the first role.

Cellphones! Cards! Cellphones!,"If your idea of a good movie is lots and lots of scenes of people looking at cellphone screens, people playing cards, people talking into cellphones, and people looking at cellphone screens, this is the film for you! Seriously- this is a far better than average Bond film, but if you take out all the scenes dominated by cellphones (why are they so fascinating to the producers? They are hardly glamorous technology in 2006) and card-playing (anyone else think that Mathis's narration of the game-- ""there is now fifteen million in the pot....there is now one hundred million in the pot.."" especially when you consider he was speaking to a TREASURY AGENT who just MIGHT be capable of ADDING was more than a little annoying?), you've got maybe forty minutes of action.You also have to ignore a few major plot holes- the password Bond chooses is so blatantly obvious. How could the Secret Service fail to protect Bond after the game was over, and before he could transfer the money? Why wasn't the money transferred as soon as the game was over? How did LeChiffre know that Bond wouldn't' run over Vesper with his car- he barely missed her- and why didn't that tip off Bond that LeChiffre already had the account number out of her? How could Vesper spend the entire card game sitting at the bar and not bother to watch to make sure Bond's drink wasn't poisoned? Why did Bond chase that guy up the crane instead of just waiting for him to come down- did he think the bomber was going to jump into a hot air balloon and fly away at the top?

Later, Moneypenny is beautiful, intelligent and likeable, but that can never hold a candle to this relationship. Bond is largely defined by one and only one true romance.

Very disappointed - Not good enough to be a Bond Movie,"Most of what I think has been said by others already by the look of it. The opening credits were really lousy - by ANY standards... and so is that bond song - What on earth were these people thinking when they made this Bond movie???? I think Daniel Craig is the worst bond for a very long time - I really watched the film with an open mind - but have to say they have made a huge mistake in casting him as bond. There is something not right about him at all, and it seems to lose everything that was unique and great about bond. In fact, I really think they should bring back Brosnan(!) The movie being set in the present doesn't work at all either - this is meant to be bond becoming a 00 agent. By setting it after the other bond movies, it is effectively saying the other bond movies never happened.This bond is not suave, sophisticated, or even polite. He should have been cast as a baddie. He has the personality of a plank of driftwood, and is more like a token henchman than anything else.There weren't many gadgets either, which isn't a good thing - but that's not my main gripe with this movie.The movie just doesn't work for me. It most certainly isn't worthy of the Bond title...As a fan of most of the bond movies, I am extremely disappointed - I will not be adding this to my DVD collection.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond re-imagined ends up being the greatest Bond movie ever made!,"When I saw this movie back in 2006 I hadn't really seen many of the Bond movies. I was a kid when Brosnan was Bond, so I saw all of those and enjoyed them as dumb action movies. I had only seen a few of the rest randomly throughout my life.After seeing this I ended up watching most of the rest of the Bond movies and I can safely say this is THE BEST movie of them all. He has his ups and downs, most of the high points being early on with Connery, a few good ones scattered throughout the next 40 years, and a lot of mediocre to abysmal. This one starts Craig's tenure off in the biggest fashion possible, the best Bond movie ever made.It's such a well made package all around. It's shot beautifully, the cinematography is like no other. The action is well choreographed and not shaky cam like most of the movies of the 2000's were. It's got the best ensemble cast of any Bond and secondary characters that you care about and have more depth than the usual stereotypes. It's got the best Bond girl ever, his first love. Craig might not be the ""best"" Bond, but him within the confines of the movie is pretty spectacular.We're just all so damn lucky that the ""reboot"" or Bond ended being such a perfectly made package. There are some who criticize it's length as it sits at 2 hours and 20 mins, but I never felt it at all. After the main plot is resolved there is a secret that adds a bit on to the end, but it's so well done that you don't even care that it's another 30 mins added to the plot.It's a shame that this banger was followed up with probably the WORST Bond movie. But it's redeemed thanks to Skyfall, but then again falters with Spectre. Here's hoping the whole every other movie is brilliant factor holds up and Craig's final movie is at least up to snuff with Skyfall and this.I'll be interested to see what they do with Bond after Craig.

It has fast cars, action, women, violence, humour and everything else you'd associate with this iconic series, however it has an element of realism which makes it 100% more intense.Craig is brilliant, the supporting cast are brilliant and the director, who funnily enough also made Goldeneye, proves Bond can live on as more than an all shagging, all fighting on ice, cartoon charter.If you like all Bonds go watch it.

I haven't heard that from her since Redford made The Sting.Finally, old Bond fans will miss the whimsy of earlier films.

Bad Jason Bourne Copy,"OK action film with bad dialog, coincidences and the most ridiculous game of poker I have seen. Critics are paid to point out the flaws in movies-which Bond films have in abundance but get away with it because they're ""just"" Bond films.The scene on the train where Bond tries to read Moneypenny and vice versa made me feel like punching both of them along with the script writer and the director. It's one of the tackiest pieces of pretentious dialog I have ever seen. How this film got a 9.5 out of 10 in rottentomatoes.com when Harsh Times is called unrealistic is a mystery to me.Better than other more recent Bond films in general (not hard) and for action sequences especially - but I still don't know why 007 climbs the scaffolding to follow the bomb maker instead of just following him from below. Although it's nothing that hasn't been done before and done better in the Bourne movies.Also how does Bond know that Moneypenny is running into a trap when she says she's going outside to meet Matheus? It then take weeks for M to ring Bond to ask where the 110 million dollars is. He sails to Venice stopping off at a beach or two and sends in his resignation before he gets the call.

Don't judge a book by its cover.,"To be honest i was very critical of the new bond, Daniel Craig. I guess I wanted to see Brosnan back and expected the same out of Craig. I believe this is due to my younger age and growing up with seeing Brosnan as Bond. After seeing the movie and thinking about the previous bonds I really do like Craig. He has that older ""rough-edged"" personality of Sean Connery. Craig played the role very well and definitely, in my opinion, was an excellent choice for bond. To be honest I always thought Pierce Brosnan was the best bond ever, and until I saw Casino Royale I am really not sure of who the best is. If you are critical like I was and think that Daniel Craig is not a good bond go and watch the movie, its just like the saying ""don't judge a book by its cover""",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Pretty Good....,"First off let me just say that I wasn't one of the ""haters"" that questioned Daniel Craig's casting as James Bond. I actually like Daniel Craig and even though I would have to say that I still consider Connery and Brosnan the two best Bonds Craig and Timothy Dalton are probably the two best actors to play Bond. If anything I guess I was a little baffled as to why Brosnan was pushed out of this role when he probably had at least a couple films left in him and his last Bond film was extremely successful. With all the said I went into this film with a very open mind and high expectations which were mostly met.This film definitely hits the mark on many levels. This is by far the darkest Bond to ever grace the screen and I guess in many ways it seems more appropriate at this time in our history. The violence is probably the most realistic of any Bond film and we finally see a human Bond that if anything is pretty morally ambiguous. As a matter of fact I wasn't really sure I liked this guy. The action is good,although, some of it is a little bit unrealistic and seems to take away from this more realistic portrayal of Bond. The film, however, does fall short on a few levels.As I said I like Daniel Craig but there did seem to be something missing here. I didn't mind the fact that he played Bond more edgy and even made the character hard to like at some points but I do feel there needs to be more charisma given off in the next film. I am not saying I want to see another Brosnan or Moore light hearted Bond but I do want someone that I at least kind of like. I just felt that we weren't really given enough of Bond's personality until, what I felt, was a forced and completely unbelievable transition at the end.My final issue was that the film didn't end when it needed to which creates the above problem. I wont give anything away here but had the movie ended probably about 25 minutes earlier I would have definitely given it a higher mark. The last half an hour or so seems to stretch credibility and expects us to buy a complete change in Bond for very little reason. I kept expecting Bond to kind of give us a wink that he knew something we didn't but that didn't happen. Most of the audience in the showing I went to just weren't buying this.Anyway, like I said above, this is a pretty good movie and I would definitely recommend seeing it in the theater. I am fairly certain that any short comings in this film have less to do with Craig and more to do with the direction and the writing. If this is tweaked just a little bit in the next film Craig could be playing Bond for the next ten years if he wants to.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I Bite My Tongue!,"So I went and saw this film on Tuesday and it blew me out of the water! I have been a long time fan of Bond and when I heard that Daniel Craig was the next Bon, I like every other Bond fan, wrote the movie off immediately. My friends, also Bond fans, talked me into going to see it. From the very opening I new this was no normal Bond film. I don't want to give ANY spoilers so I will talk about the film in generalities.Is this Sean Connery's Bond? No. Is this Pierce Brosnan's Bond? No. This is Daniel Craig's Bond. Is this good? Absolutely! Although my friends argue that the Bond franchise was never in trouble, it was. And I believe that this film, thanks to Craig, has been saved. Let me say, I don't think Brosnan could have done this movie. THis was a raw movie, and Craig played the perfect bad ass Bond.I was happy with the entire film, the only thing that I did miss was OO7's visit to Q-Lab. There are no tongue-in-cheek comments that seemed to plague previous movies. There were a few lines that Craig nailed as a perfect Bond response.The action is rough and brutal. There are no Judo chops in this film. All the hits are hard. The plot is believable and there are even a few twists along the way. Above all, this is an action movie and it delivers. The thing I like best about this film, is that you don't really know when it is taking place. There is a lot of speculations about this. I will guess that it is post-Brosnan and Craig is an incoming OO. This is something that we have never seen before. The thing I love is that we get to see Craig develop his OO7. His drink, his look, and even his signature phrase, ""Bond, James Bond.""I bite my tongue for ever doubting Craig.

Bond is Back.,"""Name is Bond, James Bond"". For almost half a century this line has been a victim of praise and criticism. Starting from Dr No (1962) starring Sean Connery Bond movies have always been on the lists of top action flicks. New movie's arrival is always awaited. At the same time signing up of a new bond has never escaped controversy. Daniel Craig is no exception to the ""New James Bond"" controversy. If you have heard, during the golden era of Hollywood, that included screwball comedies and Frank Sinatra, the actors were popular for their grace and their image among the audiences. Perhaps acting department was not on their to do list. Then came Marlon Brando in On the Waterfront (1954). He was never worried about how he looked or his social image among the viewers. Not only people accepted him but he was honoured with his first Academy Award. What Daniel Craig has done for James Bond is exactly what Marlon Brando did for the movies. Until Daniel Craig all the actors who played bond used their grace and style to play the character. But Daniel's presence in the action and the acting department has given this new Bond a really never before seen look.Is this new Bond capable of what we think? Well as the stiry advances we come to know that Craig's promotion makes him James Bond but there are no gadgets and just one leather dashboard Ashton Martin (well let's give him one). We never know clearly till the end what his job is. All we know vaguely that he has to stop a banker from winning a casino Hold 'em tournament and suposedly funding a terrorist organization. Well the first few sequences not just prove that Daniel is capable but he is rather the only bond who is convincing in his job as a secret agent, ever. Daniel has changed all the parameters of James Bond which makes this movie a must see.Although there are times when the movie drags a little bit, feels like a holiday romantic movie. But that's not what you remember when it ends. The screenplay is filled with humor, pace, romance and one liners. Perfect for an action thriller. As per the original myths and conventions two ladies add to the story. Not to mention swimsuits and cocktail dresses. In the movie the writers almost were going to reveal M's real name but it ended up being another humorous addition. On a final note I would like to mention that last year Batman Begins (2005) portrayed Bruce Wayne's quest to become the superhero. In Spiderman-2 (2004) Peter Parker's character study was done. Seems like James Bond has gone under the same treatment of character study. Thats why this is a must see. Rating: 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A royale, without the cheese of its predecessors.","Casino Royale transgresses against the familiar gun barrel intro sequence of the 007 franchise; instead blasting onto the screen with a grainy, striking monochromatic scene of Bond, in all his glory, brutally murdering a man in a public bathroom.Following this is the opening title sequence - the first Bond to depart from silhouettes of naked women, instead opting for faceless male silhouettes; their bodies exploding into playing cards and guns shooting out hearts instead of bullets. Chris Cornell's ""you know my name"" is my favourite Bond soundtrack and very fitting for the Bond that's portrayed.Daniel Craig most definitely revives a role that has been overdone. Ditching the playboy characteristics emitted from the likes of Brosnan, Craig offers a more well rounded performance as the steely assassin. Still loaded with thuggish charm, we are given the softer side of him - a romantic at heart who is actually capable of emotion. Craig is easily the best Bond there has been.Le Chiffre defies the trope of a megalomaniac villain obsessed with world domination, which I liked. His blood spurting eye, devilish smile & the scene he tortures Bond was enough to make him menacing.I loved that Vesper was fleshed out, and not the typical objectified woman who is bedded by Bond then killed by his enemies.The parkour sequence & the hotel stairwell scene were edited to perfection, and though brimming with all the nail biting action you'd want - the tension created during the poker game between Craig & Mikkelson was equally captivating.An interesting move was losing the gadgets. With no appearance from Q, and high tech gimmicks swapped for Sony Ericsson's; Casino Royale plays its strong hand with sly dialogue, believable acting and many near death experiences for the protagonist.Con: i would have liked a scene to show the ultimatum Vesper was given",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Way overrated,"Yes the new Bond is tough and gritty and a refreshing change from the pampered pretty boys following Sean Connery. And the film has some of the best cinematography and action sequences that money can buy, why not? But this film is flawed and far from the 7.9 average it is currently boasting.First flaw is the ridiculous plot. All of the Ian Fleming plots are ridiculous but without the self-mocking irony that infused most of the films -- exemplified by Connery himself -- their ridiculousness becomes annoying. And this film lacks any sense of self-irony. Daniel Craig is good as an action automaton (a la Dolph Lundgren), but his smirk is just a smirk and miles away from Sean Connery's knowing smile. The dialogue in the script is lame and flat, the wit forced.Second flaw is the love affair between Bond and Eva Green, an actress whose passivity sucks the air off the screen. There is more chemistry in storefront dummies than between Craig and Green, and her role is particularly lame (would not MI-5 vetting have spotted her as a security risk?).Third major flaw is the brutality of the violence. We are still in a fairy tale here and Bond does not have the justification for real-seeming violence that a Martin Scorsese film has, where there is a real payoff in terms of character and plot.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Are there no writers out there who can do better than this?,"I have no idea how much Paul Haggis contributed to the final product, but it is clear that since Messrs Wade and Purvis started providing the 'scripts' for the Bond films, something has gone awry. Daniel Craig is excellent, Martin Campbell shows a real flair in his second Bond outing, and the (mainly Czech) crew have done a tremendous job, But the script is simply DIRE. (I paraphrase) - example - the line '...they are demanding your head on a plate' - the next line ought to be '..I might just give it to them' - but instead is transformed into '..I might just feed you to them (sic). The screenplay is filled with squandered opportunities for witty exchange, finally degenerating into outright vulgarity (the scene in the hospital gardens for example). The pacing is completely off - the film is front-loaded with two length action sequences - then nearly an hour of very little. Worst of all - there is no climax to the story - 'twists' (such that there are are) revealed well before the end, and the obvious attempts to pull off a Batman Begins with the closing scene fell completely flat at the screening I attended at the Odeon Leicester Square this afternoon. I am genuinely surprised at some of the critics' high praise for this one - I enjoyed Die Another Day more than this - and my favourites are Goldfinger and OHMSS.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the best Bond Movies Yet!,"When I first saw the trailers, I had my doubts about Daniel Craig's ability to carry the 007 pistol. However, he proved to be more than able to handle it. Characters had more depth & were acted beautifully. Dialog was smarter & crisper. Of course, there were the trademark 007 zingers but the dialog didn't rely on them. Also, the actors didn't depend solely on their looks & sex. They were shown in unglamorous situations w/ clothes that actually got dirty. The locales were exotic & gorgeous. The action in this movie was AMAZING! Of course, it's a Bond flick so there is the usual gorgeous women & cars that we have all come to expect. Daniel Craig did an amazing job reviving James Bond as the sexiest super spy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best James Bond movie in recent history.,"I am a huge James Bond fan and was, I admit, a little skeptical of the Bond producers (Barbra Broccolli and Micheal G. Wilson) choice of Daniel Craig as James Bond. I knew he was a good actor, but would he be a good Bond. After seeing the film all my fears were put to rest. He is, in mt humble opinion the best Bond since the early days of Sean Connery. I know a sweeping statement, but I stand by it 100%. First of all, he was the first Bond, since Connery, to actually look like he could do some of the stunts preformed by Bond in the film. HIs perfect portrayal of James Bond helped me overlook the fact that his blond hair wasn't dyed. He portrayed the two Bond mentalities of the film (cold-blooded assassin and witty gentleman) very well. From the beginning the Bond producers said they were making Bond more serious and ""real"" in light of the fact that Bond had become a slightly silly caricature like character as opposed to Bond, the man from the original Ian Flemming novels. This idea rose another fear of mine. What if they went and tried to make it too serious and took out all the wit a humor and tried to make it more like a drama, because everyone knows Bond is an action movie. Also Bond is and always will be a completely fictitious character. All you can do is put him in real situations, which I think is very necessary for a successful Bond film. But the character itself is meant to be a fantasy. Yet again my fears were put to rest after viewing the film. Just a something I enjoyed, but the title song ""You Know My Name"" by Chris Cornell was superb. Much better than Madonna's sad example of a Bond title song for ""Die Another Day"". I definitely give this film 10 out of 10. Remember though I am a BOnd fan and that's 10 out of 10 on a Bond scale. Probably 7 or 8 out of ten compared to all other movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

You know my name; Bond...James Bond.,"'Casino Royale' is a well crafted '007' film that does justice and stays true to Ian Fleming's novel. Martin Campbell surely has outdone himself since his first 'Bond' film 'GoldenEye', with a different directing style that makes this the most modern and grounded of all the 'Bond' films before.1. Daniel Craig is no Sean Connery, but he does the best he can with the character of James Bond even though his acting comes off a bit stiff and emotionally detached at times. However, he does have the best physicality of the previous Bond actors and it sure does show in all of the action sequences which are choreographed amazingly.2. The one sequence which stands out above the rest, is the spectacular foot chase after the opening credits where Bond pursues a bomb-maker involved in a sinister plot which is uncovered later on in the film. All the action in this film is done surprisingly well under Campbell's direction (which I had hoped later directors would have taken note on...but didn't) with all emulating a sense of suspense, excitement and most of all...consequence.3. Mads Mikkelsen is even more exceptional than Craig as the cunning antagonist 'Le Chiffre'. He brings a sense of mystery and style as the character with so many interesting dimensions as a villain that he steals the show whenever he's on screen. One flaw is that he doesn't have enough screen-time, especially in the third act of the film. He proves himself to be smarter than Bond and just outdoes him at every turn when it comes to style.4. Now the bad part. The real anchor that weighs this film down is the campy love-story. Craig and Green (Vesper) have an interesting dynamic when they play-off each other with a sort of love/hate relationship once she is introduced at the beginning of the film's second act. The movie takes a huge nose-dive near the 2hr mark when their love-story comes front and center. At that point, it feels like the film has outstayed it's welcome when we get a full 15mins of Bond and Vesper laying on beaches, having sex, living in hotels and exchanging lines of horrible dialogue with each other. These scenes (undoubtedly) should have been cut from the final film, cause it unnecessarily adds extra length to an already 2hr 30min running time.5. Lastly, in no way am I denying that Eva Green isn't an attractive woman, but the actress who appears in the first act (Caterina Murino) is an absolute knock-out and is more of a classic beauty suited for a 007 film. She should have played the female lead of Vesper Lynd rather than Green based on appearance alone, cause she just emits hotness;)If I were to decide, I'd say 'Casino Royale' is the best of the Daniel Craig '007' films since the others (the closet being 'Skyfall') never really live up to the bar which was set be this reboot.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Wow!,"Before I entered the theater, I had the feeling that I was going to be disappointed. How wrong was I! Mr Daniel Craig has delivered in full the most realistic performance of Mr Bond. He is on par with Sean Connery. With his brutal performance of 007 together with a great storyline makes Casino Royale the best Bond flick in my opinion since Goldfinger. I sincerely hope is will not be his last. Don't miss it! On the down side, Im use to seeing the bond flicks loaded with gadgets and in this one, I was disappointed by the lack of Q merchandise.

Best Bond I've ever seen,"It's been one hour since the end-credits started rolling on the screen... It was at that very same moment when I realised, what I had just experienced... I have never enjoyed a Bond movie like I did just now.The movie does feel a little odd in the beginning, since the (at this moment) last Bond is actually the beginning of 007, but Craig does manage to show the best Bond ever seen in the movies. This more sinister and sadistic movie, shows you what the world of 007 should be according to the books, although there of course are a few exceptions.For me the movie has only one disadvantage... And that is NOT the long-lasting poker scene. Even that 'simple' game is thrilling in this movie! No the disadvantage is.... The ending! It feels like you just saw the first half of a story, not as bad as The Matrix: Reloaded though, but it certainly does get close!However, the entire movie makes that little disadvantage fade away....

Double oh my god this is rubbish,"Last night, I went to see Casino Royale. I didn't expect much, although I secretly hoped to be surprised by a tough gritty thriller devoid of all the overblown tat that has blighted the James Bond films for as long as I can remember. Stripped down Bond, edgy, moody - I had read all these things and more in an array of suspiciously complementary reviews. I loved James Bond as a child (Roger Moore), but had gotten less and less excited at the thought of the next release, and more and more annoyed at the way that the franchise acted like it had a god-given right to somehow demand respect from the public for being ""BOND"". Well, I have to say I was surprised. Never before have I seen the blatant homo-erotic 'man on man action' subtext displayed so openly. The whole film seemed mired in it's own camp importance. The acting was as wooden as Woody Woodpecker's wooden house. The dialogue was atrocious (as for Paul Haggis' 'glitter' - I dread to think what the script was like beforehand). The plot was disjointed and unbelievable - veering awkwardly from weird melancholy scenes delivered with zero charisma to weird 'slightly amusing' scenes delivered with zero humour. It succeeded in reducing poker to the least interesting and suspenseful game on the planet, and the least said about the stock European exposition man the better. It was an hour too long, had a bad ending that sought to blunt any trace of edginess the film had accidentally stumbled across during the previous 2 1/2 hours, and the blatant product placement was shameful. The best bit was a chase scene that while not making any real sense, at least stopped anyone from talking for 5 minutes. Did I mention the racial stereotypes straight out of 1980's action movies - sweaty Africans with machetes anyone?? Woeful. Don't waste your time.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One in the eye for the critics of Daniel Craig - myself included!,"Okay, so it's a Bond film and there's only so much you can expect from what has become a tired franchise. But Casino Royale gives the whole series a kick in the pants by getting back to the gritty down-and-dirty Bond of Fleming's original books.Daniel Craig is a revelation. After all the flak he took on the run-up to the release of this movie he must be rolling in I-Told-You-So's. He's sharp, sexy, funny and human, and a wonderful antidote to the foppish, anal Pierce Brosnan.The plot is minimal, but the action is original, fast and furious (without being gratuitous or boring), Bond is fresh and he and the Bond girl are believable as people of the 21st century. The script is sharp by Bond standards and authentic too.The movie really gives the feeling that we can expect the whole Bond movie experience to enjoy an upsurge over the next few years, because those of us who'd got bored by the whole tired thing will be going back to the cinema in droves.Kudos all round!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond?,"Played completely straight, pulling even the punning, this Bond is as satisfying as a a meal in your favorite Parisian restaurant, a great steak, the freshest sushi - choose your simile.Daniel Craig kept reminding me of a strange but satisfying combo of Sting and Steve McQueen; that devilish smile in his eyes and that killer ready to go on a moment's notice. Compared to the abysmally horrid Roger Moore tired farces of the 1970's we have another apex to contrast to the abyss.This will go down as either the best or the best of the rest depending on your loyalty to Sir Sean Connery. (I haven't decided yet.) This is a very satisfying escapist movie-making blockbuster. Something Bond fans have waited decades for.Some will not care for it because the genre does not appeal to all types, but few with interest in spectacular and varied settings, action escapism and fantasizing ""the stories behind the news"" will have two hours of first-class ""as you ordered"".Isn't that what we go to the movies for anyway?Does it look like I give a damn?

Unsympathetic characterisation mars this for me,"I have seen all the James Bond films - and this is to be numbered among those that I am in no rush to see again, rather than among those I love.The reason is that the James Bond of this film is a sadistic thug - and nothing more. There has always been something appealing about the previous characterisation of James Bond, but this James Bond is a killing machine without any redeeming characteristic.It has been said that Daniel Craig marks a return to the harder-edged cruelty of Sean Connery. I disagree. What made the Sean Connery characterisation appealing to me was that it was also larger-than-life and witty - as well as being cruel. And that undeniable cruelty must also be seen in context - Domino in 'Thunderball', for example, sees James Bond as someone who treats her as a gentleman would, in contrast to the way Largo treats her. The cruelty of the Sean Connery James Bond can therefore relax into tenderness when that James Bond perceives there to be no threat to himself.Other James Bond outings have had their own appeal. But it is a mistake to make too many comparisons between Craig's James Bond and the Bourne films. The Bourne films contain both excitement and a character one can sympathise with - a killer who is repentant enough to seek forgiveness from the daughter whose parent he had had to kill.Perhaps I shall be able to find something I like in this James Bond characterisation. The film may be faithful to the original book and character of 'Casino Royale' in many respects, but I beg to differ from both critical and popular opinion on this one at the minute. Ian Fleming's James Bond is not a particularly likable character, but previous characterisations combined his immorality and amorality with qualities one could relate to and an appealing superhumanness. Perhaps the series creators should also reflect that durable screen tough guys like Humphery Bogart had things that this James Bond characterisation lacks - wit, warmth and humour.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Simply Amazing,"This is by far the best James Bond film I have seen! For the first time I left the theater wishing that I was James Bond. Daniel Craig is stunningly amazing and I cannot wait to see him again in his next James Bond Film.This Bond film doesn't even compare to previous films. The director made Bond more cruel in this one. I don't say that meaning it's a bad thing, in fact, it is very good. It is much more realistic in the sense that an elite operative would be a little meaner than previous James Bonds. At the same time though, you don't loose any of the essentials for a James Bond film; You still have the exotic cars, the sexy women, the flashy suits, and many, many, many action scenes that will have you at the edge of your seat. If you are a James Bond fan, I highly recommend Casino Royale; Daniel Craig is amazing and in my own opinion...the best Bond to date.

"A new ""ole blue eyes""","An authentic licensee-to-kill: I like this James Bond. I think Craig delivered a credible, creditable performance. The director went back to basics, cutting out the over-the-top spoofing that characterized the Roger Moore movies and instead building up a thoroughly believable, if not always entirely likable, protagonist. The feisty Vesper, whose spirited replies and quick ripostes made for a three-dimensional female role, has a complicated and layered personality which contrasts well with his thoroughly male one and is not submerged by him by any means.Courage in the face of danger, loyalty to queen and country and disregard of pain and suffering might seem old-fashioned, but I approve of the return to those sterling values.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A cut above the rest,"Casino Royale has got it right. A fast paced story ran, jumped, exploded and shot across the screen. Yep, the tech was there, but in it's proper place, _supporting_ the script, _not_ in-your-face! Of course, Bond still has his encounters with the ladies. Again, they are more plausible than in previous movies.Previous Bond films have been overshadowed by the 'here are the gadgets' routine and a tired formula, which was becoming increasingly difficult to rejuvenate - 'Die Another Day' is a prime example. The formula is still there in Casino Royale, but it's been turned on its head! The fresh approach has stayed true to the spirit of the original books more fully than any of the other Bond films. Daniel Craig brings out the 'darker side' of Bond very well.I came out of the cinema wanting to see the film again, and wanting to see the next one too!

Casino loyale,"Simply,this is the best Bond since Connery 's heyday (1963-66) ,but do not expect the return of the good old days .""Casino Royale"" is something different,if I should describe it,it would be a return to Ian Fleming's spirit.Those who know the novels will certainly agree.Daniel Craig makes Bond a cold hard unkind character,just the way he is in Fleming's books .Without Connery's sense of humour,his Bond has something disturbing ,even threatening...but he is also a frail human being, as the last scenes show.For the first time -with the exception of "" On Her Majesty's secret service "" - the ending leaves Bond a broken man.I've never liked the Moore/Brosnan efforts .They had the occasional good song( ""Live and let die"") ,good cinematography ("" the spy who loved me"" by Claude Renoir),but the screenplays butchered Fleming's books -who had asked that after his death - thus after ""THunderball"" all the plots should be original ones using his titles and characters.And during Dalton's (the best of the post-Connery Bond until Craig's appearance:it's not a coincidence if both were first stage actors,having played Shakespeare)and Brosnan's era,as they were running out of novels,the writers started to write the titles too...The cast and credits are sensational ,matching the splendor of those of ""Goldfinger"" and ""Thunderball"" .But the first sequences made me fear that Bond should become a superman once again.But the rest of the film is devoid of gimmicks,gadgets ,keeping the big poker game of the novel as its Pièce de Résistance ,and daring unusual inventive scenes (Bond's heart attack;the scene under the shower with Vesper:no it's not what you are thinking of!;the tears of blood) ""Casino Royale"" (I 've never understood the spelling;it's a French expression and should be written ""Casino Royal"" )makes veiled references to the places where ""Thunderball"" (Nassau) ,""Goldfinger ""(Switzerland) and above all ""From Russia with Love (the finale in Venice) were partly filmed.Some of the viewers may remember the version of the sixties: an attempt at a spoof on the saga,it failed totally to convince me and the one thing I remember is Herb Alpert's music.So the script writers were right to make a new version of that book.Now could we dream of remakes of ""you only live twice "" (without the gadgets but with the ""suicide"" castle) and all the other novels transferred to the screen in the seventies and eighties which ,as the first four episodes did ,would roughly follow Fleming's plots?NB:Eva Green's mother ,Marlene Jobert ,was one of the biggest French stars of the late sixties/early seventies.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

The plot was equally twisted -- brought up to date but still well within the genre boundaries.The movie is two and half hours but it never gets long. Nor does the plot seem like a vehicle to transport you to the next chase or fight.With so many disappointing movies in the past few years -- movies that substituted gore for suspense and sex for passion -- Casino Royale almost makes me want to pay a few extra bucks and tell 'em to keep up the good work.

Best of the Bond Films So Far,"This film really reawakened my interest in the Bond franchise, whilst I always went to see them it was more of a formality than an eagerness to see them. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed them, but I was never impressed by them....until now.An excellent reworking of Bond himself, the way the film was delivered and thankfully they stopped all these ultra-fantastical devices from being introduced at the beginning of the film, when you know they will certainly be used later on.One of the best aspects was the plausibility of the villains and their plots, they were realistic ambitions, none of this ""I am going to rule the world"" rubbish. By downscaling the ambitions of the villains one would expect the stakes to be lower, but as a viewer you do not feel any loss of tension as a result.The chemistry between Bond and the ladies he crosses is excellent, and the stand out scene of the whole film to me is his first meeting with Vesper Lynd, which is just pure movie heaven.Craig IS Bond!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

From the beginning to end, this film will not disappoint fans of OO7.

Although, appearing ever-ready to hang up his Berretta, Craig leaves nothing to be desired in the agent's persona with an immortal legacy. In this story, Bond is up against a most sinister and certainly worthy adversary called Le Chiffre, who's aim is to provide an almost limitless bank account with which to supply international terrorism worldwide. In order to establish the world account, he must defeat Bond in among other challenges a multi-million dollar high stakes poker game. To be sure, Bond is ever accompanied by C.I.A. agent Felix Leiter (Jeffery Write) and of course "" M "" (Judi Dench). Anyone fearing that Bond has lost his physical ability to confront the modern heavy, will be disappointed as Bond adequately displays an abundance of action, drama, and of course his suave debonair self with the leading lady.

Was as much as a shock to me as seeing Robin Williams as a stalker.In summary, I give it a nine on the basis of some good acting, and primarily on the fact that is great to see a new and believable Bond.

The Bond franchise finally breaks free from its own rules,"""Casino Royale"" marks a change in the 007-franchise. What we see here is a very different James Bond and that was to be expected since this is the official first chapter in the series (although the chronology is more than messed up with ""Casino Royale"" taking place after 9/11 whereas a lot of the previous Bond movies mentioned the Cold War et al).Anyway, let's hope that this trend to break free from previous Bond rules will continue from now on. How much longer could we have taken a smirking, Martini slurping Bond that never shows any feelings at all, never makes mistakes and is basically invulnerable.A lot has been argued about the decision to cast Daniel Craig as the new Bond. Truth be told, Craig has obviously been miscast. Period. It's not that the man acts badly - how badly would you have to act to screw up James Bond? Come on, let's be real here, this isn't Hamlet -, no, he just doesn't have the right look. Maybe that's another reason why this movie doesn't really feel like a Bond movie and maybe that's a good thing, since this franchise has become really trite since the 80's.""Casino Royale"" is a well made movie with some great action sequences. Some of the Casino scenes are a bit long maybe, because they seem old-fashioned and slow. I'm guessing these are probably leftovers that remained from the original novel, since they don't really fit the rest of the fast moving, modern storyline.Hey, no one said this movie was immaculate! It does have its lengths but in the end the balance between action scenes and story development was maintained nicely.

Casino Royale - Cash in Your Chips and Leave,"The most promise. The least delivered.With an outstanding cast, great locations and best Bond book of them all, Casino Royal had me in anticipation of the best Bond in years. It started strong, with a great title squence and real action, far better than the Brosnan computer game action squences. The card game has suspense and thrills. For a while I thought I was there. But one technical flaw after another (every car in the movie has standard multiple airbags, but not one deploys as each car is involved in a collision, Virgin Airways does not operate a hub in Miami as the movie suggests), continuity mistakes (M does not report to the Prime Minister, her home is not a secret to 00 agents, would an airport continue to allow flights to take off and depart evacuating the airport during a gun battle?)and finally, the convoluted end game, left me disappointed.The talents of Giancarlo Giannini (Mathis) and Jeffrey Wright (Felix Leiter) are wasted. Leiter simply disappears from the movie just as his role becomes pivitol. Mads Mikkelsen (Le Chiffre) was brilliant and is another one in the win box for European Bond villains. Judi Dench (M) gives another outstanding performance. I lept for joy when the Aston Martin DBS fired up for a car race, but was left asking for my money back at the racetrack.Daniel Craig is a good James Bond. But he does not make us laugh the way Connery and Moore did. And while he looks far more attractive in a bathing suit than Bond has looked in years, he cannot hold a candle to Connery on the beach in Dr. No.Casino Royale has its moments.

We went to our local cinema and expected a film thats worth this special evening.... It was way beyond great over all our expectations. This is the best Bond Movie i saw in cinemas so far... Bond is like a raw pit bull and he has to go through the toughest and worst nightmares of all Bond Movies. I think the torture scenes are in direct competition with ""Hostel"". But the cool thing is the brutal humor that fits perfectly in that scene... I love Bonds relationship with Vesper in this movie. Their first scene together in the train is the best conversation ever shown in a bond movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
No Bond at all,"Good Film, good camera, good directing, good Daniel, but ugly an no James Bond, not now not ever not for me!I don t want to be like this guy, and thats the difference between all the other Bonds. He is not so rough at all, see Licence to kill, or The world is not enough, my favorites!Sorry Daniel, but even Lazenby and Rowan Atkinson are more Bond than your Streetworker Bond, a Bond who stands beside the action (first scene after Pre-Title) ... Its not even an English Anti-Hero anymore!every generation has its Bond: I wait for the next... or let him die!The producers don't have any ideas anymore, let him go to Australia, to Africa, let him see the world again.Bye Bond!",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Return of the 00,"I just saw Casino Royal last night with my hard core movie crew, and we don't let anything slide. We should have our own movie review show (Sneakin In The Movies! Ha!) Anyway, we all agree. This was the best of the franchise. I was hard pressed to find one that even came close. Although for some reason not a Bond favorite by many, OHMSS to me was one of the best. Casino easily out does this.The other thing we agreed on is that this had to be the worst Bond song ever done (opening credits) but it ends there.While Pierce Brosnan had become my favorite Bond, Daniel Craig has knocked him out the box completely.Trust me, if you're reading our reviews here and haven't seen it, then don't read any further.GO SEE THIS!! NOW!!! Not only was it a thoroughly entertaining Bond experience, but the ending and his last line is worth waiting for alone.Now, let's hope that the suits in Hollywood don't stick their fingers in the next few and ""blankety-blank"" it all up.Let's keep it 00 status!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
a passable James Bond,"Casino Royale is a good surprise for its having, in addition to spectacular action scenes, a solid plot. Craig has intensity and charisma not matching Sean Connery's standards and not even getting close to them but that are quite surprising. The story too, after the last James Bond touched terrible levels of stupidity and looked like a big ad, delivers what fans of this genre expect, twists, explosions, beautiful women and cars. Some sequences leave the viewer breathless, in spite of the obvious implausibility, plus the explosive finale leaves nothing really resolved; we'll see again Daniel Craing, in my opinion much more believable than Pierce Brosnan.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Truly Outstanding,"Don't read any of this stuff. Don't ask anyone anything about the movie. It has been years since a movie kept me in suspense and I am really thankful I didn't wait to see it. I originally thought he was going to be awful as Bond. I was wrong. I think this is the best movie in the genre in the last 10 years. It is so much less than all the other bonds but at the same time so very much more. By getting rid of the endless intricate plot details and elaborate schemes they had a lot more time to flesh out the little details. I can't believe how much I liked the woman in the movie. Never has a bond flick had less to do with women but at the same time she all but makes the movie. I can't remember caring for anyone in a movie of this genre like I did for both Bond and her. All I can say is I may be going back again for the first time ever to see the same movie twice in a theater. Hopefully this was just the first of many wonderful ""shopping"" days.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally a refreshing bond film,"I don't know about most of you but I got tired of seeing the same old bond films. Gadget here, Gadget there, Explosion here, Explosion there, No plausible plot, and reliance on flashy special effects.OK bond is blonde, I can deal with that, it even rhymes. Daniel Craig does an outstanding job like I suspected. He manages a bond that is a lot closer to Ian Flemings vision(in my opinion.)For once the movie didn't try to keep my attention with a lot of cinematic tricks, it actually managed without them. Hardly any corny one-liners, although there were some.My only complaints, the poker game was a bit long winded, but I guess I should have expected that reading the title. The villain was a little week too, I don't think I would be scared of him. They could have left the whole weeping blood thing out, besides I think he had enough money to fix a slight medical problem that wouldn't be conducive to a good poker game.Anyone who is looking for a fresh bond prospective should see this film. I think you will find it entertaining. If you are looking for the same old bond I am afraid you will be disappointed, but please don't give it a bad rating just because it wasn't what you envisioned. It really was an excellent film. I am sad so many people are upset that it wasn't the same film they had seen before. I usually like new directions in films, it tends to keep them from getting boring.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Wasn't impressed with the movie or Daniel Craig.,"Sorry- unlike some of the others- I wasn't at all impressed at all with the latest Bond effort. The plot line was sketchy and spasmodic at best; the film went way too long; and Daniel Craig seemed like a pruned-out version of Kevin Costner (if your gut instinct was that this Craig didn't seem like the Bond type before the movie- then your instincts were right on target). Clive Owens would have been a much, much better Bond.Like others, I sat wondering what happened to the Q type gadgets, Miss Moneypenny, and all of the Bondian puns (I counted one- but there may have been two).Sorrrry!- but it was most definitely a thumbs down experience for me.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Simply superb..........,"This movie is just outstanding!Kind of like a ""Batman Begins"" but for the Bond franchise.The biggest reason it's such a fantastic success is because (this may sound a little weird for a bond movie) of the lack of use of crazy gadgetry that the previous films did.They emphasized more on Bond's own abilities and for once you really get to see him getting his hands dirty.Suffice to say we get to see why he was given 00 status in the 1st place.To me Daniel Craig has made the role his own.No one since the days of Sean Connery has ever made Bond look this good.I give the movie a 10 out of 10 simply because it's in a different league compared to the previous films.I've watched it once but cant wait to watch it again.Those of you who haven't better go watch it soon.Enjoy!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
back to basics,"Bond has returned and is really back to basics. The new Casino Royale (as opposed to the 1967 parody that even featured Woody Allen as Bond!) is more true to the essence of Ian Fleming's novels than ever before. It tells the 'Bond Begins' tale of how the young 007 blows his cool over the exquisite Vesper only to get it back at his own expense and be truly licensed to kill for evermore. The opening of the film is riveting and contains non-stop nail-biting action, the ending is truly moving and deeply emotional. Casino Royale is not for the faint-hearted but definitely maybe the best Bond ever. With Daniel Craig as a very tough and masculine show-all that will this time around probably also attract gay audiences the series is now really ready for the new millennium.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig enters in dominating fashion,"As another reviewer wrote, Daniel Craig is here to stay! You can always tell how the Bond franchise will do when a new actor enters as Bond. The list for good opening portrayals as Bond was only Connery and Brosnan, that is until Daniel Craig came in for the 21st film of the franchise. Craig blew me away from the beginning.The film opens with the origins of Bond. How he became a double-O and what his first mission really was. The story starts right after Bond has made his first confirmed kills. Bond is then sent on his next assignment, to stop the blood-weeping Le Chiffre, a banker who funds terrorists, from winning a high stakes card game in Montenegro so that he'll go broke and will have to surrender to MI6. Accoompanying Bond is the HM Treasury agent Vesper Lynd who is to handle money transactions for the high paying card game.When one looks at the story line, he or she would probably think, what a stupid idea for a film, a card game is the central plot? Come on. It turned out to be one of the best plotted films, from start to finish. The card game, when played, is enthralling and enjoyable. It was one of the best parts of the film seeing Bond use his brain and not his gun. In fact, the film shows us an entirely different side of Bond, a more believable and an easily acceptable side.What Connery and Brosnan were able to do to the Bond character was give him a personality of sorts. The films they acted in showed his psychological side more than just none stop action. Where Connery and Brosnan left off, Craig picks up. He shows the human side to Bond, the easy going yet determined agent. A man who can be overcome by his job. The film explores a lot with murder and how it affects a person, especially Vesper. THe film also has a lot more darker side to it, the torture scene being one of the darkest moments in a Bond film.Ion Productions has made a masterful work with Casino Royale. The problems are very minor and I can not reveal them for they may just be me. Martin Campbell proves yet again why he should be directing every Bond film from here on out. He has directed the two best Bond films since Goldfinger, GoldenEye and Casino Royale. Daniel Craig will blow you away with his acting and charisma. You will not want to move when the movie is running. Make sure you go to the bathroom and have your popcorn ready before the movie begins, cause once it starts, you won't leave that seat.4.5/5 Stars",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Casino Royale is great Bond beginning for Daniel Craig,"Since my actual birthday was near, my friend offered to pay for both my admission and concessions when seeing this movie. We both enjoyed Casino Royale, my friend saying it was one of the best. I heartily agree since it was based on the first James Bond novel and as such it stays true to Ian Fleming's version of 007. Daniel Craig makes a great impression as a Bond who gets hurt both physically and mentally (the torture scene with Le Chiffre is especially painful to watch though there's still some humor to make it palatable). I love both Judi Danch's M (""God, I miss the Cold War"") and Eva Green's Vesper Lynd (she goes from frosty to witty to playful convincingly in the space of an hour). And there are the great action set-pieces we've come to love in Bond movies involving construction sites and airports. In my opinion, Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. So, yes, I highly recommend Casino Royale.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not a Bond movie,"This new production may be a good action movie, but it is far from being a James Bond movie. You will miss all the gadgets and sophistication of the classic movies and in exchange you will get muscle and the agility of Daniel Craig. The beautiful women and fast cars are there, but the main character could easily be Jason Bourne. There is a clear intention to renew the series, but they are sacrificing the main characteristics of the classic James Bond character to do so. We all know the terrible story about the first movie called ""Casino Royale"" with Peter Sellers, with that in mind this is a master piece. By now the production seems to be doing good in the box office, let's just hope they correct their way in the next movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""The name is Bond, James Bond"" - Daniel Craig certainly earned it - this one literally with balls","Kudos to the ""Casino Royale"" 2006 production efforts, they've made this James Bond 21 worth waiting for. The film's prelude segment in b/w has Daniel Craig rather quietly there, yet the instance as trigger demands, 007 is quick without warning or a blink. He may not be as suave looking as the previous Bond's - his is rugged yet smooth, tough yet tender - the Daniel Craig way, indeed. The beginning credit roll graphic sequence is marvelously presented along with a song ""You Know My Name"" (performed by Chris Cornell) - the ingenious mix of bold color patterned shapes with miniature Craig the Bond figure delivering his moves, and animated silhouette motion/action integrated with close up of Craig's face for accents - is a visual entertaining delight.""The name is Bond, James Bond"" - yes, he has earned it, literally with all guts and balls - Daniel Craig will return 007 strong. When you get to hear John Barry's - correction: realized the original Bond theme composer is Monty Norman - popular James Bond theme music finally delivered with Craig uttering the famous line, one can be ecstatic about the whole (yes, 2 hours 24 minutes long) James Bond 21 film experience. Bravo for Monsieur Craig, and everyone involved in the project, with director Martin Campbell (""Mask of Zorro"" fame), three screenwriters with Neal Purvis & Robert Wade (together on James Bond 19 and 20) including Paul Haggis (""Crash"" 2005 fame), music by David Arnold (whose music sure accompanied and enhanced every segment and action, chase sequences, the tender moments, with very subtle strains of Norman's original James Bond theme selectively instilled). The cast: first and foremost Daniel Craig solidly portraying James Bond, unswerving Mads Mikkelsen as villain number one Le Chiffre, exquisite looking Eva Green convincingly as Vesper Lynd, Judi Dench firmly as M with unsuspecting sensibility. The plot may not be the tightest, yet as James Bond film series go, its storyline and action sequences kept within high suspense quotient. Those who play/understand poker games may very well have a good time at the casino table scenes plentiful. Besides exciting action requisite, this film is quite dramatic with deeper romantic aspects than any previous Bond outings. You might say Casino Royale 2006's Bond is more down-to-earth - a human who errs, hurts, even battered and vulnerable to death.I remember Craig from his roles in director Roger Michell's two 2004 films: the controversial ""The Mother"" (body naked already next to matured Anne Reid) and stalking shadowed ""Enduring Love"" (intensely paired with Samantha Morton, playing opposite Rhys Ifan the single-minded nemesis). There's also ""Layer Cake"" where Craig portrayed the tough and almost impregnable 'XXXX' in the directorial debut of Matthew Vaughn, producer of Guy Ritchie's crime capers. (All three are 'NFE' not for everyone's taste.)If you're interested in more behind the scenes production notes on MGM-Columbia Pictures-Eon Productions ""Casino Royale"" 2006, check on the official 'sonypictures.com' Web site: under ""About the film"" access ""production notes"" - which opens a PDF file (51-page) available for download, including the ""Vesper Martini"" ingredients defined.P.S.

"Room to improve, time to be patient","As the trailers indicate, ""Casino Royale"" is sort of a prequel to the other films, but takes place in today's world. Fair enough. There are so many incongruities and continuity errors among the films that if you try to take any sort of linear approach to the movies as an ongoing story you'll drive yourself quite mad. The fans just ignore them. After all, if Felix Lighter can toggle back and forth between races from movie to movie, we can accept that this is sort of a fresh start with a familiar character without it necessarily being negative for the franchise.This is the approach I took to the film. The character is familiar, but not exactly what we're used to. He is closer to the Connery portrayal as a ""blunt instrument"" for MI-6, but he is more raw and I think the key here is that many things that are likely being seen as negatives by many can be explained by the fact that the movie IS a sort of prequel. He doesn't speak that much. He doesn't have the groan-inducing, corny quips. He doesn't spend time lunching with his target. Those are more the marks of a polished James Bond who, as of this movie, doesn't exist yet. He gets his 00 status at the very beginning of the film. I choose to see the character differences as a Bond at the early stage of his evolution, rather than decrying them as flaws in the performance.That being said, there are still things in this film that are departures from the norm. Bond seems to rely more on the team concept at MI-6, rather than doing all the legwork until an entire Naval fleet makes its timely appearance at the end to clean things up. This sort of runs counter to him being the headstrong, ego-driven character. There were almost no gadgets to speak of, so no obligatory ""now listen up, 007"" gadget-introduction scene. It was a little more action hero, and less smooth operator, and while I think it's fine that the character is not as polished (see above), it seemed like they had similar scenes that you get from previous films, but it didn't seem like there was a great deal of thought put into how to put those scenes together, or how to transition from one to another, especially the closer to the end of the film you get. It made things seem choppy or tacked-on at times.I think that in the next few films the Bond character will evolve more into what Connery gave us, but I would probably find a new director who understands the franchise a bit more. Pretty much any director could have pulled off what was shot in this film.Overall, I encourage viewers to take this film on its own merits, rather than comparing it too much with earlier incarnations. That being said, it's better than Timothy Daulton, but will never be better than Connery. I think there is a good chance of being better than Moore, though, and maybe even the last Brosnan one. At the very least, if you are a Bond fan, you will be entertained, and any 2+ hour movie gives you more for your money.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Umm...folks?,"This IS what James Bond is. NONE of you have obviously read the books. This movie was trying its best, successfully too, to portray a James Bond as Fleming wrote him. You are comparing this movie to the other movies which is a big mistake. This is how Fleming portrayed Bond. Not as Connery, Dalton, Moore portrayed him. Open your minds, stop thinking this film's makers were trying to stay true to the previous films. They were trying to stay true to how James Bond was written. Consider how Bond is portrayed as you would compare the new Batman Returns or the newer one coming out soon to the TV series or previous Batman movies. It's how the creator of Batman wrote him. NOT the campy 70's series. NOT the Clooney, Kilmer, Keaton Batman either.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

A perfectly structured film that hits even harder 15 years later,"I don't think I fully appreciated 'Casino Royale' the first time I saw it. I knew it was a re-booted Bond with far darker tones and a much more serious edge. And I knew it was a seriously impressive movie without quite realising just how layered it was. Now, having watched the full allotment of Daniel Craig Bond films I can go back and watch this movie and appreciate just what a masterpiece it was.I think the thing that held me back most from entirely loving this film on first viewing was the poker scenes. I almost always hate poker scenes in movies. They are so over-dramatised and unrealistic that it takes away from the promotion of the game for me. Bond just having a miracle hand in a miracle spot isn't anywhere near as interesting as Bond calling down a bluff for all the chips with King high would be, but not enough audience members would be able to appreciate that, and so I understand how they get stuck in a trap.It didn't bother me as much this time around because I don't think I'd realised before just how little poker there actually is. There are only a very small amount of hands we actually get to see and each one serves a very important purpose, not just to the game, but to the plot of the movie as well.I've heard this movie described as the ""perfect three act film"", and it really is. The opening third of the film is pure Bond with all the set-up and action scenes taking place at break-neck speed. Then the second act with the poker is far more subdued (while still having some moments of immense tension). But this gives the character's of Bond and Vesper a chance to breathe and show us what they are about. And that middle sequence is why the final sequence hits so hard. Once the twist is revealed it really hits you, and that second act is the reason why.I could go on for a long time about why this movie was so good. I just had a few thoughts I wanted to put out there and I've done it now so I'll leave it at that. If you were like me and watched 'Casino Royale' when it first came out and liked it without loving it, I would implore you to go back now after having seen the full series and watch it again. It is a marvelous film. 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

But if Daniel Craig turns in another performance like this one in his next bond film (i think he's slated to do 4), we can officially pass the torch in confidence know that when Craig is done as Bond the next guy in line is screwed. Right Roger?

Go see it because you like great action movies, great acting, great one-liners (tastefuly done i might add), and great characters.

"Entertaining, original and overall incredible with some superb acting and action","Casino Royale was once my least favorite Bond movie, but now I see how wrong I was. It has everything a great Bond movie should have which is well written characters, great and suspenseful action sequences, incredible locations/sets, great writing and a great spy thriller. Martin Campbell is back in the director chair, he created Goldeneye which was a critical success and he did the same with this movie. I really liked the realistic approach of the story and fight scenes, making it more human and original in terms of the villain and the story around him. Fight sequences were top notch in how brutal and personal they were, the sound effects and choreography helped a lot at making it perfect.The ensemble cast is just perfect, with many well known actors playing the roles and having some nice cameos. The actors that stand out the most is Daniel Craig, Eva Green and Mads Mikkelsen. Mads' performance was a highlight of the movie, he's perfect as the villain as he showed here and later on in the show Hannibal, portraying a villain with such human emotion that you just want to believe he's good deep inside, nailed it without a doubt.This movie has now became one of my favorite Bond movies as everything about it was just remarkable and entertaining, perfection.

"The Name is Bond, Without Bond","The Doctors Broccoli,Wilson Campbell and Haggis reanimated the Bond-Franchise by letting the patient die and decided to have a new baby instead...Casino Royale is full of witty and insinuating dialogues and both action and Bondvs.Villain scenes that will be well remembered: briefly, it had all things old Bonds had and the last Brosnan-Bonds lacked of. At the same time, they're showing us things Bond has never done before - and which Bond was never considered to do, leaving the audience alone with the question if the guy on the screen actually is Bond, or if all the cleverly used dialogues/Action scenes should rather cover up the fact that Craig isn't handsome, tall and has slightly more charisma than Dalton.The answer is easy: this guy has almost nothing in common with Connery, Moore etc and if it was not for the famous ""Bond""-line we wouldn't recognize him. Why this is still a great movie? Because the way Craig portrays Bond totally makes sense. So does the whole movie by not taking place before the Cold War, by not showing us Q and Moneypenny: It's about a blunt instrument on his way to become a charming, smart but emotionally cold killing spy, and nothing else. This is a ""Character-Bond"" movie. And it's almost perfect, since Craig is less the traditional Bond rather than his own Bond....Whether Craig is really capable of conveying the image of the ""Bond"" we knew and loved or not, Bond 22 will show - which is necessary because once you started a character development you better bring it to an end.

"Hard hitting Bond film, Craig is fantastic!","This is an impressive Bond film, with a star-making turn by the superb Daniel Craig. Craig brings an impressive dynamism and menace to the role and eclipses almost all previous Bonds (except perhaps Connery). The film's structure is a bit uneven with three different acts. The first part is more of a traditional Bond film, with some explosive action set pieces. Specially noteworthy is the stupendous stunt work in a long, meticulously choreographed chase. Then there is a long and surprisingly involving love story with 007 falling head over heels in love. The last act is the finest with betrayal and a heartbreaking death scene. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and has some fiery exchanges with Daniel Craig. Highly recommended, although, be warned, its surprisingly violent.Overall 9/10",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig a British agent who does it the American way,"I have waited for Casino Royal since the hype of the new 007. Daniel Craig, one of British theater's most famous faces is now starring as James Bond in Casino Royal. He is the first blonde actor to play Bond. The Four of the past Bond actors are Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and Pierce Brosnan. Daniel Craig has it all, phlegmatic English, sarcasm and of course he is a womanizer.""There are dinner jackets and then there are dinner jackets; this is the latter. And I need you to look like a man who belongs at that table"" this quote is said by Eva Green the Parisian actress who was brilliant as expected. Eva green that played Sibylla in Kingdom of Heaven (2005) is a charming actress and is well fitting in her role. The director Martin Campbell is not new to produce 007 as he produced ""Golden Eye"" in 1995 however I think he is gone too far this time with all that action.At the start of the movie unexpectedly there were no girls (except for cards girls) as we used in the beginning of 007 movies; it was animation of fighting between James and his enemies shooting spades, diamonds, trifles and hearts and unfortunately this animation extended into the movie itself.The movie is about weapons and terrorism cartels in Africa and Le Chiffre, banker to the world's terrorist organizations who does not believe in god but believes in a reasonable rate of return. He launders and invests terrorism money in stakes and guarantees profits by manipulating it through terrorism attacks where MI6 link it even to September eleventh.Mr. Bond leads the itinerary from Czech to Brag, Montréal, Madagascar, Vince, Bahamas, Miami, in order to find out the terrorism cell and who funds it and he clashes with Le Chiffre a professional gambler and the conflict take another direction and the green table becomes the new battle field. A sum of 115 millions for the winner and if Mr. Le Chiffre losses then he will have no alternative but to cooperate with MI6.The movie starts in Czech by assassinating a traitor of MI6 office who sells information there; in order to clarify how the new 007 got early promotion after two professional assignations and that his 00 status is confirmed.After the first 15 minutes you will suspect that the actors using Ever Ready as they do not seems to get tired. The movie does not leave much space for your imagination. Also, it will leave you with the idea that you are watching a carton movie that everything possible and its carton character never dies. You will feel tired after the first 15 minutes of running and climbing up building equipment without a justifiable reason.Unlike other 007 movies which focusing on the new technologies this one doesn't concentrate on Mr. Bond gadgets or other gears like his watch or his car, Even the car has been smashed on the road before exploring its capabilities; this one focusing on exploring the new James physical capabilities. And as usual, James is a woman magnate and he is betrayed (or at least that what you will think) by the woman he loves and he even resigns for her.The movie over all is entertaining.Amr_Eid",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A brilliant installment to the franchise, that delivers the expected Bond qualities and goes beyond this tiring formula.","Casino Royale does not rely on abnormal situations, complex concepts/plot or having many ""close calls action scenes"", to supposedly ethrall and excite the audience. quite the contrary. Its astounding delivery of the simple situations which are presented have me questioning why it does not have a higher rating on the IMDb charts. This movie excels past the recent outings that have been ridden with silly gadgetry tangents which have no use what-so-ever other then catching the eye of the elderly who have not been exposed to such technology. Instead, we see character development (which is essential in any movie) that makes us care for the characters and raises the stakes more so than the $30 million pot.specifically, the concept is brilliant; high stake poker tournaments, stock manipulation which in extent would lead into a domino effect of a recession. This turns into a beautiful playground for Bond (Daniel Graig)and Vesper Lynd (Eva green) to run rampant in. Outstanding performances from both actors of course accompanied by a notable Giancarlo Giannini who plays Mathis an intelligent 'aid' of Bonds for the majority of the movie.Anyway, wrapping up the review. This movie is brilliant for its simplicity, the characters and its execution. It goes beyond the tiring formula which was in need of a much needed kick-start, and luckily this installment of Casino Royale has delivered this rejuvenating kick and also given the die-hard Bond fans a slither of hope for the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond Goes Dark,"If you prefer 007 as a dark brooding super spy, that lacks even the slightest bit of a sense of humor, and one without too much charm or charisma, then this is your Bond. The plot is a slow burn that never fully pays off but the elements that make the franchise familiar are mostly present albeit muted.

Ian Flemming's actual Bond...,"From Connery to Brosnan, there has been one constant; They didn't look like the written Bond. 007 was never intended a pretty boy handsome spy, but on film he translated to it.Enter Daniel Craig: I'm not saying he's not a handsome man, but he is closer to the more realistic Bond Flemming wrote 50 years ago. His gritty and not so smooth features are closer to the Hoagy 'Stardust' Carmichael the face was based upon. Add in the original Bond novel, and yes, we have a movie.Now, most of the Bonds reach near epic proportion, more than just a popcorn movie often does... this follows those footsteps. Exotic locations, little gadgetry and more roughhouse, this follows the ideals of 'Dr. No' and 'From Russia...' than let's say 'Die Another Day'.Yes, Judy Dench as M throws the time-line way out of whack for actual Bond-o-philes, but even the producers admitted they couldn't recast the role any better, so tough.Craig enters the role at just the right time, a little known face in the U.S., with several international roles, he is definitely fresh and hits home with the brooding and broken Bond, who we've seen glimpses of in established Bonds before him.Is he the best 007? Far too soon to tell. But he's off to one damn fine start.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A miserable excuse for a Bond film,"The last of the Ian Fleming novels to be produced as a film by the Broccoli family Casino Royale is - from the first shaky black and white moments to the end - a breathless and bloody run and gun of no merit. A thug-a-thon wherein the audience roots for 007, in the end, only out of habit.A series of improbable fight, torture and chase scenes strung together by an incompetent vision totally lacking any glimpse of the essence of the James Bond franchise. Soaked in blood, and stripped of everything that made a James Bond film a much anticipated spectacle.This film is everything you never went to a Bond flick for. Its DARK, its ANGST RIDDEN, it has NO STYLE OR WIT. It DOESN'T EVEN HAVE AN ARTFUL SET OF OPENING CREDITS. NO GADGETS. NO WITICISMS. Worst of all NONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN that always decorated the films. Generally speaking the film makers plainly enjoyed themselves best when they were THUMBING THEIR NOSE AT Everything YOU EXPECTED FROM A BOND FILM.Up until now James Bond did what was unpleasant but necessary for queen and country - and was uncivil only as much as necessary to secure the lofty heights of western civilization.This James Bond is precisely the sort of untrustworthy sociopath that would make the sort of willing killer no service would ever trust.Since this was is the last of the Ian Fleming novels the Brocolli team owned the rights to, they might as well as well have killed Bond at the end of the film - they've probably killed the series.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Bourne-again Bond,"I'm a big James Bond fan. I remember leaving the theater (Westbury, NY) after watching ""Casino Royale"" and being very excited about the future of Bond films.

I am a Bond purist but I do recognize that the movies need to evolve some in order to remain fresh and inviting to new audiences. They can't be making new 007 adventures only for 56 year old men (like me). I understand all of that. It's just that producer Barbara Broccoli should have more confidence in her property. She shouldn't try to imitate Bond's imitators. That said, ""Casino Royale"" is a very exciting movie. It does skip a beat here and there but overall it is quite an enjoyable ride.

Let's hope the next film puts Bond back on track,"When I first saw the trailer, I was mesmerised. The film seemed to breathe new life into the franchise and take it into an exciting direction. While for me Brosnan exemplified Bond in terms of suavity, humour and self-confidence, the films degenerated into self-parody, particularly the last Brosnan outing. While I admit I love Casino Royale, I'm beginning to believe as a Bond film it is over-hyped. Of course this film which I've seen an half-dozen times already shakes (pardon the pun) the Bond franchise up which is why I was quickly taken over by it. However, I would submit that it was more because of the novelty rather than appreciation for what it is threatening to do with Bond that influenced me. Let me make the analogy: I loved Batman as a kid and had an impressive collection. I was deeply influenced by The Dark Knight Returns because it turns the myth on its head (the forward to my leather-bound edition had a preface by Alan Moore dissecting myths such as Bond, who he describes as one with ""a contempt and hatred for women.)"" I don't accept this as part of the 'canon.' I would never have wanted Batman to become this neo-fascist vigilante, or want Superman to be little more than a covert terror weapon for the US. But I enjoyed it for the novelty sake. Just as I enjoy showing my history class ""Red Son"" where Superman grows up in the USSR and works for the man of steel- Stalin. So it is for Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is not the Bond I grew up wanting to be. Possibly he's a more fleshed-out representation of the Bond in Fleming's first book, but he lacks his background, social class (VERY important for Fleming), and patriotism. This 'Bond' is completely cynical. One would not have believed him to be bi or trilingual with a Swiss mother and educated in the most posh environment of England. What he gets out of his job is a mystery. He lacks humour, sophistication, class. He is not even a 'commander' anymore, but one who has the usual American-influenced SAS background. In other words, there is little 'English' about him. I don't blame the director, scriptwriter or producer who I think all did an admirable job of making a film I will see again and again and will look forward to the sequel. But looking at the type of films coming out of Britain, this is influenced by edgy, remorseless films such as ""London to Brighton. and even, yes, ""Layer Cake."" No doubt he will somehow be transformed over time into the character we associate with Bond. However, if we our natures are formed by the time we are five, I fail to see how he'll pick up chicks with a one-liner, know the best wine to drink with caviare, and think to straighten his tie when speeding underwater in a Q-protoboat. And none of that will change the sins committed with completely disregarding continuity. As I liked with comic books, a box would explain background by saying ""see issue 172, printed back 13 years ago"") Let's hope it's business as usual in the next instalment.

Nicely done!,"I cannot remember watching a better Bond film! Daniel Craig's acting is not as bad as I have envisioned at all! He may not be the best looking one of them lot, but he is very suitable for this role.One thing though.... A waste of a beautiful Italian actress! Guess her involvement is no longer as important as the previous Bond films where there are always a good Bond girl and a bad villain type.I like the story and the way they twitched it to reflect the present. whoever it was who made the comment on Singapore morning news about how the story's plot was mixed in the past and present obviously don't know much of the spoken English in the movie, or he wasn't paying attention to any of the conversations at all.Definitely a very good ""restart"" of the Bond franchise.

Best Bond yet? Definitely.,"Don't let anyone tell you that Daniel Craig isn't James Bond. Not only is he a brilliant, believable 007 but could well be the best yet if Casino Royale is anything to go by.Out go the pantomime villains and idiosyncratic henchmen, out go the laser-beam-in-the-watch-/invisible-car gimmicky gadgets that we've come to expect from Bond (but don't necessarily need) and in it's place we have a rock hard, fit, highly trained assassin who you can really believe and who relies on his training, wits, strength, fighting skills and firepower. Craig does most of his own stunts and is awesome. You'd never see the likes of Connery, Moore or Brosnan doing stuff like this.There are some incredible action set pieces...including a post credits chase across a construction site and a couple of very high cranes incorporating that most breath taking of physical skills 'free running'... some wince inducing fights and just when I thought it was all over..a twist I never saw coming.The corny puns are kept to a minimum but there are some great one liners all the same one of my favourites being Bond's response when asked if he wants his Vodka Martini shaken or stirred? He may be blond..he may have a prison hair cut but by Christ he's a tough bastard and fights like no Bond I've seen before.As long as they (the producers) don't think that once Craig's been accepted by the public and critically acclaimed they can bring back all the gadgets and corny lines for the next one I think Craig will be excellent.All the way through the film we hear on the soundtrack just little hints at the Bond theme without it actually being played. But by the time Craig actually says the immortal line 'The name's Bond...James Bond' and Monty Berman's unmistakable theme kicks in everyone in the cinema already knew.. he IS Bond.I shall definitely be buying this when it comes out on DVD..and I have never bought a Bond film before....it's THAT good!!

Great movie but I think they shouldn't have used Daniel Craig,Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie.Wasn't really bond like because it was a lot more explosions and blunt fighting and not like finesse and sneaking around type stuff that bond usually does. I really think that Clive Owen would have been a better for a more classic bond movie. Daniel Craig is much better action solid crazy killer type. It was a great performance for the actor. A stepping stone into a truly fantastic career.I liked a classic bond theme much better because it showed that Americans could like a movie that wasn't just all explosions and craziness(not that that isn't great For example please see Live Free or Die Hard) But thats OK.

"Visually exhilarating, but there is something missing","Don't get me wrong I really like James Bond, after seeing the superb From Russia With Love with Sean Connery(my personal favourite Bond), and I really wanted to see Casino Royale as it promised to be exhilarating and exciting. After seeing it for myself, I thought exhilarating yes in terms of visuals but it isn't quite exciting enough.Starting off with the good things are that chiefly the cinematography, stunts, effects, editing and scenery are absolutely incredible. Also the sound is very impressive, the first action sequence was utterly mind blowing thanks to the visuals and the sound effects. The score by David Arnold is also good and authentic enough, it isn't John Barry, but it has some rousing themes. Mads Mikkelsen makes a brooding and intense Le Chiffre, while Eva Green is stunning and poised as the sexy Vesper Lynd and Judi Dench the brilliant actress she is is a suitably frustrated M.However, there are some components I didn't like so much; I found that the pacing was very uneven here, after the first action sequence, there are some parts that are fairly pedestrian. Also I wasn't particularly particularly taken with the theme song, it was typical Bond, but it was also so-so. That said though, it is better than the one Madonna sang, what was that song again? Daniel Craig I had mixed feelings about, while he had the intensity behind his beautiful eyes, while he had the body and while he had the grit and athleticism, what he didn't quite have was the charisma. Some of the story is uneven as well, there are some nice, well-constructed parts but there were others that felt unnecessary and not quite so well thought out, the torture scene especially. In terms of dialogue, some of the exchanges between Bond and Vesper Lynd are delicious and seductive, but the ones with Le Chiffre weren't quite so good, some of it didn't have the spirit of Bond.Overall, not the best Bond in my opinion, but it is not unwatchable or anything. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Daniel Craig is the Bond We Deserve,"As good a reimagining as a sixties action hero could dream of, Casino Royale brings Bond into the modern world as a very grounded, very believable and very intense action thriller.

A Bond for Adults,"Casino Royale shows us what Bond can be when filmmakers don't pander to the lowest common dominator of the viewing public.This is a serious story, and thankfully gone in this film are the stupid, insulting bimbos, (Miss Goodnight) the loony gadgets (disappearing ""stealth"" cars), the insipid villains, (Drax, Jaws) and best of all a mugging, joking, wisecracking Bond (thank you Mr. Moore for nearly killing the whole thing off).The films sticks fairly close to the novel, and Craig's image hits just the right note as a Bond who at some level is very much bothered not by what he has to do, but the awareness of what it might do to him.Refreshing too is the fact that the film treats its audience as adults rather than a collection of overgrown children, though judging from some of the trite reviews here, this adult version of Bond is lost on some.Looking forward to the next entry in the series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Starts with a bang, ends with a whimper; A different 007 indeed","After watching Casino Royale, one cannot escape the conclusion that for better or worse, Daniel Craig is a new kind of Bond, and entirely different from the one Pierce Brosnan portrayed in his 4 films as 007. Craig is a grittier, darker, more arrogant Bond. He plays his role very seriously and lacks some of the self aware irony that Brosnan brought with him to the part. While the latter had lots of charm and was reminiscent of nostalgic 1950's actors, the new Bond represents a 21st century type of masculinity. He's a man of few words, pumped up from head to toe (girls will be drooling all over this guy), and always believes he knows what to do best, even when his supervisor's suggest otherwise. He's pretty similar to TV's Jack Bauer from the hit series ""24"" for that matter, although what Craig lacks in brain and wit (compared to Bauer), Bauer lacks in body building (compared to the new Bond).This being said, I think Casino Royale was afraid of really letting this new Bond character evolve into the dark hero he could have been. Instead, we get a half baked version of numerous action heroes we've already seen before. The movie itself is much like it's main character - rather indecisive of where it's going and what it wants to do upon getting there.Clocking in at a ridiculously long 144 minutes, the film jump starts with one of the more intense action sequences seen on the silver screen in recent years. Bond chases an African arm smuggler halfway through an African marketplace, into a construction site and onto a foreign embassy. Both guys make insane leaps from one place to the other, hang onto construction equipment while suspended in the air, while explosions that demand suspension of disbelief ensue. This top notch (yet cheesy) action continues through several sequences that start off the film with a bang, each one somewhat calmer than the previous one. Through the African arm smuggler, Bond eventually reaches a French millionaire who benefits financially from various terror acts (this is the first Bond that speaks openly about 9/11 and laughs off the Cold War era). It is during a Casino game that will determine the future of the terror fonds that the film is supposed to peak. However, it just keeps winding down even more-so from there on out. Craig isn't too strong when it comes to the dramatic sequences, and the only dramatic lead that saves some grace is Eva Green (The Dreamers, Kingdom of Heaven), that only appears towards the end of the first 1/3 of the film.To sum it all up, Casino Royale could have been much better had the rest of the movie looked or felt like the beginning. It had all the right ingredients and heaps of potential, both regarding Craig as well as regarding the meanings through which the plot line unfolded in front of the viewer. However, the over-longed romantic scenes, the winding down of the plot and the lackluster climax couldn't compensate for a strange new Bond, which might just take some time getting used to. Also, the lack of Q and his mechanical gizmos, for one, was also somewhat disappointing. There's just so much an audience will be willing to bare.I gave it a 5 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Bond Since Goldfinger,"Got your attention?I enjoyed the Moore films when I was a kid, and was impressed with the competence of Golden Eye when it came out, but for me, the real Bond movies were the first three, with From Russia With Love the top of the list. Goldfinger created a more fanciful style of Bond film which took over the franchise. Now, I'm not saying that was a bad thing. 007 becoming campy is what kept it alive for so many years. It's just bracing to see this film return to the vibe you get from reading Fleming's actual work. This is what CR has.I read the book, which was the first ever novel, last summer. the key to the success of the film goes beyond how good Craig is, and how he lifts the game of everybody around him ( look at how interested Dame Judy Dench seems all of a sudden). It's how the filmmakers have expanded the novel into exciting 007 spectacle (with the construction site chase at the top and the collapsing Venice building at the end super effective), without betraying the powerful, and moody tale that Fleming was trying to tell when he introduced the character. all the emotional beats of the book are retained, even in flashy new surroundings. And Eva Green is pretty fab, too.It's 20 minutes too long, but it's ballsy, the way this film wants wants it all...the action and the drama. they come close to pushing their luck a dozen times, but it all works out pretty damn well. In the end, it takes the same risks that OHMSS took, but in a far more successful manner.I'm not a real action or spy movie fanatic, so my 8 really is a 10 for the genre.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The best Bond film. Poker, action and a love story.","This is my first 10 for a film I only saw months ago. I have always liked Bond films but I was just getting bored of seeing the same thing, and not feeling like Bond himself had evolved as a character. Funnily enough, the film that stands as a prequel to all others is the one where we see character development and emotion. For once we get to see into Bond's way of thinking and why in later film's he is such a player and doesn't ever seem to settle down with a nice lady. Daniel Craig impressed me way beyond my expectations. I wasn't expecting him to have the charisma of Sean Connery but not only does he show that but he also opens the dimensions of Bond to another level. We see the rebellious side of Bond much more in this film and there is also such a contrast of extremes (the softer side and the darker, more sinister side). The opening action sequence is fantastic with the free runner and it is scenes like this that make the action much more interesting. Other Bond films rely on gadgets way too much and this film works so well without them. The poker scenes are brilliant and show Bond's competitive side and his vulnerability as Poker is essentially a game of luck as you can't always rely on tells as your opponent can be exceptionally good at bluffing, or pretending to bluff (a double-bluff). The love story pulled me in, which was a surprise. The relationship that grows between Daniel Craig and Eva Green's characters is absorbing and realistic and it makes the climax of the film have such a bigger impact. Overall, this film blew me away and deserves a place in the top 250 above films like Kill Bill Vol. 2, which is nowhere near as good as this film. I have seen Quantum of Solace recently too and Casino Royale blows it out the water. I believe it is the definitive Bond film and I hope that what comes after Quantum of Solace has the heart and depth of Casino Royale, as Quantum of Solace was made purely to show off the action sequences, which were good, but it lacked in meaning, logic and emotion.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What a start for Daniel Craig!,"I am thoroughly enjoying the 'reboot' for Bond here, I love the more grounded take on him, the emphasis on him being a bit green because he's not even a 00 at the start of the movie, the way they show that he's actually quite fallible and can genuinely fall in love. Of course, we kinda know Bond already so we know that last can't actually, well, last. But Daniel Craig still does a fantastic job in the role, and may even give Dalton and Brosnan a bit of competition for the spot of my favourite Bond.Mads Mikkelsen, similarly, is incredible as Le Chiffre and manages to play both threatening AND fearful amazingly well. His performance may even be my favourite of ALL Bond villains ever, including Sophie Marceau's Elektra King. Also, Dame Judi Dench continues to show why she's such a highly respected actor as she elevates her already-stellar performance of M from previous movies to new heights here, adding in the slightest touch of softness towards Bond.And then there's Eva Green, showing once again that not only is she ALWAYS incredibly beautiful, but also an extremely compelling performer, instantly becoming my favourite Bond Girl ever.I hope everyone who doubted that Daniel Craig could be more than just ""James Blonde"", and everyone who doubted that this would be a great Bond movie, enjoyed their Humble Pie as much as I enjoyed this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
this rebirth was necessary,"Last year, when Daniel Craig has won the race of becoming the new Bond, a huge campaign has been started with the intention just to discredit Craig. People said he's blonde, people said he's a mollycoddle, they created internet forums and impended to boycott ""Casino Royale"".Let's see what has happened in the meantime. First Sir Sean Connery himself stated to believe, Daniel Craig could become one of the best James Bond performers ever. Now the movie has been released in the movie theaters, already with a lot of success. Daniel Craig is still blonde, but he's everything else then a mollycoddle. He's as muscular as Arnie Schwarzenegger in his best times and can suffer as much pain as Bruce ""McLane"" Willis in his legendary Die Hard performances.I've read some comments from Bond Fans, who still were extremely disappointed. They're missing all the gadgets, and they miss Q and Moneypenny, everything they got used to during the last 40 years or even more. Come on guys, be honest. All these things started to bore a lot of viewers. Always these ridiculous exploding pencils, these watches with integrated fax station and whatsoever, it was cool in the 60s, 70s and 80s, and maybe, with a lot of good will, it has still been cool in the middle of 90s, but after Goldeneye it started to annoy me, and surely it also annoyed many more of us. Also these jingoistic jokes, these will-less babes, the time has come to do something to rescue James Bond. Otherwise the end of the great Bond era could have been near.So things have been changed. No funny gadgets, but real and tough action, no babes any more, but one fantastic, attractive, drop-dead gorgeous and intelligent Bond girl, no fights without pain, no desperadoes who can destroy the world by clicking one switch, but therefore a real bad and evil guy.This movie has become the successful rebirth of a legend, which was about to die off. We all should be glad about this development.And even people, who just want to watch an entertaining good movie: go to see Casino Royale, it's worth it......",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Finally an approach to classic Bond movies,"When i went to see this movie, i did not really know what to expect! Afer having seen the last Bond movies, i was not expecting much, only a another ""Bond"" movie, overloaded with very exaggerated scenes.I was totally surprised by this movie! It is so much different from the last, the Pierce Brosnan movies. It is not a perfect, flawless Bond movie, but still it is a change towards the original James Bond essence.This movie is about James Bond turning into Double 0 agent and I believe, that Daniel Craig accomplished this takes very well. It is not the same James Bond known form the other movies, i think he lacks a certain charm and his sarcastic humor. But that is no problem, as i see this as an evolution of his character and these are only supposed to be his first steps as a double 0 agent. The action scenes are great, and convincing; they fit perfectly in the Bond reality and are not as unrealistic as they have been lately( especially in : Die another day)What I really did not enjoy was the Sony product placement. A Sony mp3-player, several Sonyericsson cell-phones, a Sony Vaio laptop and a Sony camera have their appear in the movie way too much. I was also missing Q, who wasn't in the movie.But the rest was just great: Exotic locations, as well as classic Bond sceneries in Europe, the casinos, two nice Aston Martins...",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A breath of fresh air for action movies.,"Saw Casino Royale at a friend's house on DVD. We were chilling, asked me what movie I'd like to see out of the selection he had, told him the type of movies I like, Casino Royale came up, he convinced me I'd like it, so that's what we watched. Can't say I'm a Bond movie fan. He always wins, always gets the girl, never gets hurt, just not realistic to me. My friend said I wouldn't be disappointed with this movie and he was right. It's a very good action movie. A breath of fresh air actually because they don't really make many action flicks anymore. Yes, he got the girl but it made sense. Yes, he won in the end but almost died in the process. Yes, he lived despite all the conflict and fighting but he took a beating throughout the whole movie and it was believable to a greater extent than previous Bond movies. And they didn't even have to go Rated R with it. Amazing! It's a visual action feast with a good plot. You'll be fully engaged in this from start to finish because the action scenes are long. Highly entertaining and worth watching on a proper TV with proper sound if you can make that happen.The plot flows over right into Quantum of Solace; the Bond movie compared to The Bourne Ultimatum. I don't know where these comparisons came from but it's all complete and total crap. The shaky camera during certain action and fight scenes is evident but that's where the similarities end. While Bourne Ultimatum is one of the better action flicks to ever come down the pike, Solace totally sucks. Don't know how that ball got dropped, especially since the story continues directly from the end of Casino with the same writers. Solace isn't worth the time or money. It reminds me more of the Bond style of movies that I hate and even reminds me of that totally unrealistic schlock-fest called Transporter 2. Stay away from Solace but opt in for Casino Royale. Solace gets a 4, Casino gets a solid 8.Don't get me wrong. Daniel Craig is an excellent Bond. He's grimy, kills people, steals cars, picks pockets, blows things up, trespasses, disrespects corpses, breaks and enters, burgles, and the list goes on and on. He's more like a villain than a hero. But that's what makes his version of the character more believable than the others who are way too high and mighty British. Craig is more of a street version and that's what I like in my spies. I'm just hoping the next Bond flick doesn't follow Solace's suit. Meaning I hope the right director hops on board. You can't go wrong with Casino Royale. It's awesome.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Could have been one of the best.,"CASINO ROYALE could easily have been one of the best Bonds in the series. It was great to see a Bond that was a throwback to the classic Connery films. The film is full of incredible action sequences, good dialogue, locations, the darker mood is terrific, and the characters and the women are great too.It was well filmed and directed, and the casting was perfect, except for James Bond. Daniel Craig is a good actor and I have enjoyed him in other films, but he is not James Bond. He carries himself very well in the action sequences, but he has no charisma, and he lacks the screen presence of the previous Bonds, even when he seems to be copying Connery's style of line delivery. He comes off very wooden in his performance. He kind of looks like Steve McQueen's unattractive cousin, not James Bond!The J.B is supposed to stand for James Bond, not Jason Bourne (or Jack Bauer either)! It used to be other spy films copied the Bond films. Now the Bonds appear to be copying the Bourne films. Craig would make a very good Bourne.Too bad, as this film would have been fantastic with the right actor as Bond. I also didn't like the whole reboot idea of the series. It means that all the other missions never took place! If the film was to be a reboot and follow the Fleming book, why is Judi Dench, a hold over from previous Bonds films, in it? M was a man in the Fleming books, and having her there makes the whole reboot thing confusing. The title song is also very forgettable.To me, Connery was the one true Bond. Brosnan and Lazenby were very good too. Roger Moore was very Saintly in his Bond Comedies, and Timothy Dalton was the worst. I put Craig a cut above Dalton, but I can only hope that the producers come to their senses and replace him as Bond as soon as possible.I have read all the books and been a fan of the series since the beginning, and I did like the direction this film took getting away from the over the top situations and gadgets, but surely there is a better choice for Bond than Craig. As a Bond fan I hope they can make a change before the next film, as he didn't work for me. The adds say the critics are raving, it will make you forget all the other Bonds! I don't think anyone will ever forget Connery, and the critics are truly raving to even suggest it!Aside from Craig and the reboot, I thought it was a very good film. I take 1 point off for the whole reboot idea, and 2 points off for Craig.007 out of 10!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Pretty Good,"Firstly I must say that this film has been greatly over-hyped. But having said that it is very entertaining. The plot is highly unlikely and very far fetched but then which Bond film isn't? The difference here is the lazy charm and cold violence of 007. We must not forget that Bond is an assassin (you don't get a licence to kill for nothing) and lately he has been reduced to a a swarve, middle aged commando. Craig makes him something human, direct and brutal. He is slightly cold but not without a humorous streak - usually at his own expense. Very hard to judge him as a new Bond - because he is so unlike any previous Bond. But the fight scenes, chases and general pace keep up the interest. It's a good escape for 2 hours. It would actually be an interesting exercise to re-visit the original books and re-make them as Fleming wrote them. With today's technology we could even set them in the fifties and sixties - now that would be a challenge! - and Craig is probably the man to carry it off,",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Recharged,"Talk about a recharged the series!!!!! Casino Royale brings James Bond back to life, with severe density, extreme darkness, and even a strong reprisal for a franchise that had unnecessarily strayed from its origins.All the human qualities that were lost within the former super suave and seemingly immortal 007, is now given new meaning with Daniel Craig's James Bond. He is exactly what the character is suppose to be - brooding and frightening as any true killer who is ""licensed to kill""should be. James Bond finally has a deep background, a significant past, and exact reasons for why he does what he does. With Casino Royale, the franchise series seems to no longer just an excuse to give the movie going audience pointless and mindless thrilling action rushs with no reason at all. Not to worry of course because action scenes, though not as many as the older films, are nevertheless just as exhilarating. This would all not have been possible and been utterly chaotic, if not for the amazing direction and oversight from Martin Campbell. The great thing is that all the tongue and cheek humor is still so prevalent in many, many scenes and the screenplay is so very strong.We all know it is going to be a sequel and there is no issue about it, but things have, and will continue to adapt and change for the new world order Bond. In this case, the change looks bloody good in Daniel Craig.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Over-egged the pudding,"This is a classic example of how more is less. There are some fantastic stunts. There are some great characters, and great lines, great cars and villains. However each one seems underused, just so that more can be fitted in. In my opinion this is a movie which would be much better with 20% less of everything including stunts, characters and plot twists. 20% shorter running time would be much better too. A bond movie is a light entertainment and should not go over 100 minutes. There are fully four scenes of card play. Now I understand the rules of Texas hold-em and I found them boring and utterly predictable. Someone who doesn't know the rules, probably 90% of the audience, would only be confused. Two or three card scenes are enough.I like a movie with twists, as long as they are clever and delivered like a good punchline. However, the denouement here is rushed and jerky.Lovely opening credits, but where are the scanty-clad dancing girls? I missed them.Also there are some truly blatant product-placements. e.g.Bond: I already brought my tux.Bond-girl: But this is OscarDe-La-Renta!Bond: Its tailored!Bond-girl: I sized you up the minute I saw you(Bond tries on tux, admires self in mirror)Why don't they just have an ad-break it would be more honest!It is refreshing of the directors to make a Bond movie without relying on gadgets and special effects. It is just that this pudding has too many eggs and falls flat for me. Entertaining for the opening sequence and some of the dialogue. Annoying elsewhere.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY - the worst Bond movie ever made,"I should have known how bad it was going to be by the opening credits. Normally they are a sight for sore eyes - fabulous music made by top artists (Madonna, Duran Duran, etc.) - gorgeous writhing women and erotic, interesting sequences - and this just the opening credits. None of that in this James Bond - the worst opening credits ever - images of cards (hearts, spades, diamonds and clubs) everywhere and that was it - not to mention the lousy music - but that was the tip of the iceberg. James Bond normally means amazing gadgets (cars that can disappear with invisibility shields, cars that turn into planes or submarines, wristwatches that double as satellite transmitters or tracking devices or detonators, pens that are miniature explosives, or containing poisoning gas etc. In Casino Royale, the most exciting gadget was a portable defibrillator - there were NO other gadgets in the ENTIRE movie (OK, there were cellphones and laptops, but nothing else.) Forget that the story itself was overly contrived and ridiculously hard to follow, the movie was two and a half hours long with one entire hour dedicated to them sitting in the Salon Prive of a casino playing high stakes poker, staring at each other and raising the stakes. Who wants to see that in a James Bond movie!!!? For goodness sake,we expect our James Bond to perform impossible stunts, to attract and seduce beautiful woman after beautiful woman - THAT'S the James Bond we all know - suave, debonair, sophisticated, a man of mystery, intriguing, with a presence - able to deliver one-liners that pack a punch, reducing the audience to chuckles - clever, witty repartee. There wasn't ONE single ""James BOnd"" type scene in the entire movie. It wasn't even a good action flick! It was so long and so boring! The only scene worth watching was towards the beginning when James is running after a man in Madagascar - what an athlete this man is (not James, the man on the run) - doing ""free running"" - running up walls, leaping over objects, shimmying up cranes - TRULY the star of the entire movie and the only thing worth seeing. The rest of the movie was dismal, pathetic, boring, and stupid. They never explained what ""Ellipsis"" meant - yet that apparently was the word seen on all cellphones.Ava Green acted like a wooden block,There was absolutely no chemistry between them and frankly, zero charisma. James Bond plots are supposed to be impossible - with ""baddies"" trying to take over the world but foiled by 007 - keeping us on the edge and filling the screen with action - this plot was just silly, contrived, long, non-sensical, overly complicated and completely non-James Bond.Even compared to a Mission Impossible type of film, it was appalling - What about the unnecessary but brutal torture scene? That's not the kind of movie I'd want my family to see and yet James Bond is supposed to be a family film - for everyone to see - it really was unnecessary and ugly and what was the point behind it? Nope - not the James Bond we know and love and my advice is, give it a miss.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Superb,"Having seen Layer Cake a few years back I had high hopes that Daniel Craig could do very well as Bond - and I wasn't disappointed.The movie isn't exactly dark, but does move nicely away from the cheesefest that was taking over the later Brosnan flicks. (Sorry John Cleese, the Black Knight does indeed always triumph, but Q was a tad painful.) Craig, and the supporting cast, do a fantastic job in Casino Royale at not only making this one of the better Bond films, but one of the better films of the year in its own right.A few negatives, no naked silhouettes in the title music. Just seemed wrong without them somehow, although the replacement is good.

007 Royale,"Daniel Craig's debut as Bond and its all change from the last, only Judi Dench remains, it's like when Brosnan took over, they had great casts during Brosnan's tenure, and it seems they've done it again? It's a retro change though, Casino Royale is the first Ian Fleming book, and they have made this film the same, with Bond just starting as a 00 agent, they even made the intro in Black & White as if it is in a time before colour film, so it's a prequel but made in a modern era, so conflicting with the retro feel and Judi Dench is in the role of M as she was in the last so not making it a retro fit. Felix Leiter is in it as well, but a black feller acting the part, there is no chance a black man could be a leading CIA officer in the fifties/early sixties, so that makes it a strange mix.But nevertheless it is a great film, lots of drama and intrigue, more gritty, there are a few quips, but not silly ones, not much in gadgets, and more on human interaction and dialogue, a lot more, the action scenes are good when they are there, its very well directed and excellent photography, with great scenery at Lake Como, sorry - Montenegro, yeah they faked the locations, only Venice, London and the Bahamas was authentic, Miami, Uganda, Madagascar and Montenegro were all filmed elsewhere. The music was ok, as was the title song.The acting is top notch, everyone is good, particularly Craig, Mikkelson, Dench and Green and despite my criticism of Felix Leiter being the wrong colour, Jeffery White acted a lot better than any before. And a blast from the past, Tsai Chin who played Bond Girl Ling in 'You Only Live Twice' is back, at the card tables, with a 39 year gap.Most of the Bond themes are gone, even the silhouette titles have changed to animation, however we do have a big casino scene and helicopters, the crime organisation is known as Quantum but is really SPECTRE. But no Q or Moneypenny, it is not supposed to have any gadgets, but Bond did have a miniature defibrillator.
Cars:- Aston Martin DB5, Aston Martin DBS can it get any better, and now we know how Bond got his first Aston martin, he won it off a baddie in a game of cards, and also how he discovered his Vodka Martini.
No henchmen in this, and only one Bond Girl, no.63 Vesper Lynd played by Eva Green (French) she is not the most beautiful but certainly the most passionate. Another prominent woman was Solange played by Caterina Murino (Sardinia) bond was trying to seduce her to get information but when he got what he wanted he left before the sex, so not a Bond Girl, but more beautiful than Vesper.Despite the mixed retro/modern fix and false locations it is still a great film, on a par with Goldfinger, On Her Majesty's Secret Service and Goldeneye, I would have given it a 10 if it wasn't for the false locations and confusing retro/modern angle.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Casino Royale won't tell you because in this movie, Bond is already Bond and all they add to him is his 007. This movie could have used a more developed pre-007, pre-MI6 Bond story. A better original score, since this one is i believe, the worst James Bond score ever. More poker scenes; since Texas hold'em is so popular these days why not, if done correctly. More Bondness : exaggeration is the way of Bond movies; exaggeration in a Bond movie is always tolerated because it's in a Bond movie, it's part of the tradition.

I just wish that Clooney had been cast as Bond,"Yes, this is a fine movie, but to me, Craig is simply NOT believable as James Bond. I mean, blonde Bond?!? Come on! Personally, I think George Clooney was born to the role (yet, I've NO idea whatsoever if the role was offered to him or if he'd even be interested in playing it). Clooney would be the perfect blend of Sean Connery's rugged yet sophisticated manner, coupled with Roger Moore's good looks (yes, I prefer the old school Bond, although Pierce Brosnan was perfectly likable as 007). I will always watch the Bond films, regardless of who plays the role; it's just that I'd possess a whole lot more enthusiasm for the film if I agreed with the casting choice for our favorite Bollinger sipping, martini swilling secret agent.

The bond song ain't great either, despite having Chris Cornell singing it (ex Soundgarden and Audioslave)OK I'll be fair - the first 80 mins are pretty good - then it's seems that the exec producer took over the script writing and decided to write another film and a lame (so very lame) love interest - obviously deciding that they had to make some type of chick flick appeal.

21st Century Bond,"I began reading Fleming's Bond series in 1959 when I was 14 and could not wait until the next book was released. I read them more or less in order, beginning with Casino Royale, written in 1953. ""Dr. No"" and ""From Russia with Love"" were adequate representations of the novels and Connery was an excellent choice for Bond. ""Goldfinger"" was a thrill ride (I was 18 when it was released). ""Thunderball"" moved back towards adequate.When Roger Moore (known around the trade as a 'clothes horse')appeared, I dropped out and didn't really get back into enjoying Bond until Pierce Brosnon reclaimed some of the aloof and sexy mysteriousness of Connery's and Fleming's original.Still, all the Bonds prior to Craig were - in my mind - a little too polished and sophisticated, as if they had know luxury all their lives. Fleming's Bond was from a scruffier beginning, had a harder edge, and had discovered on his own, the luxuries he enjoyed. Craig's extemporaneous drink order at the casino table was Fleming's idea of who Bond is. The drink was made up on the spot, but Bond said later in the film, he liked it. Craig, except for a nit about hair color, is as close to my idea of Fleming's Bond as any to-date.The music was the usual over-the-top - I wish they'd just stay with the background theme. As for the plot... well, beyond the early films in the series, Bond directors have never shown much interest in the actual Fleming plots and why should they start now? The original post WWII plots do need some revamping in light of changing world events and trends, but the basic Fleming was good enough for the books and should I think - if ever done - would make pretty good Bond movies. I was grateful for the dispatch of Q and the hackneyed, unrealistic tools of the trade from past Bond films. This one had a few gadgets but mostly real technology.As Bond goes into the future, lets hope he gets back to the basics and entertains more.At a dinner party the day after we saw the film, my other half and her lady friends were talking in conspiratorial tones over dessert about the ""new Bond"" and his wonderful physique.Let's hope Craig stays around for a while as a Bond for the new century.

I developed a BOND with this movie,"Okay, that was bad. This movie, however, was most definitely not! I'm saying this as a guy who had never seen a Bond film before - sue me.

First thing I said when I was told Daniel Craig was in this film? ""Who's Daniel Craig?"" Nevertheless, he was fantastic in this film. Eva Green, as well, was very good (I had never heard of her), as was most of the cast. Mads Mikkelsen...funny name, great actor.The best thing about this film, in my opinion, is the TENSION.

The action scenes were also very well done.I thought it was a great film, but I did have some minor issues that kept me from giving it a 10/10. I thought the pacing was strange - it was very good pacing, the film went along at a good pace. However, it was just a little odd, and I questioned the needs for certain scenes. I also thought a few certain moments happened a bit too fast and abruptly, but perhaps that was the style of this film.However, definitely go see it - not if you like action films, or if you like Bond films, but if you like movies in general!

Shaken or stirred - can you tell the difference . . .,"Spy movies owe a lot to James Bond. If not inventing them, he helped make the genre what it is today. So does Casino Royale, adapted from the first of the original novels, breathe new life into spy movies or just give us more of the same?Before the opening credits, we see a new approach with a gritty, realistic fist fight shot entirely in black and white. Then cut to rain-sodden Uganda where some Large Amounts of Money are changing hands. Cut again to colourful Madagascar where Bond gets involved in a chase while locals bet on a snake-and-raccoon fight. A myriad of visual contrasts; a dizzying pace; and stunts that look like they hurt. It all holds much promise even before the plot enters to make sense of it all.The big change, of course, is the new Bond. Not only a new actor (Daniel Craig) but a whole new style. Gone is the debonair, slightly camp, 007. Welcome bruised and bashed, a man's man, an intelligent fighting machine. Love interest Vesper later calls him a 'former SAS type'. This is the Bond before qualifying to 00 status, more Marine than manicure.The original book was set in the Cold War era. Predictably, this has been updated to fighting a terrorist network and people who bankroll them. But the main story in a way is Bond's coming-of-age - how he lets go of his ego and learns not to trust anyone, even the most trustworthy. He prefers women who are married - to keep things simple - but in the lovely Vesper (Eva Green) he meets his match. Not only seductively alluring, she carries as much clout as he does (holding the purse-strings for the Treasury) and challenges him as an intellectual equal. Vesper has no intention of becoming his 'disposable asset'.Craig seems to do everything right. His personality seems close to the author's original concept, he has worked very hard to live up to the part, and his physique and sexual charisma exceed expectation. Likewise, Eva Green is a great improvement on the barbie-doll types usually inhabiting Bond movies. But they both suffer from a singular flaw: neither exude, for me, any memorable star appeal. While Connery, and to an extent Moore and Brosnan, lit up a stage and became the face you couldn't forget, Craig simply looks like an above-average crime actor. Green works the part and has some reputable lip-trembles, but most of the classic lines abounding in the script are simply recited. Mads Mikkelsen, as the evil Le Chiffre, has the most unforgettable features, yet even he does not achieve the power of, say, Philip Seymour Hoffman in the not dissimilar Mission Impossible III. The film is still worth seeing by fans, or anyone wanting standard entertainment of this kind. The plot is better than average and fairly faithful to the book. Judi Dench is convincing as M (a character she has played many times). We get to see the new Aston Martin DBS (in a special colour, Casino Ice, not available until 2007) alongside the Bond favourite Aston Martin DB5. Ivana Milicevic, who plays Le Chiffre's girlfriend, has stunning outfits by Versace and Roberto Cavalli; and there's an admirable attention to real stunts over CGI. But in terms of fresh life, Casino Royale is a safe $100M investment rather than anything radically new. In a scene near the end, Bond is giving artificial resuscitation - not very well apparently, as the drowning victim's chest doesn't move. The producers seem similarly not to have taken any chances on the well-preserved body of Bond stories other than adding superficial improvements.Bond is largely a fantasy character, but this attempt at 'realism' made me wonder, does anyone in 2006 really believe the Secret Service are that efficient any more?? After losing at cards, Bond orders a Vodka Martini. ""Shaken or stirred?"" the bartender asks. Bond replies, ""Do I look like a give a damn?"" Likewise, a shot of Bond at the box office is usually a pleasant experience, but this film left me past worrying whether it was shaken, stirred or simply made earlier.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

James Bond,"I believe Daniel Craig looks more like the villain of the film rather than the hero.However, he brings an excellent grittiness to the role that has been missing since Sean Conerry's outings as Bond.I think that they need to go back to the original formula with gadgets etc. but don't let these dictate the plot, they should simply help Bond escape from tricky situations.I also believe that a male M is required to spark a new dynamic between Bond and his superiors.

SEE the MOVIE - READ the BOOK!,"Most of the positive reviews for this movie on this site have shown considerable savvy as to just what the heck this movie is all about; perhaps the negative reviews should just be ignored. Yet as a long time fan of the novels of Ian Fleming, I got to say that the comments from those who didn't like this film because it lacks ""gadgets""; or because it lacks ""jokes""; or because it lacks ""Miss Moneypenny""; or simply because it lacks any stick-of-wood prop-up like Roger Moore - These remarks leave me bewildered and a little angry. Since these reviewers can write, I must assume they're literate - haven't they actually read a book at least once in their lives? Well, if they ever decide to give that a try, I suggest they start with Ian Fleming's first James Bond novel, ""Casino Royale"" (1953) - a James Bond story without ""gadgets""; without cheap humor at the expense of its characters; without Miss Moneypenny; and with a world-weary British agent who happens to be very human and can actually get caught off-guard, and does.And I am stunned that the reviewers of whom I write complain about the wicker-chair torture scene - which not only comes straight out of the novel, but which was so controversial at the time that it first attracted readers of suspense novels to the book, just to see what the hub-bub was about. Which of course made a small fortune for Fleming and his publishers. In other words, without this scene, no further novels; without the novels, no James Bond, no James Bond films, no, not even Roger Moore (who first achieved fame playing Lesliem Charteris' ""The Saint"", as re-written for TV to appeal to fans of - James Bond novels).In other words, everything those who pan this film complain as ""not James Bond"" IS James Bond, and everything they lament as missing from a ""James Bond"" movie is the cheap cartoon invented to appeal to the gaudy, campy '60s - and not James Bond at all.They complain, because this is a REAL James Bond movie, and not one of those gaudy, campy fakes Roger Moore starred in.Oh, gosh - do I feel sorry for them? - NOT! This is a great dramatic, suspenseful espionage thriller - tough, realistic, and still a part of our time as much as it was that of Fleming's original novel; there are concerns that Fleming wrote about, which still concern us - the cold war is over, but MI5 is still the British Secret Service, and still capable of some pretty nasty business; Fleming's refinements to this reality remain in this movie, as well as refinements intended to appeal to mature viewers of any age.Enjoyed it thoroughly, and watched it twice; hoping for more of the same in the future.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Revamped 007 plays a winning hand,"Come 2002, when the world's favourite martini-sipping British secret agent was found driving an invisible car and racing to defeat a madman attempting to fry Korea with a giant magnifying glass, it had become clear that the immortalized Bond, James Bond had strayed a bit from the mark. Fortunately, producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson had a ready solution to save their beloved franchise from going belly up  take the Batman Begins route, ditch the franchise and start from the beginning once again by showing exactly how Bond earned his double-oh stripes, and morphed into the suave killing machine we all know and love.The rest, as they say, is history, with the addition of director Martin Campbell, veteran of the Zorro movies, who performed a similar revival of the Bond character with 1995's superb Goldeneye. Campbell shows a similar flair for bringing 007 to life here, as Casino Royale, adapted from author Ian Fleming's first novel proves to be one of the most powerful and intense Bond movies to date, allowing us as an audience to finally get behind Bond's skin a bit, and learn what drives him, why he is who he is. But don't be fooled into thinking this new Bond is strictly a character piece  Campbell shows no restraint in instilling the film with enough action to keep even the most sated Bond fans more than satisfied. Despite this, Campbell manages to make the title game of poker, where Bond must triumph to bankrupt a fleeing arms dealer, almost as tense and suspenseful as any action sequence; where the film might have lagged terribly is instead a high point.When re-igniting a franchise as iconic as 007, the casting of a suitable Bond was essential. Understandably, star Daniel Craig had more than a bit of pressure bestowed upon him, and more than a few naysayers. Fortunately, all those who knocked Craig as Bond are likely choking on their martinis at this very moment, as Craig shows the ideal mix of suave charisma and an intense dangerous streak, proving to be the most faithful on-screen adaptation of Fleming's beloved character. But be warned  while he still is without a doubt still Bond, James Bond, this Bond has an edge unseen since the Connery era. In the slick black and white pre-credits sequence, Bond describes his first kill, shown in flashback with Bond attempting to dispatch his target in a bathroom by fist, feet, mirror, sink and water. When asked how his target died, Craig simply deadpans ""Not well"", a throwback to the dark, edgy one-liners which established the Bond spirit in the first place. This intense yet classy sequence sets the tone beautifully for the rest of the movie  Bond is back, but the gadget bloated days of invisible cars and satellites are gone  this Bond is down, dirty and dangerous.While the film without a doubt belongs to Craig, he is aptly backed by a superb supporting cast. Eva Green's Vesper Lynd proves to be one of the most interesting and well developed women ever seen in Bond's life, and Green brings a distinct edge, yet affability to her essential character. Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen makes a more than suitable villain as arms dealer Le Chiffre. Mikkelsen shows he doesn't need plans to take over the world to be one of the most menacing foes seen in years. Watch for a particularly disturbing torture scene, bringing a deadly streak to a series usually so full of fantasy escapes. Character actor Jeffrey Wright makes a welcome appearance as Bond's American counterpart, Felix Leiter, and Dame Judi Dench produces what is without question her strongest performance as MI6 head M. Dench bestows M with a hard as nails front (her ""God I miss the Cold War"" line is one of the most memorable moments of the film) yet with a deeply concealed compassionate streak. Dench brings out every potential subtlety to her character in a masterfully layered and highly enjoyable performance.All in all, Casino Royale should prove enough to sate the needs of any 007 enthusiast, while also showing something new, sure to connect with any who may have felt the Bond series had strayed too far off track into the realm of fantasy. Director Martin Campbell and star Daniel Craig have brought both the character and franchise back to life in a fashion better than anyone could have predicted. Bond is back, and better than ever  don't pass this one by.-10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Good Bond, but good enough?","The first Bond film in 4 years didn't disappoint - Mads Mikkelsen played a great villain in Le Chiffre, Eva Green was absolutely lovely as Vesper Lynd, and even Daniel Craig pulled off a solid effort as Bond himself. But was it good enough? I haven't seen all the Bond films (only 5 in fact), but I consider the only effort I've seen of Sean Connery's, Goldfinger, to be a better film. Guaranteed, this film is only considered to be the prequel to Connery's films, and I understand the need to see Bond's grittier side before the sophistication starts to sneak in right at the end, but for me Connery is the archetypal Bond - he was suave, sophisticated and slick - I think I'll wait to Mr Craig's next outing to see if he has the ability to get to the level of Mr Connery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The poker game,"The problem with the poker game, as anyone who plays Texas Hold'em knows, is that if Bond knows how to play, he would have folded way before the river card (fifth) card was turned over. No-one would call all those bets on the hope of drawing a straight, let alone a straight flush. The massive bets would have seen him fold. As it was, the game revealed that rather than being a good poker player, he played like a beginner, hoping for the right card to turn up, and not using intelligence, odds or pot odds to make his decision. Anyone who watches poker on television will know that rarely does a game end up with more than tow players going 'head to head', as good players decide to fold rather than risk their tournament lives on hoping for a bit of luck. Although I would recommend that if you are interested, watch the re-runs of the 2006 World Poker Championships. The winner, Jamie Gold picked up $12 million, and had a run of luck that has never been seen before",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The human James Bond,"For all those using the word ""pure"" to describe Bond in this movie: I agree 110 per cent. Before I get to Daniel Craig (fantastic, *fantastic*), I'd just like to say that I'm among those people who say that this movie is the best Bond movie yet. It was more real, more believable, more from-planet-Earth. The plot was simple enough to understand (sorry, but it was), the characters were less outrageous and we finally learn that Bond is after all, one among us. Human. He thinks and he *feels* - instead of just looking fantastic (which Craig evidently had no problem with).Now I'll talk about him. Yes, absolutely, without a doubt - best Bond ever. We all know Sean Connery was brilliant, Pierce Brosnan was awesome etc etc etc, but Daniel Craig gave Bond that human touch that has always been lacking from the other movies. He didn't have many fancy gadgets to play with, so all he could do was show us what he could do with James Bond as a character and not as a complicated piece of machinery. He's always been a fine actor and I have to say, I was really looking forward to how he'd do in a Bond film. I loved what he did with Bond. He added a new dimension to the character and did not, for a second, look like he was uncomfortable in the least. Not even for a nano-second did I have to think, ""Man, they made the wrong choice here. So-and-so could have been so much better."" I can't wait to see him in the next one.Mads Mikkelsen as a villain was great too. Quiet, subtle, there to do the job. Nothing over-the-top. No over-acting. (Kind of like Sean Bean's Alec Trevelyan in GoldenEye - good, solid acting). I really liked Eva Green in this movie as well. She was way more likable and less annoying than Bond girls of the past. She has a really natural, loose acting style. No artificiality.Boy oh boy, this movie was refreshing. It was like a breath of fresh air after being caught up in a huge cloud of dense smog. With the exception of GoldenEye, which was awesome, the double-o movies just seemed to be one brainless, action-packed drag after another. It was so good just to see a *real* story, with *real* characters and great acting - with the action thrown in for good measure (and that itself was a whole lot of fun too).Doesn't matter if you're a Bond fan or not, GO AND SEE THIS MOVIE. You will not regret it. If it's not screening anymore where you are and you're waiting for the DVD release, grab it immediately.10/10, *****/***** A++++++",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Worst James Bond EVER!!!,"I see that many people gave this movie high marks, and for the life of me I cannot understand why. Did they ever see another Bond movie? I don't care that it is close to the original book. I think we've gone past the books a very long time ago.What makes a Bond movie great is action, explosions, suave characters and a plot that may tie your mind in knots.Casino Royale has none of the above.To say that this Bond is rough around the edges would be an understatement. He borders on stupidity. I guess that the idea was to make this as sort of an Episode One Bond: The rookie years.The makers of this Bond have broken a cardinal rule of Bond movies: Each new Bond has to outdo the last! This is supposed to mean more action, cleverer plot, niftier toys, bigger explosions, more shooting etc. Well, not so with this Bond. This is sort of an inexperienced, naive and googly eyed rookie, who falls in love so quickly and so easily that he offers his whole heart and soul on a platter to a chick he's never even kissed. What????!!!!!!So at long last this is the list of where they failed:1. Not enough action:Only half a car chase (no, really!)(the most ""spectacular"" chase is ON FOOT)Only 3 (miniature) explosions,Hardly any shooting2. Weak beginning:prior to the main plot, each Bond begins with a fantastic scene, to blow your mind early, and keep it blown throughout the movie. Well, not this time!3. NO TOYS WHATSOEVER!!!(oh yeah, the most high tech thing in the movie is a miniature defibrillator)4. Torture scenes are taken from the sick imagination of a prepubescent boy.Remember how the North Koreans tortured Bond in Die Another Day? Well the henchmen in this new Bond must have gotten a letter from Bond's Mom saying that he was allergic to torture, because their idea of torture is closer to giving the guy a wedgie.5. He's not funny at all!Part of Bond's charm is that he has a great sense of humor.Bond makes one joke in this movie. It's funny, but it's also very crass. It is better suited for a pot smoking college student than for the classy Bond.Oh yeah, and there is one more thing. Every car in this movie is made by a Ford company (Ford, Jaguar, Volvo etc.) I don't mean Bond's cars. I mean EVERY car on the street even. I understand product placement, but this is ridiculous. And Bond's car in this one? An Austin Martin DB S, which only appears for about 5 minutes and instead of rockets, it proudly displays an automatic glove compartment.This is a kinder, gentler Bond movie that your grandmother may enjoy, if she's really really boring. So if you must go see it, make sure to take Nana along and bring a couple of vicious, crazy bunnies with rabies, just to liven up the action.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
fantastic,"The familiar story begins only at the last minute, when Craig, as a bond, traditionally introduces himself to the enemy, in an impeccably fitting ""troika"", a tie and a weapon in his hand. Looks great!The authors obviously decided to radically change the design and color of the ""bond"" trademark, the old one began to get lost on the shelves, among other things. But in general, ""casino royale"" for bond is an analogy of ""azazelle"" for fandorin ... apparently, it became obvious that well, all the toys and tricks had already been used, and if bond did not have to try it on, it was a trail of the past, an imprint , which made him the current bond, a spiritual, so to speak, turning point. It was very melodramatic. But it's interesting to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

An absolute MUST for all 007 Fans...,"I have been a fan of the 007 films for a while and I've seen all but two of the films in the series, so when this film was released and appeared to differ pretty drastically from what I was used to I was a bit leery. I couldn't have more wrong, as this is easily my favorite Bond film to date. The studio has given James Bond a reboot, starting the series fresh with a new actor and new tone. The movie starts with Bond receiving his 00-status within MI6 and begins with his first mission as 007. The short version: He has been assigned to a case in which a man known only as Le Chiffre is partaking in a poker tournament in an effort to fund terrorist acts.Of course, that is a major understatement of the plot, as it is MUCH more complex. While most previous Bond film story lines could've been summed up in one sentence (i.e. evil organization/madman attempts to start World War III), this film's plot is complex and keeps you wondering to the end as to who can be trusted. There were some aspects I missed on my first viewing that were made clear the second time around. In addition to the great storytelling, we also get some of the best brutal action scenes from any Bond film. The fist-fights are brutal and the action never goes over-the-top, as it has in the past. We also don't have any of the signature gadgets that Bond fans have become accustomed to (with the exception of some additions to Bond's new Aston Martin). While this all leads to a completely different feel than any of the previous films, I loved it! It is grounded in reality without the campiness that has come to be expected; it seems to have more in common with the Bourne films than the previous Bond films.When I had heard Daniel Craig was to assume the role of Bond in this film, I was not one of the nay-sayers. I had seen him in ""Layer Cake"" and thought he was a perfectly viable option. I was right, because he was fantastic. He was grittier but managed to keep up Bond's usual suave demeanor with a hint of humor. Eva Green is Vesper Lynd, the film's ""Bond Girl"", an agent of the British Treasury sent along to fund Bond's mission in the tournament. She easily qualifies as one of my favorite Bond Girls, both beautiful and talented. The film was also backed with a fine supporting cast as well (Giancarlo Giannini, Mads Mikkelsen, Jeffrey Wright, and, of course, Judi Dench).This film gave the Bond franchise a refreshing reboot that has probably saved it from degenerating into camp-inspired doom. Craig proves himself as a more-than-capable Bond and the film is grounded/realistic for the first time in years. While the movie is longer than most Bond films, it is entertaining throughout and leaves you craving the sequel by the end.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond is Blonde and Back With a Bang!!,"One thing I like about Casino Royale is that for the first time ever on the silver screen Bond was a blonde character, something different from all the rest... I also loved the action of this movie, especially the ""free running"" opening sequence of the film when Bond was chasing after a terrorist through Madagascar... I loved the cars and weapons that Bond had to use in this film, they are always a trademark of these movies that his quartermaster Q provides and the sleek car that Bond gets in Montenegro is no exception.... I also liked the characters in this film, Daniel Craig crushed it as Bond his first time out and Eva Green was superb as his sidekick Vesper Lynd amongst a handful of other characters that made up the Bond family in this film... Casino Royal is good for anyone wanting to enjoy a great film except for small children as there is a PG-13 rating due to strong language and pervasive violence....

"Actually, a pretty decent movie.","To say it upfront: I am not a Bond fan. Haven't been since I was maybe 14. I find the old movies bad, horribly acted, badly scripted, with corny unfunny jokes, unbearably stereotypical characters etc. etc. The newer ones aren't much better, a bit more modern, better effects, but basically the same predictable super-agent drivel as the old stuff. Most of all, I tend to find those over-hyped discussions about who is going to fail to act in the role of this inconsequential Bond character most tiring.So it did come as somewhat of a surprise to me that I found myself in a screening of the latest installment of the series. I had not planned to watch another one of those in the cinema.However, what was even more surprising was that this one was actually a pretty decent movie. Not bad at all. Quite enjoyable, as a matter of fact.Much of that is due, of course, to the somewhat different Bond character. This will doubtless anger many fans of the series, but the latest Bond is a more believable character, almost human-like in its complexity, a character that engages in what might pass for actual relations with fellow characters in the context of this genre. Being quite fed up with the slick super-agent featured in the rest of the series, I found this was a welcome change.Craig does a respectable job at pulling off that role, and so does the rest of the cast. Obviously, the roles aren't of the great dramatic type, and the range required for them is no challenge to a fairly high-caliber collection of actors. Nonetheless, they do their jobs well, which is not something one can say about every action movie.In spite of some changes in the basic ¨flavor¨ of the movie, there are still enough of the other Bond attributes to satisfy any but the most fanatic fans: high production values, some great photography, beautiful women (also perhaps in somewhat more complex roles), fancy vehicles, a good dose of action, and lots of references, some of which outright hilarious (the scene in which he orders his martini rendered me helpless with laughter for a good minute or two). Gone is practically all of the corniness, the bad jokes and the lame-brained stereotypes (beyond, of course, the basic good/bad categories).What is left is a pretty decent spy/action flick, solid entertainment, beautifully photographed and professionally executed. If you could at all enjoy that type of movie, and if you are not someone who has firm a priori views on what actor should be playing Bond or how, or what elements ¨define¨ a Bond movie and therefore have to be present, I see no reason why you should not enjoy this one.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Playing with Cliché and Stereotypes,"As the title implies, 007 has a reputation to live up to. In most cases, I must say the film stays true to the origins, playing with clichés and stereotypes of villains and femme fatales. New Bond is simply full of attitude and has ""BADASS"" written all over his face, almost like an anti-hero. However, I must say I was disappointed after credits rolled. With recent hold'em craze influencing Casio Royale, the gambling scenes lacked something. I just can't grasp what it is, but the film's gambling scenes are inferior compared to Hong Kong ""five card draw"" gambling films. I understand the film's main focus isn't gambling but it dumbed down the excitement of hold'em. Another aspect I disliked was multiple hangers towards the end. Climax had gone down and it felt like it was dragging through two extra endings, somewhat like Da Vinci. It's nice to see little tie-ins and all, but overall it's just a slightly above average action film. It's a decent weekend bond film, disappointingly not great.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Fantastic intro to Bond movies,"I watched this film after my boyfriend repeatedly expressed his enthusiasm for it. As someone who has had limited exposure to James Bond movies, I was pleasantly surprised. The plot was gripping, and it captivated me with its succinct witty dialogue (which I would have liked more of) and maintained a intense level of action without being excessively violent. It was gripping, short witty concise dialogue and not excessively violent. It wasn't too predictable which kept me engaged throughout, and its romantic subplot added a charming touch.Daniel Craig delivered a compelling performance, embodying James with charm and expertise. The character is portrayed as an intriguing mix of austerity and lethality-aptly described as 'half monk, half hitman.'

"As anyone said they were ""stirred AND shaken"" yet?","I was never interested in Bond as a kid but when my parents took 13 year old me to this picture I can't say I wasn't impressed.This new serious Bond was really quite something: yes there were tuxedoes and gadgets galore but it captured something a lot more visceral, more masculine, more vulnerable.Danial Craig's new interpretation suggests an individual worn down by a post-imperialist government into a killing machine that still has some humanity left deep down and struggling (futilely) to get out.A lot of this movie is that card game and it does stretch the patience, as chic as the whole thing is. Certainly it overstays its welcome with a convoluted plot but that's not why we came anyway. Either way the set pieces are stunning, the script can be taken seriously and it will forever be on emblem to the harder Bond before we all got sick of Craig's face.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Fantastic Bond Film,"With No Time To Die finally set to hit cinemas in a few weeks, I thought it was time to go back and watch the other Daniel Craig Bond films and that starts with Casino Royale and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a newly minted 007 have to win a high level poker game in order to stop a criminal funding terrorism.Main Character
This was Daniel Craig's first time in the role and I thought he did a fantastic job as James Bond in the film. He is super intense and basically plays a cold hearted killer, but it really works and Craig nails this action machine that easily makes him the deadliest Bond and one that fits the modern age for sure. When he needs to put the charm on he does a good job and I thought the combination of the two really worked for the role that was needed here.Supporting Characters
Eva Green plays Vesper and she is truly brilliant, for years we have seen Bond Girls be damsels that are submissive to Bond but that isn't the case here. She matches Bond for smarts and intelligence with her being her own character that has development and I really liked how the two of them progress throughout the film. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre our villain here and he is also great, this is a desperate man who feels pretty human despite of the terrible things he does and I really liked how this bought him to Bond. Judi Dench reprises her role as M and she is just great, I really like her and Craig's dynamic and she feels like a mum who is pushing her son but gets frustrated all of the time and it works well here. Giancarlo Giannini and Jeffrey Wright both have roles here and are effective despite their limited screen time.Story
The story is really good, seeing this relatively new 007 is fascinating and it feels like this world is updated and is done really well. The stakes are really high and the scenes at the poker table are so effective and tension building with great characters throughout. Literally my only issue is that I feel like the film goes on for too long. The final 20 mins feel unnecessary and for me could have been cut and used as the start too the sequel and would have been much more effective.Script
The script is really good, the mix of drama and humour is really well done and due to Craig's charisma it is really effective but it allows him to build relationships with the other characters and create an interesting journey for us to watch.Style
The action is fantastic, this action is brutal and has some of the best stuntwork that you will ever see in a film. This film has one of the best parkour chase and car crash scenes that I have ever seen and credit has to be given to the crew to really make this action seem less silly and way more intense and destructive.Overall

I mean, it was so cheesy! Yes, I know, all the Bond movie was cheesy (the cheesiest being The World Is Not Enough - yup, the one with Denise Richards as Dr. Christmas). The thing is, the rest of the Bond movies was not so serious - it was done with a mischievous air about them. However, Casino Royale tries really hard to be super serious, and that was why I think it was funny. The scenes that got me in stitches were...1. The beginning started really well, all noir and sleek with violent flashbacks of a bathroom fight. Stylish, dark and interesting...and then when you least expect it...JB turns with the signature Bond pose!2. JB was chasing an African man...the man is a Parkour expert and he is jumping over building and dodging obstacles, very agile. Hot on his pursuit is JB. So this man tries to escape by jumping through a small rectangle opening in a wall. And what did JB did? He ran through the wall - wow what finesse!3. You know how all JB movies have the leading girls came out of the water in bathing suits? Well, this didn't happen in this movie because JB himself emerged from the water, dripping wet. Most girls appreciated this scene.Anyway, I gave a score of 6 because it made me laugh so hard. And minus one for Eva Greens grating voice I found so irritating.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
One of the rare modern Bonds that deserves a 10. Very possibly among the top 5 Bond films ever.,"This is an atypical Bond film.Although there are great action sequences, the focus of the film is not on action, but intellect, and great characters & thrilling sequences (of gambling, etc). This is not a Bond film with an insane villain in a Swiss ski resort. This is a cold calculated spy story, with financial intrigues.Daniel Craig is magnificent as Bond, and Eva Green has chemistry with Craig that is authentic in ways other Bond girls never were, which will continue to drive the story in later Craig Bond films.This film will be displeasing for people who like the classic Bond film formula (action, ridiculous locations & gadgets, etc). However I consider it a masterpiece of a spy & Bond film. I have watched every Bond film to date (including NTTD this year), and consider Casino Royale to be the best Bond film ever (alongside Goldfinger).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bland, James Bland","Before this was released, there was a lot of angry speculation about whether Daniel Craig had what it takes to step into the Bond shoes. But, in fact Craig seems to be the only one trying to make this a Bond movie. Craig plays Bond with his particular style of brutal vulnerability. He has always had the face of someone nursing an ancient wound that won't heal. And he does well with the material he has been given. Unfortunately, that isn't really very much.The plot, which has to be one of the all time daftest, revolves around Bond stopping international terrorism by playing poker with its main financial backer  using millions of pounds of British taxpayers money. Gosh, now there's a good plan! It's just crazy enough to work, as they say in Hollywood. It's really just an excuse for a whole lot of very tense casino footage with actors saying stuff like: ""I'll see your 20 million and raise you another 20 million"" all spoken through clenched teeth, presumably to stop themselves from giggling.Possibly because it's all so ridiculous, the writers have tried to offset this by removing all the other customary Bond absurdities. There's none of the politically incorrect sleaze (Bond even falls in love for gods sake!). And no gadgets to speak of  alas, no laser cuff links or jet propelled shoelaces. Even the action sequences look almost within the bounds of physical possibility. Gone are the days when Bond would think nothing of strapping himself into an evil experimental rocket-ship, still wearing his tuxedo. In place of all that, we're served up a wince-inducing torture scene straight out of 24.The problem, as I see it, is that this has also removed a lot of the fun. This may well be a lean, mean Bond for our times, but it's Bond in name only. To be fair, the film is well made and Craig is (as always) engaging, but it could be about anybody. It's just not James Bond. When Craig speaks the immortal lines ""Bond, James Bond"", I simply didn't believe him.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
First Bond - 2006?,"First of all, I thought the film was really entertaining and i loved it.But, at the end of the movie, I got the impression that: if this were supposed to be the first Bond movie, the makers of Casino Royal did a poor job... (Could be my knowledge that's poor tough;)In Casino Royale, they're referring to The Cold War, and how they are ""glad it's over."" How can they do that? Isn't the plot from of some of the earlier Bond movies during the Cold War?And there has to be some kind of date in one of the earlier Bonds... I just can't believe this is the first time they'd let us know which year their in.""No Brad, I'm just an ordinary guy, with nothing to loose;)""",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""Royale"" is the most thrilling Bond adventure in the past decade","Casino RoyaleDirected by Martin Campbell.Starring Daniel Craig, Eva Green and Judi Dench.After a four year hiatus, newcomer Daniel Craig reinvents James Bond in ""Casino Royale."" Directed by Martin Campbell (who also launched Pierce Brosnan's Bond in 1995's ""GoldenEye""), ""Royale"" reboots England's sophisticated super-spy by bringing him back to basics. Campbell steers clear of the excesses often associated with the franchise -- ditching the gadgets and avoiding the puns -- to create the most thrilling Bond adventure in the past decade.The film's opening sequence sees Bond attaining his double-oh status by making his first two assigned kills; one while engaged in an intense bathroom brawl, and the other during a calm encounter in an expensive London flat. The scenes show the audience Bond's calm, collected exterior as well as the animosity the lies underneath. Craig establishes early on that his Bond will be a rougher creature, less like the camp-filled shenanigans of Roger Moore and more like the dark, brooding Timothy Dalton. It's a risky decision, considering Dalton's short tenure as 007, but it winds up paying off in ""Royale.""After the initial set-up, the plot meanders for an hour or so, and Campbell rounds out the film with some impressive filler. Bond's exhilarating foot chase after terrorist Mollaka (played by Parkour pioneer Sébastien Foucan) is one of the most inventive in the series' history. Other scenes, like 007's attempt to thwart the destruction of an expensive new commercial airliner, are just as exciting.The story really begins when Bond is assigned to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a banker to the world's terrorists who has carelessly lost his clients' money. In an effort to win back the fortune -- and avoid the repercussions -- he sets up a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro. MI6 reluctantly enters Bond in the game (as luck would have it, he's a gifted player) to prevent Le Chiffre from winning, hoping to gain information from him in return for protection once he has lost. Along for the ride is Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), representing the treasury and making sure (unsuccessfully) that things don't get out of hand. It's not long before Bond develops an attachment to her, jeopardizing his career and even his own safety.There is an underlying sincerity in Craig's Bond that has not been seen since 1969's ""On Her Majesty's Secret Service."" When he falls in love with Vesper, it is convincing and feels completely genuine. When he is unable to best Le Chiffre, he loses his cool and panics. The human touches work well because they prove that James Bond is fallible, even if only for those brief moments.The charm and stylishness of ""Casino Royale"" cannot be denied, and neither can Craig's impact as 007. The film reminds action fans that, while there are many imitators, James Bond is still at the head of the pack.Final Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Style, with Substance.",Perhaps my Favorite Bond flick. Seeing a younger harsher bond come to life is spectacular. The reboot of the series makes the world famous agent a genuine character with flaws and weaknesses. Craig brings a visceral approach to the character and never holds back. Mads Mikkelsen as Le Chiffe is brilliant casting and most definitely a memorable villian.Only criticism of the film is the final act in Venice. Seems a bit too over the top to close the film with and makes the film feel its 2.5 hour run time.Overall a grand Bond flick.,9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
That's entertainment,"Daniel Craig brings 007 up to the Sean Connery level but modernized, even though not as gadgety. Craig's Bond has it all: the look, the physical prowess & toughness, the coolness, smartness etc. and delivers it perfectly. Mad Mikkelsen (Polar) is the perfect 007 franchise villain; the rest of the supporting cast brings it all together, including ""M"" and of course the obigatory eye candy ladies (tastefully presented without unnecessary nudity). This edition, being Casino Royale, adds the poker showdown element which is always exhilarating (a-la The Cincinnati Kid w/Steve McQueen & Edward G. Robinson). It even shows Bond vulnerable and falling in love which is short-lived and hardens him to go on with his license to kill. Lots of action & intrigue; well-presented screenplay with no expense spared on the effects. This makes it to the all-time favorites list.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Beautiful cinematics but uninteresting story,"This movie is a real eye candy. Packed with great shots, atmospheric colors plus loads of action and destruction. Unfortunately the storyline is rather a guide from one action scene to another while it offers no depth and doesn't really get you hooked. There is no real tension curve as the movie shows Bond hunting down one more or less relevant criminal after another and in the end it becomes overbloated with forced 'twists'. This movie seems more like the Transformers 3 of agent thrillers than the millenium classic many people want it to be.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
As good as any 007 and maybe better than some.,"This story starts at the beginning. Yep, we see how James Bond (Daniel Craig) got his double Oh's.

We can never be sure who should wear white hats if anybody.Interestingly Dame Judi Dench plays ""M"" the head of department MI6.They picked a lot of strange places for the film:

"A dry martini, shaken not stirred","Gritty set pieces, smirk filled exchanges and beautifully visualized shots.Casino Royale, the James Bond reboot played all its cards right - from being an edgier spy drama than its predecessors to taking the action a notch more realistic.Here, James is not just a womanizing killing machine, but instead shows emotional dimensions. Albeit, being paraded around in beachwear a significant number of times. (We ain't complaining!).With menacing enemies of state at every turn, friends doubling up as snakes and a solid M to fall back upon. The reboot packs quite a punch to keep viewers hooked for the entire 2.5 hrs.All in all, a good (re)start to the otherwise watered down Pierce Brossnan series we were subjected to.Omega. Check.

Craig miscast,"A few brief comments. First, I liked Daniel Craig in other recent movies he's been in, like Layer Cake. But I think that he does best in a real, everyday kind of role, like Michael Caine. Secondly, there's a glib humor that you see in other Bond movies that is missing here, or at least a ""believable"" glib humor. Again, I think that's because he does best in ""everyday guy"" roles. Lastly, I found the fight scenes to be a bit freakish. Maybe it's just my age showing. Maybe the world has evolved too far downward for a Bond figure to be believable anymore. That's the challenge, to make a Bond (and a scenario) that is believable in today's world. But I do think that he gives it his best shot, and that it's a worthwhile movie to go to.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Top notch entertainment but don't expect any realism,"For proof, the initial chase scene between the ""new"" Bond(Daniel Craig, a Shakespearian-trained Brit) and the bad guy could only have been accomplished by androids or the like, as no human in the world is in such great condition to be able to do even 10% of what they did. And, neither was hurt or breathing hard when Bond finally got his man after about 15 minutes of full-out running and falling and crashing into hard things, like steel cranes. Way cool, but also way unrealistic as is typical with all previous Bond films. Nothing different there, and all FX were marvelously done and very dramatic, as always.I really enjoyed the new Bond..ice blue eyes, and rough, tough, buff and more sensitive but also more blue-collar than all previous Bonds. He had none of the snooty, upper-class Brit mannerisms we saw in the previous 007's. Richard Gere said in An Officer and a Gentleman, ""I have no place else to go"", and this new Bond could have said it too, as he ""is"" 007 through and through and could be nothing else. His new ""humanity"" instead of previous Bond imperviousness or insensitivity was refreshing, but it did somewhat shock me to see a real human being with loving feelings wiping out scores of people without a second thought even if they were the baddies. Again, not realistic at all, but tres entertaining. Don't try this at home.I enjoyed this movie more than all other Bonds except Goldfinger..the storytelling was more or less the same as others and predictable, but Bond was very different this time....and much better. I hope he does many more.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Possibly the best Bond ever,"I enjoyed the Brosnan films, they were slick and fantastical but Casino Royale brings Bond back to earth with a bump, and what a bump! This is a thriller in the true sense of the word, violent and gritty, it zips along at a great pace, fantastic stuff.The new Casino Royale also brings Bond right up-to-date, we've known and loved the character for years and now they have cleverly re-invented him for a new generation. The gadgets and corny one-liners are gone and we are left with something which is much more believable.Crucially the film remains reasonably true to the book and it is a lot better for it, rather like On Her Majesty's Secret Service. It's difficult to make direct comparisons with previous Bonds as they are all products of their time but this is up there with the best of them.It must be gratifying for Daniel Craig, after all the criticism he initially received, to realise that he and the rest of the team got it right.This will be a hard act to follow, here's hoping for more of the same.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Little action,"An entire hour set around a spy trying to outsmart a terrorist at poker or bridge or whatever it was isn't my idea of a good spy movie.

Danny Boy gets the gig.,"Gotta give credit where it's due. This movie hits all the buttons you want from a Bond flick. Great opening chase scene, great closing blow-it-all-to-smithereens scene, great looking Bond girls and snappy cinematography. And the newest Bond, Daniel Craig, proudly carries on the tradition without slipping into the Austin Powers self-parody trap lurking around every corner.Have to love the opening. After using every imaginable mode of transportation from speedboats to hotsh*t race cars to jets to skis for the chase scenes in the previous Bond flicks, I would have figured they'd run out of options and just re-cycle. So, instead, the producers hit on the ONE mode of transportation that hadn't yet been used... Running. Lord help me. Running. On foot. And it WORKS!!! All I can say to Marty Campbell is ""You had me at ""hello"".Great twist on the ""Shaken, not stirred"" line, too. Cute retro move on the opening title credits. The theme song ain't really up to snuff, but that's my only real complaint here.All in all, not quite ""Goldfinger"", but not bad. Thought that a blonde Bond would create a rift in the cosmos and suck the universe into a some black hole in the space-time continuum. Thought I'd come out of the movie screaming ""I knew Sean Connery. Sean Connery was a friend of mine. And you, my friend, are no Sean Connery"". But Daniel Craig pulls it off. Go figure. I stand corrected. And more important...I sit entertained.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This Bond film is a fine entry into the long running and well-loved series,"James Bond (Daniel Craig) has just completed the arduous journey to 00 spy status. An employee of the British government, his assignments will be the most difficult and important cases imaginable from this time forward. As he is investigating an African warlord's money connections, he ends up, unhappily, as front page news when the case takes a slightly wrong turn. Nevertheless, his investigations propel him to follow a corrupt money manager named Le Chiffre, whose clients are the most unsavory and dangerous in the world. From the Bahamas, to the Czech Republic, and to Montenegro, Bond is out to get his man. He even risks a great deal on a high stakes card game in one of the most plush casinos on the face of the earth. Naturally, beautiful women cross his path as well. Will Bond end up victorious on his first months on the job? This is an exciting movie with the highest of production values. Craig is splendid as the newest Bond, sure to please male and female movie goers alike, with his cool but charming demeanor.

One of the best Bond movies period.,This Bond movie has it all a new Bond character and Daniel Craig who is exactly what we needed in a new Bond character rustic rough around the average unpredictable willing to take chances savagely subtle with an attack method somewhere between a chainsaw and a scalpel depending on the situation and what is deemed appropriate. Bond should be a badass and he is in this movie. The movie has an interesting plot the time to we're halfway through the movie they've accomplished so much that it could be a movie onto itself and then the other half of the movie is yet itself another movie so you get a two-in-one special here that's how thickly the plot line is laid the movie has everything developed characters that you are invested in and that are memorable relationships that are nuanced and also developed the Clashing of egos Titans Great Guns great cars heroics and romanticism it's edgy yeah it's beautiful it's classy yet blunt it's exactly what a Bond movie should be and I wish they would make more like this,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Yes, the real Bond is back; but ""Casino Royale"" still to be made","Yes, Sean Connery remains the definitive James Bond, but Daniel Craig effortlessly (actually, it looks like it took a great DEAL of effort) supplants George Lazenby as the very *very* good second best, and hopefully a great Bond for the next decade or more.Lazenby had the advantage of being in the movie based on the best of the original Ian Fleming books, ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE, and consequently the best movie in the series. Craig has the advantage of being a terrific actor with precisely the rough edges to the visage Fleming first envisioned. He isn't the first blond Bond, Roger Moore had that distinction, and thank God he isn't the pseudo-suave pretty boy which almost sank the series (though he may have the best chiseled body of anyone yet to play the role, and shows more of it). He's simply Bond, James Bond - at the start.This is, in many ways a new beginning in the same way other decades running series have reinvented themselves. The film makers have gone back to Fleming's first book to reintroduce the character as if he were appearing for the first time today rather than at the height of the Cold War. Keeping most of the essentials of the novel's story (it is sadly amusing to see self professed but possibly illiterate ""Bond fanatics"" *complain* about the inclusion of the essential elements of the NOVEL ""Casino Royale"" - the card game, the torture sequence and the resolution of Vesper's story - that give the movie its legitimacy) the film makers have built a ""traditional"" Bond film thriller around them. The BOOK doesn't really start until half way through the film(!), leaving Casino Royale with the odd distinction as the only Fleming Bond novel filmed THREE times now (the first was with Barry Nelson as Bond in an episode of a TV series called ""Climax"" - it is available on DVD as a bonus with another film) and yet still not faithfully preserved on film!As a film thriller in the 44 year old Bond tradition, this new CASINO ROYALE is undeniably thrilling. The opening chase scene is hands down the most exciting in the entire series. Gone are ""Q's"" increasingly outrageous ""toys"" which were threatening to overwhelm the characters Fleming had created, but the smart joking dialogue still stands out even if, appropriately, it is reigned in for a character just finding his footing and just having received his ""double 0"" rating, but that hasn't limited the ingenuity of the screenwriters. The new addition to the saga: how Bond acquired the first of his favored Astin Martins, is superb and utterly fitting for the character.One may (must) quibble that the commercial decision to replace the elegant ""Baccarat"" game with its faster turn-around (even if the audience needed to be taught the rules) with a TV familiar ""Texas Hold'em,"" (the card game is essential and central to the story) or that the film goes overboard with the setup for the car crash (the less ""spectacular"" version in the book would have been far better and more credible) and the unnecessary quotation from TITANIC as a battle is waged in Venice (the travelogue aspect of the film - always a Bond highpoint - is still strong) with a whole building sinking beneath the protagonists (!), but none of that can stop the film from being a wild ride, packed with enough adventurous incident for two Bond films.It's a fine return and great new start for a superb series.

Trying to sell margarine as butter,"Daniel Craig is not James Bond despite the fact that we have been subjected to a 2 and one half hour sales presentation. No, this was not a Bond movie but an attempt to convince us that we needed Craig.

I wanted to give it a fair chance.Some may criticize the title sequence for lack of the traditional Bond women, but I thought it was absolutely brilliant.

Daniel Craig makes a strong debut in the film that brought Bond back in a big way,"Having recently been promoted to Double-0 status, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is sent on the trail of the international financiers of the world's terrorists by MI6 head, M (Judi Dench). The trail leads Bond to Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the money handler for several terrorist groups, warlords, and international criminals who handles his clients money while also using it to make high end investments that will pay off from their criminal activities through ripples in the market. Bond sets out to bankrupt Le Chiffre teaming up with Her Majesty's Treasury agent, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), as Bond finds himself tenuously holding onto his humanity through the dark, tangled, and violent world of international espionage.Following the critical backlash to the previous Bond movie, Die Another Day, EON Productions were prompted to reboot the series and bring the Bond character closer to the roots of his Ian Fleming origins as opposed to the gadget using quipper that had become the subject of parody due to the nature of the Bond formula, effectively starting over from scratch and cancelling a high profile spin-off featuring Halle Berry's character Jinx. Directed by Kiwi director Martin Campbell, who helped to resurrect interest in Bond with the Pierce Brosnan debut in GoldenEye, the movie reintroduces Bond for the era of the spy film as redefined by the Jason Bourne series of films. Casino Royale has many of the familiar Bond elements, but sidelines the gadgetry and fantastical aspects of the series in favor of a more grounded character based approach.Daniel Craig's take on Bond is really strong and falls in line with Timothy Dalton's take on the character where Bond is portrayed more as a steely eyed assassin rather than the devil may care playboy that characterized the later Connery films and Moore era. When Bond kills someone in the movie he doesn't brush it off with a snarky quip and we see the expression on Bond's face as the deaths of those around him begin to weigh on him. Craig's Bond is a very human take on Bond and in a way feels like it's aiming for the same level of pathos that was attempted in On Her Majesty's Secret Service albeit striking a better balance with a more well suited actor. The rest of the cast is nicely fleshed out as well with Judi Dench reprising her role as M from the Brosnan films, but giving a harder more detached take on the character that gives the character added dimensionality to her mentor relationship with Bond. Eva Green is also well realized as Vesper Lynd who makes a strong counterpart to Bond and you buy into their relationship and become invested in it. Mads Mikkelsen is wonderfully despicable as Le Chiffre whose cold calculating presence in the film makes him a despicable force and a worthy foe for Bond to square off against.The action sequences are well done and are fittingly spectacular but forego the sillier aspects of prior entries in favor of a more scaled down approach where the action sequences feel like they have weight gravity and consequence. Two standout sequences are some wonderful chase sequences in Madagascar and Miami with Campbell doing a good job of showing the flow of events and establishing a strong sense of spatial geography with some tense death defying sequences that keep you engaged.Casino Royale brings Bond back to his roots and brings the characters to the forefront in place of gadgets and outlandish action sequences. Craig brings a unique approach to Bond getting in touch with the character's humanity as well as the lingering effects felt by his work in the field and the ensemble of Judi Dench, Eva Green, Jeffrey Wright, and Mads Mikkelsen makes for a solid adventure in the James Bond series that is a strong start for a new Bond.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

People are raving about this because they're so relieved it doesn't stink,"Craig is outstanding and the film is worth seeing for him alone. M plays Bond brilliantly and as a friend of mine said, Dench is actually playing M for the first time. Green is passable, Mikkelson is good and justifies his retirement from Formula 1 a few years back (F1 in joke).The movie has a fair stab at staying faithful to the novel and I hope the franchise stays in this direction. In the case of Casino Royale, it means the pacing is weird, but. To say more would constitute a spoiler. However, I am sure that even as I type, The Simpsons script writing team are working on an episode showing how many entertaining interruptions you can put in a card game to make it interesting. Incidentally the film (unlike Fleming) assumes we know the rules of the game. Very lazy. Cowardly and forgivable, but lazy nonetheless.However.Most of the action is Bond by numbers, uninspiring and at times, largely during the climax, the storytelling of the action seems poorly thought out and tricky to follow. No, not because it's fast or because of the editing - just because it's unclear in depicting what's happening.Worse.It's dull. Spectacular but lacking in the visceral gutsy feeling of films by newbies, such as Crank.The franchise needs new blood at the helm, or at least a fundamental rethink of how to make Bond style action sequences relevant and exciting.Craig carries the movie, convinces and makes you (well me,anyway,) care.And why, why,why does Arnold blow his Bond song writing debut with the dullest most forgettable Bond song ever? Truly bizarre.Robert Altman R.I.P. And thanks for the memories.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not particularly stirred ...,"I have a feeling I'm in a very small minority here ... but having seen Casino Royale at a preview last night, I was very disappointed with it, particularly given all the glowing reviews. Daniel Craig is fine, but the plot was a mess and the villain wasn't all that scary. The film seemed to lurch from one set piece to another, and the twists at the end were frankly baffling (can anyone explain to me what happened to the Algerian boyfriend? Is he alive or dead? When was he kidnapped?) Okay, I admit Daniel Craig looks great in his tight swim shorts, and Montenegro looks extremely pretty, but as a film it was pretty dull (and way too violent.)",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond reborn,"Watching ""Casino Royale"", it was both satisfying and surprising for me to see how the James Bond franchise has evolved over the years. In this modern interpretation of Bond, Daniel Craig brings a new and fresh energy while maintaining the essence of the character. His performance brings a new depth to the Bond character, which is certainly a distinguishing feature when compared to previous interpretations of the character. It was a cinematic pleasure to see the action sequences well directed and choreographed. However, there were a few moments in the movie where I felt the pacing dropped at certain moments during the progression of the story, which is one of the few shortcomings that prevented me as an audience member from fully appreciating the movie. On the other hand, the character development and storytelling in the movie challenged conventional perceptions of Bond, giving it a different dimension. As a result, ""Casino Royale"" stands as a modern landmark in the Bond universe. It is impressive in both its vision and depth of character, but some pacing issues in the narrative could have been worked on.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Full House,"""Casino Royal"" is a return-to-form, suspense-driven Bond film that delves deeper into the series' inherent spy-craft roots more so than a number of previous entries, albeit with a touch less of tech and gadgets. The transition between the last version of Bond, played by Pierce Brosnan, and the latest iteration acted by Daniel Craig, is a bit jarring; though not to the detriment of the character. Craig's more serious and business-before-pleasure take on the iconic MI6 agent lends itself well to the increase in espionage presented throughout the film, which in turn allows for the more grounded storyline to flow seamlessly. This, combined with a solid cast, an exceptional line of music scores including a breathtaking intro, and a number of action sequences that hit all the right beats make the film a must see for fans of the franchise and newcomers alikeConcerning the plot, the movie centers around a new 00 agent, James Bond, as he attempts to shut down a terrorism-funding scheme. Right out the gate, the film wastes no time is displaying Bond's brutality against his opponents, though with the caveat that he is still prone to making logical mistakes; a point he is reminded of by his boss ""M"", and one that goes on to haunt the character. After identifying a connection to the ringleader, a man who goes by the name of Le Chiffre, Bond utilizes a brief romantic fling to obtain information on one of his underlings. Upon neutralizing the target and preventing another from destroying a state-of-the-art plane, thus derailing Le Chiffre's initial plot to obtain the money he needs to keep his head, he and a woman named Vesper Lynd are sent into a high-stakes gambling scenario that would be seeing a number of wealthy contenders all playing for an enormous prize. With the pressure on Bond to win to prevent the proceeds from directly funding terrorism, the uphill battle and subsequent climaxes see more than just his wit and resolve tested as Le Chiffre pulls out all the stops to secure victory at any cost.One unfortunate setback to mention is the awkward pacing of the storyline due to its over-commitment on a series of surprises within the final act. Admittedly, this is primarily an issue for the first watch of the film, as subsequent viewings (being aware of the ending) will likely run better with the subterfuge cleared; but it still creates an unnecessary hurdle that could have been prevented with a few changes to the plot. This is unfortunate, too, as the wealth of set-up for the ""true"" ending is easy to overlook and wasted without the knowledge of what is actually taking place.As mentioned earlier, one major boon to the story is its focus on creating suspenseful situations, such as the pivotal card game, that play to both the strengths and weaknesses of Bond's character. Since the relationships he forms with other characters, Vesper in particular, carry throughout the film in plot-relevant ways, the investments to those relationships feel all the more palpable when compared to a number of shallower past ""romances"" the character has had in previous entries (such as Dr. Christmas Jones from ""The World is Not Enough"").Concerning the most notable characters, Daniel Craig's performance as Bond in this film was a masterclass from start to finish for all the aforementioned reasons. Eva Green's Vesper was one of the best ""Bond Girls"" to date through merit of her juxtaposing warm vulnerability and matter-of-fact banter that never reaches the obnoxious level of snark that certain modern female roles employ. Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre was a well-rounded antagonist that felt competent and formidable throughout, especially in the torture sequence late into the runtime, and Judi Dench's ""M"" managed to improve upon her role even further from the last several outings of the character.All in all, ""Casino Royale"" is a perfect introductory film for anyone looking to jump into the franchise for the first time, and a solid watch for those already familiar with it. Though it loses a degree of playfulness in trade for a more gritty atmosphere, it delivers in spades on the action and intrigue that have always been with the series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Still Bond but not brilliant,"From the opening scene you know this is a different Bond film to one you've ever seen.The filming is entertaining,with a very good pace.It does however force the point you feel of how different it is and runs for about 20 minutes too long.As with all Bond films the plot is not of the utmost importance...but here it is anyway.Bond has just become 007 and must now compete in a high-stakes poker tournament against Le Chiffre.There are of course many gripping tosses and turns in-between to keep us entertained.The acting in this film cannot be faulted.Mads Mikkelsen makes a stand-out turn as Le Chiffre,Craig makes the character of Bond his own(not particularly easy) and Judi Dench makes acting look easy as M.The scenes where we have Bond and love interest Vesper Lynd(Eva Green) in one on one situations did on occasion made me cringe.Not so much the fault of the actors but the script.This is what took the film down a notch particularly coming up to the finale.The main success of the film is Martin Campbell's direction.As with Goldeneye he re-invents Bond and leaves us with a good film.Without him this film would not be anywhere near as good as it is.Overall not as amazing as some people claim it to be but still well worth seeing.When the main talking point of the film is Bond getting his balls whacked you should know it's not going to be a classic...",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Worst Bond Movie Ever,"First of all this is a two and a half hour sony commercial. Bond is weak, The movie is boring. I wanted to leave several times. The plot is lossy and the emotional chit chat totally against bond character. The new bond is unappealing and his eyes are digitally enhanced. Even the special effects are not what they used to be. We come to expect more from bond, bond is not some lame superhero with a darker troubled side.For me Sony has totally ruined bond. One cant only hope this is the last we see of this new bond.

Highly recommended bond film with explosive debut by Daniel Craig,"Daniel Craig makes an explosive self assured bond debut in Casino Royale, a reboot of the series. His bond is a heady cocktail of machismo and fiery charisma. The pre credit sequence traces bond's beginning as a rookie agent as he earns his double 0 status and the opening fight is visceral.Craig and Judy Dench are both very good actors and they have a field day as they verbally spar with each other. The slightly overlong film conspires to make bond meet Vesper played fantastically by Eva Green. The two have great chemistry.The action scenes continue to impress specially an early parkour chase which is one for the ages. There is a long mid-section with a card game which is punctuated by drama and action. Despite an overlong action climax the film sizzles as the main characters battle betrayal.The film's closing moments are memorable as the familiar bond theme starts playing.Overall 10/10 highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A much-needed Bond make-over,"James Bond is bankrolled in a high-stakes poker game in the hope that he can bankrupt Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), a money-handler for organised crime who is heavily in debt to his ruthless handlers. This, the third film version of Fleming's inaugural Bond book, is Danial Craigs' first outing as the iconic 007 and is quite good. Craig brings a cold menace to the licenced killer that had been lacking in the previous (post-Connery) incarnations and the production values of the film are exemplary. Judi Dench is great as M and, as Vesper Lynd, Eva Green makes for a sultry, sexy Bond-girl (although her clever name fits better in the original story than in this post-cold war update). Mads Mikkelsen oozes nastiness as the eye-bleeding Le Chiffre and manages to be cold, smooth and malignant without tipping over-the-top into super-villain land. The action sequences are generally excellent although the film is a bit long and the somewhat unlikely climactic scene in Venice seems a bit tacked on. An excellent debut for Craig and a promising rebirth for the venerable series.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"""You take the next one. There's not enough room in here for me and your ego.""","Almost four decades after the novel was first filmed as a spoof, the Ian Fleming story gets reinvented for the James Bond franchise as a serious yarn about Bond (Daniel Craig, making a smashing debut) relentlessly pursing an icy-cold money expert, Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), who acts as financier for the worlds' terrorists. It shows us how this latest special agent using the ""James Bond"" designation first earned his ""double 0"" status. Bond will ultimately face off against Le Chiffre in a very high-stakes card game, with the intention of preventing Le Chiffre from winning the big prize. (Which the bad guy needs to do to stay in the good graces of his clients.). Watching over Bond is a Treasury department official, Vesper Lynd (Eva Green). Naturally, Bond and the lovely Vesper don't get along that well at first, but there is definitely a spark there.Craig is a very cool, self-confident Bond who can be reckless at times. He's well matched with Green, one of the most charming Bond girls that this viewer has seen in a while. Their first big scene together is electric as they size each other up. Mikkelsen is a fun, effectively low-key antagonist. The leads are well supported by a top international cast including Dame Judi Dench (once again playing ""M""), Giancarlo Giannini, Jeffrey Wright, Simon Abkarian, Isaach De Bankole, Jesper Christensen, and Ivana Milecevic.""Casino Royale"" begins with a flourish, with most of the opening 19 minutes devoted to action, before settling into the story proper. In fact, much of the first half contains some breathless action set pieces. A large portion of the second half is devoted to the critical card game, which does get appropriately tense at times. There's room for some humor, and Craig does give this Bond a bit of an edge while also giving us a classic image of Bond as a man who's masterful with the ladies. The plot twists are well laid-out, and once again there is a certain delight in all the globe-trotting going on. Even more importantly, there are some very human moments here which help to ground the material, especially in that second half. There's a decent special effects climax of a building disintegrating.All in all, very agreeable escapist entertainment that, although somewhat over-extended at almost two and a half hours, always tells a good story.The screenplay is credited to Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and Paul Haggis, with director Martin Campbell returning to the franchise for the first time since 1995s' ""GoldenEye"". The late Chris Cornell belts out a solid theme song that helps the film to get off to a rocking start.Seven out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Goodbye Bond,"Sadly, I fail to agree with the rave reviews given to this film. By taking away everything that made a Bond film unique, we are left with your run-of-the-mill action flick, save for one or two original twists. If I want to watch a gritty action film, I'll watch The Bourne Supermacy or something of that ilk; I don't want to watch Bond without gadgets, Bond without quips, Bond without a sense of fun. Casino Royale is no fun. It's deadly serious. Daniel Craig is a good 007 and there are some witty dialogue exchanges between Bond and Vesper. But moments like this are fleeting. For the rest of the time you could be watching any other action film. Not impressed, and I hope the producers realise that Bond is best when it is DIFFERENT from other action films, not the same.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
It won't kill you to smile,"007 fans, i watched the film tonight. I am huge 007 fan. Always been. So was my father before me. And my grandpa was a huge fan. So it runes in the family. You can say I would know James Bond when I see one. I haven't seen one tonight. It is not Daniel Craig's fault. The man did the best he could. But, people, he is not James Bond. Not in ""Casino Royale"" at least. Remember Connery, Moore? Now they played Bond as it was meant to be played. And I happen to like the Timothy Dalton as 007 best. It's just that James Bond disarms you with his smile, he is too cool to be worried about bullets flying towards him. He comes in, with a cool line, kills the bad guy with help of Lady Luck (what else is the 7 in 00 for?), grabs the babe, winks at you and storms out just before the place is blown to bits. It may not be a thriller, there is not a mystery to be solved, there are just a few romantic scenes. You may not call it the Oscar category, but it has been like that for half of century. And people loved it. This is a good movie, but that is just it. It would be a great movie, if the lead character isn't called James Bond, and if he is not addressed as 007. If he were John Smith and was a CIA agent, for example, i would give him praises. And one more fact. All of my friends that are fans of the serial, didn't like it. My friends that didn't like the Bond movies, liked it. It tells you one thing. They looked at ""Casino Royale"" as just another movie, and it was good. The rest of us, wanted to watch James Bond movie, and we were preparing for that. We didn't get what we expected, and we were disappointed.One funny thing. I am a Serb. The original character upon who Ian Fleming based James Bond, was also a Serb by the name of Duan Popov. I am sure a lot of you did not no that fact, not that it has some meaning. He was a spy, and he was working for British Intelligence. And only a Serb would be dumb enough to be so cocky, when a spy has to be someone invisible. But that's not the point. I live in a country called Sebia. It used to be called Serbia & Montenegro. And then those two countries parted. Do you recognize the name Montenegro? It is that beautiful place in the other half of the movie. Except I never saw that country and I used to live in it. My friends, it has all been filmed in Chech Republic. I am sorry to say that you will not see those sites in Montenegro, let alone travel on a train like that. It may be a small matter to you but everyone here laughed when they saw ""Montenegro"".Anyway to sum up. It could have been a great movie, if it wasn't James Bond. Next time little more focus on the previous movies, and for gods sake Daniel Craig smile. It won't kill you to smile. Connery smiled, Moore smiled, and they did it often, so can you.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Casino Royale : The Best Movie ever? I don't think so...,"First of all i must say that Daniel Craig has put lot of hard work in it, and has done a good job. Yeah ! still i am saying that it's not the BEST movie ever, and here its my review. THE BOND movie we have watched so far and how the character been elevated by the persona's of Sir Sean Connery, Roger Moore and the SOUL of real BOND Pierce Brosnan. That Charm or say that Smirk smile was missing in the movie, the BOND is suppose to be street smart, who fights with intelligence not with his muscle power. the Sound track of the movie keeps you always excited in the flick, which i miss in this movie... when people go for BOND movie they expect to see some cool gadgets, which they can always wish all there life to put there hands on. I had MISSED Q in this movie and i m sure other's too... as it his passion about what he designed and BOND's cheesy arguments with him and proving there genius to each other was a treat to watch. And the BAD Guy should leave a lasting impression on movie lovers... who can even give 007 a scare for his life...I would say if all the above mentioned things were not supposed to be BOND's essential... i don't wanna see 007 doing things like BOURNE IDENTIY.. for that i m HAPPY with MATT DAMON for his great work.I want BOND to do his work... flirt with girls, argue with Q, have the great cars... and fight with villain with his intelligence not with muscle.Ario's !",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What I've been waiting for,"Casino Royale is everything I've been wanting in a bond film for a long time. A great movies that had good pacing, writing, acting and directing. It's just so much and even has some pretty good Easter eggs/nods to past films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond - reimagined!,"Being a Bond fanatic, I was apprehensive when Daniel Craig was picked for the role of the iconic titular spy, particularly when I learned that he'd be portraying the origin story of the famed 007 (or at least his first mission as a double-O agent). Blond hair was bad enough, but the fact that he was neither suave nor charming seemed to work against him. Within the first half an hour of Casino Royale, I was proved wrong on all accounts.The story is an adaptation of Ian Fleming's first novel of the same name, and the plot is essentially the same. Of course, it's updated to the modern day, with the enemies being terrorists and launderers instead of Russians and SMERSH. In this one, an unnamed organization (which arises later on in Quantum of Solace, but of course, I will not spoil that) takes money from a terrorist in Africa, keeps it as a banker, and then uses it behind the banker's back to gamble it (at the cost of lives and legal property). Then, when they are foiled by Bond and lose all of the money, they must win it back in a poker tournament. Le Chiffre, the man behind the money, must play James Bond.The plot is the only real bit of contention I had with the film. It seems far too simple for a true Bond film, and of course, it ends up being such. For that reason the producers added in extra fight scenes, extra twists, and of course, gave Bond a motive beyond just his duty to MI6 to complete the assignment at hand. Along with this is the handy fact that Bond's abilities are almost completely physical - no fancy gadgets, no grappling hooks from watches or hidden laser pens, no knives hidden in the boots, just pure physical ability. He's effectively become the Jason Bourne of spies, but even MORE powerful.His personality has also gone a makeover. Sean Connery's Bond was known for being a womanizing, drinking, smoking and charming man, and women were of no concern to him. In Roger Moore's era, Bond became a much more romantic person, more subtle and clever, and in Dalton's era he became angry, emotional, and vengeful. Brosnan averaged the three predecessors and created a Bond who couldn't always control his emotions, but got the job done; someone who was capable of relying on his charm to get him done, but showing true concern for the women he saved or fought along with. The oft quoted ""It's what keeps me alive"" comment from GoldenEye summarizes this quite succinctly.Daniel Craig's Bond breaks with this for a few obvious reasons. He is Bond before he becomes the super-spy. He's just been newly minted a double-O, and thus abuses his power. He falls in love quickly (although he seems to have a preference for married women), and clings to that love with a tenderness that I would not have expected of Craig, one that manifests outwardly as hard and unyielding but gives way to real care and comfort when his barriers melt. I learned with this film not to have any preconceptions with well-established characters. Vesper Lynd is perhaps the real hero of this, giving him a romantic interest and thus a reason to the film's rhyme. She stirs Bond in a way that we haven't seen since Tracy Bond was gunned down by SPECTRE.Le Chiffre is another weak point, but not by much. His character is well developed, but his villainy seems relatively unnoticed since he does not ever encounter Bond in a fair confrontation. He tortures him - that too, brutally (I cringed as did the entire male population of the theater) - but he never quite confronts him as an equal. Still, he provides a good foil for Bond to develop on. Judi Dench as M is much colder, hardliner, and far more willing to take drastic courses of action than her previous incarnation as a separate M with Pierce Brosnan. This gives her character far more room to develop, however, and creates a unique relationship with Bond that we don't necessarily see in most other films.CR is a promising film, and despite the relative mediocrity of its sequel, it provided a completely new paradigm for Bond, both physically and mentally. Aesthetically, it may be the greatest accomplishment yet for an old, classic film series.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Bond, back to basics","Like many, I was horrified by the appointment of Daniel Craig but by halfway through the film, I was converted. Strip away the superficial differences - gadgets, tuxedo, looks, sleazy charm - and this is still Bond. This is Bond as he was intended to be - a spy, an assassin and a 'problem' solver.Daniel Craig isn't as good looking or charming or in-your-face as the other Bonds, but he brings a subtlety and understated power to the role which had become sadly lacking, instead being replaced in recent years by wholly unrealistic events and characters. This Bond is an enigma and unpredictable, as a good spy should be if he wants to stay alive. The events are believable and the characters complex, what a pleasure!I was a huge fan of Pierce Brosnan as Bond but this film has addressed issues I had with the series I didn't know I had. The film is breathtaking, raw and powerful and Daniel Craig is a resounding success. He did a truly magnificent job despite enormous negative reactions and his increased effort shows. He has reinvented a beloved character and actually improved him, which is no mean feat. I have never been so happy to be so wrong.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Winning hand, but not quiet a full house","Every Bond series is a product of the times. Daniel Craig is the harder reality above the almost ""in-joke"" techie nature of the last few movies. I like the film and for the most part they are very good bringing together something fresh, as far as Bond movies go, but not quite anything fresher than Daniel Craig's face.Horray for dumping corny lines and nice to see Felix back in it. The action scenes were pretty good, though some a little too drawn out. The Airport scene in the movie is almost complete dropped from memory until I read some other reviews recounting the plot. It needed some trimming. There were only two other problems I had in the otherwise enjoyable outing.First, I think they pushed the love story a little too hard. Yes, they are trying to peel the layers off Bond to soften him up a bit, but the dialog was simply better off in another movie. This subplot could have been trimmed a bit also.The only other thing I noticed in the film, was dialog. Or the complete lack of it from Daniel Craig. He does a lot of blue-eyed staring into the lens, but talks very little. Most of the scenes involve other members of the cast talking up a storm, while we hear little from Bond himself. Perhaps that is the tone they were going for, but I know this Craig guy can act, I want to hear him speak.Other than that, I hope they keep up this line of style which is more Jason Bourne than, Inspector Gadget.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Yes, the name is Bond, James Bond ..","If it did nothing else, Casino Royale proved that there is still creative life in the franchise. Cold war or no, Bond still has something to say, is still relevant, and can still impress the hell out of us. The only question to answer is whether James Bond still plays in Peoria, and the opening numbers suggest he does.I think what surprised me most about Craig's Bond is how human he was. He has feelings; he can be reached.. and hurt. He gets tired, scared, desperate, makes mistakes, and worst of all, seems fallible to those around him. To M early on, and Vesper later. How so very different from his predecessors. I like the change. I like the athletic Bond, too. This was one really bad dude, and we knew that long before we saw his pecs.I find myself thinking that Craig's Bond fits in the Bond canon like Powell's Marlowe fits in the Marlowe canon: resourceful, courageous, smart, and dangerous, but also real and human. What makes him most human is that he is not above being debased by the dirty job he has to do. All the killing, the lies, the stolen moments, the dangers ultimately take their toll, and the Bond we see in the denouement in Venice evokes our pity.A very good movie: one of the two or three best in the canon, and a solid 8.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Craig is here for a long time.,"""Casino Royale"" has the answers to all my complaints about the 45-year-old James Bond series, and some I hadn't even thought of. It's not that I didn't love some of the earlier films, like some, dislike others and so on, as that I was becoming less convinced that I ever had to see another one. This movie is new from the get-go. It could be your first Bond. In fact, it was the first Bond; it was Ian Fleming's first 007 novel, and he was still discovering who the character was. The longtime Saltzman-Broccoli producing team could never get their hands on the rights until now, despite earlier misadventures by others using the same title, and maybe it's just as well, because it provides a fresh starting place. And it returns to the family fold; with her father's passing, Barbara Broccoli is producer. Yes, Daniel Craig makes a superb Bond: Leaner, more taciturn, able to be hurt in body and soul, not giving a damn if his martini is shaken or stirred. That doesn't make him the ""best"" Bond, because I've long since given up playing that pointless ranking game; Sean Connery was first to plant the flag, and that's that. But Daniel Craig is bloody damned great as Bond, in a movie that creates a new reality for the character. With ""Casino Royale,"" we get to the obligatory concluding lovey-dovey on the tropical sands, and then the movie pulls a screeching U-turn and starts up again with the most sensational scene I have ever seen set in Venice, or most other places. It's a movie that keeps on giving. This time, no Moneypenny, no Q and Judi Dench is unleashed as M, given a larger role, and allowed to seem hard-eyed and disapproving to the reckless Bond. This time, no dream of world domination, but just a bleeding-eyed rat who channels money to terrorists. This time a poker game that is interrupted by the weirdest trip to the parking lot I've ever seen. This time, no laser beam inching up on Bond's netherlands, but a nasty knotted rope actually whacking his hopes of heirs. But I care about Bond, and about Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), even though I know that (here it comes) a Martini Vesper is shaken, not stirred. Vesper Lynd, however, is definitely stirring, as she was in Bertolucci's wonderful ""The Dreamers."" Sometimes shaken, too. Vesper and James have a shower scene that answers, at last, why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions. The plot centers on a marathon high-stakes poker game, in which Bond will try to deprive Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) of 10 million or more pounds that would go to finance terrorism.

A New Kind of 007...in a good way,"I really enjoyed the Pierce Brosnan era of Bond movies, especially Tomorrow Never Dies, so when it came out that he was being replaced by Daniel Craig, I was a little upset. All those doubts were gone the moment I left the theater...Casino Royale is the ultimate 007 movie! It has amazing action scenes, the antagonist was perfect, great plot twists and the acting could be the best in the entire series. Daniel Craig made his interpretation of Bond his very own by making him vulnerable and prone to making mistakes. I know, one of the appeals to 007 is that he's larger than life, can escape death defying obstacles and save the world all while getting the girl but that can get old and make the movie less suspenseful. All this plays into the story because he just got promoted to 00 status and is learning through his failures. Another thing that is very different, there are very few gadgets or stunts that are so outrageous that no one could possibly survive it in the real word.When I write a review, I try to point out something that I didn't like but like I mentioned before, this is the perfect Bond movie and I dare anyone to point out its faults. I know some traditionalists will gripe that it's missing some of the James Bond staples that have made the series what it is, but this is a new Bond that I think will be remembered as one of the best!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Best Bond yet, by far","This is the right Bond at the right time. Daniel Craig has helped take the Bond franchise from the realm of quasi-comedy to the serious spy/action/thriller. And he has managed to do it with style, wit, and a confidence that seems real rather than manufactured.He is also the first Bond who looks as if he could actually win in hand to hand combat. This helps the believability of the film tremendously. Could any of us imagine Roger Moore in the opening chase scene? I think not.This Bond is also vulnerable, both physically and emotionally. Unlike in any other film, there are moments where you actually question what is going to happen. I've never seen or felt that in a Bond film before.Despite the annoying (and blatantly obvious - does any one really believe Bond would drive a Ford?!?!) product placements, this seemed to me like the first movie that actually wanted to be a movie rather than just an excuse for Bond to say the same old lines and romance a beautiful woman out of her clothes.It will be interesting to see where Mr. Craig and the franchise go from here.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Bod, James Bod","I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about Daniel Craig taking over the role (what was wrong with the last guy - wasshisname again? I forgot already) but after seeing the film at Sony tonight I have to say he's OK. He's certainly ripped... and he looks pretty fly in black tie.He's a more physical and agile Bond than some of the other guys, and the script went a few steps closer to humanizing him too. There's a couple of tender scenes between Bond and Vesper Lynd where this Bond reveals a sensitive side... and I can say without qualm that this is the first time I've ever ended up feeling sorry for James. He's more impish, more sneaky, more vulnerable, and more impervious.. the guy's made of teflon and he's practically a superhero.All that said, the film captures the exotic and glamorous nature inherent in the franchise, there's some boffo violence and superb chase scenes, and they even squeezed in a 1964 Aston Martin because at the end of the day, they know its the TRUE BondMobile (accept no substitutes!) I found the beginning and ending rough, the boyfriend thought there was about 18 minutes too much on screen. We don't want the time back, you definitely want to see this on the big screen (action movies need big screen impact) and I loved the locations - Madagascar, Venice, and Eastern Europe.There's alcohol, gambling, fast cars, grandiose shootemup action, great Bond music, super hot women, yes it's got all the elements. It's also super trendy, I have no doubt other than that this one's gonna seem as much ""of its time"" 25 years from now as the original Casino Royale seems today.We just caught the original last Sunday on cable (as ""research"" in preparation for this night) and while he same basic story's in play, it's not what you'd call 'a remake'. The story's there, but a lot of the time I was either cringing from the ultra-violence or thinking ""whaaa?"" whenever the action went over the top (there's some 'Fear Factor'-worthy stunt work in this picture!)

Strong new character- same plot shortcomings,"I have seen every new Bond film since the late - 60's and seen every one made.Like many, i was disappointed with the demise of Pierce Brosnan as Bond, and nervous about Daniel Craig's appointment. I needn'thave been.Craig brings an icy steeliness to the character not really seen since Connery. I loved Brosnan as Bond, but accept that he lacked menace.In Casino Royale, Bond is probably the most convincing menacing character, on screen. The opening post title chase sequence is not only one of the best Bond chases ever- it ranks with the best full stop.In itself it makes the film worth seeing. So, after these plaudits , whats wrong? The film is too long, and the last third lacks pace.The Card game sequence lacks power because we don't know enough about the players, and goes on for too long. the traditional female glamour associated with bond films is largely absent.Apart from Bonds' girl, and the baddies'girl, there is hardly a female in sight.What there is , is copiously clothed. By contrast, the interest in Bonds body is almost homo-erotic.Wehave the ""Dr No"" Ursula Andress cloned Bond emerging from the water,and close ups of his bare chest and nipples on several occasions apart from his nude torture scene. The girls by contrast are firmly robed.The new Bond theme and incidental music is awful.I am all for contemporising themes.The ""Mission Impossible"" and British TV ""Dr Who"" themes are universally loved, but haveboth een given successful makeovers.This failed dismally.The Venice finale is risible and anti climactic, and little effort is made to capitalise on the dramatic opening fifteen minutes - the film gradually losing momentum thereafter.The overall verdict is that the Bond franchise is safe in the capable, and different hands of Craig.

Worst Bond Movie Ever,"This bond was nothing even close to what the Bond character should be and has always been in the previous movies. I understand that they were trying to show how Bond got started as 007, which could have worked out had it been done properly. Him falling in love was just too much like the movie where he got married only to have his wife killed shortly after. The writers must have been able to come up with something a little more original than that if they tried. They removed Q from the movie again like they tried in the 60's and it was as big a mistake then as it was now. Not nearly enough high tech gadgets in the movie this time, which is another feature that has always been an important part of what makes a James Bond movie a James Bond movie. The real kicker was the end of the movie. It makes you feel like half of the movie is missing, like you need to look for disk 2 in the case. They went a completely different direction with this movie and in my opinion it failed. I feel that this was the worst Bond movie ever, a real let down.!! :(",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond as he should be,"I am a Bond fan and I like it when the films are serious. I liked Sean Connery, Pierce Bronsan and Timothy Dalton when they played Bond, but I didn't like Roger Moore because I felt most of his films were too silly. I was worried when the filmmakers cast Daniel Craig because I didn't know him at the time and I liked the idea of casting Clive Owen as Bond (I still wouldn't mind seeing him in role). However when the reviews came out and especially after seeing the film my worries were rested.After Die Another Day the Bond franchise needed a reboot. Die Another Day was a poor film, being too silly, having a sci-fi plot and just selling out. At the same time Bond finally had a serious rival in the name of Jason Bourne. Bronsan was also getting too old to be play Bond and a new Bond was needed.I like Casino Royale because it took a more darker, gritty, realistic approach. This was refreshing and needed. It shows Bond as a human and a more darker character, showing him more colder, like a man who does kill for Queen and Country should. Bond does get into tough fights, and the fights feel genuine. Another factor why the film is more realistic is the bad guy, Le Chiffe, is a man who sets out to make as much money as possible. He is sadistic and cold hearted. He was played by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen who gave moviegoers a good performance. Bond also doesn't led evils monologue, and just kills them or fight them, which would be the more real response. Eva Green was also a very good performer. She played Vesper Lynd, the Bond girl. She is portrayed as a strong character, having to make her a super-spy like Bond. She also felt like a very character, and unlike other Bond girls Eva Green career has actually improved after the role and is now an A-lister.I loved the action in the film as well. Die Another Day used CGI (and poor CGI at that) which shouldn't be used in Bond films unless they is no other option. Martin Campbell took the film back to basics and the action was performed by traditional stunt work. The fight scenes were excellent, and I loved the chase scene in the beginning of the film as just amazing.I can't wait for Quantum of Solace to come out and hope that it can build on the groundwork Casino Royale laid out.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

"Bond, stripped down, lean and mean, yet 007 to the core.","In my 52 years, since 'Doctor No' onward, from the wild and windswept movie drive-ins in Kansas, I feel like I grew up with this 007 guy.A Bond movie was and is forevermore ""the ticket"" if you want to see great action, beautiful women, and exotic location shots. And oh yeah, all of it soaked with that soundtrack, variations of which comprise best movie theme of all time.Casino Royal knocked my socks off, plain and simple.With par-excellent direction, editing and cinematography, it's really the brain+brawn combo that is highlighted throughout. There is such a level of detail in these scenes that it will likely take a few viewings to really catch it all. But the real payoff here is the story behind the story.Basically you ""get it"" that James Bond is fallible. He's not just steely-eyed-mean. Not just focused to almost super human levels. But also yes, dare I say it; He actually makes mistakes, which is THE thing that makes this character one of the most powerful Bonds put ever. As with the mythical heros of the past it's the flawed aspect, that Achilles' heal factor that really oils this theme machine. It is also an understatement to say that Daniel Craig's complex edge-of-your-seat portrayal is not to be missed.This 2006 entry depicts Bond's beginning. Low on gadgetry, nearly devoid of the trademark one-liners, and get ready for this Bond fans..... nearly all the chase scenes are on foot!!! And I'm not talking about simple chases here. We are treated with complicated, unusually heart pounding, gritty, death defying high altitude jaw dropping leaps and falls, bone jarring crash-throughs, flesh ripping, bullets flying, surprising cut-offs and twists in abundance, the likes of which I have never before seen. And all the while there are glimpses of intellect-in-motion as this 007 continuously calculates the next strategic turn as if in some rapid action, extremely physical game of chess.But again, in my opinion it's the fallibility aspect that really fleshes out the James Bond character in full (perhaps for the first time ever). Add to this: impeccable taste, enduring confidence, unmatched style, riveting physical capability and an edgy coolness taken to a dramatic new level, all of it shaken - not stirred, and you probably have the best Bond movie that has ever been made.Joseph Maas, LinkSky.com",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Wow,"In my opinion this movie is, by far, the best all around movie I have ever seen. It has amazing action sequences that are both believable, very entertaining, and unique.

The storyline is very true to the book and the basic plot is very simple, yet serious and significant. Daniel Craig's Bond is completely different from all the previous Bonds, but in an entirely good way.

The best Bond movie ever,"Casino Royale is the best Bond movie I've seen. Granted, I've yet to see a few fan favorites (including From Russia with Love and Thunderball, which are on Spike tonight), but this beats Goldfinger and probably even my favorite, Dr. No.The direction and script, the two most important issues to me, are fantastic. Martin Campbell kicks his own GoldenEye's ass by a mile. The tone is dark and moody, the way the novel was written. There are no qualms of production quality or direction here. The poker scenes, fight scenes, and development scenes are flawless.The script is almost perfect. It stays true to the novel, albeit modernized. For example, terrorists are now the enemies, not Russians, and the game at hand is poker, not baccarat. The only problem with the script is that there are some unnecessary scenes, which make it drag out in the middle, and part of the unnecessary problems include a pretty worthless Bond girl. It should also be noted that it's a whopping 150 minutes, which is time consuming. It does keep you entertained through and through, but the first half hour to hour are really inessential to the story.The action scenes, which is why most people like 007, are fantastic. They are few of them, proportionally, however. The first action scene is Bond chasing an African bomb maker, and includes some far-fetched stunts. However, these stunts are believable by Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan standards. There is also a car chase on an air-strip, and a two-on-Bond stairwell duel. The last action scene, in Venice, is both heart-breaking and action-packed. But all these scenes are great.Not only is Casino Royale a fantastic Bond movie, it's an equally cool poker movie. In case you've been living under a rock and haven't seen any marketing for this movie, you know the story. Bond has to outplay La Chiffre, a French poker expert who supplies bad guys money he wins from Poker games. If he loses- which no one expects he ever will- the people he owes money will kill him, which will disrupt the cash flow of all terrorists organizations.When I heard they were adapting Casino Royale, I expected an enormous movie with the most luxurious casinos and exotic players. I expect cool poker scenes and high stakes. I got what I expected, which is rare for this era of disappointing films. La Chiffre is the master of poker, he even does cool tricks. Bond defeats him with style in which is possibly the most edge-of-your-seat poker game ever.The cast is great. There are good actors, yes, but Bond isn't just about good acting. It is also about good-looking women and cool characters. Both the bond girls are hot (really hot) and the bad guy is bad. Le Chiffre is bad to the bone. Though he is not as stylized as previous villains (his power isn't too cool, he's a math expert), he is truly evil. He tortures Bond, and almost castrates him. You know he's evil when he cries blood. Daniel Craig is better than Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, and George Lazenby easily, and is probably on par with Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan. He's down-to-earth, but cool at the same time. He's very human, but makes you feel inferior at the same time.Go see this movie. It's got great directors, screenwriters, and actors. This is the best Bond yet. And it's in the top 250! Overall, I give this film an A+.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

As newly promoted ""00"" in this prequel, this bond was believably human...bleeding and scraped after every fight, vulnerable in love, yet completely self sufficient. Even my wife who reluctantly attended after much cajoling, was impressed...I suspect mostly with Bond's bod. She even suggested (several times) maybe it was time for me to rejoin the gym.

Critics of Daniel Craig swallow your words and swallow them now!,"First off as soon as Daniel Craig was announced as the new Bond there was a wave of criticism. Apparently he was too blonde, too fragile, can't drive etc. And what he has done in this film is take those words and shove them straight back down their throats. Also more important than that he has breathed new life into the 007 series we all know and love. After seeing the ridiculous 'Die Another Day' I wondered if the Bond legacy would last much longer, and I can tell you that Casino Royale is just pure brilliance. Basically restarting the entire saga it shows Bond getting his 00 status and embarking on his first major mission. Not impressed yet well the way it is delivered is great, Bond seems to have more of a personality (with less of the cheese gone now) and a tendency to make the wrong decisions. He gets hurt more often which make him look more like a spy as apposed to the gymnastic, rambo like superhero we have come to see in the latest films. This shows best near the start where Bond is chasing a very gymnastic bomb maker and ends making the moves he does look very basic and done without confidence, and I found this brilliant. There is point of the film that you see the old bond seep through. ""shakened or stirred sir"" ""do I look like I give a damn"" That just proves the gambles that the creators pulled off were just pure genius. What I can say after seeing this film is give Daniel a chance and go and see it, I can guarantee that it will not be a disappointment.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A Bloody Good Show, Mr. Craig","The charm of James Bond films have mostly eluded me over the course of my 31 years. In fact, I've only seen one other as far as I can recall (""Octopussy"" -- and by the way, how did that movie ever get released with THAT title?) and I remember virtually nothing about it. I don't think I'm missing much. From the isolated moments I've been able to catch on T.V. here and there, Bond movies look pretty awful -- not, mind you, awful in the tongue-and-cheek, isn't-this-fun kind of way, but awful in the I-wonder-what-else-is-on-T.V.-right-now kind of way.Well, Daniel Craig may make me a Bond convert, at least for the next few films. ""Casino Royale"" is a blast -- it's an action-packed adrenaline jolt of a movie, full of beautiful people and beautiful locales, and it's a testament to its ability to entertain that I didn't once look at my watch during its 144 minute running time.Daniel Craig looks like a bulldog, runs like the terminator, and has steely blue eyes that usually match the color of whatever body of water he happens to be standing in front of at the moment. The moment he appears on screen, you get the sense that he's out to quash once and for all all of the naysayers out there who assume that he'll make a lousy Bond. And boy does he. He could take on Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan at the same time with both hands tied behind his back. Sean Connery maybe would give him a run for his money, but I suspect Craig would still pummel him severely. As for his sex appeal, I'll leave that to the ladies to assess, but if my wife's reaction to Craig's entrance half way through the film in a tuxedo is any indication, he's not lacking in that department either.It's almost laughable how regressive these movies are. Women are treated as nothing more than objects to either seduce or save, and Bond usually refers to the lead female in this as nothing more than ""the girl.""

Bond Begins  A Royal Treatment,"""Casino Royale"" (2006) directed by Martin Campbell is different from the Bond movies I've seen but it is very good. Based on the first novel in the Bond series, it shows James Bond (Daniel Craig) in the beginning of his career. His mission is to destroy a corrupt banker LeChiffre (Mads Mikkelsen} at the poker tables where he never loses and wins a lot of money to supply the various terrorists' organizations. To accomplish this extremely dangerous task, Bond has to rely mostly on himself; there are no fancy gadgets that Q would provide him with. There is no Q either. I think it is the only Bond movie that lets us look rather briefly behind the Super-agent facade to see more human side of Bond. I don't remember any other Bond movie where he would be tortured in the way that made me truly uncomfortable. I also believe that it is the only (or one of very few) movie where Bond fell in love and as the result of that affair, he would never fell in love again. I have only seen Daniel Craig in two movies before ""Casino Royale"", ""The Mother"" (2003) and last year's ""Munich"" but he was memorable in both. As new James Bond, he is fabulous - a marvel to look at, he has unbelievably blue eyes, he is in a great shape (remember, he has to rely only on himself while chasing, fighting, shooting, and killing bad guys) and he delivers a very convincing James Bond, sharp, tough but vulnerable - the Bond for a new millennium.8.5/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The best Bond since the Connery Classics 'From Russia with Love' & 'Goldfinger',"Casino Royale succeeds on many different levels. It gives us a fresh new face, a prequel-type story, and the superb action we've all come to expect from the franchise. The action scenes are superlative with some of the best stunt-work I've seen in recent years. Craig's bond is more realistic..athletic. For the first time, Bond's womanizing, training, and his cold-blooded nature are given true substance, instead of being an assumption(or at least the first time since On Her Majesty's Secret Service). We go on an emotional roller-coaster with Bond, feeling his pain, mourning his loss, finally realizing who he really is...The lack of gadgets is more than made up for in beautiful women, fast cars, and truly incredible action. The cinematography and overall look of the film is superb. I like the opening song, but the credit design could have been a little better. One of the few weaknesses. Better credit design and more gadgets and this would be my first 10/10 Bond film. Craigs one liners are sharp and witty, yet Bond seems to have outgrown the silliness and CGI, and graduated to the big time. 'Casino Royale' has solidified Craig's hold on 'Bond' for quite some time, and rejuvenated the franchise. This is easily the best Bond in over 20-30?-40? years and ranks up there with the top two or three in the entire series. I'm sure that may not sit well with some of the Bond ''traditionalist""..but IT IS that good.last thought....with the suspect acting we've seen from the female leads over the last six or seven films, Green is a breath of fresh air. 90/100 Bravo!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The name's Craig. Daniel Craig,"Bond is back (well... Craig is here for the first time)- with a vengeance! Great movie and ditto performance by Daniel Craig. All doubts about him as 007 can now be laid to rest. He portrays the rogue Bond, similar to Connery's 007. He goes with the times: spiky hair and ever that PDA-cellphone gadget which is becoming very familiar around us (didn't need Q to explain that). And the psycho-analysis by M and Vesper, something Connery's 007 would have been loath to undergo. The story is well-paced with ""all the usual refinements"" in the plot. And when 007 gets romantically involved you know what her destiny is (ref. OHMSS), we can't have a committed Bond next time, can we. The only reference I caught to the 1967 CR with Sellers/Niven, was Mathis mentioning the cavalry. With this CR, EON and Craig have done themselves a dubious favor: the bar is now set so high, it will be hard to top next time. And oh yes, the last five seconds, a masterful find!Eric Liong Curacao - Dutch Caribbean",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What hand will 007 x 21 give you?,"The twenty-first (21!) James Bond flick is expertly directed, well acted, beautifully photographed. It is solid entertainment. So why only seven stars? Because it is entertainment and no more. Before hurling words such as ""snob"" and ""curmudgeon"" at me, consider that it's entirely possibly - and highly desirable - for food (and movies) to be both tasty and nutritious. ""Casino Royale"" is excellent, glorious... popcorn.The reason to bring this up right at the top is that ""Casino Royale"" hints at substance, of character development, of depth - but it doesn't deliver. The new Bond, Daniel Craig, is more complex than most of the macho cardboard figures of the past. He has some ""issues,"" some vulnerabilities, and he falls in love the way no flashy establishment killer should. (Speaking of killers, British intelligence is using the new film for recruiting, while denying that agents, of any rank, have a ""license to kill."") Twenty-one in the series of films is not the only impressive figure. It's been a half a century-plus since Ian Fleming wrote ""Casino Royale,"" his first James Bond novel, and 40 years since the appearance of the first film version. You know when a series has ""legs"" when you start repeating titles.Four decades is a long time. With a changing world, there is a different script, involving - of course - terrorists. And those who finance them. You finance terrorists by selling weapons of mass destruction, or, once Bond catches you or blows up your weapons, by playing Texas Holdem at the Casino Royale. (Neal Purvis and Robert Wade are responsible for the screenplay.) Martin Campbell (of two Zorro movies and of ""Vertical Limit"") directed ""Casino Royale"" smoothly and expertly, but unable to overcome instances of banality in the script. Campbell is also perhaps partially responsible (along with producers) for the 144-minute length of the film, which you may regard as ""getting your money's worth"" or as excessive, resulting in bang-bang scenes that go on and on.The women of the new Bond are less pulchritudinous than the model/bunnies of the past, and have more soul... up to a point. Eva Green, Caterina Murino, and Ivana Milicevic are entertaining and forgettable, even as the film itself is. The great Judi Dench, as M, is great indeed, presenting a memorable character with marvelous economy. Giancarlo Giannini, as Mathis, is a class act, as always. The new super-villain is a Danish actor, Mads Mikkelsen, playing Le Chiffre. He is scary enough, especially when - rather routinely - a smidgen of blood is discharged from his eye for no discernible reason.Bond's Aston Martin has fewer visible gadgets than those of the old times, but its glove compartment is conveniently furnished with a defibrillator. Just as there is an invariable rule in the theater that if you show a gun in act one, somebody will be shot in act two, if there is a defibrillator in your glove compartment, somebody's heart is going to stop (temporarily, one hopes). However, there will be no spoiler here about the identity of the victim or the outcome of the medical procedure.

"Bond is back, with a Veangance.","Casino Royale begins in Black and white, foreshadowing the more dark and violent tone that follows Daniel Craig around the world for two and a half hours. Director David Campbell has breathed life back into what some feared as a dead franchise. Brushing all worries aside, Craig was almost perfect for this new and updated version of James Bond. Although Craig is not as handsome or sleek in his demeanor as the previous Bonds, his grittier attitude does match his looks. It seems MGM put all the pieces of the new Bond puzzle together quite well, but missed one of the most important pieces, the Bond girl. The new Bond girl, played by the anorexic looking and consistently dull import Eva Green, does bring the film down as a whole.The action in Casino Royale is stellar, snatching all of Bonds usual attention away from his futuristic gadgets and luxurious cars, and centering on pure adrenaline pumping action. Casino Royale may also have one of the best opening credit montages to grace a Bond film, coupled with the catchy theme song brought to us by Chris Cornell. Casino Royale was filmed across the world, picking beautiful locales to compliment the exquisite camera work, bringing us closer to a classier James Bond film.Another interesting point that should be brought up is the lack of one main villain in this supposed prequel to the life of this promiscuous secret agent. The villain in this is more the greed that can persuade seemingly anyone into the life of corruption. This installment of the franchise does zero in more on Bond's abatement from arrogance, and his struggle with becoming a more efficient agent. Casino Royale is a definite see for the Bond fan, and any newcomer alike.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"But...it's not Bond, James Bond","This is NOT a bad movienot by any means. Then why the relatively low rating? Because, it's just NOT Bond, James Bond any more. The production values in this movie are quite highthe storyline is decentand even Daniel Craig, blond hair and all, is respectable as 007 if you like the very dry no-nonsense sort (and, I'm not talking about his shaken or stirred  because he apparently doesn't give a damn this time around). However, this movie didn't even have the decency to rip-off its predecessors. Instead, it's a complete rip-off of the Ludlum ""Bourne"" series (of movies anyway). And, I love the Bourne series by the waybecause it's Bourne and not 007. Now I can't even like 007 because it's unique unto itself and I refuse to like it because it's like Bourne.So I guess we've (they've) finally come to the end of the road as far as James Bond movies go. They've started to remake the old movies which I guess was bound to happen sooner or later (amazing how idea-less Hollywood can be at times). The stories will be much darker and without much in the way of humorjust what the new generation needs. As for Casino Royale (2006), I will not watch it again as there is no joy in doing so and I already know what's going to happen. Once was definitely enough. Give me Casino Royale (1967) any dayat least it is unique unto itself (even though it's not even close to being one of the better Bonds'but as a satire, it's damn entertaining). Give me the Connery, Brosnan, Dalton, and Lazenby versions of Bond (you can keep Moore's versionwhat a 'dweeb!'). And please, give me the cold war and the old James back...it was a far more interesting time!!",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A bright restart for Bond,"Directed by Martin Campbell and produced by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, it has script by Robert Wade, Neal Purvis and Paul Haggis. This is the twenty-first film of the franchise and the first film in the new era of James Bond, embodied by the participation of Daniel Craig, who succeeds Pierce Brosnan in the role of the famous 007. Judi Dench remained in the role of M, Jeffrey Wright resurrects the American spy Felix Leiter, Giancarlo Giannini gives life to Rene Mathis, Eva Green played the bond-girl Vesper and Mads Mikkelsen gave life to the villain, Le Chiffre.In this film, a new James Bond, recently elevated to the status of 00 agent, will try to catch a gangland banker which helps fund arms dealers and terrorists around the world. For this, he will need to participate in a risky poker game, where the villain will seek to multiply his money.This is one of the best Bond film's to date and marks the relaunch of the franchise, after the resounding failure of ""Die Another Day"". Daniel Craig is quite different from any other actor who played the role: hard, extremely violent, more a killer than a gentleman, he manage to updates his character to the new millennium. But this new approach doesn't merely update it, it also gave him more credibility and plausibility. In the public's mind, it's really possible that, if there are spies, they're similar to what Craig shows as Bond. And, like any human, Craig's Bond also fails, makes mistakes and is fallible. It's far from being a hero or a good guy. On the other hand, the villain, played by Mads Mikkelsen, is also credible and is not exaggerated by stereotypes of other villains. Discreet, quiet and, at the same time, cruel and relentless, Le Chiffre is played brilliantly by Mikkelsen, managing to pluck some shivers from our spine. Eva Green was also impeccable in the role of Vesper, a difficult and mysterious bond-girl, which perfectly combines beauty, seduction and mystery, becoming one of the most beautiful and mysterious bond-girls of the franchise. It was also the second woman to make Bond fall in love for real. The script have also fairly good aspects: the main theme, the financing of terrorism, which is very present today, or the chronological resumption of history, which allowed a more accurate approach to Fleming's book and a fresh look to the main character (in a break with previous films, particularly Brosnan's, who totally putted Fleming aside and created new scripts from scratch). Some scenes of this movie also became memorable, such as the climactic scene, in which Bond tries to save his beloved of a Venetian palace that sinks under their feet. The opening sequence of this film is, perhaps, one of the most striking ever. It was created by Daniel Kleinman and stands out for the use of pictures of playing cards, the lack of women's silhouettes (justified by Bond feel true love for Vesper) and ""You Know My Name"" song, composed and performed by Chris Cornell.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A truly great 007 film.  One of the top 5 of the whole franschise!,"I loved this film. I never had a big problem with Daniel Craig being Bond, but never thought he was ideal either. And after seeing Casino Royale my feelings have not changed. But it wasn't so much Craig's job at playing Bond that made this film great - though he WAS good. It was the writing, the directing, and the cinematography. All of this combined, along with a philosophical shift on the part of the producers, made this a very memorable film. The action was intense and real, but never overdone or staged looking. A lot of action films seem to want to film the action sequences with the goal of making the hero look totally cool and Competent. The action here was more about the characters will and emotions. I have only a few minor complaints about this film. I would like to have seen the opening titles for Casino Royale exactly as they have for the last 20 films, with a circle on the screen following Bond as he walks along before suddenly turning to fire. That was not in this movie. I guess I'm just a bit nostalgic about these sort of things. In terms of music, I would like to have heard the original theme a bit more. But overall this is a great Bond film. It ranks as one of the best of the whole franchise. In the future I hope we continue to see the development of Craig as Bond. And I also hope that some of the features of previous films, like gadgetry, humor, and bizarre villains. These were important aspects in the history of Bond and I would like to see them appropriately integrated into this new era. I would also imagine we'll be meeting a new Q and Moneypenny at some point.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Daniel Craig Is The Best Bond!,"MGM when casting g for the star role in Casino Royale selected Daniel Craig and what a selection it turned out to be. Daniel Craig is magnificent as 007 James Bond.
Craig plays him as a International agent rough and tumble. Watching Daniel Craig is watching a real movie star.Dont confuse this tremendous action packed film with that of a David Niven light comedy Casino Royale.Casino Royale turned out to be a worldwide smash hit grossing over a $1 Billion dollars.I strongly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Will actually see again in theater,"I admit it, I get out to the movies rarely. Very few over the last several years have motivated me to make plans to actually go out. This one I had to see; it was BOND, my goofy family LOVES Bond movies. We all have our favorite Bond actors too and argue their merits/downfalls with glee. Saw this with my brother and Pop last night and am taking my husband out to see it as soon as possible!This Bond movie didn't need the fluffier trappings of the franchise to tell the story (No Q. No outlandish gadgets. No super-villain hideouts that turn into space ships. No Moneypenny to banter with.), the plot was tight, the action scenes were more believable without losing any excitement, the acting was significantly better than past Bonds, and the 2 1/2 hours flew by all too fast! The movie also had just enough grit to remind the viewer that Ian Fleming did have a background in espionage.Oh yeah, and the little tongue-in-cheek comments were delivered w/o smarminess - LOVED that! I've been a Sean Connery-as-Bond fan since I was quite young and think Daniel Craig lives up to Connery's toughness & charm yet takes Bond a few steps further as far as depth of character.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Daniel Craig Although A Good Actor  Is Too Old For The Part,"Everything else has already been said about the movie so I will comment on the lead actor who I think is all wrong for this franchise.Daniel Craig is too old an actor to portray a young Bond especially if they want to make further movies. He is almost 40 but he looks considerably older and even if they buffed him up for the part he still looks too old.Botox? And he also has a Slavic look about him that is a bit distracting.Gez I seem to be tearing this poor man apart but they did throw him out there as the next saviour of the Bond franchise and he took the bait. Rightly or wrongly he is James Bond ...for now.A younger actor of say 25-30 would have been better as he could have matured along with future movies.I heard that Henry Cavhill was being considered but was too young/pretty(?) or perhaps not experienced enough BUT truthfully Craig is just not Bond material and PLEASE that does not mean he is not a good actor.Let's face it , he just isn't charismatic enough to pull this off and horrors! I cringe to say this NOT GOOD LOOKING ENOUGH. I recently saw him in Enduring Love (2004) and even in that where he played an author with glasses and a satchel , he still looked like a geeky gangster and I kept thinking ""This can't be the next James Bond!!"" And yes he was very good in the part.Will there be another Bond Movie? Well they had better hurry as Craig is not getting any younger. Apparently one is to come out in 2008 so we'll see how that fairs at the box office. This one was quite successful but I'm not sure it was for the right reasons.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not bad but not as great as the critics said.,"I finally got to watch this movie last night after several of my mates had been raving about it being the best Bond film ever.Mmmmmm,so why wasn't I blown away with it?The first thing I have to say is that,as with so many movies nowadays,it is definitely too long by at least 20 minutes.If it had lasted about 110 minutes or so it would have been so much better.I must admit that the action scenes are very well done and the movie is great to look at with several gorgeous locations.The story isn't too bad,it just takes a long time to reach it's conclusion.The acting?For the main characters I rated Daniel Craig(James Bond)as very good,Mads Mikkelsen(Le Chiffre) as good,Eva Green(Vesper Lynd) as no more than average with an accent that seemed to alter in several scenes.She didn't convince me as a Bond girl I'm afraid.I have to say also that I found Judi Dench(M) a bit wooden and I have felt that in all of her performances as M so far.I guess the main talking point here is does Daniel Craig cut it as Bond.I have to say the the stick he got for taking on the role was ridiculous and good for him that he put in such a solid performance under so much pressure.I am still not 100% sure that he is a Bond though,but as an action hero he definitely cuts the mustard and he is the best thing in this movie.This is not a bad film but I enjoyed Terminator 3 more as an action movie because it moved at a faster pace and the length of the film was just right.I know a lot of people will give me stick for that opinion,but it is one I believe to be true.I was in a dilemma about what score to give this,a 6 or a 7.I finally decided on 7 because Daniel Craig deserves praise for a convincing performance of a character that I am still not sure really suits him.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A worthy addition to the Bond collection,"After months of anticipation, 'Casino Royale' was revealed to be, at least for me, a rather enjoyable thriller. Perhaps it wasn't the best Bond but it was a worthy addition to the collection.Based upon the first of Ian Flemming's novels, 'Casino Royale' sees Bond newly promoted to '00' status meaning he now has a license to kill and this is a license he intends to put to very good use. His assignment as 007 first leads him to a terrorist cell then to LeChiffre, who is raising his funds in a high-powered poker game that he can't afford to lose.This was a darker, more aggressive Bond and Daniel Craig definitely captured that essence to the character, a man who's not afraid to kill or to put his life on the line because he's still young enough not to care. This Bond was also more human in that he can feel pain and can be injured even if he does endured it all with military prowess. I did feel Craig was a shade too old for the role, however, as the arrogance and ego of this younger Bond would have suited a man who looked no older than his mid-thirties and was still relishing the novelty of his new '00' status. He might be in his late thirties but he looks a good decade older. That said, now this 'origins' storyline is over, I think he will be better suited as an older, veteran Bond in subsequent films (although had they cast a younger Bond, he would have been able to do more films than Craig is surely destined to do). Judi Dench was excellent as always though as she reprised her role as the cool, self-assured 'M' but this time it seemed fitting there was almost a touch of concern in her tone towards Bond, who is meant to be still quite fresh-faced in his duties.The actual plot-line was very involving, shifting between multiple villains in the tradition of the novel. I imagine some folk might find the poker scenes a bit tiring, especially if they are unfamiliar with the game, but the action and fight scenes more than make up for that as Bond proves that he didn't spend his training days learning how to sip martinis and wear a tux. The violence is raw and all necessary in comparison with other action films where it's added because it looks good or will make a nice scene in the video game. Also, the whole set up of M16 reflects on a post September 11th era where intelligence services are both under pressure to produce results and under surveillance by the press to ensure they don't abuse their powers and this works well to compliment the moodier tone of the film and Bond.Yet there were a number of flaws I found with 'Casino Royale'. The first was the length; a good twenty minutes towards the end could have been shaved down. Secondly, the villains, including LeChiffre, lacked substance. Not enough effort was made to give them personality and make them more three-dimensional. The result was, it was hard to care one way or the other what happened to them compared with other villains in previous Bond films that either left the audience admiring their audacity or eager to see them die. Also, Vesper-- the Bond girl-- was a another character who lacked depth and it was hard to understand how Bond suddenly fell for her when there was little chemistry between them nor were there any scenes to suggest they felt a romantic connection. Product placement of Sony and Ford was a major annoyance in the film to the point where I've been put off both after being overly-advertised to. It just cheapened the film seeing Sony products being shown off right, left and centre. That, and a better song could have been chosen for accompanying the title credits, especially since a film where a new actor is debuting as Bond deserves something more memorable.Personally, Craig isn't the best Bond nor was this the best Bond film but 'Casino Royale' surpassed my expectations and I'm sure other Bond fans who doubted him will probably find him, at the very least, acceptable in the role and will be willing to give him a chance in another film. It will be interesting to see how he depicts the character shifting from headstrong, aggressiveness to collected maturity (yet still deadly) as Bond gains more experience. One last thing, this film was rated a 12A but, parents, do think twice about bringing your younger, more sensitive children as there are some scenes which can be quite brutal.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Best Reboot Ever,"This is probably the best Bond movie, definitely stays together with the likes of Goldfinger and other defining classics. For sure the best of Daniel Craig's five appearances as James Bond. Just love it. I have just rewatched it in 4k quality and I highly recommend the scene where James Bond meets Vesper Lynd for the first time, sophisticated and witty dialogue at its best. The story arc keeps you glewed to your seat and never gets boring despite the long running time. The tragic ending somehow fits the movie's undertone that you cannot have all what you desire. What an absolutely fabulous reboot of the James Bond franchise!!! Thanks and kudos to Martin Campbell!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Certainly over-hyped but still rather enjoyable,"The relentless hype machine would have you believe that Daniel Craig is ""The best Bond ever!"" and that Casino Royale is the film that ""saves the Bond franchise!"" None of that may be particularly true. The Bond franchise may have needed a little tweaking and updating but it certainly didn't need to be saved. And while Craig is very good in the role can we let him do more than one of these before we dismiss all who came before? But once you get past all the breathless hype you do have a very good film.Casino Royale is, at least compared with the slew of films which preceded it, a serious James Bond movie, if there can be such a thing. Many of the Bond films have been overly campy and at times ridiculously over the top. Not here. This is a much more grounded film and the new tone works wonderfully. This movie actually seems believable. Even the action scenes, which in many Bond films were ludicrously impossible, ring true. You get the sense that this stuff could actually happen which is refreshing. And happily, the film is less about action and more about plot, about engaging characters and the dramatic situations they find themselves in. Yes, this Bond film goes in a different direction and it pays off.Now, for all the positives this is certainly not a perfect film. It definitely drags at times and probably would have benefited from some scenes being left on the cutting room floor. A poker game that takes up a rather healthy chunk of the film's running time is certainly vital to the plot but definitely slows things down. But, as a whole, the film works. The film certainly looks terrific with the visuals as stunning as you would expect from the Bond franchise. The key roles are all performed well. Craig may not be the best Bond ever, at least not yet, but he is certainly very good, entirely believable in all aspects of the role. As always, this Bond movie comes with plenty of villains but Mads Mikkelsen is the key bad guy and his performance is terrific. Appropriately menacing and much more believable than many prior Bond villains. As the requisite Bond girl, Eva Green may not be quite as good here as Craig and Mikkelsen but she holds her own. You get the sense Green and Craig could have had a little better chemistry but it's a minor quibble. In the end, everything comes together rather nicely. The story, while a little slow moving at times, does hold your attention and ultimately goes off in some surprising directions. Add in the fine acting performances, the great visuals, some riveting action and you have a film that's definitely worth your while. Maybe not an all-time classic but a very good film which makes you anxious to see where Bond goes from here.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Casino Royale  review from Rajan Laad a big Hollywood watcher,"well i thought the movie was very very close to Ian Fleming and in some cases made slight improvements. i thought Daniel Craig was a terrific bond made me forget abut the rest while i was watching the movie. he reminded me of Dalton in his realistic portrayal of bond, he also according to me is the most dangerous and unpredictable bond since Connery. i can imagine this guy being a ruthless killer. pierce seems like a pussy cat in comparison. he much like Dalton displayed the moral dilemma of a spy also the insubordination with M.the movie had a great beginning and went on very well especially the poker game and the twists. i still do feel that the film could be chopped by 30 minutes to make it more compact but i really am not too sure which parts should have gone . Eva green played the very complex vesper to perfection, since i had already read the novel i was analyzing her performance and she displayed the right proportions of moral conflict and duplicitous-ness. she also displayed a tenderness and vulnerability of a women caught in a web of deceipt. the villain was also very good for a change he wasn't some crackpot with an outrageous plan of 'world domination' . but by an large they managed to mix grit with fun and a great bit of casting in Daniel. all in all they were better than all the Brosman films.so i give it a 4/5.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This Was NEEDED,"Pierce Brosnan (whom I have enjoyed in numerous projects) stunk like Pepi Le Pew as James Bond. Although not all the responsibility for that era of films should fall on his shoulders alone, too much reliance on gimmickry didn't help.Enter Daniel Craig. On reflection he can be argued as the greatest Bond to date. For a little context I grew up with Roger Moore so he was my favourite, and then in later years I shifted towards Connery. Craig though has been mega.This film has it all, super action, a slick look to it and a tough guy with some tools, not Inspector Gadget!Not just one of the great Bond films but also a great action movie in its on right.A much needed reinvigoration to the series and great to see :)",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Brilliant Bond Reboot,Daniel Craig's first Bond film is a masterpiece. It is a very complicated plot - but once you understand it - the journey of the spy's quest to foil a plot by (Quantom/Spectre) the enemy agents it's really a great story. There are a lot of enemy agents and each one of them has a highly complex motive. Bond takes them all on. He has a major babe that he puts the moves on. This is a look at Bond more like how he is in the books - with some tragedy and depth. Also - some of the best musical scores in the series.,10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This is the real Englishman I would expect to see as Bond,"Daniel Craig..I salute you. The hard-nut style works perfectly as Bond (whom I've always seen as a sophisticated SAS-type, comfortable in his skin for the work he has to do, intelligent and culturally well-travelled). Pierce Brosnan never filled that role for me, he was too well-coiffed and perfumed.Daniel Craig looks like he will rip your head off if necessary, and yet look entirely at home in the Casino - because this sort of risk-taker would be! And a true Blond Englishman to boot - that's a real Englishman in my book.With his piercing, steely blue eyes, rugged, streetwise attitude and rugby-player build, he entirely took over the role of a credible Bond. I would want this sort of man protecting my Government interests. And his sexy transformation in the sophistication of his dress suit worked perfectly. Yet, underneath the hard exterior, their emanates a complex emotional person and Daniel portrayed this perfectly, too. He looked like he was hurt and beaten...human, not super hero.The film chases round the world as usual - yes, maybe for the sake of just the pretty locations, but it did make us feel like spies ourselves.I thought the quick recovery from a poison was a bit of a stretch and I didn't like the Venice scenes of a Palazzo collapsing (how did the British Government get out of that one?) but for sheer spectacle the crane jumping scene, however implausible, worked the audience into a dizzying start to the film.The casino scenes were beautiful and of the right length to involve us. Eva Green left me cold, but at least it felt like a real liaison (not that I was ever convinced Bond had fallen for her)All that was needed was a less jarring score to the film along the lines of 'You only live twice' or 'Diamonds are Forever' and I would have given a ten.That said, there is at last, a Bond that fits the original mould and one that, as a Brit, I can feel proud of.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"The Name's Craig, Daniel Craig.","Unlike many of the naysayers, I was happy with the announcement that Daniel Craig had been cast as James Bond. I had seen Craig in ""Layer Cake"" and loved his performance, thinking that the character of ""Mr. XXX"" would be a good template for him to base Bond. This having been said, Craig makes an excellent Bond, down to his haircut, overall demeanor and chemistry with Vesper Lynd.""Casino Royale"" is, thankfully, a very literal adaptation of the Ian Fleming novel, the first in the franchise to take so few liberties. Having read the book makes the film slightly monotonousreaders will know exactly how the plot turns outso seeing Craig in an original Bond storyline should be an excellent treat. Perhaps the films greatest, and thus far unspoken, performance belongs to Eva Green as Vesper. Green captures her character better than any male performer has captured Bondand that's saying something since Craig and Timothy Dalton were very close to the ""literary Bond."" As such, Green is very much Craig's equal, a powerful leading female better than all of Bond's ""strong female characters"" (read: Jinx) that have appeared in the past.Overall, ""Royale"" marks an exciting new direction for the series.

"best recent Bond, but flawed","The new Bond is great (he's not a pretty boy) and Dench is outstanding as always. The emphasis on character as well as plot was definitely a good idea. This is hugely better than recent Bond flicks which probably accounts for all the great reviews. Fun to watch BUT the editing was no good. There are scenes that don't belong and there are missing scenes. There are also plot holes. It's a shame. A little more work on tightening up the plot and it would have been terrific.The acting is good, the sex is unfortunately only fair. The action is a bit frenetic as always in recent Bond movies (whatever happened to suspenseful action a la Goldfinger). The violence is sometimes extreme. Personally I think the movie should be rated R for the violence but the MPAA morons seem to think horrific violence is fine for children but god forbid they should see a nipple.",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
What a Disappointment,"What is it that you love about the Bond films? The music? The gadgets? The fascinating women? The utter charm and savoir-faire of Mr. Bond? The exotic locales? The ""eccentric"" cast of characters? Well, you better go see another movie to get these because you won't find them in this film.The gadgets in this film seem to revolve around resuscitation, which, all things considered, was a good choice.As far as fascinating women all I can say is Thank God for Judi Dench. She is hands down the most fascinating woman in this film. Eva Green, the Bond Girl in the film, is easy enough on the eyes, but there is nothing special about her. She lacks grace and seems to be putting inordinate effort in making sure her voice sounds ""low"", but she only succeeds in sounding funny. The good news is that at least she wasn't portraying a woman trying to behave like a man.Now for the character of James Bond....in this rendition he is rude, crude, completely devoid of charm and acts as if he has no experience in the worldly, sophisticated ways of the world (and doesn't care if he does). We are used to a James Bond that is the epitome of ""cool under fire"", but this one is a cry baby. Another words, he is no different than so many of the clueless young men that lack manners in this world that you can run into on any given day. Why should I pay good money to see more of this?The locales in this movie are O.K. Venice certainly is a beautiful place, but hardly what I would call ""exotic"" or unseen by the vast majority of people that will see this film. Ditto for The Bahamas. Boring. The Czech Republic was an interesting choice and certainly different so I will thank them for that.As far as memory serves me, there was really only one ""eccentric"" in this film.

Bond is cool again,"It goes without saying that the years haven't been especially kind to James Bond. The series went from being cool and genuinely exciting to campy and barely coherent. James Bond himself went from being charming, roguish, and crafty enough to be a believable secret agent to being an almost cartoonish superhero whose mannerisms had become too cliché to be considered cool by anyone. The movies and the character needed to be reinvented. Fortunately, that's exactly what we get with ""Casino Royale."" ""Casino Royale"" is easily the best Bond movie since the early Sean Connery films. It's far more engaging and exciting than the series has been in years, and for once it isn't due to ridiculous gadgets or effects-heavy action scenes. It's due to a plot that actually makes some sense, characters that are actually believable, and a note-perfect performance from Daniel Craig as James Bond. The people who go into this movie expecting the kind of nonstop action of some of the previous Bond films might be disappointed (Bond's mission is to bankrupt a man who is funding a terrorist network by beating him in a high-stakes game of poker), but the folks who want to see a more realistic take on James Bond will love this one.Of course, the big question that everyone's been asking is whether or not Daniel Craig is any good as James Bond. While he may not look like any of the previous Bonds, he plays the role better than anyone has in years. He often comes off just as charming and likable as the character has been in the past, but in this film we see a dark side to him that we haven't seen before. There are times when he is downright cold-blooded in the way he deals with his enemies, and it's clear that part of him truly enjoys brutally killing people. He's also quite a bit more arrogant than we've seen him in the past. He's good at his job, he knows it, and he doesn't hesitate to do things that let the people around him know it. This kind of cocky confidence is really what makes James Bond the iconic character that he was years ago. He's smooth, cool, confident, and everything that most people want to be.The most interesting thing about Craig's Bond, however, is that his cool facade is really a front. This is one of Bond's first missions, and it's clear that the fact that his job frequently involves killing people affects him more than one would expect. He's visibly shaken when he makes his first kill in the opening sequence, and at one point he seems to be afraid that his job will rob him of his humanity. There has been talk in other reviews I've read of this movie that Bond is more human in this film because he makes mistakes and gets hurt, but what I think the thing that truly humanizes the character is his conscience. He's far more compelling here than he has been in years.As I said above, those of you who go into this movie expecting nonstop action will probably be disappointed. Most of the drama comes from a high-stakes game of poker. That may sound strange for a Bond film, but believe me when I say that it works far better than one would expect. Bond may be a tough secret agent, but he has to rely more on his wits and his ability to read his adversary to succeed. It goes a long way in making this more of a character-driven film than most of the Bond films have been. Le Chiffre isn't the typical megalomaniacal Bond villain. He has just as much to lose as Bond does, and he's clearly Bond's equal at the card table. The main conflict is a battle of wits, something that I don't see nearly enough in movies today. It is worth mentioning however that despite the lack of a lot of big action scenes, there is an extended chase scene early in the movie that is almost worth the price of admission alone. It doesn't rely on a lot of big special effects, but it features some truly impressive stunt work. It ranks up there among the most memorable Bond moments, and that's saying a lot.Overall, I have to say that this movie was a lot better than I could have possibly imagined. If this is where the James Bond series is headed, then I will definitely look forward to the next movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Though Dr.No is dated as far as effects and style, the passage of 44 years has not diminished the polish and cool charm under fire exuded effortlessly by Connery.Throughout his successive turns in the role, James Bond was Sean Connery and no latter day Bond, in the minds of traditionalists, could ever be quite as convincing.In his later movies, Connery added a veneer of snappy one-liners and sardonic sarcasm. In Dr. No, we saw the ""raw"" James Bond, chillingly cold and true to Fleming's vision.Surprisingly, Daniel Craig has managed to pull off a major coup; he has simultaneously reinvented the Bond franchise, much as Christian Bale has brought back the previous moribund ""Batman"". Despite the obvious physical differences, these are almost quickly dispersed as you get lost in the character, who is a credible incarnation of the pre-Dr.No Bond, rough around the edges, yet to fully define his character and ultimate evolution to top notch spy and cold killer with a license to kill.If time were fluid, it would be easy to see the Craig character turn effortlessly into the Connery character in Dr. No. For that, Craig and the screenplay and the director should be commended on doing the best thing possible under the circumstances...give you a ""new"" James Bond, who is as close to the perfection of Sean Connery as can be obtained.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Must See!!,"This was a solid movie, and a step forward for Bond films. Daniel Craig is the best choice for Bond, and he brings it strong in this film. Although i was not opposed to a black bond, (i think one will come soon enough), a blond one is the different flavor that we are looking for. Clive Owen is the only other prime actor that would have held the character, but Daniel has more to offer in the close-ups. Besides being drop dead sexy, he is 100% Bond. You will not be disappointed by the plot, either. The villain is also a great foil for our new hero, and whether or not you like poker, you will be intrigued up until the credits start to roll. I especially liked the opening song 'You know my name' by Chris Cornell. Must see!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Waist of Time,"Long, boring, not intelligent at all movie. Strip ""James Bond"" label from the movie, it will not make C-. It is not the ""Bond"" movie as we like to enjoy - sharp personalty, little sarcasm, sparks in the yeas of Bond. Craig is just another LAPD detective who happens to speak with the funny accent. Obviously, someone was trying to save a back on Brosanan.We like all Bond's fantastic tools and toys - you will not see any in this movie. There are 2 sets of fights and a sinking house. They are glued to long pointless dialogs and a card game.I think, it is the END of Bondina.",1.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Broccoli is right,"I would not call myself a Bond aficionado, but I have seen all the films, many of them woefully more than once thanks to American television. I'm guilty of the worst of all foibles of Bond fans: I grew up with Sean Connery's Bond, and believed no one could replace him. That is until he replaced himself in Never Say Never Again. Lazenby appeared, for lack of a better word, ""uncomfortable."" Moore was dramatically two dimensional at best. Dalton had moments in Living Daylights. Brosnan alternately refreshing and annoying. I did not hold much hope for Daniel Craig. I was wrong. While brilliantly cold and merciless, as one has come to expect from the Bond mythology as it has been lifted from Fleming's pages and transposed to the screen, Craig's Bond demonstrates a believable sincerity and vulnerability. Frankly, I was taken completely by surprise. His reading may not be true to all of Fleming's character, but his is more appealing than any Bond I've seen. Period. To the ""Craignotbond"" clique, I must say I couldn't disagree with you more. As I left the theatre, I was unable to suppress a shiver as I admitted to my companion that the franchise had definitely scored with this Bond. Barbara Broccoli is right. Craig is Bond.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Arrogance and self-awareness seldom go hand in hand.,"Casino Royale is directed by Martin Campbell and adapted by Neil Purvis, Robert Wade & Paul Haggis from a story written by Ian Fleming. It stars Daniel Craig, Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, Judi Dench, Jeffrey Wright & Giancarlo Giannini. It's the 21st film in the James Bond franchise.Plot finds Craig as Bond, newly promoted to 00 status, he is thrust into the murky world of high financed terrorism.One of the hardest series of films to get right, with some of the most committed of fans, is that of the James Bond series. To wit, there will never ever be a Bond film that will appease every fan across the board. The complaints will range from not enough gadgets, too far removed from Fleming's essence, not serious enough and vice a versa: too darn serious. Then there is the usual round of arguments concerning the leading man stepping into the tuxedo, for every Bond fan ready to fight to the death in the name of Sean Connery, I'll find you another prepared to back Timothy Dalton's take on the Martini swigging legend. Once it became clear that Pierce Brosnan had run his course as Bond, bowing out with the super silly Die Another Day in 2002, the pressure for any new Bond, both the actor and the makers, was immense. 2006 and time had moved on, and we live in different cinema times, spy movies are a different breed to what went before, The Bourne Identity had raised the bar. The news filtered thru that Bond was to be rebooted and that Daniel Craig was the man to be Bond. The howls of derision could be heard from as far as the tropical locations so in keeping with a James Bond plot. Too Blonde, too craggy faced, not tall enough, and why reboot a much loved franchise anyway? It was war and the heat was turned up to full.Casino Royale still has its critics, but as majorities go as regards a Bond film, this one has the biggest sway. Sure, the Daniel Craig haters will not be bowed, they can't after all lose face after such a vitriolic campaign against his casting, but few, I suspect, can seriously deny Casino Royale is not a magnificent Bond movie. Just a peak at the Worldwide box office figures shows you how well received it was, making nearly $600 million, those are figures that do not lie. The truth is that Casino Royale has almost everything you could wish for from a Bond movie, and a little more. Gorgeous locations, beautiful women and reams of action; where, the stunt department reach new heights. It's also refreshingly in keeping with Fleming's original story, only major difference here is that the makers have upgraded it to a post 9/11 world. There's nods to traditional franchise staples, whilst also neatly streamlining some of the previous film's comedy scene fillers. Smart villain too, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre, complete with creepy eye issue and loyal girlfriend, is a villain not trying to blow up the world because he's mad, but trying to outwit Bond to stay alive! That's great stuff that keeps a Bond thriller alive and well.But for all the energy and pyrotechnics (there's enough in this one film to have filled half a dozen of previous Bond entries), a Bond film can only succeed if the leading man is up to scratch. Thankfully, and joyously, Craig nails it, both in physicality, swagger and raw egotistical aggression. More telling is that Craig's Bond is more human that what we are used too, at one time suave and appearing unruffled, the next, bruised battered and emotionally conflicted. This is a new and rounded Bond, given impetus by Craig's powerful presence. He is helped by Eva Green putting brains and slinkiness into Vesper Lynd, a Bond girl to turn Bond's head in a way not seen since Diana Rigg's Tracy di Vicenzo in OHMSS. Though one of the film's rare missteps is to under write the part. Felix Leiter also gets a quality tune up in the form of Jeffrey Wright, Judi Dench's M kicks arse and Giancarlo Giannini adds a touch of continental class as Bond's Montenegro contact René Mathis. Layered over the top is a nifty score by David Arnold, blending traditional Bond flavours with high energy bursts and Phil Meheux's photography brings optical delights in the Bahamas, Czech Republic and Italy.Opening with the best chase sequence in the whole franchise and closing with an ultimate Bond moment, this is reboot supreme. It's high energy with intelligent humanistic smarts and Bond is back: blonder, brutal and most assuredly better. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A bit more realistic,"Just watched Casino Royale- based on the 1st James Bond book. I was fortune to get tickets for the premiere (here in Singapore).Its pretty good- I'd say there is an emphasis on realism... comparatively speaking. The previous JB films were pure fantasy, almost parody. You know- shooting lasers using massive space satellites in outer space.Except for one or two silly plot holes, which initially is not so apparent, this new film held up pretty well. Watch out for the vague reference to the Ong-Bak film at the start of the show. I thought the start was too laid back, old school.The new Bond is more of a throwback to the young Sean Connery, suave, charming, deadly with a hint of brutality and menace. The previous Bond was too fakey and artificial.This one takes it cue from the Bourne Supremacy rather than Phantom Menace. Less on special effects- more on style and plot.Its cool. Watch it. And somehow you'll end up being a little bit more motivated to go to the gym.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
It's The Next One That Counts!,"The philosophy required for new Bond arrivals is ""give them a chance"", and this is precisely what I did. I saw no purpose in pre-slagging off Daniel Craig for not fulfilling the cyber boys Bondian requirements (despite his being more like the Fleming Bond). However, I don't feel as if Casino Royale will be the film by which Craig will be judged, but the next one that is of paramount importance.Casino Royale has been given the Batman Begins treatment in terms of reverting back through time to point out the pitfalls and pivotal moments which created the Bond we all grew up knowing. Now, Casino Royale works on the premise that for the past however many years Bond has been in decline. Possibly true. However, that is neglecting Goldeneye (which staved the campness for a gritty story), and possibly the first half of 'Tomorrow Never Dies'. And by neglecting this, we have our problem.Where do we go from here? If Bond continues on this path, the ""old"" styled enjoyment will forever be confined to make way for a more self indulgent and seemingly serious series. While possibly not a bad thing unto itself it will only be a matter of time before there is uproar and the whole saga will have to shift once more. However, revert back to the ""old"" style of Q (or T whichever name John Cleese goes by), and Casino Royale becomes redundant. A self serving exercise which doesn't tie in with the other movies, which has to be frank a somewhat cringe worthy finale.This isn't to say Casino Royale is a bad movie. Far from it. It is hugely entertaining, and presents itself well and carries a greater deal of plausibility than many other Bonds films. But then does that strip Casino of the Bond essence? Is it merely Bondman Begins? Rhetorical questioning which only everyone as individuals have answers to. Royale is a damned decent action spy fest with a peppering of thriller for good measure, and to be equally frank Craig is not a bad Bond. While some say he may have the visual resemblance to that of Golum, it is irrelevant as he carries off the necessary task of performing Bond for this particular Bond film. But as I have alluded to with this entire review, the direction taken in the next step of the saga will be pivotal as to deciding whether or not Craig is worthy of the mantel. If the affair is another no-nonsense outing then perhaps Craig will slot himself nicely in the #2 spot. Perhaps some viewers will perceive him as being the #1 and credited with reinventing a dieing series and giving it some much needed gravitas. However if the ""sequel"" proves itself to be too much of an ""old"" styled Bond film, will Craig be able to cope, and through this that Casino Royales status in modern cinema will either increase or diminish.Bond has begun, but like the Batman he cannot conquer the world as a mere man. Let us see whether it be gadgetry or gallantry that continue the legend, or whether it be confined to mythical status, having flown too close to the sun.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Professional Spies Cannot Afford Emotional Involvement,"I think Daniel Craig is a good James Bond, I must say. Because he's blonde or because he's too stern or because he's too emotional are all ridiculous reasons to knock the new Bond. There's always a reason to knock the new bond. Ever since 1973 when Live and Let Die was released minus Connery, there's always been a reason to knock a new Bond. He's blonde, yes, and very young for someone who's been dodging bullets and killing several people all fighting against him at once since 1962, and who has, every two years on average, been doing so relentlessly ever since. He's very agile, strong, sexual, elusive and lacking in gray hairs for someone who should be Sean Connery's age, so there is no point in discouraging Daniel Craig, who has always been a fine actor, from the Bond throne. As for the stern and emotional nature of Craig's 007, that effect is caused by the direction of Martin Campbell, who directed Brosnan as well in GoldenEye. So, Daniel Craig delivers as 007.The problem to be concerned about is its inconsistencies as a prequel. Casino Royale is supposed to be James Bond's very first mission. It begins as he gains double-0 status. However, M is still being played by Judi Dench, whose character is introduced in GoldenEye, the seventeenth Bond film. At the very beginning of the series, M was a barrel-chested, round-headed, feisty yet refined Englishman, played by Bernard Lee. Also, the technology, the portrayal of the political crises, even the brief mentioning of 9/11, all date the film as the most recent and brand spanking new you can possibly make it. This is a huge inconsistency to overlook, so I'm sure that it's in perspective somehow, and I perhaps am uninformed, but equipped with a friend of mine who for months before this movie's release was constantly sending me posters, updated trailers, production announcements, etc., I feel like it would've been difficult to miss something.From the very beginning, Casino Royale is established as a turning point in the Bond series. From now on, we know that the 21st century has completely taken hold of the already very faddish series. The required format for the films is not scrapped, but varied upon. As the film progresses however, you realize that Campbell does not transcend the rest of the series, despite the fact that this is by far the highest point in his own filmography. He and Craig flesh out a Bond that is in his most accurate form. Yes, Connery was the best and Brosnan the second, but James Bond, the way he was initially created, was a dark, mysterious, overconfident, elusive, and guarded rogue, and his weaknesses were the romantic emotions he would learn the hard way to keep in check and the ego that deprives him of the strength to back down or retire from a conflict with humility. Craig hits the nail on the head, and so at times we see a Bond that we simply are not used to seeing. Connery had the darkness, the complicated mystery, the roguish qualities, and yet he was very earthy and coldly suave, sometimes quite mean. Lazenby could've been any other action hero. Moore was all face value; too airily chipper and full of light-hearted English playboy charm, maybe that of a country club regular more than a secret agent. Dalton was the closest to home, but without the charm and suavity. Brosnan was so well-liked as 007 because his portrayal compared so well to Connery's. Craig, perhaps, is better at registering Bond's internal emotion rather than playing it as a cocksure indifference and so we see that rarely recognized true Bond.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Opening credits to Final Frame - You're ""In"" the movie","The opening credits for Bond movies, long famous for the writhing women and cutting-edge animation technique, gets a spiffy update to signal a new era of Bond that focuses more on the Cold War spy/man of action angle, rather than the impossibly infallible lady killer...not that he doesn't manage to allure. The chase scenes are still present, but not necessarily done in a car with a requisite fruit cart tipping over in the open air market. The action is very fast and you'll burn calories just watching this extremely physical role unfold at the speed it does.Casino Royale is actually the first of Ian Flemmings novels and introduces the character to the world, but the original 60's movie made of it was a send-up of spy movies and a ""counter"" to the overwhelming success of the devil-may-care MI-6 agent previously portrayed by Sean Connery.Since the series has outlived all the book titles and certainly its authors, it makes sense to re-start the character from the beginning. Introduce how he got his ""double-oh"" designation, his Astin Martin, how he developed his drinking preferences, and how his heart was forever broken. He is thus rebuilt in the form of Daniel Craig,an actor who looks neither brooding nor suave on the poster, but gets it done on screen.The wry humor traditionally present in the films is still present but (mercifully!) the horrible puns and the incongruously over-the-top daftness of the jokes appears to have been removed. The only detraction I can make from the movie is the persistence of the product placement in the script here and there. Most egregious would be the Omega (Oh-mee-guh? Do the Brits pronounce this brand name this way?) A necessary evil, and a tolerable one in film-making of this magnitude. I paid $10.50 to see it in a Los Angeles theatre and I have every intention of seeing it again. (So many movies look so LAME these days, I usually don't bother seeing them even once...)Technical note: the camera work is amazing. The editing of the construction site scene alone is just thrilling. How many cameras it must have taken to get some of these scenes accomplished, I cannot guess.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Business as usual (which ain't bad),"I enjoyed ""Casino Royale,"" but I felt a little cheated when I left the theater, because the movie has been falsely advertised as a radical new start for the James Bond franchise. It's not.I had heard, for example, that ""Casino Royale"" was going to be more realistic, in the vein of Ian Fleming's novels. Now, I haven't read any of the novels, but I've heard that the prose version of Bond rarely does crazy stuff like, for example, takes on thirteen machine-gun-wielding guys simultaneously - and win. But he does so here, within the first twenty minutes of the movie. He also runs through a wall and hops between girders on a construction site like Spider-Man. So much for realism!It helps, though, that Daniel Craig is built like a human tank. Unlike most previous Bonds, he's convincing as a tough guy. He's not that charming or even that smooth with the ladies, but that might be because this is supposed to be Bond's first mission and he hasn't developed his teflon coating yet.Lest I sound like I'm burying the movie, I should mention that I liked the lovely European locations, the cool casino setting, and even the action scenes, which manage to be exciting and easy to follow despite all the rapid editing. I like Texas Hold 'Em poker, too, so it was fun to see Bond trying his hand at it (typically he plays Baccarat, I think, but I never had any idea what that game was about!) Of course, most of the poker hands in this movie are ridiculously strong - ""my royal flush beats your full house!"" and that kind of rubbish.On the downside, the film lacks a strong villain (Mads Mikkelsen with a bleeding eye doesn't count), and the romance scenes seem halfhearted at best. The script makes weird and ultimately unnecessary concessions to modern-day feminist sensibilities. Ye olde love interest, Vesper Lynd, spends about forty minutes psychoanalyzing Bond (don't bother, dear, he's a cardboard character) and insulting him before melting to his charms (sort of). I suppose this is ""modern"" romance for some people; to me, it's just a bore. If we're not gonna see any nudity, can we just get back to the shootouts and the card games, please?My other minor complaint is the peculiar scene when Bond's... uh... family jewels are abused by the villain. Another odd attempt at ""realism,"" it didn't quite work for me. (Whatever happened to fun, campy torture scenes, like the one featuring Goldfinger's death ray and the immortal line, ""No, Mr. Bond, I expect you to die!"")As you may or may not have guessed already, I'm not the world's biggest Bond fan - how many movies can one watch about a pompous guy in a tuxedo seducing chicks with suggestive names (boringly), playing cards in exotic casinos and defeating lame super-villains? I think the franchise needs an overhaul to stay interesting, and ""Casino Royale"" only partially - minimally - fits the bill. It flirts with realism, but doesn't go all the way.Note to the production team - either push the realism further, or return to your fun camp roots. This movie lies in a somewhat awkward and self-conscious realm between extremes. It's still fun, though.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Arguably the best Bond movie made,"First of all, forget all silly, childish gadgets, or a disappearing car nonsense.

Also, fight scenes are much more realistic, opposed to Brosnan's Bond, where his perfect hair never gets messed..",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
An Awesome 21st Bond Film,"From the start, Casino Royale puts itself in a league of its own.The movie's opening scene, arguably the best of any Bond film's, makes it quite clear that Bond-rookie Daniel Craig is not Pierce Brosnan.Like On Her Majesty's Secret Service (1969), in which newcomer George Lazenby replaced Sean Connery as 007, Casino Royale marks with a new actor to play the charming and charismatic spy the beginning of a new era of Bond films.First-time viewers of Bond will undoubtedly enjoy the secret agent's 21st exciting escapade, while aficionados of the series have plenty to look forward to.Although some Bond fans may have been initially disappointed in the film for its lack of the customary gun-barrel sequence that opened the first seconds of the previous 20 movies, most were pleasantly surprised when the sequence appeared later as a lead-in to the main titles.Unlike any Bond film since The Living Daylights (1987), Casino Royale sticks mostly to the plot of an Ian Fleming book. As a result, James Bond is back to his roots in Casino Royale as the determined, bare-knuckled, cold-hearted killer Fleming had, in his 1953 novel of the same title, intended his secret agent character to be.While several elements from the book were changed in order to better fit the current time period (cell-phones and high-stakes Texas Hold'Em replaced Fleming's Cold War trappings and Chemin de Fer), the focus of the film was much more on its richly nuanced characters than on high-tech gizmos and gadgets.In fact, everything in the film is more realistic. The exotic locales, fast cars, and stunning Bond girlsas well as several other hallmarks of the series, such as the famous phrase ""BondJames Bond""are all still included, only without the campy, cartoon-like tone that characterized the earlier films.Hand-to-hand combat is much more frequent and James Bond appears to be more human than superhero.The action sequences are much more convincing and rather than the cheap puns evident in past films, Casino Royale's one-liners are actually clever and legitimate jokes.The surrounding cast has been tweaked as well. Instead of a megalomaniac out to rule the world, the villain Le Chiffre (French for ""the Cipher""), played by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen, is a banker to international terrorists whose only interest is money.The heroine, Vesper Lynd, played by beautiful French actress Eva Green, serves as Bond's female equivalentsuave, shrewd, skeptical and sex-savvy. Rather than worn-out double entendres of sexual innuendo, their multilevel exchanges are convincingly sharp.Jeffrey Wright does an excellent job as Bond's CIA ally Felix Leiter, while Italian actors Giancarlo Giannini and Caterina Murino also deliver laudable performances.And, as always, Dame Judi Dench is perfect for the role of 'M,' Bond's boss and head of Britain's secret service, MI6.Casino Royale's outstanding cinematography and direction juxtapose its highly memorable storyline. The action sequences are brilliantly shot and edited, appropriately placing emphasis on real-life stunts in preference to special effects, and the plot is simply more engaging than that of most Bond films.Additionally, the title theme song ""You Know My Name,"" sung by Chris Cornell, former front-man of Seattle rock-band Soundgarden, is an excellent piece of music and perfectly characterizes the plot and tone of the movie.Director Martin Campbell, who also made the 17th Bond film, GoldenEye (1995), should certainly be praised for his remarkable work and despite a few slow but completely necessary parts, Casino Royale could not have been much better as the latest volume of what seems to be the never-ending series of Bond films.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"I wanted to love this movie, but....","I adore the James Bond franchise. I was in love with Pierce Brosnan. I wanted that feeling to continue, so I wanted to love this movie, but... despite some great action sequences, great acting by the leads and supporting cast, I just couldn't embrace it for one reason- Daniel Craig. IMHO, despite his buff bod, he is just not handsome enough- too grizzled, too old (for this to be his first 00 mission), too edgy (what's with the spiky hair?). That may be the appeal to some viewers, but I like my Bonds smooth, debonair and darkly handsome. Still wish Clive Owen had got the job. I missed the humour so prevalent in the franchise previously (I laughed only once during the entire film), missed the gadgets, missed having a Bond that made me wish I was the chick making out with him! That said, I have to admit that the story was good and also that Craig is a fine actor who brings a different Bond personality to life credibly. It's just not the Bond character that I wish to see.

Daniel Craig Can Cut It As Bond,"There was a lot of uncertainty and speculation when the actor to take the coveted James Bond role was revealed. Admittedly, I was one of the doubters but, after witnessing Daniel Craig's immaculate performance in the new movie Casino Royale, I was proved wrong.The first blonde Bond gave the sophisticated, witty and arrogant performance expected of Britain's most famous secret agent. Dare I say it, the role was played as well, if not better, than his predecessor Pierce Brosnan, and the film was ten times better than the previous instalment, Die Another Day.The script was cleverly structured, the twists in the storyline were far less predictable, the brilliant ending tied up the film very neatly, and Craig injected some very humorous lines into the dialogue. When asked how he would prefer his Martini prepared, instead of the traditional ""Shaken, not stirred"", this time Bond replied ""Do I look like I give a damn?"" Unlike many of the previous movies, the emphasis of Casino Royale was less on the cars and car chases, Bond girls and gadgets, but more on the story and characters. And yes, as rumours suggested, James Bond did drive a Ford Mondeo. Classy.Of course, the Mondeo was later traded in for a flashy Aston Martin DB9, fully equipped with all the classic Bond gadgets and gizmos. The only disappointment came when, just as Craig set off in his new toy on a long-awaited car chase, he proceeded to skid off the road and write it off in a spectacular fashion. The only equipment from the fully stocked Aston that Bond put to good use was a medikit to keep him alive after being drugged by his arch nemesis in a poker game.However, the positives in Casino Royale far outweighed the negatives. All the characters were acted brilliantly, in particular Bond girl Vesper Lynd, played by actress Eva Green. Vesper wasn't a typical Bond girl  she actually developed a meaningful relationship with the secret agent, as oppose to the traditional one night stand. The role was played with the quick wit and sophistication unseen from previous lead female characters.As always, not a fault could be picked with the performance of Bond film veteran Judi Dench as Craig's boss, M.I have never been a big fan of Bond, but I haven't seen such a cleverly scripted, action-packed film in a long time. I was extremely impressed with the new movie, and expect Daniel Craig to play the character many more times in years to come. He certainly proved the critics wrong.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Back to Bond,"Daniel Craig is by far the best yet. Having seen Daniel's performances in Layer Cake and Archangel, to mention just two of his long line of successful performances, I couldn't wait for Casino Royale, and I wasn't disappointed. Craig's Bond is a gritty, confident ( without being arrogant, pompous, brash or big headed ) hard nosed machine with a job to do, and he certainly gets it done !!This movie isn't for the tech heads, no outrageous impossible gadgets, more believability, lots of action, no silliness, but still with some great one liners and very funny moments. Its hard to believe it has taken 21 films to finally reveal the true James Bond, the Bond that Flemming wrote his books about. Some of the previous 007 films were good, some where not so good, and some were just down right overindulgent fantasy, but Casino Royale is in my opinion, by far the best 007 film yet.Please don't do a Lazenby on us Daniel, stick around for at least a few more Bonds. Cannot wait for the next one ! Truly superb.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
I had forgotten what Bond should be,"When you hear ""Bond"", what word comes to mind? Suave? Sophisticated? Cool? Years of smarmy Bonds made me forget another word: rugged. This Bond is tough. And Daniel Craig's Bond is not just enjoyable, he's believable.Over the years, here's what I had forgotten about Bond: 1. I forgot that the reason why Bond gets into such trouble is that he doesn't always see three steps ahead of everybody. Bond gets blindsided. Yet the more recent Bonds seemed very cerebral - quicker with a quip than on the draw.2. I forgot that Bond doesn't plan, Bond reacts. This Bond is like a great football player who sees the field around him and finds the gaps. Previous Bonds were more like football coaches - planners more than players.In many Bond movies, I wondered why the bad guy didn't quiver knowing that Bond was on the trail. With Daniel Craig's Bond, I figured it out: bad guys don't quiver because they *think* they can beat Bond; they see a flaw, a weakness ... but they underestimate his resolve and his resourcefulness.This was not only a terrific movie - I feel I understand Bond in a way I didn't before. Even if you never understood why people liked Bond movies - or maybe ESPECIALLY if this is the case for you - see this movie.I feel as if the franchise is starting all over again (which in a way, it is).",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Thank you Daniel Craig!! It has been a decade and this movie like a fine wine has aged well. It is official. Daniel Craig is Bond.,"I was blown away when I saw this movie. I was still trying to get over Die Another Day. After seeing the far out and ridiculous situations from that movie and horrible writing, it was great to see Bond brought back down to Earth and seeing him starting his career instead of having an established one. The opening sequence reminded me of Dr.No with Sean Connery in his motel room and shooting the professor with 1 shot. Daniel kept his cool and he knew what he was doing. I loved it when he did his own stunts especially the foot chase and the scene at the airport. Those I couldn't see Roger Moore do. Daniel Craig brought back Bond the way he was meant to be. Sean Connery may have been the first but sorry Sean, you've been dethroned. Daniel has more range of an actor. I saw it when he lost Vesper.That was fantastic! You can see him show more dimensions that make him a real person. Even the torture scene shows that we weren't in the Pierce Brosnan era anymore. The villain was cool. He was a corrupt banker and not a super villain but his motives were great. Vesper reminded me a bit of Stacey from On Her Majesties' Secret Service. She was a great equal to Bond and committing suicide was what she had to do. Overall, this was a great start to the Danial Craig era. Sorry Sean but you have been dethroned. He is a Bond for my time.

Not only the best Bond film... One of the best films ever!,"I Did not expect to weep at the end of a James Bond movie... but I did. Not since Braveheart has a movie created so much emotion and inspiration in me. Daniel Craig (spelling?) shut all the critics up. He was mesmerizing. His eyes and confidence were elemental. I never doubted once that he could do these extraordinary things. The plot was great, simple and suave. The action was not over the top but in an amazing way brutally realistic. The lead female was a real woman, beautiful! No plastic! When she was fully clothed in the shower and James Bond just sat with her... that was the best love scene in any James Bond movie and nothing happened. Mr. Craig, if you read these... keep making these and never quit. You are the new James Bond and frankly the best.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"CASINO ROYALE (Martin Campbell, 2006) ***1/2","Against every conceivable odds, the 21st James Bond adventure is one of his best: the highly unpopular choice of leading man (with die-hard fans of the series) paid off in spades as blonde Daniel Craig - who had previously impressed more for his restrained acting than his animal magnetism in both ROAD TO PERDITION (2002) and MUNICH (2005) - lends the character a determination, temerity and, most importantly perhaps, vulnerability missing since the earlier Sean Connery incarnations. The fact that he was faced with the burden of playing one of the screen's most iconic characters and encountering such overwhelming opposition at first, seems to have merely aided in making Craig's characterization of James Bond as, ironically, more believable than perhaps ever before.This is not to say that the spectacular stunts and action sequences - not to mention Bond's enviable way with a witty line or prowess in the bedchamber - have been jettisoned or diluted in favor of realistic minimalism but, the fact remains that more time than usual is dedicated here to delving into the various characters appearing in the story instead of previous upping-the-ante tactics which necessitated numerous climaxes seeking to upstage not only the ones seen in previous films but even those within the film itself. The relationship between Bond and his partner Vesper Lynd (the luscious Eva Green) is one of the most emotional and satisfying in the entire series and, despite my initial misgivings prior to watching the film, Mads Mikkelsen's Le Chiffre is a terrific opponent with a subtly effective make-up to go with his intense performance. The supporting cast is also worth mentioning: apart from Judi Dench (who is by now filling in impeccably for the formidable Bernard Lee) as M, we have Jeffrey Wright's bemused Felix Leiter and Giancarlo Giannini's reptilian Mathis, a welcome ally to Bond as he steps into the spider's lair that is the Casino of the title but, as usual with these spy sagas, loyalties - to say nothing of love - cannot be taken at face value.At 144 minutes, this is also the longest James Bond vehicle so far but as I mentioned earlier, CASINO ROYALE is easily the best of the series in 25 years (at the very least). Frankly, I've only been able to take Roger Moore's overtly tongue-in-cheek James Bond persona in small doses, have had little use for Timothy Dalton's glumness and only been wholly satisfied with Pierce Brosnan's take in TOMORROW NEVER DIES (1997). It is, therefore, very refreshing to see, for once, a James Bond film whose plot is not only exciting but, free as it is of the ingenious but distracting gadgets which proliferated in previous outings, also quite absorbing. The black-and-white introduction is a nice touch, the rather harrowing torture sequence is possibly a first for the series and, among the handful of action highlights, the crumbling of a Venetian edifice towards the end is as spectacular as they come.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Cool agent - boring plot,"Daniel Craig was an excellent choice for the character. A very good actor and with a cool brutal look. He fits the role perfectly, although a bit more sophistication would be beneficial.But the plot - which is to stop some African war lords from getting USD 100 million of their own money back - is too simple, too ordinary and too boring for a Bond movie. The villain's plot should be Earth encompassing and psychotic like in the older movies. And even though it was nice with so little (no?) CGA, a Bond movie must have more gadgets and crazy situations - like M having an office in an Egyptian temple or a wrecked cruise ship - and car, boat or ski chases. Although it shouldn't get so stupid as in Die Another Day a bit more imagination in the next one would be nice!!",6.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Bond is back, reinvigorated and ready for the next generation","I absolutely loved this film. Daniel Craig brings a unique, fresh approach to the characterization of James Bond - the character is reckless, makes mistakes, and lets his ego sometimes impact his judgment. Craig is a superb actor, and does the Bond name and franchise true justice. This is by far the most violent of the Bond films, and Craig really displays Bond's lethality and cold-bloodedness perfectly. Mads Mikkelsen is a very good baddie in Le Chiffre, Eva Green is perfect as Vesper Lynd, and Judi Dench is elegant and commanding as usual as M. I cannot wait for the next film Quantum of Solace which continues the story where this film leaves off - the first time in the Bond franchise that this happens. If you have not seen this film, it comes highly recommended. Daniel Craig is the personification of Bond as Fleming wrote it. See this film!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

Convincing Bond but unconvincing script,"Bond is back, but in a disappointing vehicle - and I don't mean the Aston. Casino Royale had some imaginative titles and the music was up to scratch but the plot and pacing of the film were not up to the standard of the better (and especially early) Bonds. There are some nice references to the early Bond sequences and all the recognised elements are there - including the inevitable dastardly villains (foreign accents of course), the glam Bond girls, the cars and some spectacular effects. In summary, Daniel Craig made a good Bond and given a better script could be a prospect for high quality future entertainment. The question now though is, with all of the Ian Fleming titles done, where next ?",3.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This is the real stuff,"Wow Wow Wow... this has to be the best Bond film ever made. The chases, the action, the lack of silly gizmo's and the inclusion of events which are close to real is what makes this film a must watch.Initially I was a bit suspect about both the actor and the film - but both exceeded expectations. Craig's body is what Michelangelo would have given his life for to sculpt and his screen presence is simply fabulous. Lean, Mean and Witty - he is GOOD. Eva Green is very clever and all the dialogues in this movie are charming.Locations are beautiful (expected), action is completely raw - there is an honesty about James Bond which is unimaginable. 'M' is her usual self, crisp, confidant and always curt.

"The king is dead, long live the king","Great empires need revolutions every few centuries or they fall into obscurity. Perhaps that is why the Bond franchise has survived so long, periodically jolted out of its torpor by a new lead actor. If the basic formula remains, it is still Bond, isn't it? But can the franchise survive this most recent incarnation? Along with the introduction of a new lead actor, Daniel Craig, the tried and tested formula has been swept away. Where is the super-villain? Where is the world domination plot? Where is the corrupted scientist fashioning a diabolical super-weapon? I searched in vain for nude women in the title sequence, for a super-lair in a dormant volcano or for escapes through ventilation ducts. In short, and most shocking of all, the plot came close to believability.True, there are nods to the old days, but each time we are reminded that this is going to be different. When asked if he would like his cocktail shaken or stirred, Bond replies: ""Do I look as if I give a damn?"" Some of the old cosiness has gone and we are left with a brutality that reflects the original Fleming novels. Bond makes mistakes. He feels emotional as well as physical pain. It isn't always easy watching and I was dismayed to see young children in the audience. How did this get a 12A certificate? If I have one gripe it is with the punctuated storyline. It almost felt like four episodes of a drama that had been run together. But that is a small complaint about an otherwise excellent film. Perhaps there is life in the old franchise yet.

Casino Royale,"I am a 13 year old girl who has great love of fluffy chick flicks, LOL comedies and hardcore horrors, so when my Dad requested I go to the cinema to watch it, I was WAY unsure. But since I had not much better to do, I tagged along. Anyway, when we got into the opening scene, I was LOVING it! This movie has a pretty much all star cast, a snazzy theme tune, loadza great stunts, good camera angles and bucket loads of suspense. There were times I was on the edge of my seat, biting my nails, and once where I really needed the loo but was too scared I'd miss anything. There is even a bit of comedy thrown in from time to time.Overall, a very modern update, and I hate to admit it, but Daniel Craig is quite cute.

Amazing,"I went to the movie expecting the movie to be good because of Martin Campbell. We've all seen Golden Eye, Mask of Zorro etc. But Casino Royale sure exceeds expectations.The movie portrays a Bond who is more convincing to be a real MI6 agent than the other typical Bond movies. Bond fans worldwide will sure miss Pierce Brosnan but we have to realize that Daniel Craig definitely is physically more able to perform those amazing stunts than the previous, but perhaps more charismatic Bond.So I say the team has done an excellent job, though the stunts in the beginning of a movie may seem exaggerated. For those who do not know what PARKOUR is, it is the French originated art of passing obstacles in the fastest and most direct manner possible. The french movie Banlieue 13 has a fine display of the same.Further, the script was pretty good too, speaking of which, Paul Haggis was a co-writer of Casino Royale!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"One of the best, compliments all that is Bond","Set in the present day, in a time-line of Bond's early years, after receiving his 00 status he must stop banker villain Le Chiffre from winning a poker tournament at Casino Royale that is funding terrorism.Director Martin Campbell after an old-school approach to Goldeneye delivers a thrilling and grounded vision of Bond. There's a great modern use of angles and camera movement techniques.Casino Royale is a must see for all Bond fans, old and new. It is simply, Bondtastic! With less gadgets and more realistic tech tools, Bond relies more on his training and wits. Everything is there on screen, exquisite locations, guns, cars, action and there are many nods to the books too. Although some of the characters from the series are missing, they're surprisingly not missed and the spirit feels they may appear in future films.With Neal Purvis & Robert Wade excellent screenplay coupled with a fantastic score, stunts and drama this movie is far more gritty. The character Felix Leiter makes an appearance this time played by Jeffrey Wright. Judi Dench returns as 'M' and there are notable performances from the excellent and subtle Giancarlo Giannini as Mathis. In addition, the villain is less than stereotype with Mads Mikkelsen in the role of Le Chiffre.Daniel Craig is mesmerising as Ian Fleming's British spy, James Bond. Less humour, harder, infused with emotion, Bond is lean and dangerous.It's a great entry and hopefully a sign of things to come.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Ian Fleming's Bond,"That is what this movie is all about, re-booting the Bond franchise and reviving Bond as he was meant to be... and showing us how he got there. Those who love Bond movies, and I do, should immediately identify this as a flawless masterpiece in the series. The length of the movie might bother some, but me - i hardly noticed. What I noticed were the cool touches and nods marking a change and renewal.* Male vocal at the start with clothed male shadows, not a female vocal and nude female shadows. Btw I think the song was cool too.* Showing how becoming 00 is not easy* The opening chase sequence - it said a lot to me. Action movies these days are a lot about the kind of moves the running bomber showed. Bond is different - he can keep up and do it his own way - direct and smart.* Smart, impetuous, emotionless when killing but driven by anger. Bond's a rough uncut diamond and in this movie he's put under a grinding stone.* Even the car was realistic - an Aston Martin DBS that rolled and shattered like any other cars* In fact this movie reset the whole franchise to how it should always have been - centered on people, with gadgets as peripheral* smart and sexy women, a true counterfoil to Bond, not props* Bond getting beaten up. Real spies win as many times as they lose. And they are not supermen. Die Another Day started this way, but then lost its way. Casino Royale never sets a foot wrong.Finally I couldn't help noticing, as the movie wound to an end, the references to a shadowy powerful organisation. Just wondering aloud - are they bringing SPECTRE back?Recreating Bond like this was a beautiful masterwork, how'll they treat Blofeld and his minions?

If Sony made autos, Bond would have been driving that instead of that little Ford. What was that? A prequel Pinto?

Bond - Ruthless/Vicious,"I went to see Casino Royale on Saturday and I was really impressed by the acting and stunts. Daniel Craig is one of the most ruthless and vicious James Bond's I have seen since Sean Connery was in the role back in the 1960s.Within the opening segments of the movie, he killed two people without any emotions being shown which made for him to being cold blooded but as he stated, he wouldn't be any good at his job.I would really recommend people to go and see this movie if you want a fresh, dynamic, ruthless and vicious Bond and to forget all the negative comments and publicity surrounding Daniel Craig - he is brilliant and excellent!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Back to basics,"Let's make sure we understand that Daniel Craig is not Sean Connery before I write that Craig's James Bond in CASINO ROYALE is very much in the mold of the James Bond of old, before things started getting out of hand in the Roger Moore era. The plot is simple enough, the number of characters stripped down (no Q or or Miss Moneypenny or stuffy prime minister, just Bond and M), the action sequences tight and brutal. Craig makes a believable-enough blond Bond on his first mission, as he uncovers a plot among a mysterious cartel to amass a fortune based on some nefarious doings including blowing up a jumbo jet and winning a high-stakes poker tournament. The actor playing LeChiffre is sinister enough, and the actresses playing the Bond girls (there are really only two) are strictly eye candy. The focus is heavily on Craig, who seems physically fit enough (or perhaps it is his stunt double) as he races around the world to expose and defeat this cartel. And the truth is, he does remind me of Connery's Bond, with a touch of Tim Dalton thrown in. No clownish Bond he, like Moore or Brosnan. The always entertaining Jeffrey Wright plays Felix Leiter, Bond's American counterpart.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Im no film critic....

(which by the way like 99% of British males I have always enjoyed ) This Bond is like no other you have seen before, and it gets back to basics, of which i feel Daniel Craig acts OUTSTANDINGLY.

A brave new Bond,"Okay, let me say that the reason I'm reviewing this film several years after its release is because I've decided to give it a second viewing (in the wake of Skyfall's success at the box office).I've watched all the Bond films, right the way through from Sean Connery to Pierce Brosnan and, although they vary slightly depending on the story, I have to say I've loved them all. I love the silliness, the tongue-in-cheekiness, the witty quips and the gadgets.Then came Casino Royale.I had no objections to Daniel Craig being named as James Bond (after his part in Layer Cake, I think he proved he had what it took). I didn't even object to the fact that Bond was (sort of) being 'rebooted,' showing how Bond became a 00 agent etc. What I objected to was that, in my opinion, it was NOT Bond. Yes, it had action, ladies and exotic locations, but gone was everything that I thought made Bond Bond.I watched the whole film and give it a disappointed two stars out of five, admitting that the action sequences were good, but it was more The Bourne Identity than Bond.However, as the years have gone by and my shock has dwindled, I've re-watched it and come to accept that it does have its merits. Yes, Bond has changed. Maybe it's for the best. Daniel Craig's (current) three outings have been the most financially successful of all the Bond films, so I guess he's appealing to the masses.This is indeed a 'new slant' on Bond. Gone is what I loved, but it's been replaced by something - now I'm viewing it in the cold light of day - with some ALSO pretty good too.I appreciated that the plot to Casino Royale was actually a lot more intense than many of its predecessors, plus there was far more reliance on character development, rather than just invisible cars (yes, even I found that one a little hard to swallow in Die Another Day).Although I will forever enjoy the cheeky charm of 'old' Bond, I will admit that this one has its place alongside it and now am beginning to look forward to the news of a new Bond film in the making.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
This is taking Bond back to Fleming's creation.,"I am a James bond fan in every sense of the phrase. I have seen every movie multiple times, as well as, read every novel. I see this movie as being exactly what Fleming envisioned as he wrote. Daniel Craig takes us back to what James Bond was originally. Tough, resourceful and enamored with women. While it is easy to represent this using a script derived from a Fleming original, it takes someone like Daniel Craig to deliver it appropriately. I can appreciate the lack of extravagant gadgets. I think the casting is this movie was wonderful. Not only is Craig perfect for the role, but the other main characters are also well chosen. Eva Green is stunningly beautiful and her acting is superb. Mads Michelson is the perfect ""bad guy"", if you will. He is cunning, intelligent and truly believable. I applaud the entire team involved in the production of this movie for giving us a true representation of James Bond's original assignment in MI6. A must see for even the casual Bond fan and a turning point for the movie followers who consider Bond a somewhat stretched character profile.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"""Royale"" Wins the Pot","""Bond. James Bond."" The man behind the infamous quote returns to his roots in the latest 007 adventure, ""Casino Royale."" The film features Bond in his most raw form: edgier, wittier, and even colder than audiences have seen in the spy's previous adventures. Daniel Craig, the newest man to drive the Aston Martin, pulls off the role with expertise. His performance is true to the feel of the original novel and will have doubters quickly retracting their reservations. Craig is accompanied by a talented cast including Eva Green, Mads Mikkelsen, and the returning Judi Dench as M. Under the direction of Martin Campbell, ""Casino Royale"" is an explosive hit that will evoke the devotion from traditional Bond aficionados and bring on a new generation of fans.Newly appointed Double-0 agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) is on a mission to track down a terrorist funding organization. His search leads him to a criminal mastermind and expert gambler named Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen). Le Chiffre is looking to increase his funds by playing in a high stakes Poker game. Aided by Treasury Agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), Bond is recruited to play against Le Chiffre and bankrupt the organization. Should he lose, however, he will have personally aided in financing terrorism.As he did with ""Goldeneye"", former Bond director Martin Campbell returns to bring new life and new attitude to the franchise. He keeps a fast pacing of the film and manages to capture all the action without missing a beat. He is keen to show the audience Bond's close calls while also leaving other details to their collective imagination. But Campbell does not simply rely on explosions and car chases for excitement. This is best shown in the Poker game that Bond and Le Chiffre are involved in. With his brilliant camera style, Campbell captures the tenseness of the situation. Audiences will be able to imagine themselves not only inside the poker room but at the very table of the contest.Also returning for another Bond run are screenwriters Neal Purvis and Robert Wade whom are joined by veteran writer/director Paul Haggis. A better trio could not have been chosen to tackle the challenge of adapting the first Ian Fleming novel of 007. They stay true to the basic and most important fundamentals of the book while also adapting plot elements for the modern audience, i.e., changing the card game from baccarat to poker. Being a prequel, the screenwriters are also aware to make James Bond at his most basic form. He is not the quite the man with infinite charm and sophistication and tackles situations more with his wits than with gadgetry.After months of speculation and distrust among fans as to whether or not he would be a suitable Bond, Daniel Craig's performance silences those doubts. As Bond on his first mission, Craig is more cold, calculating, and even egotistical than audiences have seen. He will complete the task regardless of what rules he has to break or who must be sacrificed. Craig demonstrates this through his encounters with M on and off the job. Acting out Bond in the original stage, Craig walks the fine line between being charming and arrogant. On the one hand he could be buttering up a woman and then suddenly turn the tables to feed his own ego. Craig also displays plenty of the Bond wit and humor that fans have come to expect and enjoy. But again, one has to define whether it is being funny or being self-centered. Eva Green becomes the latest Bond girl with her role as Vesper Lynd. Typical of most Bond girls, Green is a good mix of beauty and the not-so-damsel-in-distress. An antithesis of her literary character, Green portrays Lynd as very headstrong and almost a female reflection to the young Bond. For every snide remark and quick quip, Green matches in return. But Green does not make Lynd as cold or uncaring as Bond. She does an excellent job is showing the emotional and mental strain that becomes involved with the field work. Mads Mikkelsen is a great persona of Le Chiffre. He always carries an aura of self-confidence on-screen that if Bond were a villain it would be Le Chiffre. Mikkelsen's portrayal is just as cold, manipulative, and egotistical as Craig makes Bond out to be. An added bonus from Mikkelsen is something that has not been seen in many Bond villains: fear. Mikkelsen is not the typical Bond villain who is out to rule the world for himself. Rather he is an employee playing with his employers' money. Mikkelsen shows this knowledge throughout the film and an understanding of the consequences should he fail. Judi Dench is more involved in her return as M. She shows the frustration of having to deal with the brash, young Bond but also an almost motherly compassion for the trials he has to go through. One can tell that she wants her latest recruit to succeed but is unsure if he has the stability for the job.""Casino Royale"" will most certainly entertain Bond fans and movie-goers alike. Daniel Craig's portrayal of 007 is a refreshing change to the smooth customer fans have become accustomed to and will reinvent 007 to a new legion of fans. The incredible cast combined with the brilliant direction of Martin Campbell and fantastic screen writing guarantees ""Casino Royale"" will down as one of the top Bond films of all time. Mr. Fleming, you would be proud.Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"Not my dad's James Bond, that's for sure","When I was a kid, my father and I constantly watched all the James Bond films together, I always loved every adventure James got into, the women, the villains, the gadgets, everything about James Bond just equals fun and excitement. But the later James Bond films haven't been so pleasant to watch, so I just stayed clear of Casino Royale. But I heard nothing but good things about Casino Royale, so I decided to go ahead and see what this movie was going to be like. So I rented it, I watched it last night and I wasn't expecting anything special, but I really loved Casino Royale, it was so different than what we are used to with our James Bond films. Not to mention Daniel Craig, the James Blonde, I know a lot of people were having doubts, for those who haven't seen this, watch it, Daniel will definitely take your doubts away.James Bond in his first years as an agent has his first major assignment. He is the best card player in the organization, so his boss, M, sends him to beat a mafia boss, Le Chiffre, who is taking so much money. James is set up with Vesper, a foxy beautiful woman who is the head of Treasury, and is pretending to be his wife during this whole charade. But when Le Chiffre is onto Bond and Vesper, they may wanna think about not being a secret agent so much any more.Casino Royale goes where no other James Bond movie has gone before, it's a lot more darker, it's more realistic, even though you know that these gadgets are over the top, they seem like they could exist. The actors are just top notch, we have Dame Judi Dench who's Bond's boss, she was a great addition to the franchise. Eva Green was a great Bond girl and her last scene was beautifully shot; I was really impressed with the editing, the action scenes, the movie shots, everything about this movie was just great and was so much fun to watch, it's pure entertainment, I highly recommend it.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

It's...good...,"I hadn't watched any Bond movies other than the most recent Spectre, and I decided to go back to Daniel Craig's first outing as Bond back in 2006. Quite honestly, I enjoyed the movie, just not enough.Casino Royale sees James Bond get his 007 status before going on a sinister mission to take down a man running a ''high-stakes poker game'' that has been betting against big world corporations.Honestly, I enjoyed a large part of the film. The first half of the film is enjoyable, quality, smart action that breezes by you spectacularly. I highly praise both the chase in Uganda and especially the airport scene. Daniel Craig plays Bond as a matter-of-fact, smug agent for this half of the movie (and, actually, the entire movie really).It's just the second half of the film that really gets too drawn out and confusing for me. James Bond goes to Montenegro with Vesper Lynd, going to participate in the poker game with Le Chiffre. Everything after this becomes slow and drawn out. Honestly, I would be fine with this slow pacing, except the whole plot felt a bit confusing for me. Maybe I'm just dumb, because this movie got universal acclaim, but it just felt like too much at times for me.That's not to mention that this movie is 2 hours 20 minutes, and for the entire last half hour I was just waiting for the movie to end. The best of the action is over by about the one hour mark in my opinion, and the entire remainder of the movie just feels boring. The little action that is left is, albeit, good, just not enough.Okay, so this movie doesn't need to just be non-stop action; that would be unreasonable. But the casino scene is just boring for me, which was a shame since it takes up a large part of the second half of the movie.Still, I digress; Casino Royale is a good movie. I enjoyed every bit of it, even if not the second half as much as the first half. Daniel Craig shines as James Bond, and the film is visually stunning. I have high hopes for the entire franchise going into the future.

I grew up with Brosnin so thats what i expected. But Daniel Craigg, does an absolutely excellent job. I think this is because he is his own Bond, he doesn't try and copy Brosnin. He is tougher, more crude, definitely more humorous. You can definitely tell this movie is about him learning the ropes of being a 00 agent. This movie, has great action scenes, which is expected from a bond. But surprisingly, this movie has some very funny parts to it and they aren't cheesy either. This Bond beats all of Brosnins Bonds.

Quite Good,"A pleasure to finally see a Bond film without the requisite invisible cars, deathray satellites, or wrist-mounted poison gas dispensers that only work if you hum the first 3 bars of ""God Save the Queen"" or similar rediculousness.Also -- good to see a Bond film where the world isn't in immediate jeopardy from nation conflict, nuclear conflict, or something firing a laser from outer space, as was standard plot from so many past films of the franchise.This is the Bond film they *should* have made in 1987 -- gritty, full of blood, a decent story and no superfluous BS that made License To Kill and Die Another Day so unwatchable. (Wayne Newton? C'mon...)Kudosto Purvis, Haggis and others on a tight screenplay that doesn't rely on past Bond-isms and gets right to the point. I can only hope that they'll stick to this formula moving forward. Good to see Bond full of blood, beaten up, and angry!",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
hated it,"1 part Idinana Jones, 1 part transporter with out any of the good parts. this is a poorly executed Bond film. and it left me aching for the Bond of old, Daniel Craig at no point convinced me he was 007, but reminded me of the agent slain in the first Triple x film. The plot is taken from the original Ian Fleming book & very well written,might I add. but missing are the things that make Bond an icon in American cinema. the exotic love interest, the gadgets & even the cars. there aren't any one liners to even make You chuckle and say ""That's the Bond i know"". the movie tends to linger a bit after about the first 30 minutes,and once it picked up again I was ready to get my refund.if You really want to see a great ""bond"" film then see M.I3, Cruise delivers once again.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Good but incorrect,"I consider myself a Bond fan and Casino Royale is a great addition to the collection, and is a great film. I agree the use of fewer gadgets makes it in line for one of the top Bond films, but it has problems with the plot and defiantly the characters. Casino Royale is supposed to be a prequel to most of the other Bond films. However it uses the newest female M. If it is a prequel it should use a male M as the female M didn't come around till Goldeneye, much later in the literature series. I also think that Brosnan would have been the better choice for Bond, since he is probably the 2nd or 3rd best Bond after Sean Connery.",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
James Bond Meets Die Hard,"The extravagant action packed Die Hard series with it's big holly wood sets and ruff and tough actors is combined with the smooth touch of the British suave leafier.Hes not Sean Connery.

The timing and stunts that were done to create the scenes was very extravagant. It reminded me at many points of the action Scenes in the Die Hard movies.

excellent,"Now - we are aware of the www.craigisnotbond.com or whatever the hell it was who criticised Daniel Craig unfairly: (1) the film had not been made (2) Craig has an excellent acting resume (3) they had not read any original 007 books and didn't understand how much Craig looks like the JB of the books (4) the editor of the website admitted to not watching the James Bond movies but just thought Pierec was lovely (which he is) (5) Pierce has a contract for three movies with an option of a fourth - he made four (6) Pierce is 53 for goodness sake - he is too old, despite being the best Bond of all!I was lucky enough to see a preview, and the movie looks excellent. Yes, a lot of product placement, but you need that to help fund the production.

Bond is back!,"Since the release of the new bond film, i have been receiving mixed views about the film, both from critics and from friends, so i had to go and see it for myself to find out who to believe. My conclusion is that those who said this film was anything other than brilliant are completely delusional, it was incredible, i enjoyed almost every minute of it, so, OK, i admit that they could have cut out about 20 minutes but it still did not feel like a 2 1/2 hour film. it was dark, gritty and Craig was a ruthless killer, but this is how Flemming wrote about Bond, he was as cool about killing as a surgeon. Tho only thing that i felt the movie missed was that little bit of class and style that we associate with Connery and Brosnans films (Connery more so) so if you are a fan of Bond films, (especially the earlier ones) or if you are not a fan, this film will blow you away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond -- Not Just Camp Anymore,"If you read any of Ian Fleming's books on Bond, then you know the stories are high-spirited, intense and with detailed descriptions. The devil is in the details and that is how he tempts us to partake. So, perhaps you, too, have ordered a martini the way James Bond prefers them made.What Fleming's books are not, is campy comedy with an insincere protagonist and disposable attractive women.If you have never read the books, then Saltzman and Broccoli probably defined Bond for you. You have my sympathy.So, this movie returns to Bond's roots in more than one way. It starts at the beginning, more or less, and it starts without tongue in cheek. It is about time, too. The camp had been done way past the point of exhaustion -- of the writers, the actors and, most importantly, the audience.Let us all hope that this Bond does not degenerate the way Saltzman and Broccoli's Bond did in that franchise.Welcome back, Ian Fleming's James Bond.

There's much enjoy about Craig's Bond,"Unlike some reviewers, I found Bond's antagonist, Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen, quite good, and the beautiful Eva Green not quite as entertaining as Bond's love interest, Vesper Lynd. But, of course, the key is Bond himself and Craig is quite good as the most athletic and sardonic Bond ever. Any guy should enjoy this film. But while watching I kept thinking, why does this film start in Africa? Are we finding it more and more difficult to find 'bad guys' with a bit of real life in them? Truth is, the English speaking world is no more immune to greed and violence than any other. Bond is best fighting true villains for a good cause and not merely for power and resources, as in real life. With the recent death and suspected murder of anti-Putin ex-KGB agent Litvinenko I kept thinking how ironic that as that man lay dying, he was complaining about how 'ruthless' the KGB is, while I and millions of others were reveling in Bond's make-believe ruthlessness. I guess in real life it's only fun when we're not the victim.If the scripts can at least match this one, the Bond franchise is going to make a strong comeback. What amazing luck, finding Craig.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Bond goes classless,"The critics will have you believe that this Bond is more like Ian Fleming's original character - the super-cool ruthless one-man assassination squad. As was said to the fictional press Baron by his (of necessity) sycophantic editor Salter, ""this is true up to a point, Lord Copper"". In other words, ""not really"". The original Bond was a projection of Fleming's own background (rich, upper-class, Eton, Sandhurst), snobbishness and tastes  fast cars, luxury goods, fine liquor, tobacco, disposable women and spying games - into a fantasy world in which he could be the ruthless man of action he never was in real life.Here, Daniel Craig as Bond is anonymous, classless, a cog in the governmental machine (though not always obedient), a character from ""Spooks"" in fact who doesn't care whether his martini is stirred or shaken (the bar tender looks quite crestfallen when he say this). His hunky good looks don't look upper-class Brit and he looks like a gorilla in a dinner suit. He does convince in the action sequences.Speaking of those, they were exciting to watch, particularly the chase across the construction site at a port in Madagascar, but the tensest moments, and the ones nearest to Fleming's book, were the gambling sequences, removed from a small casino in northern France to Montenegro. In the book the game was baccarat, here it's a variation of poker. No doubt it would help to know the rules, but if you don't you just watch who scoops up the chips. Bond's opponent, Le Chiffre, played by Mads Mikkelsen (very big on Danish TV) is quite good-looking and does come across as being only moderately evil; belting Bond's balls with a rope (Bond almost seems to enjoy it) isn't really on a par with Goldfinger's crutch aimed laser, and money laundering for African dictators isn't in the same class as blowing up the world a la Blofeld.The Bond girl is something of a throwback. Vesper Lynn (Eva Green) is certainly very beautiful and starts off by not liking Bond much, but she crumbles fairly quickly to his charm and becomes the maiden in distress he has to rescue. Bond manages to bed only two women in the whole show, one in the line of duty  it ain't the sixties any more. There is a perfectly fine ""M"" from Judy Dench, but no Moneypenny or ""Q"". The great Giancarlo Gianni is tucked away in a minor role as MI6's man in Montenegro but the rest of the cast, who don't have a lot to do, are unremarkable and the cars have very minor roles  no Bentley and just a couple of Aston Martins. There are also some cameos of the ""blink and you'll miss them"" variety such as Richard Branson at an airport security checkpoint.Despite the lengthy running time this was an easy movie to sit through. Having set-piece, seat-gripping action pieces intercut with quieter moments all in dazzling locations seems to have the peculiar property of making the viewer lose track of time, or at least lose track of how far into the story we are. The action peaks rather early, before the big poker game, and the Venice Palazzo bit at the end, ingenious though it is, comes almost too late. Still, most Bond films have been like that  a series of action sequences and an episodic plot (if any) and for that reasons not true to the books, which are about tastes and sensations and how it might feel to be a spy, at least if you are an upper class snob. Anyway, this Bond film is successful enough to ensure there will be another one. Look out Osama.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
"A departure from the usual Bond, and not a good one.","Let me start by saying for the most part i enjoy the recent remaking of many old ideas, such as Batman Begins and the new Battlestar Gallactica. Many of these re workings try to stay true to the best aspects of the original show/film, but take out the worst aspects, whether it be bad acting, low budget, poor effects etc.Casino Royale is very much a similar idea, but unfortunately they have got it the wrong way round. Watching it at the cinema last night, i found myself bored from about halfway through the poker game. They have stripped away the best aspects of Bond and left the worst, with bad acting and truly cringe worthy lines.They have re-invented something which simply did not need re-inventing, and in doing so have taken out everything that makes a bond film, well bond. Gone are the high tech gadgets and fast cars. The bulk of the action is over within 10 minutes and most of it has already been shown in the trailers. The rest of the film tries to be a tension filled game of cat and mouse, and ends up being a far too long game of uninteresting and very predictable poker.Comparing it to the Bourne Identity doesn't work as Bond has never really tried too hard to be as ultra realistic as Bourne. Some of the gadgets are no doubt real, but much of it is a slight escape into fantasy, such as the underwater Lotus.Making it more realistic and making Bond into more of an everyman wasn't what, in my opinion the genre needed. And instead of getting his Gadgets from Q it seems Bond is now getting his stuff from Sony Ericsson and Ford.",5.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
The Best Bond movie in years!,"Super spy James Bond receives his license to kill and is assigned to enter a high-stakes poker game against Le Chiffre, a man who finances terrorist groups. Based on the novel by Ian Fleming.Not since Sean Connery have I seen an actor play James Bond with such intensity, realism and sarcasm as Daniel Craig! Craig is a fantastic actor, when you see him in action you believe he can do the things he does on film. This Bond is unlike all the previous Bonds, this one has emotions and bleeds.The story is reminiscent of Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Thunderball and On Her Majesty's Secret Service. Expect some surprises along the way! This is a must see movie for both Bond fans and non-Bond fans alike; action, drama and a bit of humor makes this the must see movie of the year and one of the best Bond movies ever!",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Seconded only by Dr. No (maybe),"Perhaps this is the best Bond film yet, perhaps not, but definitely a front runner. They portrayed Bond as capable, witty, and most importantly, somewhat distant and casually cruel and cold-blooded. Such a dark personality would have to be a prerequisite for the type of work which he volunteers for: killing people who compromise the free world. This film was executed very nicely, and I am earnestly anticipating the next film, which is a continuation of Casino Royale, I believe. Hopefully they will keep the same trend of leaving Q branch out of the films, or at least keeping its part to a minimum. It was nice to see Bond, rather than his gadgets, kicking asses. They also pulled off the villain nicely. Le Chiffre came off as a classic Bond villain, very cold and methodical, without the absurdly complicated revenge theme used.Bond is back people!",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Favorite Bond Movie,"I liked watching Bond movies, but during Pierce Brosnan's era it was less reality. In Casino Royale the franchise has taken it to a whole new level. Exotic locations, flawless acting, and my favorite storyline. Casino Royale is more factual and more realty separating it from any other Bond movie. Action sequence are great and Daniel Craig was the ultimate choice for Bond in it.The whole story is beautiful and the ending makes people crave for more, although picked up smoothly from Quantum of Solace but lost its charms a little.I really thought the ending wasn't what I expected.

The First James Bond,"This is arguably the best interpretation of the James Bond character and here we see a more humane side rather than the stone hearted killer. Of course, this is based on Fleming's first novel, 'Casino Royale' and we see a somewhat different James Bond who falls in love, who's actually vulnerable and who's even scared at times. Daniel Craig, at first seems a little awkward, but quickly fits into Bond. His awkwardness works in favour of the character, who's quite new himself to the MI 6. He's a cold blooded killer and a hot headed protector. The beautiful and charismatic Eva Green's Vesper is different from other bond babes such that she is NOT the damsel in distress, nor the cold-hearted seductress. She too is a vulnerable character who actually does resist Bond's charm. Judi Dench's irritated M is quite funny and is a strong presence.The film is brilliant, like any other good Bond film. Mind blowing action, starting from the edge-of-your-seat chase scene in Madagascar, to the exotic locales in the Bahamas, superb high-tech gadgets (which are somewhat more realistic than what has been witnessed in other Bond films), exquisite style, an interesting villain with blood tear, beautiful women, a fine score and a fast-paced screenplay.Definitely both a visual treat and great entertainment for Action movie and Bond fans.",,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Back From the Dead,"It's well documented how much I don't like the Brosnan films but we got a new Bond because of the lack of quality in those films. That new Bond being Daniel Craig. Since this film, Casino Royale, was the first Bond film I ever saw, it has a special place in my love of Bond, and films in general. But it's not just that it was my first Bond, Casino Royale is a great film no matter what.As a new Bond usually does, Casino Royale reinvented the formulaic nature of this series. This all starts by giving Bond one of if not the best female leads of all time. Eva Green may be the first ever Bond woman of the series as she exemplifies pure strength in her vulnerability. She is not a damsel in distress and she is in no way the usual eye candy or sex object that the series can sometimes rely upon. Her chemistry with Craig is undeniable as is her likability as the stunning and seductive Vesper Lynd.It's the longest Bond film upon its release which is noticeable, but it's also used to the film's advantage. There are plenty of twists and turns to go along with some of the series' best action sequences to date. Right from the opening pre-credits to the thrilling climatic scene, Casino Royale blends the best of what modern day CGI and effects have to offer while also showing tribute to the best of what the series offered so far. Mads Mikkelsen plays Le Chiffre, a quietly manipulating investor for terrorists. The first half of the film is non-stop action packed as 007 goes after Chiffre, but it really picks up once Green and Mikkelsen come into play.Casino Royale is in many ways an origin story for Bond. We begin the film with him just being promoted to '007' status. He's careless and very much egotistical throughout the film. But he shows the beginnings to the Bond we love. We don't even here the classic Bond theme until the very end of the film, but everything really comes together perfectly for this movie. I think it may be my favorite of the series because it doesn't rely on the beautiful girls and action sequences to tell a great story. Both of those aspects are very present, but they don't overpower just how great the story and writing are. But I think the thing I appreciate the most about the film is that it treats the audience intelligently unlike the few films before it.+Origin story+Eva Green is fantastic+High powered action+Mixed with a twisted and intelligent plot+Mikkelsen+Not formulaic9.6/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Not your old respectful Bond. Watch out for this guy.,"As the world's most charismatic secret agent switches faces yet again, some changes are definitely to be expected. Many changes are for the better. For example, the action is unbelievably awesome, leaving everyone with their mouths hanging wide open. The chase scenes will undoubtedly leave you talking about them for days.There are some negative sides. If you are smart, you begin to catch on to the plot and it may seem a bit predictable. Another downside is the personality of the new Bond. He is an adulterous, egotistical,and reckless jerk. It's hard to think of him as a hero most of the movie, although he does have some redeeming traits.Don't even try to compare this to the past Bond films. This is a movie all its own. An extremely entertaining guilty pleasure blockbuster. Typical for modern Hollywood, yet clearly original.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
one of the best bond movies i have seen,"i was as everybody else went into this movie with a doubt nagging behind in my head... will Craig be able to fill in to the shoes of the spy we have all come to love and of lately started to yawn at? my heart almost went out for Craig, because he had such a big image to live up to. well all said and done, i should say that this is one of the best bond movies i had seen and may be even one of the good movies on the whole. Craig is redefining the character as we have never known him before. the subtle blends of humane and cold blooded killer, has been aptly portrayed and delivered. the absence of senseless gizmo's helps to improve the novel feel of the movie. sheer energy and ruthlessness of fight scenes are beautifully shot. after seeing this, i am just wondering what will they dish up for the next bond movie... i don't want them to ruin this whole thing all over again....",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
You have to see it!You'll get used to Daniel Craig as James Bond,"After all the controversy and comments on Daniel Craig's potential as an actor and doubts over him playing James Bond.He is at least better than Roger Moore and maybe better than Pierce Brosnan.We must accept this new bond.He deserve compliments and a new role in the next James Bond movie.He will play in the next currently on the working title ''James Bond 22''.This movie shows Bond movies don't need gadgets or something.Daniel Craig has only this role so we cant compare with other Bond movies.He has the James Bond character and the Bond humor but not the bond looks but Roger Moore doesn't have to looks and doesn't have the character.He has also more respect for women like Sean Connery for example.Everything talk about Sean Connery but he isn't the prototype he is only the first James Bond actor and he place in an other epoch in other movies so you cant compare him with Sean Connery.He is self-willed,humoristic,and cool.He has a more beautiful body but a less beautiful face.I actually accustom to this actor in a minute.Its also a cinema movie like every James Bond.Take the opportunity at the cinema.I don't miss the gadgets like a explosive pen or something.But or course the gadgets are a great James Bond item.We actually can judge or deem Daniel Craig if he plays the second Bond movie but I judge like everyone.I like adaptations in the story for example they talk about 9/11 in the movie which makes the story more understood and more recent.I want to see this movie many times more because the actions are amazing.The stunts are amazing and the whole storyline is understood more than other movie such as Goldeneye and The World is Noy enough.I saw the Dutch premiere 11/23 which makes more special to.There was also a dramatic moment at the last few minutes.And at moment he said like always My name is Bond,James Bond, which is a tradition.It's not the best movie I have ever seen but you must see it!James Bond is not a robot and not immortal.He is a person, a human and or course a womanizer, but with respect for women.Mads Mikkelsen is a great actor he plays la Chiffre and looks like a bastard and looks scary.I give it 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"

In this movie Bond grows up, he learns form his mistakes and he realize what 00 means. The new Bond has born. The movie is also with some humor.

My review,"If you are a die-hard Bond Movie fan, then let me warn you, you are in for a serious disappointment. There are no gizmos, no ""Shaken not Stirred"" Vodka Martinis, no typical bond movie stuff. The silhouettes of femme-fatales in the opening track are conspicuously absent. But hold on, I am not saying the movie is crap, its pretty good. It's more about the evolution of Bond as Bond.Contrary to my expectations, Daniel Craig has done a great job as James Bond and Eva Green is absolutely stunning.In case you don't know it by now, the movie opens with Bond earning his double '0' status after two quick assassinations. Some fast pace action follows with some really thrilling stunts moving from Uganda to Madagascar to Bahamas to Miami before it finally reaches the Casino Royale at Montenegro. The Poker game is slow and tends to drag the movie. Almost getting killed by poisoning, losing a round to his enemy, winning the big stakes, getting captured and whipped by his enemies, 007 does it all. And for a change, professes his love for the leading lady.But that's not the end... A bollywood style climax awaits you. After all no movie is bond movie till you hear the golden five words ""The name's Bond, James Bond"".",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
A Different Bond Movie,"Daniel Craig plays Bond at the beginning of his 007 career when his character is still evolving. His Bond is more down-to-earth and less cocky. The film is more character driven than its predecessors with fewer stunts, chases and explosions. The amazing gadgets and the banter with Q and Moneypenny are no more. Bond makes his first kills and the violence is grittier and less cartoonish. He falls in love with his beautiful MI6 colleague Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), who is smart, witty and delightful. Unfortunately, the love story is an annoying distraction and really belongs in a different film.Like all Bond films the plot doesn't make much sense. The Dr. Evil character is Le Chiffre, a fund manager to the world's terrorist organizations? MI6 finds out that Le Chiffre is planning to risk his client's money in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro at Le Casino Royale. MI6 assigns 007 to use taxpayer's money to play poker against him, knowing that if Le Chiffre loses the terrorists will be short of cash. In the real world MI6 and the CIA would have arrested Le Chiffre and thrown away the key. With no backup Bond is inevitably captured and there is a strange sado-masochistic torture scene.Although the Brosnan films had become far-fetched and formulaic they were also enjoyable in their own way. The producers have obviously watched the Bourne movies and opted for more realism. Craig is very athletic with an impressive physique but the trouble with turning Bond into a run-of-the-mill screen tough guy is that he loses some of his charm. Although Casino Royale is entertaining it could have done with more action and humor. It will be interesting to see whether the producers fall back on the traditional formula for the next flick, although the film seemed better on second viewing.",8.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
back to a good action film,"The film combines a good story, good acting, and some excellent stunts to produce a pleasing action movie. For a change, the stunts seemed to be things a human could do (barely). There was some poor logic in the script particularly during gambling scenes. They reduced the effectiveness of the film since I found myself thinking, ""that's silly."" I didn't personally feel the female lead had the sexual firepower required for her role. The end of the film was first rate. The final scene and the final line of dialog were knockouts and reminded me of part of the appeal of some of the early Bond films. The Bond character seems more like the one I remember from reading some of the books years ago. He was completely committed to his job which he did impersonally using his intelligence and considerable athletic ability. He was also very lucky.",7.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
Casino Royale Confusion!,"I went to see Casino Royale with an open mind but still with the mindset that it will follow all other Bonds - bad guy, bad girl, fun fighting and ending with Bond in an embrace with a good girl. However, I was completely taken aback. The fighting was amazingly realistic and I thought that the four people I can think of that die, die in purely horrific ways with a lot of blood and pain. There is also a truly horrific, mind blowing scene, which trust me you'll know when you see it which one i'm talking about, which begs the question whether this film should be a 12A. Also, I personally found this film kinda confusing. Ususally with other Bonds, you can stick it on while doing the housework or the ironing and thoroughly enjoy it. However with this installment, you actually had to pay attention as there is a twist at the end with which if you weren't paying complete attention, may confuse you.There is a lot so right with this film though. It has a fantastic chase scene at the beginning and the story is far more compelling and intriguing than previous Bonds. It also has an amazing opening credits with an equally amazing theme tune which I would pay good money again just to see that! It has taken a more Die Hard approach which has done wonders for the Bond franchise. More action, more grit, more twists. There are less corny one-liners (however prepare yourself for the odd one or two) and hardly any gadgets - no incredibly cringe worthy invisible car as seen in Die Another Day. And in my opinion Daniel Craig did an excellent job as a different Bond that was so needed.I honestly believe this is one of the best films of the year, with the action, romance, grit and humour in perfect quantities. If you go to see this film, keep a completely open mind and don't expect a traditional Bond. You will fully be blown away.",10.0,Anonymous,"Action, Adventure"
