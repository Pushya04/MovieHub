"I can't protect you, not like this.","Frank Farmer is a top line bodyguard, formerly secret service protector to President Reagan, he is approached to guard Rachel Marron, the latest pop sensation on the cusp of Hollywood domination. After initially being reluctant to take the job, Farmer gets to the task of protecting Rachel from a potential maniac who's been sending her threatening letters. As the initial in camp hostilities die down, Frank & Rachel start to draw ever closer, but so does the person who wants her dead...The Bodyguard is one of those films that was long in gestation, originally mooted in 1976 to star Steve McQueen (it was written with McQueen in mind in the 60s) and Diana Ross, it was put on the back burner after McQueen fell ill to the cancer that killed him. Then it resurfaced in 1979 with Diana Ross to play opposite Ryan O'Neal, but the two stars just couldn't get on and the project again fell by the wayside. Enter Kevin Costner and his boys at TIG Productions, original choice to star alongside Costner, Maddona, ruined her chance (thankfully) of starring after being a bitch to Costner in her Truth Or Dare documentary. In stepped Whitney Houston (brilliantly diva casting), Costner gave himself a crew cut (in homage to McQueen) and The Bodyguard went on to make $410,900,000 worldwide.The film now seems like a myth to me because the rating across many forums is on the low side, critics hate it and you will be hard pressed to find macho film fans readily about to own up to liking the picture. That's a shame because as undeniably nonsense as it is, it has got a great thriller heart to blend in with its romantic core. The good ship Bodyguard may dock at all the formula ports in the genres, but it's one hell of a journey getting to the end, even with that song that seemed to top the charts for years! (the soundtrack to the movie selling 17 million in America alone).In spite of the obviousness of the plot, and the general feeling of familiarity, The Bodyguard has much going for it, things that ensured it became a monster hit and had cinema goers queueing round the block to see it. Houston is something of a revelation, here she nails the diva bitch heart of gold portrayal of Rachel with astonishing ease, and couple that with a voice sent from some deity paradise far away, makes her total value for money. Costner also stepped up to the plate to win a new breed of fans as Farmer, his charm and laid back manner works well with a ruggedness that the male viewers could easily get on side with. The rest of the cast are merely playing second fiddle to the well matched up leads, and outside of Gary Kemp becoming increasingly annoying as the film progresses, they all blend in well to create what is now a sadly undervalued picture.See it with someone you love, don't just take my word for it, look at the box office take, it doesn't lie. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
I quite enjoyed it,"The Bodyguard is fundamentally a love story between two contrasting characters with their own idiosyncrasies. The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Really good romantic drama,"Despite a few dumb twists, The Bodyguard is a really good romantic drama. Kevin Costner is great in the lead role and Whitney Houston is really good in her debut role and they have good chemistry. It's well paced, well filmed and Mick Jackson's direction is good. The music by Alan Silvestri is really good and the soundtrack is excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Saturday Night Movie,"Why do people trash this movie? It's not high art but it's thoroughly entertaining. WH's performance in this movie is better than all her others...just watch the scene when she asks Frank Farmer to take her on a date. Natural, unaffected and charming. Kevin Costner underplays his role and I enjoyed watching him. I just bought the anniversary DVD and it has great backstage footage and very interesting tidbits. For example, it was Kevin Costner's idea, against a lot of protest, to have WH sing the first few bars of 'I will Always Love You' acapella. Smart man. And it is interesting to listen to the comments of Costner about this movie. He was a major star but he waited and held up production of this movie a year so he could get WH. He didn't want anyone else and was willing to wait for her. He refused to interject a story line that would 'explain' the Black/White thing (Bravo). And although Black/White pairings are fairly common now, THEN, for a major star to have a real black love interest ( and an untested actress at that) was a bold move. And it paid off. I don't know why he has not been as successful recently. The DVD interviews were done about 2 yrs ago and WH was still drug crazy (so no interviews with her) but Kevin Costner's last words in the interviews are about her and he said, among other things, that he would always love Whitney. Their chemistry was spot on. I WILL ALWAYS LOVE THIS MOVIE.",,Anonymous,Music
I was made to watch this in 2022,"After keeping the secret safe for 30 odd years I finally let it slip to my fiancée that I hadn't seen this.So that ended up being my Sunday afternoon.I am pleased to say that this is actually pretty good.In some ways not an awful lot happens in this (like a lot of 90's movies) but the characters are engaging and the story is lean and holds it all together without getting too complicated.I was surprised that there was some action, Kevin does a few roly-poly's through windows and there are some fisty-cuffs but this is mostly romance with a dash of suspense.It is strange seeing something for the first time that is firmly ingrained into pop-culture.After seeing poor old Whitney dragged out for public appearances in the last stages of her life it was startling to see her in her full, magnificent glory.The ""I will always love you"" moment was ever-present in my mind like a shark circling a life raft.But when it came it was still pretty impactful.This has three special effects in it and two of them are really bad by todays standard - but mostly I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed this and I think it stands up.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Costner and Houston's chemistry save a bland plot,"A movie/music star who needs protection from a psychotic fan, wow what a concept. And who better to play it than Whitney Houston, a stretch I know.The plot is totally disappointing and bland. Luckily the on-screen romance and chemistry from Houston and Costner, along with a great soundtrack, save this film from being a total bust. The love story between Costner and Houston becomes the main driving force, preventing the film from running out of ideas. In the end the romance is what you take away from the film, not the convoluted mystery plot.It's enjoyable in the end and I would recommend it. Of course the soundtrack is one of the best and most popular in history with ""I Will Always Love You"", ""Run to You"", ""I Have Nothing"", and ""I'm Every Woman.""",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A lightweight melodrama,"Whitney Houston's screen debut is a lavish urban thriller that takes itself quite seriously but never gets going. The film stumbles from one scene to another and never has any semblance of a coherent, believable story. The production values are top notch all around but the plot is utterly senseless. Houston does well in her role as a temperamental diva, is talented, pretty, bitchy and vulnerable. She fares much better than star Kevin Costner, who plays the title role. Costner seems unsure of himself and comes across as tentative and hopelessly wooden, although he and Houston do seem to have a bit of chemistry between them. Ralph Waite is fine as the bodyguard's father but the rest of the cast overacts to the point of silliness.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Oh my goodness!,"There was a time when there were no internet for me, no video and no satellite.
I was a 19 y.o. boy, young and full of emotions. A naive young fellow knowing nothing about life and its twists.
One day, while waiting at a bus station, I overheard two friends talking about a movie called 'The Bodyguard' and that how good that was, how they enjoyed it and how Withney Houston shone in it.
Years passed, I lived my life, but I always had memory of that conversation in the back of my mind as if waiting for the right moment and opportunity to grab and watch that film.
And opportunity it came one day with its video from a friend. I put the cassette in the player and started watching the anticipated movie with unbelievable excitement and happiness.And the movie rolled over me like an avalanche...That was a rollercoaster of emotions, chemistry, love, acting, music and one of the best and unique voices of the 20th century that I experienced.That was one of the most beautiful and heartwarming movies that I have ever had the pleasure to watch.Kevin Costner and Withney Houston were just diamond-like in it and outshone themselves in every aspect.Tears are appearing in the corners of my eyes as I am writing this review. This is a review full of memories of my youth as well as the rainbow of true emotions that were conveyed by the eternally alive comet called The Bodyguard.Withney, I've always loved you. No other singer has ever been like you and never will be.
You had one of the most beautiful, powerful and mind-blowing voice of all time. All you needed was a microphone and the audience was in awe.
We will always love you and cherish your dear memory.RIP",10.0,Anonymous,Music
When Kevin Costner Ruled The World,"Bodyguard (1992)Plot In A Paragraph: Frank Farmer (KC) a former Secret Service agent takes on the job of bodyguard to a singing superstar Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston)Whilst I do not rate The Bodyguard as high as some people do. It is an enjoyable movie, I happen to have watched it a lot in recent years, and I always like it, but I can go years without feeling the need to revisit it.It is hard to say what I don't like, as it's nothing in particular, I just find the directing a bit flat, and at times the actors are poorly framed. I remember I loved it when it was released, but by the time I watched it again on video, my opinion if it, had dropped considerably.The soundtrack is very effective, all the new songs are catchy and for the second year in a row, the single to a KC movie dominates the charts. I knew the song I Will Always Love You from the Burt Reynolds/Dolly Parton movie The Best Little Whorehouse In Texas. And whilst I still call it a Dolly Parton song, I know many call it a Whitney Houston one, and think of her version as the definitive one.Of the cast, in her first movie Houston is very good. I'm surprised she didn't make more movies (she only made 4 more) as the talent was there. It's another less is more performance from KC, similar to his performance in The Untouchables, but it's still effective here, and he has some good, witty lines. All the supporting cast are fine too.The film had to undergo some hasty re-cutting when test audiences hated the original ending with Farmer dying after saving Marron. I remember KC saying in an interview, that he didn't even understand the new ending to the movie.Sadly for me the tacked on happier ending ruins things a bit!! As Farmer is clearly shot in the chest and gut at Oscars, but he turns up at the airport with his arm in a sling.It was another $100 million plus grosser for KC as The Bodyguard finished the year the 7th highest grossing movie of 1992, with a domestic gross of $121 million.8/10 for this reviewer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Worth It Just for the Singing,"Whitney Houston became a movie star in this film, which offers a lot of insight into the level of talent and appeal she had some 20 years before her untimely death in 2012. Although this is not a musical per se (more of a romantic thriller), Houston plays a pop singer and performs, among other songs, her signature tune, ""I Will Always Love You,"" which was written by country legend Dolly Parton. ---from Musicals on the Silver Screen, American Library Association, 2013",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Stiff with no chemistry,Can't believe I made it through the whole movie. Literally couldn't wait for it end. I can't believe this is the same actor who starred in Dances with Wolves. If you have ever seen Boogie Nights and saw Dirk Diggler in action you may notice Kevin Costner was another Dirk. Whitney had her moments where she was quite good. Be even she couldn't save this fraud of a movie.,3.0,Anonymous,Music
Intriguing Story,"I have watched many action movies but this one makes one think: what happens next? This material could have been handled badly, but it comes out refined and elegant.Both Whitney Hustoun and Kevin Costner stay true to their types, yet sharing a common purpose giving a spiritual dimension to the movie as observed by a commentator.This is not a conventional romantic movie and that is why many are disappointed. It is a throwback to old concepts of chivalry and knighthood. The remarkable point to observe is that it is a modern story about an independent woman and her child.This is a movie which feels good and genuine in the end.",,Anonymous,Music
Romantic movie well made,"I don't know why this was nominated for razzies, its actually not that bad. Its actually pretty enjoyable romance and very charismatic leads with a lot of chemistry, overall it has action, suspense, romance, and a very good revelation near the end, it's actually very good, an above average, love Whitney very much she is amazing and very well actress, and i hope you enjoy this movie as much as i did, i just love a Good romance movie of the 80s-90s and this is perfect for the whole family and i think its a well deserved classic with a great soundtrack and a very warming feel, ok this is all my review, thanks.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Overblown, overheated, overrated","Annoyingly stupid movie, meant to launch Whitney Houston's acting career and, apparently, Kevin Costner's fallback career as a model for terrible haircuts. Houston is, of course, gorgeous and sings like an angel, but her acting ""talent"" is nowhere to be seen, and her ineptness brings down the whole movie--not that it had a lot going for it in the first place. After Houston, playing a pop diva, starts getting death threats from an obsessed and obviously crazed fan, Costner--a former Secret Service agent--is hired to protect her. Instead of showing appreciation for his efforts to save the lives of her and her family, however, Houston proceeds to fight him at every turn, insulting him, mocking his attempts to turn her house into a secure area and generally making a complete ass of herself, and her attitude spreads to her entourage and hangers-on, all of whom turn on Costner. In the real world Costner's character would have told her to screw off after the first day and dumped her, but--in a plot ""twist"" you can see coming a mile away--they proceed to fall in love. Yeah, right.Anyway, like I said, Houston is great to look at, her voice is divine, and Costner tries hard, but overall this movie is not much more than an extended episode of ""General Hospital"" or some other equally brainless soap opera, and is just as predictable and badly acted. Houston's fans will like it, Costner's fans might like it, but anyone else is strongly advised to avoid it.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than you think it is,"The story of a superstar singer who falls in love with her bodyguard could have been a major disaster. I remember the previews and thinking it was going to be one. However once the film was out and I actually watched it I was pleasantly surprised to find out that this is a really good romance and a really good thriller. Of course its hokey and Hollywood and all of that but you get sucked in and carried along for its running time.Trust me this is better than you think it is.The only problem is that the film is a bit too long to do what it has to do. I think the problem is in the early part of the film where all of th e pieces are being set in motion, however once its all going its great.Get some popcorn your honey and enjoy.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I'm af - I'm afraid of not being there.,"Kevin Costner was right to insist that Whitney Houston costar in this film. All doubts were removed after she nailed the screen test the other producers insisted upon before they would agree.This may have been her film debut, but she came across as extremely believable in her role. Yes, it was a bit hackneyed, especially with the addition of Ralph Waite as Costner's father, but it was still very enjoyable.If you watch it for nothing else, the music was sensational. In fact, the soundtrack sold 100 million copies. It was that good. I Have Nothing and Run to You even got Oscar and Grammy nominations.It's a very good film to sit back and enjoy just for Whitney's singing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Underrated film,"Inter-racial relationships in a mainstream Hollywood film were rare back in 1992 and this was quite a revolutionary film, as it showed how normal it looked and not really questioned, and yet the poster of the time did a lot to underplay that. And Whitney Houston could really act, fragile and tough at the same time. I have reservations about Kevin Costner as an actor, but somehow he is right in this film and apparently wanted to act with Houston a lot. The plot is simple, but exciting to watch and the electricity between Costner and Huston is erotic, beautiful to see and the tender love scene with what looked like a samurai sword between them riveting to watch. Caught this on a UK channel. and it is rarely showed. A fine film that should be seen and shown on television more often in the UK than it is. I liked it back in 1992 and I like it even better now. A lot of details like the fund raising event for AIDS showed how exactly the film was aware of its time. Dramatic, tender and well worth re-evaluation.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Love/hate...,"The Bodyguard is an example of a movie that isn't for everyone. I personally didn't either love it or hate it, I was overall kind of eh on it. The dialogue is cheesy, the characters underdeveloped and lacking subtlety, the pace drags in the middle and the story makes little sense. However we do have some good cinematography, locations, costumes and editing, credible direction and a great soundtrack including the haunting And I Will Always Love You(and it will always be the best version no matter how many Huston wannabes try to sing it and end up murdering it). The acting is fine, Kevin Costner is good and Whitney Huston is more than credible in a role that showcases her beautiful voice excellently. Overall, The Bodyguard is a love or hate it sort of movie, but for me my reaction was mixed. 6/10 Bethany Cox",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A Great Romantic Thriller,"I just recently watched The Bodyguard again and i forgot how good it was.Costner plays the role of the obsessed bodyguard perfectly and Houston's first feature film performance was flawless.This story of an obsessed stalker terrorising a famous performer and the bodyguard trying to protect her at all costs, was made in a refreshing way, even to compete with todays movie standardsMick Jackson's The Bodyguard is a great movie to watch over and over again even when you find out whodunnit .",,Anonymous,Music
He's got her covered.,"Two professionals of different kinds. One who has to cultivate an outgoing and accessible air because that's how she makes her living, and one who keeps his emotions in and tries wherever possible to stay in the background as part of his. Mutual attraction will place limits on both of their lives - if they manage to stay safe for long enough, that is...Costner is well-suited to playing the stoic and intense action man, and casting Whitney Houston as a singer allows her a fairly comfortable start in the movies. They make an appealing enough couple and their chemistry together is of the simmering type. Some have criticised the leading female, but I believe her underplaying works well enough that we can glimpse a vulnerable dimension to her character.The whole thing seems content to serve as a glossy potboiler for the shameless romantic - and help to shift millions of soundtrack units along the way, of course. It's something of an easy sell, I suppose, but I'm still left admiring how it's packaged. A triple handkerchief affair for some females, no doubt, but it's flashy enough in certain spots to be of moderate interest to the guys too. Cross-gender appeal is what Hollywood strives for, and they hit upon a smooth and stylish blend here.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"Peak Costner, Peak Houston (musically.)","Former Bodyguard to Ronald Reagan, Frank Farmer, is hired to look after musical superstar Rachel Marron, who's life is in danger.I have truly never understood why this Oscar nominated movie is so lowly rated, it seems to have been forgotten about, in all but one area, the music.This film was huge when it first came out, and sure it features one of the greatest soundtracks in history, but it holds up well, it's a romantic thriller, and who doesn't enjoy a hero movie, particularly when it's in the guise of Kevin Costner, from a time where was deservedly, was Hollywood royalty.I watch it quite often, with a degree of sadness, for one reason, Whitney, when I see what she could have become, she was good, in spite of it being her movie debut, the combination of her and Costner worked to great effect.I still find it very rewarding, of course it's a little bit corny, a little cheesy, but it still works so well. I will always love you will always be remembered as one of the all time great songs.Don't judge a book by its cover, give it a go.8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wonderful Movie,"Oh my, what a wonderful movie. Hollywood is known for churning out a lot of sentimental mush that's supposed to pass for romance. But, thankfully, this is not one of those movies. In this movie the main characters, the bodyguard and the lady he is hired to protect, are likable and have a relationship that develops into something really beautiful and special. Moreover, the story is plausible and the movie is well-acted too, with Whitney Houston turning in an outstanding performance reminiscent of Diana Ross's in Lady Sings the Blues (which is another great movie). If you want to watch a movie with good acting and an engaging story, then this is the movie to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Pairing,"Besides turning out a smash hit song Bodyguard was also a good movie.The stunning Whitney Houston plays Rachel Marron, an entertainer who's had threats on her life. Kevin Costner plays Frank Farmer, the no-nonsense bodyguard that's been hired to protect her. Their personalities couldn't be more different. She's loose, open, and dangerously carefree. Frank is conservative, tight-lipped, no-nonsense and all-business. They were definitely an odd couple.The storyline was a dandy and the onscreen chemistry between Costner and Houston was good. To be honest, I was surprised by Whitney Houston's acting skills. It's not an automatic that a singer can crossover no matter how accomplished of a singer she was. Michael Jackson was just passable as an actor. ""The Bodyguard"" overall was a solid production with one of the best pairings you can think of.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The best bad movie ever,"The Bodyguard is a movie with many flows and one redeeming factor: the WH factor. People went to see this picture because they wanted to see Whitney singing and she delivered some of her most passionate vocal performances before the mesmerised eyes of her millions of fans on the big screen. Let's face it, who wants to see her acting when she can sing so beautifully?The unrelenting criticism by couch 'drama experts' of her acting seems a tad over the top. She never claimed to be an actress and despite this being her film debut, she did not disgrace herself. She did the best she could with what she was given: a patchy character with very little to say. What else could she do to play this role? Well, just what she did, sing her heart out.The best thing that Kevin Costner did was to insist that Whitney was the only one he wanted for this part. He knew he had a winner, but he also tried to do too much with the story: a romantic thriller with patches of 'comedy', a study in professional-personal conflict and 'who done it' thrown in. That's the reason for the plot's erratic turns and the non existent character development. The glue that holds the whole mess together is Whitney, the singer, looking stunning and sounding like an angel.This could have been a gigantic flop and instead it was a massive hit. It will remain a phenomenon in popular culture because it delivered what the vast majority of its audience wanted: escapism, a couple of hours away from their own reality and a look inside the glamorous life of a superstar. They were entertained by a great pop singer, who had made a huge video clip for her songs and they did not mind paying for the privilege. Those who hate The Bodyguard, went to see it with some unrealistic expectations of 'serious cinema and acting'?! Hey, go to see foreign movies with subtitles for that and come down from your pretentious cloud.",,Anonymous,Music
There's something special about this movie,"If I read the script I probably would've rated this movie a 4 or a 5 based on my imagination on how the movie would go. But the way they executed it made it so much better than it has business being.I think it's Houston and Costner's performance. They don't overdo it like most romance stories do. So I was fooled into believing that the story would match their performances. ""It can't be corny. They play it straight."" Yet it was.And what stuck to my mind most wasn't how corny the story was, but that the romance was pretty good. That's how good they made a movie with a 5/10 corny script. Still a 7 cos I can't defend an 8 with this story, but they really made the most out of it.It also reminds me of a time when movies were really made for theaters and was some sort of a spectacle. Just like in amusement parks you know what's coming but still enjoy the ride, I could see some moments in the film coming with how predictable it was yet still enjoy it. People put too much emphasis on not being predictable nowadays, when most of the time, that's not the point.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Flat-lined After 30 Min,"Lack luster performance from Kevin Costner. Although, I wouldn't expect anything more from him. A movie that can't decide if it's a romance or action film, that makes every scene seem over dramatic, but somehow still boring. Zero chemistry between the two actors creating a very forced relationship. The exposition makes you interested followed by a movie that makes you want to look at your phone.

I could hardly sit through this,"First of all, I never really cared for Houston's singing from the beginning of her career. It was too Ethel Merman/Carol Burnett, but at least they were fun. I preferred Dolly Parton's version of 'I will always love you' for its sweetness. It's not the kind of song that needs to be belted out at full volume. Second, I don't think she is all that beautiful either with those lifeless eyes of hers and the bitchiness came way too easy for her.Kevin Costner looks good in clothes (costumes) but has the voice of a 15 year old boy. I've never liked any of his movies or his attempts at acting.Put these 2 together and voilà, an awful, awful mess. Was the interracial love affair supposed to be daring in the 90s? Did Whitney get threatening letters for her performance in this thing as well as the character she played? Did Kevin go to Supercuts during a power blackout? We want to know.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
it can't get any worse,"Hopefully, you won't be left in the dark about the ending of this one. Very predictable, poorly acted, poorly conceived.

Then fall asleep like I did. Watch the last five minutes to confirm what you already know to be true. You'll have a great nap and know you solved a ""twisted"" plot with no effort whatsoever.

Predictable fluff suitable for Houston debut.,"The Bodyguard has a history behind it that should have served as a warning to Lawrence Kasden and Kevin Costner when they considered making this film. Of course after the box office that this film grossed, (it made a lot) I am certain they don't see it that way.The script for this film was originally intended as a vehicle for Clint Eastwood with Diana Ross to star as the female lead.  I'm not too sure what happened over the years, but the script sat in limbo and the stars got too old to play those parts.Kevin Costner got the script and originally wanted Madonna to play the female lead.  A bad mistake, to say the least, but suffice it to say, she turned it down.  In the end Whitney Houston, who was looking for something to launch her inevitable movie career took the part and history was made.The Bodyguard is the story of a former secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who can't forgive himself for the fact that he had the day off the day that Ronald Reagan was shot.  I'm sure Jim Brady would have some choice words for this guy.  (In the original script, Eastwood would have been agonizing over the Kennedy assassination.)   To console himself he works as a bodyguard for private citizens.His latest job offer is for pop diva, Rachael Marron.  She has a stalker after her and her people are keeping her in the dark as what is going on. Even though Frank doesn't do celebrities, Rachael's people convince him to take the case.And from here the story moves on its predictable course.  Naturally Frank and Rachael do not get along at first.  He's the serious type who puts all of his energy into his work.  She's the bitchy type who puts all of her energy into her work.Frank finds fault in Rachael's current security and goes to great lengths to fix everything.  At the same time, a list of suspects start to come out of the wood work.  It seems that Rachael has a few enemies in her jealous sister, her over eager publicist, her macho bodyguard and some freaky looking albino guy who can't stop following her.Some mayhem occurs, and of course Frank and Rachael start to fall for each other.Kevin Costner is by far the most boring actor ever and this film simply serves to prove that, even though he over acts to the bitter end.  Whitney Houston is OK playing the disco queen from hell, however something tells me she didn't have to stretch too much for this one.All in all the film follows along the typical Hollywood path of boy meets girl, boy hates girl, boy has sex with girl, boy and girl fight the bad guys and so on.The Bodyguard is a movie that I suggest you pass on, particularly if you like some depth in your films. Whitney fans should stick to the sound track. Costner fans should stick to some of his better films, like Field of Dreams and Dances with Wolves.",,Anonymous,Music
Cut to commercial! Cut to commercial!,"***SPOILERS*** Kevin Costner as ex secret service agent Frank Farmer looks genuinely board stiff as his role demands him to be guarding the body of singer and actress Rachel Marron, Whitney Houston, as her bodyguard in ""The Bodyguard"". Coaster or Farmer walks around looking so deadpan throughout most of the movie that he seems to be suffering from a serious case of shell shock from his previous job as a secret service agent. It's a habit that he picked up over the years guarding both Presidents Carter and Regan in him being able to blend in with the furniture or background in him remaining inconspicuous, to any attempted assassins, on he job. Taking on an assignment at the insistence of his good friend Mr. Dewaney, Bill Cobbs, to be Miss Marron's personal bodyguard the company that he surrounds herself with get so intrusive in him doing his job that he almost quits before he begins. It's Rachel's sweet looks and bubbling personality that keeps him on the job guarding her and also the fact that those in her entourage of flunkies and hanger on being so completely incompetent in doing their jobs that makes him stay.We and Farmer know right away that someone out there is trying to do Rachel in but that fact is kept from her by those around her that makes Farmer's job that much more difficult. Acting as if she doesn't have a care or fear in the world Rachel doesn't realize that her life and body, the body that Farmer is guarding with his life, is in serious danger. It's only much later when Rachel gets a disturbing pone call, on her private phone number, that she finally gives in and lets Farmer do his job protecting her life. It's her obsessed fan and stalker who's planning to whack her at the biggest moment in Rachel's life when she's to accept the Academy Award for best actress with over a billion people watching the great event live and on TV all over the globe.***SPOILERS*** The love angle in the movie doesn't quite pan out with Farmer and Marron never really clicking in their love scenes that come across mechanical and not genuine at all. Farmer for one is so intense in all of his scenes that showing affection towards Rachel seems out of character for him in the movie. It's only in the last few moments that Farmer gets his act together in realizing who's out to knock off Rachel that he really seems to care for Rachel and tries to save her life even at the expense of his own. But by then she's so turned off by his almost zombie or robot like action that she almost allows her intended killer to do her in by not believing or responding to Farmers frantic attempts to save her life.Both Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston as Frank Farmer & Rachel Marro did their best to make their parts in the movie work and the final payoff with a by then a disgraced, in letting things get out of hand, Farmer saving Rachel's life which saved the film from being total disaster. It was sad that the film ""The Bodyguard"" in a way predicted its star Whitney Houston's actual death some 20 years later in 2012. It was then just like in the movie Whitney faced death this time in her hotel bathtub, not from an assassin's bullet, just before she was to receive a Grammy for her music like an Academy Award for her acting in ""The Bodygurad"". But this time in real life not in the movies the outcome was sadly a lot different.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A very standard movie with a little bit of corn,"Former Secret Service agent Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) is a no nonsense bodyguard who doesn't like to get involved with his clients or stay around too long. Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) is a pop diva with a stalker. Her manager Devaney (Bill Cobbs) begs Frank to work for her. She is reluctantly to have the bodyguard interfere with her life, and it's obvious that they haven't told her the worst of the situation.Written by Lawrence Kasdan and directed by Mick Jackson, this is a very standard and predictable thriller. Kevin Costner is very solid as the straight laced guard. Some may downgrade the movie because of Whitney Houston. However I found her to be a good natural performer especially for someone who is untrained. She actually adds a sense of reality. There is no denying that she has the persona of a pop diva. And it helps to have her great soundtrack to prove the point. The romance is a bit corny. That's probably its biggest weak point. The movie expects a little too much from an acting novice.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
memorable performance by Whitney,"What a sad day today (11 FEB 2012).The Bodyguard will not go down in cinematic history as an unforgettable film, but Whitney's acting performance was just that indeed and quite compelling.After seeing this movie when it came out two decades ago now, I was really hoping she would shift career gears just a little bit in order to more cultivate these acting talents.It's hardly believable that such a great talent has departed at such a young age.R.I.P.

Two hours better spent down the pub,"I had the misfortune to see this film when it was first released. A decade on, and my hatred for this puerile stinker remains unabated.Think of your very worst celluloid nightmare.

Even ""The Swarm"" had some redeeming features.All the depressingly familiar ingredients are here: wooden acting, stilted dialogue and warbly singing. It's overlong, overrated and features one of the most irritating soundtracks in the history of American cinema, which makes me want to stick pins into a wax work effigy of Dolly Parton every time I hear it.Mow the lawn, bath the dog, watch paint dry. I implore you do anything but watch this film.How the respected British Director, Mick Jackson, became involved with this outrage is anyone's guess.

I quite enjoyed it,"The Bodyguard is fundamentally a love story between two contrasting characters with their own idiosyncrasies. The plot is intriguing enough to carry the film through and the romance between Costner and Houston builds steadily and realistically.With some decent action scenes, a decent cast and a great soundtrack, i found the Bodyguard to be an enjoyable movie.Clearly this film is not for everyone, it doesn't have enough action to satisfy the action fans, it isn't thrilling enough to be a thriller and as a pure romance film it is fairly weak; but i have to admit it does balance between these 3 genres quite well without excelling in any one of them.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston team up to strong effect,"'The Bodyguard' makes for entertaining viewing from the early 1990s, as Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston team up to strong effect.Costner plays the titular role of Frank, very nicely might I add. You like the character pretty instantaneously, feeling as if he is the perfect man to protect Rachel. Houston, as the latter, is impressively good given it's her film debut, I really enjoy her performance throughout the 129 minutes.That aforementioned run time is probably too long, as the film does drag its legs as the third act is on the horizon; everything before and after that moment is entertaining, though. Another critique of mine would be the editing, which is choppy in parts.Houston's soundtrack is obviously excellent, while the premise is certainly engaging. It doesn't do everything else perfectly, but this is still one to watch and have a very fine time with.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Looked to be promising at first.,"Whatever films I comment on this site, The Bodyguard was a movie that was quite promising at first when it was premiered in 1992 and this was due to the number of commercials it received like TV adverts and movie posters displayed at shop windows or lit-up bus stop shelters but then several film critics in the media actually painted a different picture and sometimes gave it an average rating. It was clearly a movie that saw Kevin Costner's film career start to wane through highs and lows where to this day, he makes frequent appearances in second rated films despite some previous film successes like Dances With Wolves or JFK.
I did watch The Bodyguard a couple of years later on the living room box after reading the usually average ratings in the press. The film
turned out to be quite dull for a number of reasons with the plot about a bodyguard assigned to protect a celebrity singer played by one Whitney Houston, fictitious or not! It was even Whitney Houston's first attempts in making movies with Kevin Costner being the minder as he has to deal with Houston's sometimes annoying ""off-stage"" part as if she cared less about her own safety from a mob of deranged fans and behaves like a spoilt child that can sometimes become a cause for discomfort. I remember the adverts for this film very well and considering that, it okay.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Lousy and lazy.,"So, Hollywood got it wrong once again. This supposedly romantic film is anything but romantic. Its about satisfying one's lust. Yup, this is more of a lust story than a love story.'Pretty Woman' was romantic. 'When Harry met Sally' was predictable and cheesy, but even this was romantic. 'The Bodyguard' is not. There's also no chemistry between Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston whatsoever. On the contrary; it felt forced.Rachel is a superstar actress and singer (oh, whoopee, lets cast Whitney Houston) who is assigned a bodyguard after receiving death threats. Kevin Costner - ever so dashing and charming - stars as Frank Farmer, the bodyguard.The plot is predictable and the script and dialogue rather lousy at times.

OK romantic thriller with some good scenes,"For the most part, this is a passable love story with thriller elements thrown in. It's easy to watch. What's odd is that Whiteney Houston, who is not an experienced actress, gives a more believable performance than veteran actor Kevin Costner. Costner has done well in other movies but was wooden here. He's trying to do a Steve McQueen cooler-than-cool turn, but he seems like a wind-up toy soldier. Also worthy of censure is Costner's haircut, which was rightly criticized at the time. Houston is convincing enough, but it's because she's essentially playing herself. They have a love scene, which was also OK but nothing memorable. There is the supporting cast, which is good enough but nothing memorable. The screenplay is occasionally exciting but usually routine and not always believable. Costner's character probably wouldn't have been in the secret service to begin with if he's traumatized by a shooting that took place when he was off duty at a funeral. The soundtrack is the real star and this film features some great songs. Also praiseworthy is the ending, which was one of the few parts to avoid romantic clichés. It's very easy watching and will appeal to fervent fans of Whiteney Houston and romantic drama.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

A thriller that needs to find a main focus,"Romantic thrillers can work, they just need to have good direction. But for this film, directed by Mick Jackson, did not keep a steady eye on where the plot had to be. Much of the time I was trying to figure out what on earth was happening with the plot that seemed to go on endlessly.The story of the bodyguard is about Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), a veteran in the art of protection and now only takes care of special VIPs. Sadly, the character of Farmer is so thinly written that nothing ever changes for the better in this man. His entire outlook on his job is strictly to be emotionless. The audience isn't even explained to why the only beverage he drinks is a glass of orange juice.Co-starring Costner is Whitney Huston, a pop culture icon ironically playing a fictional pop culture icon named Rachel Marron. Her character is eccentric and snobby but it works. At least she tries to excite Mr. Farmer, but even she is not able to get him to come out of his cage of cautiousness. It's almost as though the lines written for Huston's character were supposed to be more entertaining than Costner's.The problem with these two characters is that the connection between them just didn't feel or look like it was there. That and the fact that the film focused more on these two people more than the plot. The main plot here was to about Farmer protecting Marron from a psychotic killer whom when, on screen, seemed like he had some serious issues. Turns out though, this creep is hardly ever focused on at all. And it's because of this that the tension in this ""romantic thriller"" is lost. Nothing gets tense at all until the finale.The music, which was for the majority of the time provided by Huston, nonetheless has energy but all this does is support the fact that Huston is better at singing. Of course her acting is good but her voice is the top gun that she has. The rest of the score was produced by Alan Silvestri and once again, just like Unlawful Entry (1992), was a let down by the fact that there was not enough music to keep the scenes tight. But then again, who could blame him; how could you produce a score for a thriller film that rarely focuses on the thriller aspect of it?Huston isn't bad at acting here but all this does is prove that she should stick to singing. Not to mention, the lack of balance in romance and thriller makes this film hard to enjoy.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A beautiful classical 90s movie,"After having it watched more than 20 times over two decades, I have to admit that the bodyguard is an all-time classic of the 90s that it features a beautiful and talented Whitney Houston with a great voice and a cool Kevin Costner. Before I wrote this review, I actually watched ""I wanna dance with somebody"", the biopic of Whitney Houston on Netfl., which I stopped in the middle because I had the urge to watch ""The bodyguard"" - this movie. That is basically all I can say. The story might sound shallow but if you think about it more, I just really like it . The bodyguard is a classic movie of the 90s .",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A successful and  bad movie!,"Why was the ""Bodyguard"" so successful at the box office? I know the reasons. Does it mean that it's a good movie? That all depends on who you ask. The Bodyguard is a story that only appeals to one's emotions and never intellect or depth. This movie has a very weak script. The plot is just elongated with the spirit of your typical love story formula. And it touches on all the essential romantic buttons to have girls flocking to the theater. No it will never be heralded as a masterpiece and it even lacks the depth of movies like, ""Love Story"" and ""The way we were"". First off, the pairing of Houston and Costner was unique and somehow drew you in. Houston plays herself pretty much; the spoiled, talented and exceptionally beautiful pop star. Costner plays the dry, uptight and boorish professional bodyguard. They are both opposites, but that is what makes the love story intriguing. Costner has been bashed for his boringness, dullness and lack of charisma. He never really qualified as a leading man in my opinion. But here it somehow works, because Houston's beauty was more revealing as a foil to his bland as goat milk persona. And Whitney Houston was at the height of her career and beauty in 1992, and Costner was at his prime as well. Intellectuals and film critics are more likely to be annoyed by this sappy and overblown love tale. But there are those that just can't help but be immersed in the romance intrigue of it. This is your rare and typical successful bad movie that ranks up there in the same phenomenon as ""Rambo"", ""Terminator 2"", etc. Brainless films that just appeal to our senses and emotions.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Many flaws but worth it for Whitney,"This movie has a very weak script and a serious problem with the tone: it doesn't transit well between romance, thriller and drama, but it tries hard to be all that. Also, the male lead is just shallow (?) or simply lacking charisma. Impossible to see why the sisters would fall for him tbh.Still, it has iconic Whitney songs and even though it's her big screen debut, her acting is solid. Rachel was the only character I could care about in the whole movie. She shined in the role and was funny, charming and multi-dimensional.Overall, ""The Bodyguard"" is too long, too boring and too flawed, but one could still watch it at least once to appreciate Whitney!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Corn and clichés courtesy screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan (who must have been embarrassed until the checks came in),"Music superstar is threatened by a twisted fan and so hires a stolid bodyguard to protect her--and quickly falls in love with him. Nonsensical rubbish served as the debut acting vehicle for real-life music diva Whitney Houston, who does passable work off the stage. Kevin Costner, on the other hand, is enervated beyond belief; his brand of low-keyed machismo isn't in tune with the general air of camp inherent in this tacky scenario--he doesn't seem to be in on the joke and comes off seeming tired and indifferent. This got by with audiences via Houston's musical numbers; otherwise it is second-string stuff, with a script that makes very little sense, tossing ideas at the screen with no point or purpose. Disappointing throughout. ** from ****",4.0,Anonymous,Music

And, if you don't even like her music, you haven't got a chance at making it through this movie.Whitney's blatty, expressionless voice aside, this isn't a good movie. The love story of an extremely popular singer (gee, I wonder who plays her) and the man who is her bodyguard falls extremely flat. It's boring, there's no chemistry, and there's no sense of danger to even necessitate a bodyguard.So, even though Kevin Costner's a cutie, this is one to skip unless you really, really love Whitney Houston songs.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

It's Lawrence Kasdan's water-tight screenplay that keeps you glued, and Jackson's direction keep the proceedings alive. Alan Silvestri's music score, is another brownie point.Now coming to the acting department, Whitney Houston sinks her teeth into the character and brings it out like flying colors.

Not as bad as the voters think.,"You know, I was looking at IMDb's database on romance and was pretty stricken to see that not only 'Vertigo' was rated a romance(!), but five of the top twenty were written around and before fifty decades ago. Ghost? Nope! Dirty Dancing? Ha! Try 5.3. Titanic? 9100 votes gave it a 1. Ever After? Female votes have scraped it up to a 7! Wedding Singer, Pretty Woman, GREASE of all movies. Modern romance has been beaten to a pulp, but even though the same conventions of romance movies exist in The Bodyguard, I'm not one of those people who hated it.After missing out on Reagan's assassination attempt, bodyguard Frank Farmer is now working for-hire. When a singer hires him after she gets death threats, conflicts begin but feelings follow.The Bodyguard plays out your basic romance and resists the urge to jerk any tears. I don't think the actors could pull it off though. There's a point in the movie, when they realize their romance, when their reactions don't make any sense, but afterward everything about the movie plays out like it should and it's well made! Although I believe people are rating the movie on what has happened to Whitney Houston in recent years, they should judge it for the performances themselves and that means it's not bad.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Body and Guard become soul mates,"I too have seen this movie at the theater a long time ago, and the memory of it was on the positive side as I've always appreciate K Kostner's work and don't mind W Houston voice although I would not go as far as declaring myself one of her fans. Yet her rendition of the song is so powerful, it has to be taken noticed of! So today when it was screened on our TV screen I decided to have another go at it and certainly do feel it was a worthwhile decision! I enriched my feelings about this film, beside my own, reading very interesting entries in IMDb. I understand now why Kevin Kostner reminded me so much of Steve Mc Queen. I won't repeat what others have already very well said and what is also fairly well documented in that regard. I am a little surprised too by the low average rating of what I think is a very entertaining movie and do share the thought that someone expressed already here; something like: There are too many snobs ""would be critiques"" who look at this kind of work as it it was a piece of art fated to go in a dusty museum shelf and studied under a microscope for every possible imperfection, instead of its entertainment value. I consider myself having been well entertained and I guess I should give it a 10 just to rectify the balance, but who's counting! I did not feel W Houston acting was that bad either and what she delivered, to me, was fairly appropriate. A successful, talented singer who enjoyed the ride and wanted to make the best of it.

"The soundtrack is outdated, but the movie's still good","I saw this movie when it was first released and didn't really care for it. Well, basically I was still in grade school and didn't care for anything that wasn't loaded with action or comedy.  I gave this movie another try when it came on Cinemax and recorded it on tape.  It's a very impressive film that's both suspenseful and romantic, without being over-the-top.  The only thing that really bugged me was the soundtrack.  My cousins upstairs bought the soundtrack and would listen to it constantly, so I'm pretty much tired of hearing every single one of those songs.Kevin Costner gives an engaging, charismatic performance.  Whitney Houston is not a terrific actress, but she can pull of a dramatic line without making me burst into laughter.  So I gotta give her a little bit of credit, being that this was her first performance.  I've seen much worse.  And it's nice to see Whitney looking very pretty, as opposed to now where she's destroying herself with drugs.  And though the relationship was between a white man and a black woman, the film didn't get preachy about it.I just think Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote the script) should've just made Whitney's character a singer, since we never see her act in this film.  We never see clips of her films.  All we see her do is sing.  So why not make her a singer and have the climax at the Grammy Awards?  Nevertheless, I really enjoyed the film.  It works well as both a love story and a thriller. And unlike most romantic films, the two characters don't constantly jump into bed together and the sex is left to the imagination.  We actually feel some real chemistry, through dialogue and character development.My score:  7 (out of 10)",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Some drama, intrigue, crime, music and romance","""The Bodyguard"" has some drama, a little intrigue, crime, music and romance. That's about the best that can be said for this film. It has just enough of each to hold one's interest to the end. And, the ending makes watching this film worthwhile. It's the best part of the movie.Everyone knows, or should know, the plot. A former CIA agent is hired to protect a hot female singer. And, he falls for her and she for him. Whitney Houston is good as Rachel Marron, the big name singer. Kevin Costner is mostly wooden as Frank Farmer. I get it, as I think most movie buffs do, that a real bodyguard doing a serious job is not going to be a friendly, funny Joe with the people around him. Mike Starr's Tony, as such a glad-hand character, exaggerates that notion with his distractions for lunch, watching and enjoying the show, etc.But Costner's Farmer goes to the extreme in the opposite direction. He's almost sullen in his constant alertness. He's overly calm and slow to the point that he doesn't shoe much life or intelligence behind his apparent thinking and critical watching. The plot dances around, as do the scenes, with sharp breaks, so it doesn't have a feel of fluid continuity.One very good scene in this movie makes it worth watching. It takes place at night in the kitchen of Rachel Marron's mansion. Frank Farmer is sitting alone at a counter drinking his orange juice. He has just gotten Rachel home safely after a near riot broke out with her fans at an event. When they sped away, they left Tony behind.Now Tony kicks the door in. He's mad and goes after Frank - four times. Each time, Frank uses his martial arts and fisticuffs and lays big Tony out. Tony's face is bloody and he's about to try a fifth time with a big butcher knife. Frank picks up another knife and hurls it so that it sinks into the woodwork beside Tony's head. Tony backs down. Not a word has been spoken to this time. Frank turns to leave and says, ""I don't wanna talk about this again.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Jarring Jump Cuts,"Strange as it seems the director of THE BODYGUARD is a former BBC director called Mick Jackson who made the nuclear holocaust docudrama THREADS . I say it`s strange because there surely can`t be a bigger contrast between a director`s two pieces of work . On one hand you have a very cheaply made kitchen sink drama dealing with a subject you pray will never happen , or if it does you`d hope to be vapourised in the opening exchange while on the other you have Hollywood blockbuster melodrama material (Though the plot has also popped up in several latter TVMs ) featuring love and songs and the occasional shoot outThere is a stylistic connection between these two Jackson directed contrasts and that`s the jump edits . I checked the credits on both THREADS and THE BODYGUARD and was very surprised to find that different editors were used in both because the editing is very similar in its jarring quality of having a scene where noise is overwhelming followed by a scene of total silence which lasts several seconds . I guess it`s the fault of the directorAs for the rest of this movie I didn`t think much of it . For a romance to work on screen you need a lot of chemistry between the two romantically linked protagonists and THE BODYGUARD features the charisma free Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston , and I was certain that the film would have worked far better if the movie was produced in the mid 1970s with Steve McQueen and Diana Ross in the main roles . It wouldn`t have saved the film from its TVM type plot but at least we`d see some convincing characterisation and actingFinally the title song is one you will either love or hate .

It is hard to imagine that a movie nerd would watch this old film twice and he did so with even greater interest this time than the first time. And that nerd is writing this review right now.The Bodyguard (1992), what a nostalgic show to watch and what a walk back in time for Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner! The plot itself is average and exaggerated at times but still isn't short of layers. It wouldn't qualify as the most suspenseful show yet I suppose it's the overall package it presents that sees it stand out. I mean the romance, the music, the scene and the grandiosity. It is indeed a live performance of the late Whitney Houston where a number of her hit songs were played - Run to You, Queen of the Night, I Have Nothing and needless to say the all-time famous I Will Always Love You. She is such a vocal queen whose voice conquers the world. That powerful and resonant voice lingers forever in our hearts, doesn't it?Cast and crew also make good sense. Kevin Costner, what a good looking old bloke! Well he wasn't that old at the time of filming but he is still a handsome classic man in present day. Together the hero and heroine make a such perfect combination and it is only natural to assume that romance will break out between these two.The ending scene is somewhat sentimental when Houston left Costner. It is always sad to leave someone you have a feeling for, isn't it, although we all know that is life?All in all I really love this old fashioned movie maybe because I'm old fashioned. You can't blame an old schooler for liking an old show, can you? As I have defined Rain Man (1988) as a must-see 80s classic, would it be fair to name The Bodyguard (1992) a must see 90s classic?And I will always love you...

I Have Nothing,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**What was supposed to be action packed Friday night ended up as a romantic flick - so tonight's movie review is The Bodyguard (1992) which stars the likeable Kevin Costner who plays Frank Farmer a bodyguard who is assigned to protect pop singer Rachel playing by Whitney Houston. We have here is a few suspense moments and a melodrama of the romantic link between these two characters. The movie does have an interesting twist at the end and the overall acting isn't bad in the movie. What the movie lacks is cliched dialogue and the chemistry between the two leads feels forced and cartonny - like are you serious with the samurai sword scene?? If you are a 80's and 90's pop fan, then you will love the soundtrack in this movie. The movie could have gone more in the stalker suspense but instead gave away the reveal plus there was an interesting aspect of the expectations of fans with their idols. We could of also seen Frank's obsession with security and changed the script around his reasons on becoming a security guard however once again we were given a bland backstory. I did enjoy Costner's performance as a cold and detached guy however hides his emotions under the surface around guilt of a prior presidential assassination attempt. Again the soundtrack really works in this film especially with Houston's beautiful voice which can be demonstrated with her belting ""I Will Always Love You"" and ""I Have Nothing"", awesome ballads but again the overall story is just bland and too slow-moving - 6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
An awful film ....,"An awful film, which does NOT work.  The recreation of the Oscars is awful (heck, even ""Naked Gun 33 1/3"" did a better job!).  Whitney Houston cannot act, and Costner is in robot mode.  The soundtrack is bad as well, and too much of the film is concentrated on it... The plot is pure old Hollywood garbage that I thought had stopped being made a couple of decades before... A complete nightmare, and hard to sit through...

Good,"If you look at this movie from a professional point of view, one would say it is mediocre at best, but from a nostalgic point of view it is good, everything is period correct and a relaxing atmosphere while a love story unfolds.The script was originally written in the 70's was rejected for 2 decades was originally intended for McQueen, and yes it is not the best script, but it was smartly modified to offer us atmosphere instead of action. The script gets 5⭐Many people might not know this but this was Whitney Houston's first movie, and the result is great and in part credit need to go to Kevin Costner(Frank Farmer) for helping her with the acting and for postponing the movie one year so Whitney Houston will accept the role, he sad he will not play the part if Whitney Houston will not accept, and when asked why he sad a movie about a star singer nobody sings like Whitney Houston in Hollywood..

A Bodyguard in a Difficult Situation,"Having recently resigned from the Secret Service, a bodyguard by the name of ""Frank Farmer"" (Kevin Costner) is offered a high-paying job protecting a musician by the name of ""Rachel Marron"" (Whitney Houston) who has recently received several serious threats upon her life. Although initially hesitant, he eventually decides to check out the situation as a matter of courtesy and is thoroughly appalled by what he finds as not only is her security greatly inadequate for the task at hand but her carefree lifestyle makes things even more difficult. Yet, despite the fact that it goes against his better instincts, he reluctantly accepts the security position-and it's then that he discovers just how precarious the situation really is. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this was a decent film with an interesting plot and a nice twist at the end. Along with that, I would also like to mention that this film received several awards and nominations with most of them pertaining to the musical abilities of Whitney Houston rather than her acting abilities or that of Kevin Costner. To that point, although both of them were panned by the Razzie Awards, I personally didn't think that either of them deserved this criticism. That being said, while this certainly wasn't a great film by any means, it was still entertaining for the most part and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Worse the waterworld,"Yeah, I got roped into seeing this cheesy 90s chick flick cause of the girl I was dating at the time. Hollywood couldn't find away to make truly good movies in the 1990's, and many times through together movies like this, roped some big time actors into doing in in order to get people in the theaters, only to see the flicks quickly disappear when the audiences quit showing up. What we have in a contrived, rather implausible little story that never gets the viewer interested, and can't even get the viewer to care about their respective fates. Whitney Houston, providing scant actor ability, has zero chemistry with Kevin Costner, who should be more happy to include Waterwold, or the 1970's drive in flick Sizzle Beach USA on his resume then this fluff. Shoddy direction, implausible ending, and more or less, a script that seems like it was written on the fly. I remember being so bored out of my mind, that I was actually reading the box my popcorn came in. Even the girl was completely bored. We left as the movie was ending, as did the friends we came with. We all agreed that we could have spent the money better by tossing it in the toilet, and flushing. One of the worst films from the decade of sub standard music, and a down period for Hollywood flicks. Absolutely zero grade, and only should be watched if you don't get the lifetime network on your local cable system. Useless fluff.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

A Less That Mediocre Thriller,"Usually one can count on high production values to make even a bad Kevin Costner movie interesting.  Alas, despite having high production values, ""The Bodyguard"" was a bore.  Let me count the ways:  slow plot, preposterous story, and bad acting -- particularly by Whitney Houston.  In fairness, I should say that the completely unbelievable conduct of Houston's character does serve to make her performance seem even worse than it was.  Costner does not a bad faux Steve McQueen as the existential and dour (depressed?) athletic pretty boy, Frank Farmer.  But his performance does not save the film.  Indeed, I doubt that De Niro could have saved it.  Spend two hours and ten minutes elsewhere; not recommended; 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Silly, but entertaining","Watching it well over 25 years after it was made, this is a really slow moving film, by modern standards. The plot is paper thin and Whitney Houston's performance is variable, but it's still somehow surprisingly watchable. Very silly, but definitely entertaining.",,Anonymous,Music
An easy target for critics.,"The willingness to sacrifice oneself to save the life of another person is inherently romantic, which is the idea at the centre of The Bodyguard, a two-worlds-collide drama-thriller starring two of the hottest tickets of 1992's film and music scene, Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston.While it might make an easy target for critics, The Bodyguard is a film that connected well with audiences upon release. Much of that comes down to the perfect storm of three elements; Lawrence Kasdan's script (it rattled around Hollywood for years), Kevin Costner's leading man status and Whitney Houston's incredible vocal performance - particularly the mighty power-ballad 'I Will Always Love You', which ate up the pop charts. These three elements are competently stitched together by British director, Mick Jackson, who captures enough chemistry between the leads to paper over the gaping cracks that emerge.Costner carries his brand of quiet man chivalry, which gives Houston room to find her character in their scenes, which are always engaging. You can only guess, but it doesn't seem a stretch to imagine the similarities between her character and what her life was like. The writing tries to examine what it's like to live in the cocoon of celebrity, but the direction of the narrative becomes increasingly about the thriller aspect of the story, leaving some, but not much to chew over. When the finale comes, it's a messy combination of awkward positioning and bad logistics, culminating in a predictable, mostly underwhelming conclusion. That said, given the right mood, The Bodyguard is entertaining mainstream cinema, held aloft by its star credentials.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Zero-Chemistry Romance ruined this movie,"Started off as interesting and went like that up until the zero-chemistry romance (which only contributed to the proliferation of trashy melodrama) blossomed. The movie lost me completely from there and I don't think it recovered except for maybe the Oscar ceremony part. Liked that earlier Mayan club scene and had hope. Then the romance came in and I simply wanted the movie to get over. I started to check the clock continuously. Anyway, watched for Kevin Costner and guess he didn't disappoint. Well, he deserved more than this movie. Costner's Frank Farmer deserved a movie like To Live and Die in L. A., playing a secret service agent seeking revenge or playing a raging bodyguard in a movie like Man on Fire. Also, you don't even have to closely examine the sisters' photograph hung on the wall, seen earlier in the film, you just need to take a casual look and you know the whole movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"It started off pretty good actually, but then the plot slid down after the first half the film","Ah, The Bodyguard, I was 7 years old when this film was released, and the funny thing about it is that I actually remember all the hoop-la there was about it. Well, mostly what I remember is how much my mom and sister complained about it's hit song by Whitney Housten, I will Always Love You, was way too over played on the radio. Hence the reason why I never saw this film, well, I passed it at Hollywood Video and I figured I would see what it was about and if it really should of got all the praise that it did in 1992. Now when the film started out, I was actually surprised, I found myself enjoying it, but then it got into a mystery thriller that wasn't really needed in my opinion, that wasn't explained very well or wasn't even enjoyable.Frank is one of the best bodyguards around, he has protected some very important people in his life, but he refuses celebrities. But when a superstar, Rachel Marron, is getting death threats, her assistant begs him to join the team. One problem, Rachel is a bit of a diva, big surprise. Her and Frank keep clashing but can no longer hide their deep sexual tension for each other and give in. But Frank must remember that he is here to protect Rachel and save her life and protect her family as well.The Bodyguard had it's moments and a very promising plot that could have worked, but unfortunately what happened with the character, Rachel's sister, just got too confusing among with the friend of Frank. You'll see what I mean when you see the film. I'm not sure if I would recommend this film or not, but I do think it's worth a look. But I agree with my mom and sister, I did fast forward through the singing moments, no offense, Whitney.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Ultimate Guilty Pleasure,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Bodyguard"" (1992) is a wonderful drama / thriller / romance. It is not cheese romance by a mile, you can point your finger at any direction these days and find much, much more cheese movies then this one.Acting was solid by all involved, but especially of course by our leads Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston - we do care for these two sharply drawn characters. Directing was solid as well as involving script. And the outcome with the killer wasn't the for me the ultimate ending of the story - it surely was that plane scene.Overall, two great charismatic leads, involving writing and amazing (one of the kind) music makes this a very cool movie. It has some romance, it has some thrills and its all done in a very good way - add the unforgettable soundtrack and ""The Bodyguard"" becomes the ultimate guilty pleasure.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

I had forgotten some of the major parts such as who the stalker was, so it was like watching it new all over. Whitney looks simply stunning and I was reminded again of her amazing voice. It gave me goosebumps, especially when she sang "" I want to run to you"" - one of my favorite parts in the movie. It was a bit nostalgic to see, considering how she passed. She was gone too soon. Kevin Costner was casted perfectly and is a beautiful young man. Their chemistry was undeniable. For what is worth, it is an underrated movie in my opinion, a love/thriller story you can enjoy on a relaxing Friday night.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Liked their kiss at the end...,"..but unfortunately it took over two hours to get to it.  Its a great moment and is very old-movie in its execution, but the movie preceeding it is mostly awful.  Don't read this if you want your 'experience' ruined..Kevin & Whitney have some moments of genuine chemistry. He is hired by her staff because she is receiving threatening letters and intruders (she's a double threat - big in movies and in music - just like Neely O'Hara!) but she is mostly being kept in the dark about her stalker because she might get 'upset.'  Her staff is comprised of shady characters, all designed to make you think any of them could be guilty of stalking.She wants her freedom but he's very professional - he worked for the CIA and still regrets not being on duty the day Ronald Reagan was shot - so They Clash, so that they can Overcome That and Become Romantic.  Inexplicably, his professional responsibility is put aside and he decides to accept her invitation to go on a date.  Being that she is a huge star, its unreasonable that she is never recognized, but I digress..He realizes that they should not have gotten close the Following Morning, and she is angry that they won't be waking up together anymore.  When the threats take a more serious tone, they agree to get serious about her being guarded.You don't want to know the rest.  See the fey dye-blonde guy who is obsessed with Whitney.  See the co-worker of Costner trying to get some of what Kevin was given.  See the resentful sister/secretary seething at every turn.The best is the Oscars ceremony at the end, where she wins, but is almost gunned down..maybe the killer was pulling for someone else in her category!The script is a mess.  Costner is wooden for the most part.  Houston is very good but has a lapse in some heavily dramatic scenes.  I don't think playing a spoiled diva is a huge stretch for her but its good to know your own limitations, too.As mentioned, the finale is very well done, very emotional and cathartic. Its the only spontaneous, real moment in a mostly artifical movie.  5/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
to john mayer's comment below,"You treat this movie as dumb, but yet your example proves that you have no imagination or intellect at all. When Kevin's character jumped to save the kid, it's not because he predicted that the boat will explode, but it's because if the kid goes very far with the boat then Kevin will not be able to reach him. The kid obviously doesn't know how to ride the boat, so if he goes too far, what is Kevin's character supposed to swim for 15 minutes in freezing water to get to him? No. So he didn't take a chance and jumped to prevent the kid of getting away and going too far. You know it's funny to see people bash movies and treat plots as dumb, yet they just embarrass themselves!",,Anonymous,Music
Movie above average - Whitney's voice one in a billion!,When you think of all the poor attempts by music stars that makes the transition into movies I think Whitney do a decent job with this movie. She couldn't really fail either as she has to play a big star. The movie itself is okay. The highlight is of course the soundtrack which is also the best selling soundtrack of all time and one of the best selling albums of all time. Whitney's voice was a treasure and she could sing it all which is showcased a few times in this movie. So all in all a watchable movie and unfortunately also a reminder that one of the greatest singers is gone.,6.0,Anonymous,Music

This was supposed to be a romantic movie, but there were barely any romantic gestures and to end the movie on such a unromantic-banal conclusion ?! I was very disappointed.

To co-exist they and survive they develop a special bond. This film looks at the relationship and all the drama along the way, as well as following the murder plot to take Rachel down and how Costner plans to thwart it.I have to admit, I wasn't really a fan, maybe it's because it's a blatant chick flick - or maybe it's the soundtrack song by Whitney Houston that makes me shudder every time I hear it - putting me off the film. The plot isn't that complex and there isn't really any sexual tension or chemistry between the two stars - which is a surprise as the whole premises is the whole 'will they/wont they', 'do they/ don't they' between the two potential lovers. They aren't that engaging as characters and I didn't care less what happened to them throughout the film. Where Houston and Costner are authentic is in their individual persona delivery - Costner is supposed to be fairly dull and bland - which I believe; and Houston is supposed to be a bratty diva - which I could also have believed. This felt more like a vehicle for Houston's vocal talent than a real attempt at a film.Overrated and not my cup of tea.

Hasn't stood the test of time well,"This blockbuster capitalized on the peak of Whitney Houston's career as a pop phenomenon and Kevin Costner's sudden rise to box-office number one in the wake of Dances With Wolves. The film was a huge success back in 1992, but hasn't stood the test of time well. It's intended to be a romantic thriller of sorts, but all the thriller elements are oversimplified, most of the characters are one-dimensional, and the so-called romance is out of the blue and not accounted for, making it feel uneasy at best and outright cringeworthy at worst. There's no indication as to why these two people would fall for each other, other than the fact that they have the likenesses of Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, who were seen as good-looking by contemporary audiences. It's a remarkably lazy directing job by Mick Jackson from one of a series of poor Lawrence Kasdan scripts of the 1990s - marking Kasdan's steep decline from his streak of brilliant films in the preceding decade. That is Gary Kemp of New Romantic pop sensation Spandau Ballet playing Houston's manager - a performance which could have been interesting with a more refined script.

"The Bodyguard, artists and public figures, respecting God Granted Dignity.","Blessed Happy Mother's Day!~
Thank the Lord for artists who truly put an effort for sharing music, and films such as ""I Will Always Love You."" These artists, down to earth did share togetherness for this work of art, from the deepest heart. One of my favorite scenes, unfortunately Fletcher was in danger in the lake, Frank Farmer, played by Kevin Costner without any hesitation at all ran as fast as he could to rescue Fletcher. The true concern in real life they show for each other and Children which GOD sends into the world for our love and care is one of the main true human family justly due diligence with every fiber of being;- is what endears me to artists.Personally, I always associate ""Jesus Loves The Little Children,"" Red & Yellow & Black & White, as we are concerned to help one another with content of character;-
with, ""Yes, Jesus Loves Me, For The Bible Tells me so.""
~
This iconic film, helped alleviate the stereotype of artists as ""Rachel,"" in some scenes showing the production of concerts and such could lead some to think of them as 'bigger than life,'
as opposed to down to earth regular folk, just like the rest of us. The following relates to one of the serious issues concerning the fostering by some in the media of painting artists to be on some huge pedestal, instead of the pursuit of excellence in respecting the beautiful work they do, the GOD granted dignity of the artists and public figures,
since each of us as the song, ""The Greatest Love Of All,"" tells us, it's the children's laughter that reminds us of how we used to be, child-like simplicity of down to earth folk,
with respecting one another's human dignity, and personal space.~
(*note: besides the incident that follows, here is link to a short video of David Brenner
and a child actor at the time Drew Barrymore, who was bum rushed, deeply frightened,
chased 28 blocks, the chaperone took her into an establishment, and the crowd was still there when they went to leave. We each know impartially, no one should have their safety or personal space treated with such disrespect for another human being. In the rare occasions of an artist or public figure addressing me on the job or otherwise, it was cool and all,
but thank GOD for the blessing of just seeing these folk as just human beings persons who happen to be by their GOD given gifts and talents in the public eye. Link omitted.)
In my line of work, now retired, I had a State Police Security Officer Re-Certification Act, license, which required mandatory testing on subjects such as homeland security, public safety crowd dynamics (i.e. When exiting a venue, without some safeguards, with a bottleneck stairway, one misstep could easily cause trampling by guests on top of guests); keeping an diligent eye open for any suspicious packages or activity. Some venues have, away from the public view trained first responders who are prepared for any coyote terrorist or rioting civil unrest event.~
The latter happened at one venue, with such sad violence that the whole stadium was on lockdown until the state police and security, and other responders could aid a peaceful climate. Sadly arrests were made on those responsible for extreme violence. Some venues we have to lock arms to form a line of defense so an on rushing crowd cannot get onto the stage with performers and equipment still on stage. In one even a previous occurrence a guest former obstinate regarding, along with other the fire marshal's public safety rules by jamming a public aisle to take pictures,;- got in my face threatening to hit me. So, when we locked arms, the usual danger of being punched in the face, vulnerable with arms locked was higher.~
Thank GOD the other Security Officers, were able to aid the crowds to disperse after the being severely boxed in by a huge crowd pressing in all around us. It truly is a real concern at these type of events, just simple true.Have a blessed peaceful evening!",1.0,Anonymous,Music

Intended for the simple minded...leave your brain at the door,"(1992) The Bodyguard
THRILLERThe theme is centered on one or two 'unknown' professional stalkers verses one of the best secret service agents in the business who happens to be the character Kevin Kostner is playing. Kostner as Frank Farmer who in principle and while on one of his off days gets confronted by a former friend asking him to be the bodyguard for a top actress and best selling musician in the business after receiving some threatening letters. ""You're the best in business!"" he remarks for he initially doesn't want to do it but will do it for $3,000 dollars a week which is I guess more than the average salary a secret service agent makes. And upon seeing Rachael Marron (Whitney Huston) she appears to give her fans as well as her audience the benefit of the doubt despite what has already happened, and to me this is unrealistic- it's like ""my fans love me too much they would never hurt me"" that kind of thing. At the early stages she's totally ignoring Frank's orders, but instead of being fearful for her life which is what any normal person would've acted- she does exactly the opposite, once suspected that it may be one of the people working around her that's been doing all the stalking. This stalker even succeeds in masterbating on her bed and theirs no asking about DNA samples or anything etc... making viewers think that it must be someone amongst the people who're working alongside her. Anyways, the most absurd thing was the scene when someone finally gets shot and killed, a person whose very close to Rachael, and the police are never even notified or even involved with this senseless killing, including the fact that it happened on snowy weather and no snow tracks are even acknowledged nor considered. This person who was killed then gets buried and it's like her murder can only be solved conveniently by the top security service agent Frank Farmer, and of course the police are still absent with no questioning about who or who is capable of doing this or anything else for that matter- not even the FBI is involved. She still decides to go to the Academy Awards despite the killer still being out there already submitting many threatening letters and phone calls etc... Yes, in order enjoy this film one must ignore common sense, logic, and the customs of proper police procedures whenever a murder occurs for this film is only intended for the simple minded.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
The Bodyguard,"The definition of a solid film.Far from perfect but enough to keep you intrigued and immersed. The film is very simple, very straightforward but has little details here and there that make it an overall unique experience. The storyline is a bit bland, a lot of repetition, however the characters make up for it, they all play a vital role and add depth to the story. The cinematography is definitely the highlight of this film, it's unique, simple but yet so capturing and creative. The movie symbolises how fame comes with problems, consequences and risks, someone is always watching, envying your success to the point where a bodyguard is an essential component of life. Overall a great film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Mesmerised by that man!,"Here I am in 2024, watching this film again for the umpteenth time and - yet again - I'm completely in love with Kevin Costner in all his gorgeousness. He is fantastic in this and plays the conflicted bodyguard so well - dealing with his feelings for his superstar client while trying to protect her from a deranged fan.I've never really felt the chemistry between him and Whitney in this, yet their real-life friendship made during the making of this film was obviously genuine and lasting - hence the beautiful eulogy Kevin gave at Whitney's funeral.Whitney performs the beautiful songs so well and the final airport runway scene still moves me to tears every time.It's a long film but has so many great scenes that it's one I come back to time and again. Kevin Costner has aged like fine wine but Frank Farmer will always hold a special place in my heart!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Whitney Houston shines in this role,"For a non-actress, Whitney Houston shines in this role. I just don't see the reason for all the criticism found in the comment section. Maybe I'm just blinded by her beauty. I haven't seen her other films. Her voice is, of course, pure gold. Costner, like many leading men, plays much the same character in many of his films, and does it well. The supporting cast was excellent, the direction non-imposing, and the photography good. The only real criticism I have is with the script, Rachel falling for Farmer so fast. I gave it an 8.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
That's not how you kiss!,"Anyone else notice that their kissing appeared to be hot and dramatic but if you look closely, neither of them once opened their mouths!

This was such an all-around good movie with pretty good acting and great singing. It's been pretty clear that Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston really did have a connection and as the years have gone on it's obvious that he really cared about her. This really is a nice love story.

"Sweet and Electrifying, Much Better Than Its Perceived To Be","Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) a clean cut, methodical ex-secret service guard whose drink of choice is orange juice is hired to protect Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston) a pop star diva whose unaware of her stalker situation.

Then as her situation gets more precarious an unexpected enemy reveals itself whose envious eye has long been on Rachel.

At times lurid but enthralling,"I was hesitant to watch this film. A friend had rented it and ask me to watch it.The acting here is good by most everyone. It is also interesting how you get to see 'behind the scenes' of a person who is a mega-star. You get a little peek into the private life that you might not see otherwise.At times the film feels lurid and soapy. But other times it is fascinating. Kevin Costner did a very good job here and looks so handsome. He really gave his character life here. Whitney Houston also does a good job and it wasn't any stretch at all to believe her portrayal of the big star singer.Probably a film that women would enjoy more than men but despite the flaws, I did enjoy it. I don't think it ever became too sappy. I think the reason for the attacks on the star are probably the weakest point of the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
ok at best,"This was one of those movies that was trashed by the critics but loved by the audience. I rank it somewhere between. It did feature good performances by Kevin Costner as the obsessed bodyguard and Whitney Houston as the pop superstar he had been hired to protect, but it also got a bit prodding at times. Still, I thought it was a decent movie. The chemistry between the cast members was good.** 1/2 out of ****",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Well-cast Whitney,"Costner continues his unbeatable early 90s run with a tarted up daytime movie starring Whitney Houston. Kev plays Frank Farmer, bodyguard to superstar Rachel Marron, who is receiving stalker notes, death threats and upsetting fluids in her bedroom. A well-cast Houston has never sounded or looked better, and she tries admirably in the acting department. Costner deliberately plays the straight man, almost to the point of boring, but his sheer movie star charisma carries the film. Highly entertaining 7/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

The characters rang true.The jealousy of Rachel's sister rang true and added another dimension to the movie.And then there is the music. Incredible. Made the best use of Whitney's voice.

Love and Life mixed into an obsessive bodyguard's way of working causes chaos,"I am a personal fan of Whitney Houston, and I believe she didn't cause any dishonor to her flawless reputation. Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston truly portrayed the couple of the year. What I like about this movie is its simplicity, honesty and magnificent music. I don't know why the Razzie Awards attacked the film so much, it's a truly classical love story with great performance, music and directing. Although the roll was originally for Diana Ross, I can't imagine Rachel Maron being interpreted as any other woman but Whitney Houston. If you haven't watched it, I honestly think you should, because this is a mist-see cinematographic treasure that is rare to find in today's modern chaos. It has no special effects or any computer tricks, it is as simple as it gets, and I believe that that's the secret to a great film. The outline of this movie is Frank Farmer (Costner) being an extremely serious bodyguard protecting Rachel Marron (Houston), an extremely immature person. The different points of view of both affect Farmer's way of working, causing chaos during the process of Rachel's protection.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"""Reagan got shot! - Not on my shift!""","This movie has a dark atmosphere, which is something I love about it. It's not like most love stories. This movie is so different from a typical romance film. It doesn't just focus on the romance, it focuses on Rachel's career, the stalker, Frank's resistance to grow close to his client. That's what makes this movie so special. ""The Bodyguard"" is one of Whitney's best performances. You can tell she is in her prime with her career. She and Kevin Costner are outstanding in their performances. I love the performances throughout the movie most..Kevin Costner portrays Frank Farmer, a no-nonsense bodyguard hired by the singers associates that struggles with Marron's devotion to her career and her own deluded view that she is invincible. Houston plays a character that parallels her real life, an accomplished actress and singer who is being stalked by an obsessive fan. Bodyguard was to be the big vehicle to launch Houston into a mega film career. Although Houston's performance is commendable for her first film effort, her shining moments in the film are when she showcases the soundtrack, which is incredible. Costner is strong in his stern, powerful role. If you like a who-done-it film, amazing music, watching Kevin Costner, as well as just the right mix of romance and damsel in distress, you've got to get The Bodyguard (and get the soundtrack while you're at it).Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Razzies,"I think six Razzie nominations is a bit hard, it wasn't that bad of a movie. I've seen a lot worse. If anything the only Razzie worthy performance was by DeVaughn Nixon (Rachel's son). I know he's a little kid, but his acting was bad.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I jjst love this movie!,"I was a kid when this movie was in theaters an was swept of my feet ofcourse! Adored Whitney and was in love with Kevin Costner. After many years as adult I watched it again and again was enchanted with the story, music and characters! Even though story is predictable and kind of a stereotype of romantic movies, there is something so fresh and delicate about it. Easy to watch but has some rush thriller moments. Characters are developed in just right amount, not too deep but enough to get the point and to be amused by their story. I just love this movie and for me it stands side by side with Pretty woman and Dirty dancing. Modern classic in romantic genre.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic,"I never get tired of watching this movie. I am a die-hard chick-flick fan: fluff all the way, all that meaningless dime-a-dozen stuff. But this is one movie which breaks my mold and I consider a new classic. It's a movie I have to be in the right mood to watch, but it's one that I never get tired of. It's a great drama--romance, mystery, with a spice of humor thrown in here and there, enough to make you smile and lighten up the mood but not enough to make it seem tawdry. Kevin Costner's performance makes the whole thing for me: he spins a great character without becoming bland or stony. Whitney Houston is fairly good as an actress, smiling and charming in her pleasanter days, and obviously her songs are very good--I hope no one will contest that she has an excellent voice (or did; does she even sing anymore?). Watching the little boy, Fletcher (sorry I don't know his real name), was also a treat. He's the precocious-almost-to-a-fault genre, but it was fun seeing all his antics and especially hearing the things he said.I think this movie has gotten a much lower rating than it deserves. The plot is not extremely involved, but I was surprised by the ending. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the most emblematic romances of the 90's ...,"1992 left two romantic moments for cinematic posterity, both musically immortalized: the magic carpet ride in ""Aladdin"" where ""A Whole New World"" opened itself to Jasmine's dazzled eyes, and Kevin Costner protecting Whitney Houston from the riot that just interrupted her concert. While the song is never heard at that moment, we all visualize it with ""I Will Always Love You"" playing in the background. That image of Houston in Costner's arms is one of the most defining of the romantic nineties, Houston's feet never touched the ground but her soul touched our hearts forever and even more after her untimely passing, last year.It's the mark of great movies to be able to capture the soul of a relationship by only using the simplicity of images and music: a film like ""Titanic"" will always be remembered for the flying-over-the-boat moment and ""My Heart Will Go On"", ""Ghost"" for the pottery scene erotically conducted with the ""Unchained Melody"", and ""Dirty Dancing"" when Johnny gives Baby the time of her life after putting her off the corner, and so on and so forth. And whether the film is good or bad becomes almost pointless when it reaches such a classic status. Cinema is not a rational world you know, imagery, lyrics, music have their 'word' to say and sometimes it transcends any attempt of an objective reasoning.My tone is partly defensive because I'm aware of ""The Bodyguard""'s reputation, I know that the film met with mixed to negative critics, that it was panned for its formulaic story, for the wooden performance of Kevin Costner, the eternal Razzie's scapegoat, and even Whitney Houston, didn't escape from criticism. ""The Bodyguard"" would almost need a bodyguard of critic to reply to its harsh disapproval. But I believe a film is also to judge in retrospect, at the light of what it has become and what has generally become of Cinema for the years after. Take all the movies I mentioned, with the exception of ""Titanic"", a few romances ever make it now to the top highest grossing films of the year. We thought the 90's to be 'cynical' but in comparison with the 2010's, it's the 60's.Today, most successful films are action blockbusters / Pixar / Marvel adventures' adaptations or successful franchises, the recipe for success is clearly established, and a film like ""The Bodyguard"" wouldn't have necessarily worked or even been considered to be made. Take the script, written 20 years before the release (for Steve McQueen and Diana Ross as the leads): a former ex-Secret Service Agent is assigned to protect a pop star whose life is threatened by a stalker, the material is simple but it's only through the casting that Mick Jackson elevates it, by confronting two of the then most inevitable faces of show-business. Costner is Frank Farmer and Houston Rachel Marron, but we all know she's playing herself, like Ava Gardner in ""The Barefoot Contessa"", she gets a role tailor-made for her, and a powerful testimony for the person, that she was.Marron is Houston, and vice versa, a diva whose talent and unique voice brought her on the top of the billboards and the kind of spotlight that unveils the darkest side of stardom. As Costner said in his eulogy: ""anyone could have played the leading man, but only Whitney Houston could have played that part""; in one sense, he was right, even a star like Madonna wouldn't have fit the film. She already played in movies, which would have damaged her credibility as a 'vulnerable' star. Houston showed enough strength to convince us as a diva (because she was one) but she was fragile enough to need a strong shoulder to put her head on. But Costner is wrong about himself, he always cherished lone-ranger roles, men who combined both competence and high morality, with a wound in his past, so only him or a younger Clint Eastwood could have made it work.And both Costner and Houston make it work. And the film never treats the interracial romance as if it was relevant to the story, but nevertheless it accentuates the gap between the two characters. He works in secrecy, she's a star, he takes his job in a no-nonsense way, she embraces celebrity with full arms, knowing that it's part of her competence to be available to the crowd of fans. These contradictions create many situations where they have to make the rules, to adapt to each other, but we know these scenes are only meant to make their chemistry grow slowly and surely until the romance finally blooms. The romance is convincing because it starts as respect, understanding, and empathy to the point of when it happens, we don't feel it contrived, but as natural, exhilarating and passionate as the song that defines it.Indeed, ""I Will Always Love You"" is the darlings of Karaoke and the ultimate test in musical reality programs, and that's a credit to Whitney Houston's miraculous talent for having made both the opening and conclusion, such milestones in the world of music. It was Costner who picked the original Dolly Parton's song and suggested Houston should remake it. That fact alone proves that his casting was a blessing. ""The Bodyguard"" is as great as a film can get in terms of impact, and music enhances it to an extraordinarily emotional level, being till now, the all-time best-selling soundtrack.Naturally, ""The Bodyguard"" was nominated for every Razzie Award possible, but like I said for ""Mommie Dearest"", some films stick in our mind, no matter how seemingly bad they are for some pompous critics, and that's the kind of achievement some 'greater' movies fail to achieve. The only difference is that I called ""Mommie Dearest"" a guilty pleasure, while I don't feel so guilty for having enjoyed ""The Bodyguard"".",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining romance/thriller with some tense scenes and a good soundtrack.,"I'm a bit surprised the rating for this movie isn't a bit higher on here. I've read some of the negative reviews and I have to disagree with most of them. This is a pretty entertaining film all around, with a love story for those into that sort of thing but enough elements of a thriller to not put off the males in the audience. Personally, I think they blended the two genres together pretty well here.Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston did fine in their respective roles and the film had a nice pace throughout.I also have to commend this film for some pretty tense scenes that I don't think the other reviews gave enough credit for. The scene at the Oscars was pretty good stuff. The mystery of the stalker kept the momentum going, and the letters and phone calls were genuinely creepy.This may not be a bona fide classic, but it's certainly a very entertaining early '90s romance/thriller with some good songs thrown in as well.I can't imagine what disappointed the others. Maybe they should remove something from their behind area before watching a movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

the cult of celebrity and those who protect others,This film has a romance angle as KEVIN COSTNER falls from a woman he must protect from a bad guy.I am not drawn to celebrity. Not in the least.In fact if it ever came my way i would kiss it off (granted it never will..sort of like me owning the buffalo bills). This film is a fantasy action adventure romance in which Costner plays the nice guy action heavy against all the bad guys in a story about a guy who operates in the world of the cult of personality. Personality and being seen witht he rich and famous are things I have never craved in this film Costner plays a PI/bodyguard who has to keep it in perspective and do his job. The bright lights and spotlight can be distracting to some yet his character is a professional who is not distracted. A interesting concept.,,Anonymous,Music

Great blockbuster,"This movie has grossed over 410 million dollars worldwide at the box office which makes it one of the most successful movies of all-time.  If you haven't watched it, then that reason alone should be a good cause to watch it.Both Whitney Houston & Kevin Costner did a great job.  The movie has a lot of great one liners, it's too funny.  Of course the music & singing are incredible.  Now if they can only release a special edition DVD with some extra features it would be great, the dvd currently available was released in 1997 when DVDs were still debuting.  Anyways, this movie is a good combination of thriller, romance & humor.  If you haven't watched it then check it out!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Romance, thrills, comedy, action, music.  The Bodyguard has it all.","The Bodyguard starring Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston is one of the most successful movies of all-time, grossing over 410 million dollars worldwide. Why?  There are several reasons:First of all, the chemistry between Kevin and Whitney is great.  Whenever they are on screen, you can't take your eyes off them.  They are very talented and very attractive.Second, the music in this movie is incredible.  Whitney's voice soars on ballads like I Have Nothing and I Will Always Love You, and she brings down the house with the rocky Queen of the Night.  No wonder that the soundtrack is the biggest selling soundtrack of all-time (37 million copies sold worldwide).Third, the story is fun and the characters are well developed.  There are so many funny one liners in this movie, I don't know where to start.  There's plenty of romance for the girls and plenty of action/suspense for the guys. The Bodyguard is a classic.  Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Music
"I don't care what the critics say, this is a good movie","Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner) is a former Secret Service agent who now does private security work and falls in love with his present client, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), a singer turned  actress who resists his overbearing ways at first.  Rachel is stalked by a crazed man and Farmer is called in to protect her.  She must be convinced into accepting his services and they eventually develop a relationship.   But Farmer realizes that this relationship will interfere with his job as a bodyguard.  He ends the relationship, but Rachel, out of concern for her son, Fletcher, soon realizes that the bodyguard relationship is more important than her feelings for her bodyguard.  A great, if not intentionally low-key performance by Costner and over-the-top performance by Houston make this an enjoyable film to watch over and over.  The excellent writing and great one-liners don't hurt either.  Three out of four stars, especially due to the great ending!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
strong love,"An unusual romance story that grabs you as the plot progresses, Whitney is a dedicated actress with a powerful voice.
Although from the beginning anyone can tell as the plot progresses that it is a somewhat predictable script.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Protect any viewers from having to watch this film,"Kevin Costner seems to be very concerned with making each new film that he does as completely different from the one before it as possible and with this one, this is how he follows up on the much stronger film, ""JFK."" Costner is wasted in the title role and Whitney Houston costars to some level of OK effect but this film is much better noted for Houston's songs than anything else. If you want to see the talented singer Houston make a better attempt to establish herself as an actress, see ""Waiting To Exhale"" instead.",,Anonymous,Music
more romance....,"I'm one to not like a lot of sex scenes, but I wish there was more romance between Rachel/Frank.... Overall I still love the movie. Hearing Whitney's voice however brought emotions to my ears, because her voice is beautiful, as well as she in no longer with us:( I like the suspense with a little romance all mix in one. As written in some of the previous reviews I saw about there being no chemistry between Kevin/Whitney? I notice it, but it's not throughout the entire movie... I saw chemistry on/off.In conclusion, it was a great little movie, even my guy enjoys watches it, he sure isn't one for soft movies, but when a movie is great, its that! thumbs up to the late Whitney. a special thumbs up to the sexy Kevin Costner!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining and Enjoyable - that's just what it is supposed to be,"I don't think this movie was intended to be in the 'Oscar-winners' category, so all the 'movie critiques' don't get it.This is a romantic-drama with a bit of thrills, meant to entertain you and fill up a light Sunday afternoon.Whitney did exceptionally well, considering this was her first ever movie and she went 'all out' acting in some scenes, shedding her inhibitions - which many other singer-turned-actresses have shown in their first flicks.The movie, with all it's flaws, is still iconic because it was the first time in mainstream an interracial love-story was portrayed in such a 'color-blind' fashion - that is, not stressing on the 'color-aspect' of their relationship.There are some classic moments, and scenes that you love watching over and over.And then of coarse there is that record-breaking soundtrack - the best selling in history.This is like a Bollywood potboilers, with several elements of entertainment. Watch it with just that in mind and don't be too critical.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good acting, bad action scenes","The actors, led by Kevin Costner, did a great job. But they could have left out a couple of the action sequences. And if you're trying to create a mystery, the script concentrated too much on the glitz and not enough on the substance.",,Anonymous,Music
I have nothing... do you?,"The movie ""The Bodyguard"" is of a singer, Rachel Marron (Whitney Houston), who is been followed by an obsessed fan. Her new bodyguard is an expert, Frank Farmer (Kevin Costner), who is flawless and does everything to protect Rachel. So, it was a short plot in my words. The movie was actually pretty good, romantic and entertaining, though there was a little too little of drama and thriller. Kevin Costner probably did his best role as nowadays it is hard to even remember that there once was an actor by his name. Whitney Houston is a define B-class star, she should stay with singing.The songs were the ones that saved the movie and made me almost but not quite love it. ""Queen Of The Night"" and ""I Have Nothing"" made me shiver and search the Internet for mp3-s. I'm really sorry that Whitney has gone from a great singer to a drug addict. Sorry, but that is the pure truth. So, to put this all together in a few words, I would say: sweet, entertaining, full of fantastic songs. 8/10 points from me.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Superb performance by Kevin And Houston,"Bodyguard is one of the best films i have ever seen, the good combination between a former secret service agent Kevin who lost every thing , with serious type who give all his interest to his job,and a succesful singer who had everything , with the bitchy type who give all her interest to her fans this combination make a perfect romance.The music is great , Whitney performance is great ,nobody can deny the pure golden voice, what presence,It worth watching more than 10 times and be enjoyable each time, it deserve to be the biggest selling soundtrack of all time.",,Anonymous,Music

CHEER! - (9 stars out of 10),"The stage curtains open ...I just finished watching and reviewing the documentary released this year simply titled, ""Whitney"" - so I thought I would revisit ""The Bodyguard"" since it has literally been years since the last time I saw it. Most movies, as they get older, become dated and not as viable as they once were. Not so with this film. In fact, it just seems to get better over time, like a fine, aged wine. Some of the little things that used to get under my skin with this movie (ie: Kevin Costner's hair style, Whitney's choppy debut acting performance, some of the mistakes they made in regard to how a trained secret service agent would really act in certain situations, some of the bad camera work at the end of the movie) - these things just don't bother me anymore.The power and the strength of this film is the music, the chemistry between Costner and Houston, and the strong characters. Of course, maybe it is just the age I'm at now that makes the difference. It has been over 25 years since it came out and the first time I saw it. Maybe, the movie has always been this good and I'm just now starting to realize it. In any case, it has grown to be a personal favorite of mine. I won't bore you with a synopsis of the plot, since this one is so well known already. But, I will say that with the passing of Whitney Houston, this one can be a bitter pill to take now. I did feel my heartstrings being pulled a bit more and the sadness creep in. Despite this, however, I still love this movie. It is a must-see in my opinion, and a high recommend to any of those who have yet to watch it for the first time.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful movie,"I have to say this was and still is one of my ulitmate favorite romantic movies. The soundtrack is amazing! The scenery is beautiful, the plot is great, and the characters are just what you want to see.  Kevin Costner is a great actor and I thought Whitney Houston did a great job acting in a part similar to her own life very well. Viewers might hate that she is so spoiled and selfish and that's a lot of the reason why her sister seems so quiet and kind of like a slave to her whim. Kevin's character you take to heart, since he is a great worker and does his job as he should.  The scene that they know they have fallen in love is so beautiful and well acted that I will remember it forever. You look for a great scene in every movie and there were a few in this one as well, but I don't want to give it away for those that have not seen it yet.  The ending made me cry when I first saw it and still makes me cry, it's just tragic that not all loves end up the way they should. I'd rate this a ***** out of 5!",,Anonymous,Music

"I HAVE NOTHING, so she chooses you","4 out of 5, for music's sake and in the name of entertainment!sorry, i do not know Whitney Houston before this movie though seem familiar with ""i have nothing"". just watch it because of Kevin Costner, whose Open Range worked as starter for my western career. surely i never silly expect this movie to be a western, do I?it's unnecessary to talk about the plot, which just goes the usual way and you can always expect. i just don't understand well who's Farmer's biggest threat. Rachell's sister, Portman, the crazy fan or they actually made the plot together? this caused confusion to me.forget this point, this movie would be a big entertaining one that makes your Sunday, lonely evening pass by quickly... if you are the type of depth-movie goer, then better get rid of it unless you like Houston's attractive look or songi do love Houston's voice, pure and wild! the passion in her music could naturally ignite you and it indeed reminded me that I HAVE NOTHING. my door was broken by her love strength and i was left bare to the open...",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I Won't Always Love This Movie...but it's easy to watch.,"You're going to see ""The Bodyguard"" spoofed a lot. Just two days ago I saw an episode of ""The Simpsons"" with Homer saving Mark Hamill from a horde of geeks. As the song ""I Will Always Love You"" swelled in the background, the image of Homer carrying an animated Mark in his arms filled the screen.Of course, the film itself isn't a good movie. ""The Bodyguard"" is, in fact, a very bad movie. But I like it, in an odd sort of way. It's one of those likable but stupid movies that make the time fly by on a Friday night -- unless, of course, you have something better to do than waste your time watching Kevin Costner attempt to act and Whitney Houston attempt to love him.The movie stars Kevin Costner as Frank Farmer, a bodyguard who blames himself for events from the past that come back to haunt him. Whitney Houston basically plays Whitney Houston (though the character's name is different in the film), a famous singer like herself who falls in love with her newly-aquired bodyguard and sparks an interracial romance that threatens her career almost as much as the death threats she has been receiving in the mail.Frank's mission is to protect her at all costs from the assassinator, who is not a metallic cyborg and who does not bear an uncanny resemblance to Arnold Schwarzenegger (though it would have helped market the film). The surprise at the end is that the killer is not who we think it is throughout -- so don't think at all! Just watch. I hope I didn't ruin any part of the movie for you. But don't tempt me -- I'm about to give away the rabid fan's identity to you.""The Bodyguard"" is a big, mushy mess, filled with bad acting and bad scriptwriting. The entire movie is bad. It's way too long for its own good -- especially when it is broadcast on network television and stretched to a near three-hour showing. (Do they really provide fifty minutes of commercials these days on CBS?) I've seen the movie numerous times, on network television and unedited, and it always seems too long. But, despite its (extremely) bad traits, the movie is a lot of fun to watch.I don't like Kevin Costner. I think he is, what I call, a *blah* actor. He talks with such a lightweight mumble that it often induces sleep. If Costner wants to make money after his film career is depleted (that's happening, folks), he should market Costner Sleep Cassettes. Insert a cassette tape/CD of Kevin Costner reading your least favorite book, and you're guaranteed to fall asleep in less than five minutes -- or your money back!I found one great role that Kevin Costner has played over the years, and it was the role he played in ""The Untouchables,"" opposite Robert De Niro's Al Capone. Brian DePalma directed that movie, and it worked because the role for Costner fit his dull acting talent. Watching him attempt to *really* act is quite sad. Remember his interpretation of Robin Hood? Some people liked it, but I thought it was a disgrace to Robin Hood.For what it's worth, Costner is good here, mainly because he acts like a dull bodyguard who is required to show absolutely no feelings whatsoever. His character basically walks around with a single expression on his face throughout the film, including while he's on a date with Whitney and the night after (if you know what I mean).The movie sparked a lot of controversy because the couple embrace in a passionate kiss at the end of the film. If you don't mind sitting through bad acting, bad directing, bad scriptwriting, all stretched out to two and a half hours...then this is the movie for you. I, personally, sorta like it. But I don't respect it.3/5 stars.John Ulmer",,Anonymous,Music

The Way Movies used to be...,"It struck me as extremely funny that 2 of the biggest box-office movies of all-time, The Bodyguard and Titanic, were and are considered BAD MOVIES!!! So what is it that people want? A serious interesting movie with great acting and great writing,or a bad movie with likeable attractive stars and great music..which both Titanic and Bodyguard both have! Why is it that many comments about this movie are either Loved it or Hated it! Seems that box office is what matters when deciding if a movie is entertaining or not! People go to movies to be entertainedand escape the reality of everyday life! This movie is like an old hollywood movie from the 1940's when big stars would fill the screen with thier glamorous looks and charm and persuasive personalities that would pull us in and not let us go till the credits rolled! So sit back and grab a coke and enjoy a throwback movie! 4/5 St",,Anonymous,Music
Can't help it Costner is sexy,"Okay, I gave it a 10. I just can't help it. Costner is sexy as the reticent bodyguard and Whitney Houston was at her most beautiful. I'll even admit to having loved the soundtrack when it came out. I think the plot surprises, too - though that could be my relative innocence. My recollection is that the movie was critically panned. But it kept me up all night on late-night TV tonight - because I had to see the ending just one more time. I think my 9 year-old will love it, and I'm ordering it on Netflix. If you're looking for something intelligent, forget it. I also think you need to be female to see any merit in this movie at all, because it really is about Costner's appeal - to Whitney and to those of us up too late at night. He's not Benicio Del Toro (there's only one of those) but he's definitely well-cast for The Bodyguard. Watch it with a girlfriend.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
one of those touching films adhesive to the mind,"In this Mick Jackson-directed film from Warner Brothers, which was produced by Lawrence Kasden, Jim Wilson, and one of the two main stars...Kevin Costner..., the issue of interracial relationships is addressed; while that is a matter now tolerated but not totally accepted, even though it is much more frequent than it used to be, this movie presents it as a situation which can be warm, so much so that the sometimes-negative attitude toward it does not ""stick out like a sore thumb"", to employ a favorite cliché. Kevin Costner is in one of his best roles as the secret service agent, Frank Farmer, who is hired to protect Rachel Marron (played by Whitney Houston in her movie-acting debut), but neither has any idea that there will be love between them. In the movie Farmer does not beg Rachel Marron to be protected by him when the independent Marron is often hostile toward him, but that changes and then, again, love develops between them. Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waite do well in their supporting roles. The color is beautiful, so much so that the northern part of this country, with its snow-capped mountains is, in turn, beautiful and refreshing, and the ocean bordering Miami Beach is drawing and refreshing. There is plenty of exciting action, a bit of mystery, and, obviously, warm romance. Whitney Houston is her beautiful self as she portrays her consummate singing ability through such songs as ""If I Don't Have You"", as well as a signature song ""I Will Always Love You"". Because of all its trappings, the movie is one that could never be easily forgotten.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Why don't u go back there and keep watching,The Bodyguard is one of my favorite movies. Costner does a GREAT job as a badass bodyguard who falls in love with his client and Houston does a great job although she makes me think in the movie shes mixing medications.

Why it's nowhere near CASABLANCA,"This fairly well-constructed movie/music collage is rather dated as my wife and I watched it again July 2002.  The 10-year gap wherein some of the plot deficiencies would be unbelievable nowadays makes this seem ""long ago in a legendary land.""  The ""Mine"" club scene especially seems like a 1930's kind of gag since passing a grown woman in a kind of ""mosh"" setting would never really happen with such a harmless, happy ending.  Being stranded at the remote family hideaway with no lines of communication or emergency back-up plan also seems pre-World War II. To enjoy this movie one must enjoy the pop sound of Ms. Houston as well as tolerate the country (light) music of ""I will always love you.""  It is admittedly wacky when it dissects the Oscar/Academy Awards facade; after all, nobody ever really muffs their lines when the television audience is 2 billion viewers, really (??). This movie should never get serious consideration for telling its viewers that much about ""LOVE"" as does a much better but still ""dated"" movie: Casablanca (director Michael Kurtiz).  I believe that BODYGUARD is alluding to it in its choice for an airport penultimate scene; neither principle actor in the 1992 casting approaches the sensuality and romantic extremes of Bergman and Bogart.  Who is the ""third"" side of the LOVE Triangle in this subtextual riff?  Probably the Bodyguard's own sublimated Father-figure aspect with the Diva's son.  That kid is left adrift in more ways than one in the course of the movie -- whether he can swim and just what the ""name"" of the Diva's nominated movie is seem to be not very solid at different points of the screenplay.  For its strengths of music and comedy (sometimes inadvertent), I give it an ""8"" out of 10 star rating.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very good, but...","Lawrence Kazdan has written a dozen of memorable films and directed some of them ( 'Body Heat'(qv) is among the very very best films noirs ever ). Here he selects the hate of Nikki for her extremely successful younger sister as the basis of his plot. Why not ? But difficulties arise when it comes to explain how a girl without connection with the underworld can get the services of a gun for hire. Kazdan tries it thus :  full of guilt over the unwanted near-death of her nephew, Nikki confesses that ,-though so drunk as not to remember the name of the bar she went to -, she made enquiries and got in touch with a go-between , and hired  a killer (perhaps the best one in the States, by the way!); and she paid the whole price (a quite sizeable sum ) in advance - when she could have been so easily swindled . The confession is conveniently stopped  by the yapping of the watchdog; and immediately after, she is ( also conveniently ) bumped off when trying to stop the killer ... But "" The Bodyguard "" being a very well made and entrancing film, the foregoing shortcomings of the plot  appear only long after the film has ended . The cast is quite satisfactory  : I am not an unconditional fan of Costner's, but he manages well enough, and has some powerful chemistry with Whitney Houston; she is quite convincing in her movie debut, and her voice is a marvel. And all supporting actors are well selected , including reliable veterans Bill Cobbs and Ralph Waithe, and intriguing Tomas Arana. The film made quite a  pile of money, but apparently did not help the career of its  director, Mick Jackson.",,Anonymous,Music
