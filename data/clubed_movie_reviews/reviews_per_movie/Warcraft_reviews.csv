Sold film. Solid ending. Worth the watch.,"I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews and low reviews. If you're a fan of mystical worlds and fantasy, wizards, kings and queens, mythical creatures such as deserts, orcs, elves and more, then already this has the foundations for a good film. It's not anywhere near Lord of the rings or The Hobbit, but it isn't cheesy and keeps you entertained. The fight scenes are really entertaining and I felt choreographed well. The CGI is really good with this film to the point where the creatures feel real and you forget they're fantasy creatures. The film is well-paced, and although it is just over 2 hours, the film never seemed to drag for me. I felt the film had the right balance of dialogue, action, fantasy and humour. I personally enjoyed it and recommend it is worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Critics sunk the much-needed sequel.,"David Bowie's son Duncan Jones is the brilliant mind behind the film Moon (2009). It was also his debut film. Warcraft was his second.I have watched this film 3 times over the past few years, and it never has lost its magic. The acting, story and visual effects are mind-blowing. It is dark and brutal, with a glimmer of hope. In contrast, Rotten Tomatoes and other ""esteemed Hollywood critics"" decided to bomb this film, with a ridiculous 29% rating. They were dark and brutal, without that glimmer of hope.I know a bit about the background of this film, and that it was made outside of Hollywood structures, with major funding coming from China. It seems the only reason for them to be so unreasonably and selfishly venomous towards the film.I have played the stand-alone game and liked it, but I am not a fanboy of the game. The film is an origin film, and the storyline is easy to follow, not so complicated as many critics allege. Duncan Jones is an extremely talented director, and I can only think how these reviews destroyed his intentions of a follow-up.To give Warcraft 29%, and the infantile, by-the-numbers film Bumblebee (2018) 91%, you just know that RT is very much ROTTEN TO THE CORE.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Done really well, considering","There were several constraints that the movie had to work with. There was the already established Warcraft mythos and stories, there was the terrible stigma of game adaptations and finally there was the matter of so many main CGI characters that had to look realistic, not like something Pixar or Disney designed. Given that, I was not expecting much.Yet the movie exceeded all my expectations and gave me hope for the future. The story is something placed at the end of chapter III of the mythos and the beginning of chapter IV. In game, it is the story of Warcraft I, which was another bold move, considering the hordes (heh heh heh) of World of Warcraft players that weren't even born when that game was published. It pits the peaceful kingdom of Azeroth vs the war clans of the unknown Orc, fleeing from their dying world through a portal fueled by the very thing that destroyed it. A half human, half orc girl is instrumental in providing information about who the Orcs are, what they want and how they have reached the kingdom.Characters were well developed, graphics were good, the script had few holes and the mature story was clearly well smoothed out. The only problem one could have is that it's just the first part in many, with the main conflict point resolved, but none for the character story lines.Actors came from all kinds of TV series, Vikings, Preacher and Legends of Tomorrow to name a few. The only predominantly big screen actor out there was Ben Foster. It shows both the direction of cinema and TV blending together (and perhaps with games) and the fear of well established cinema actors getting caught in unsuccessful game adaptations. Perhaps with the success of this and - one may only hope - Assassin's Creed, things will begin to change.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Honest review,"First of all let me say that I never played Warcraft but I played other blizzard Games like Starcraft, Diablo and Overwatch. I enjoyed a lot this movie and want more, much more. I have to say that the movie is actually very good (not great, but very good). The CGI is awesome, they should as example to the next Hulk. The movie could be better? Yes, but honestly, this is probably the best adaptation of a video game. I had no problem to follow the story, the plot is simple (could be better). The names are very complicated to remember (lol). The orcs are the core of the movie, they are much more interesting them the humans in my opinion. I believe the director was so focused in have the CGI right that maybe he forgot the human actors. I don't understand why the ""professional"" critics were so harsh with this movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Highly Entertaining Fantasy Film,"When the world of the Orcs Draenor is being destroyed by the evil fel magic that uses life-force, the powerful warlock Gul'dan creates a portal to the world of Azeroth and forms the Horde with members of the Orc clans. He also captures many prisoners to keep the portal. The king of Azeroth Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and his brother-in-law Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) are informed by the apprentice of magician Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) that he has found fel magic in dead bodies and the king decides to summon the Guardian of Tirisfal Medivh (Ben Foster) to protect his kingdom. Lothar and Khadgar head Kharazhan to meet Medivh and a shadow points a book to Khagdar and he takes it and hides. Anduin, Khadgar and Medivh and a group of soldiers are attacked by Orcs and they capture the slave Garona (Paula Patton), who is released by King Llane, and she shows the location of the portal. Garona is contacted by the Orc chief of a clan Durotan that wants to meet King Llane to stop the fel magic. Meanwhile Khadgar learns that the gate was opened with the help of someone in Azeroth. Shall King Lllane trust on Garona and Durotan? Whi might be the traitor?""Warcraft"" is a highly entertaining fantasy film with an abrupt beginning without development of the situation and characters. Most of the characters are unpleasant and non-charismatic. Maybe the fans of the video game have a big picture of Draenor and Azeroth. But the special effects are top-notch and the story is not bad. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Warcraft: O Primeiro Encontro de Dois Mundos"" (""Warcraft: The First Encounter of Two Worlds"")",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A great start to what should be an epic series of movies!,"This movie is something that grabbed me from the word go! I am not a gamer! But this makes me want to check out the game! I truly hope they take this and run. The possibilities for this is ridiculous! PLEASE EXPAND upon this (hopefully) first installment of many more to come! The story is a wonderful beginning of an epic in the making. The character base and unfinished story is an incredible tease for what we all hope will continue to hit the big screen! I have yet to hear from others, anything at all negative! This movie has absolutely everything I look for Ina movie!

Entertaining summer blockbuster with some flaws,"I'll keep this short, because people don't want to read long posts.Here goes:The good:+ Visuals, stunning.+ Acting was OK. I liked that it was serious in parts. Everything must not be ""funny"" and Disney all the time. I think it took itself less seriously than The Hobbit though.+ The action -especially when Gul'Dan was involved - was really epic and well choreographed.+ If you like magic, you get plenty of mage action in here.+ Obviously some fan service here and there. I heard lots of people laughing and clapping hands throughout the movie. + The set- up for the sequel was nice.The bad:Pacing. The beginning is very fast. The first 20 minutes jump back and forth between locales. I'd rather have an slower pacing in the beginning, and then go all-in later.Some of the characters have very interesting back stories (especially Khadgar and Garona), but they're skimmed over. - We never really get to see much of the orcish world.The movie feels a bit short. You could easily add 20 minutes without the audience feeling bored.So, all in all: Are the critics right and the audiences wrong? Well, I do think that some critics should question themselves. This movie CAN NEVER GET 1/5. That is blasphemy. A lot of love and care was put into this movie. My girlfriend, who knows nothing about Warcraft, thought it was a good time.Solid 3,5/5 from me. A movie worth watching in cinemas. You will most likely have a good time. It's no masterpiece, but it's an entertaining summer blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great Fantasy flick,"I didn't have any expectations for this film,and it completely blew me away!Visuals were stunning,acting really surprised me,action was incredible.I really can't wait for the sequel cause the ending set it up really well.Magic was also pretty damn cool.Orgrim was a ferocious bad ass.It was a damn fine film,best of the 2016 dare i say.Bring on more,and it finally broke the video game movie curse!Go see it,you won't regret it!10 out of 10 for me!I think that it will have a good reception from audiences and critics.Warcraft fans will love it.Direction was amazing,one of the best motion capture for a film i've seen,i really hope it does well in the box office and review department cause it was really amazing!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Good, but not great","To begin with, I have to say I'm not Warcraft fan. I played the game occasionally, but I never gave too much thought to it nor read anything related to this lore, so I'm not competent to say if movie is faithful to original story or not. But I am fan of epic fantasy and it's my favorite genre. The only thing that somewhat bothered me was that two hours is not nearly enough to tell this story proper. Fact that movie feels incomplete is acceptable, cause it is obvious this is just the base for movies that will follow and this franchise looks very promising. But even just introduction to this world can not fit in only two hours. It needs at least three hours, or even two movies for this part of the story to be told right. Beside that I have no other objections. It is very good movie. But they call it The Lord of the Rings for the new generation. That's where I must draw a line. However good this movie is it is not worthy to be even compared to LOTR. Not only it is blasphemy to say that Warcraft is better or equally good, but they are beyond any comparison. Even after fifteen years nothing came even close to LOTR, let alone overthrow it from the throne of the genre. Maybe this movie standing alone deserves higher rating than what I rated it, and if there was no LOTR maybe I would rate it much higher, but LOTR set standards so high for this genre and in every single aspect it so much better than Warcraft, that on the scale where LOTR is ten, I simply can not give this movie more than seven. Still, I warmly recommend this adventure to all genre lovers and I can not wait for the sequels.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome!,"You know, there are films in which the first frame is clear that they will be so-so. Here the situation is reversed. After seeing the first frame, I immediately realized that it will be very cool.Seriously, I'm all covered with goose bumps when I saw how much it is great. I was just literally shaking when I saw the gorgeous magic. However, better than in this movie magic effects have not been implemented in any fantasy films, it seems to me. I love Warcraft story so much and I think even if you don't know anything about the original story after that film you'll love it.Would certainly recommend to both fans and non-fans alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fun action fantasy movie.,"This movie got some bad reviews when it came out but i really enjoyed it. It isn't up there with Lord of the rings but it's not bad at all.I don't play the game so i know little about the lore and it is kind of goofy in parts but this was a fun action fantasy movie.The CGI is pretty amazing, the orcs might be the best looking fully CG characters i've ever seen in a movie. There's a few scenes where the lighting was just right so they actually look like real living things, it's very impressive.The story feels rushed as there are too many characters who aren't fleshed out enough but the effects are great, the acting is good and the action scenes are chaotic and exciting.I like Ben Foster and Dominic Cooper so it's always cool to see them in big movies. Y'all know Paula Patton's sexy orc lady is someone's kink as well, some people were very happy.This is a fun time and i want a sequel but i don't think there will be one which is a shame.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I knew almost nothing about Warcraft and I still enjoyed the movie!,"4,3/5 - 8,6/10 IMDB Rating
I didn't expect it to be this fun! To be honest, when I chose to watch this movie my expectations were pretty low, not because of the reviews or anything like that, but because I didn't know much about the Warcraft universe. I knew that it was a game and what it consisted of, but that was pretty much it. So, you can understand why this movie came as a surprise to me. Warcraft is such a beautiful world, that is dominated by a war between people and orcs, and the rest is yours to discover. There were parts that I loved and parts that I didn't, so I am going to mention them pretty quickly:
What I liked:
1. The atmosphere - I don't know how, but they managed to make me fall in love with those places even though I didn't know anything about this universe at all, just mesmerizing.2. The characters - I actually liked the characters more than I expected. Some of them were bland, but the majority were pretty good, nothing unique or out of the box, but still great character storylines.What I didn't like:
1. The animation of the orcs - Ok, I know that some are going to judge what I am saying, but I truly believe that they could've done a better job with this. The animations weren't horrible, but in comparison to the rest of the visuals, they lacked that ""special"" something.2. The end - I liked the end, but I didn't like the fact that there is no Warcraft 2, which is quite sad because I was really curious to see what's next.All in all, even if you don't know anything about the Warcraft universe, I recommend giving it a shot, especially if you are a fantasy movie lover.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the critics tell you,"I went to see Warcraft movie on a night and i am not disappointed. The movie was good, a great fantasy flick with awesome looking visuals and even more awesome looking orcs. While it is certainly a good movie, it is not an unmissable one. That i a creepy situation, because it sets me apart from both the critics and the fans. While i would go to cinema to watch a sequel then this movie is not as good as most people say. But i nonetheless still enjoyed it and had a pretty good time watching it. I am happy to see a new great fantasy franchise come out. It is also a good movie which is interesting because it is based on a video game. For a verdict i would say that this movie is a good one that will fill your time with a good memory and a good feeling, too. I liked this movie and it is great. I am definitely on board for sequels. Besides the fight between the orcs and the humans is really interesting. The characters are great and everything is sorted out great.

WarCraft: The Beginning - Review,"I actually thought this film would be bad. Like most other video game movies I thought this was going to be a massive flop and just suck. This movie broke the video game movie curse with style. WarCraft surprised me even though I am a WarCraft fan.If there are sequels WarCraft could easily be this generations equivalent of The Lord of the Rings. The acting was great, the effects were spot on and the action was epic. I was really impressed with the motion capture on the orcs, they looked amazing. Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar was a good choice. He did a really good job of portraying the lion of Stormwind. WarCraft has a lot of lore that could easily be made into a film series and I think this film did a good job of establishing the world of WarCraft for future sequels. Do I recommend watching WarCraft? Yes, WarCraft is a movie everyone can enjoy, although it may be too intense and violent for younger children. If you were a fan of the games there are Easter eggs for you. If you have never heard of WarCraft you will be amazed by the world and want more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flawed, yet spectacular","So, I just saw the movie in IMAX 3D. The theater was almost entirely full, and it seated about 550 people!First of all, the CGI and visuals were amazing and all the orcs were spectacular. The music and cinematography was great and some scenes were so epic it's hard to describe. Some of the moments in the movie were among the best I've ever seen, and they really drew you in. Blew my mind really, I was hyped.The acting was decent by most, and I enjoyed most of the characters. Gul'dan and Durotan were probably my two favourites. The movie really did have many awesome characters, but it's too bad that they weren't fleshed out more. Garona was probably the most fleshed out, and that is also why you sympathized with her.The story was good, but very disjointed. Parts were messy and the editing was seriously not good. I mean, the scenes themselves were mostly well done, but they felt very unorganised, and different from each other. Besides needing more character development, and background story, the movie needed a significantly more cohesive and streamlined expression. It felt like a lot was left on the cutting room floor and you could tell they have been working on it for a long time. In the latter part it really picked up and the movie seemed more deliberate with longer scenes, and very thrilling action. The griffin was badass!It really did stay true to the Warcraft universe and I loved that. It was very beautiful and yes, heartfelt. The emotions of the characters shined through, even if they did not have a lot of time to build them up.Personally, as a whole, I rate it a 7.5/10. Could have easily been higher if the movie was more conjoined. Easily.As a spectacle It was truly amazing. As I said in the beginning, some scenes are unlike anything I've seen before. I will definitely watch it again!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I had ABSOLUTELY NO EXPECTATIONS of this movie and it was enjoyable from start to finish. I believe a lot of the bad reviews are from warcraft fans in which I'm not.It's not a cinematic masterpiece but the plot is very solid and completely action packed, has a decent storyline and outstanding characters.The CGI was fantastic, the battles were far superior to what i thought they'd be.Obviously it ends on a bit of a cliff hanger setting up got a number 2 but I'll certainly be watching it again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good but not great It's a movie for the fans,I came to the movie as a Warcraft player (I played Warcraft III and World of Warcraft). I know some of the lore and this made me understand what's going on. But from my objective side as a moviegoers I find this movie will be hard to grasp by mainstream audience because the lack of character building and fast pace of the story with lack of background.Pros: - The long awaited movie of the much beloved Warcraft finally came out - Battle scenes are pretty epic and hard - Feels like a superhero movie with medieval settings - CGI quality is greatCons: - Needs more screen time for storytelling - Lack of character building and depth - People without Warcraft lore will find the story is too fast and lack of backstory,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful Visuals and Strong Soundtrack but not much else going for it...,"Here in Denmark, Warcraft had its premier today so obviously I flocked to the cinema to watch the movie. And the movie turned out to be exactly what I expected. The film looked and sounded wonderful (I'm already thinking Oscar nominations for visual effects, sound editing, and sound mixing), but the story was weak and the characters vanilla. The CGI, which I had feared, turned out to be pretty gosh darned good (especially in relation to the orcs). The acting department of the film was not anything unexpected with a few decent performances and otherwise plain and wooden acting that seemed to gloss over the otherwise dramatic and interesting situations that some of these characters were thrown into. The largest issue with this film however is the weak story, the unbelievable screenplay, and the fact that the movie relies on the audience having previous knowledge of the Warcraft lore (which I don't).Travis Fimmel, who I've only ever seen in Vikings, plays the human protagonist, Anduin Lothar, and does so decently. Now this is obviously not a groundbreaking or jaw dropping performance, but for a big action movie like Warcraft his acting was fairly good. Fimmel makes the character interesting, relatable, and easy-to-root-for, which is frankly more than anyone could have expected, so props to him. But Fimmel was by no means excellent; on several occasions when he had to deal with loss there seemed to be a weird and inhuman lack of emotion. Paula Patton plays the half-human and half-orc female protagonist, Garona Halforcen, who flip-flops from Horde to Alliance and vice versa. This character, just like Lothar, has a nice relatability and is easy for the viewer to get behind. Patton's performance is also pretty decent, but just like Fimmel, she had moments of uncomfortable stiffness and lack of emotion. I do think though, that in this case that could also be due to a screenplay that totally lacked any sense of believable dialogue. Ben Schnetzer also has a major role in this film as the mage, Khadgar, who accompanies Lothar for the majority of his journey. Although the character is cliché (I'll be saying that a lot), Schnetzer's decent wit and mildly sarcastic approach makes the character fairly compelling and interesting. The character's major moments however are ruined by unpleasing directing and weird dialogue, but Schnetzer did alright.Ben Foster also features in this film as the Guardian of Tirisfal, Medivh. Now I can honestly proclaim that I was lost for a large portion of his scenes which were something about mages and magic and 'fel', I think But all that aside, Foster did not help much himself. Foster's portrayal was awkward and inconsistent, sometimes he'd loudly speak to himself and sometimes he'd have a large unjustified outburst of emotion with no true reason behind it, but for the sake of the story. Dominic Cooper portrays the young and dashing King Llane Wrynn, who rules Azeroth. Cooper's character is awfully clichéd, but is wonderfully grounded and believable and seems to mend some of Foster's scenes. But ultimately the character fails to get the audience to back him and it seems truly outrageous that the same actor who made Howard Stark a likable character played such a dull character in such a big movie. Toby Kebell plays the noble yet awfully underused character of Durotan, the leader of the Frostwolf Clan (a clan of orcs). In the very beginning of the film, the character is seen with his very young son, and this helps make the character appeal to the audience. Although the character itself is interesting, and Kebell's acting is decent, the character is so underused and pushed aside for story lines and plots that fall incredibly short of Durotan's.Robert Kazinsky and Clancy Brown (Mr. Krabbs in Spongebob) play Orgrim Doomhammer, the reluctant follower and occasionally good friend of Durotan, and Blackhand, the aggressive war chief of the Horde, respectively. They both do decently in their roles and Kazinsky especially has nice chemistry with Kebell on screen. Daniel Wu is also thrown into the film as the classic evil manipulative magician-type character. Though the character itself is cliché and has no true backstory or anything (at least not in the film), Wu does play the role well and if it were not for IMDb, I would never have guessed that Wu had played that character. Ruth Negga and Anna Galvin also feature in the film as Lady Taria, Wrynn's wife, Lothar's brother, and queen of Azeroth, and Draka, Durotan's wife respectively. The two are really just shoehorned into the movie to make Wrynn and Durotan more relatable (I guess) and serve no purpose but to be wives, and although Draka especially gets a few moments to shine, she is– despite significant screen time– absolutely forgettable. Negga's acting in the film is depressingly and cringe-inducing wooden, while Galvin's was a little more believable, but was still to a certain degree weak due to the lack of emotion she put into the character. And finally– because I'm tired of writing about these dull character– Callum Keith Rennie plays Moroes, Medivh's assistant (maybe). The character is never really explained and although having a significant handful of scenes with Medivh I have no clue why he was in the film or what his relationship was with Medivh. But despite all that I can still point out the fact that Rennie's acting (like countless other's) was uncomfortably wooden and he seemed to put no effort whatsoever into making the dialogue believable.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
People should have supported this effort.,"This time the fault solely lies upon the audience. People should have supported this effort. We could have get an epic series if the audience bought the tickets of Warcraft. I admit as far as fantasy genre goes this was no Star wars or LOTR or Harry Potter but people forget Warcraft got a powerful storyline to back it up.Warcraft lore is rich. It has everything !!! It got even enough diversity to appease the 'woke' viewers. No ,I am not white. I only care about the story . I knew I had to support it when it released and I did. Apart from Castlevania there is no other movie or series which was adapted better than Warcraft. It could have been a masterpiece series if people supported it like they did with ' The Witcher' which was mediocre at best but like Warcraft it has a strong lore to bolster it's future sequels.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly good,"Knowing nothing about Warcraft, I expected the movie to be terrible, just based on previous experiences when it comes to adaptation from videogames, however I was greatly surprised by how good this movie was for most of it. From the start they didn't miss a step in laying out the story and the characters, their deep and complex nature and connections to and with each other. It's always tricky not sounding silly when talking about magic, orcs, dwarves, mages and what not, but the wording and delivery was spotless, led obviously by the great casting of Travis Fimmel. Although some of the ""swording around"" looked weird, the special effects were good.Unfortunately, the movie took a huge hit by the end, it was just dumb and poorly written, after they had done everything so well. Overall, still a good movie and the way the actual final scene ended allowed to amend things and end up in a better position.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Warcraft fans, LOTR fans, Fantasy fans and even non fans, GO SEE THIS MOVIE ! You will love every second of it !","Hello.First of all i have to tell you, i am a Warcraft fan and i had no expectations from this movie at all. I am NOT a Blizzard fan boy and i know when they do something poor and when they do something good.If you like the cinematics that they make and if you like LOTR like me and fantasy, you will absolutely love this movie.I was really scared about this movie being another video game movie chaos. Not by a landslide.Warcraft is astonishing. The visuals are ground breaking, the acting is very strong and the emotional involvement between the viewer and the movie is breath taking. The familiar zones from Warcraft universe are all and are built exactly how they are suppose to be built, every Warcraft fan will feel like home and on the brink of shedding tears. I will watch this movie again in 10 June and gather all my friends that were not lucky enough to see it yet and go again, maybe twice. I need more, there has to be more Warcraft movies. Dunca Jones working alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the movie. Almost 2 hours of pure awesomeness. 10/10 from me.

"Worth checking for anyone who's a World of Warcraft fan, now as a movie...","I went into Warcraft with high hopes and expectations, much like Batman v. Superman, and much like BVS most of my expectations were let down by a few things that I found wrong with the movies themselves. However, I will say that I thought Warcraft was better then BVS in terms of character arcs, interesting story and better- handled action.Before I go on let me just make it clear that I myself am not a hardcore WOW fan myself, but my friends at secondary school told me everything about the lore and since then we always talked about it. Deathwing has always been my favourite character though, and if the studios are planning on bringing him into any future Warcraft movies then I'd slap down £15 to go see that! Assuming of course they'll will be good sequels (fingers crossed).But back to the film itself, there are some neat stuff and some bad stuff. The bad stuff I'll focus on first, mostly to do with the pacing. This movie is two and a half hours long and at a point, my friend's sister fell asleep almost half way through, mostly because it was rather a late screen timing that the film was on at. The pacing of this movie really dragged on, and I felt like the narrative was a little unfocused and the characters and lore of Warcraft were both not given the proper development (unless this turns out to be the start of a series, perhaps trilogy, I hope it is so they can explain more).However, that's not to say that I didn't like the movie because of those things. I actually really liked this movie for the most part because it at least had enough interesting characters with deep emotion and amazing visual spectacle and epic gritty action sequences to the film a thrilling and enjoyable movie-going experience for me.The main villain, I thought was delivered great justice, the main orc character, Durotan, I thought was hands down the best part of the movie as well as the main human character, Lothar, who I really liked as well. Daniel Wu, Toby Kebbell and Travis Fimmel did a spectacular job and I was on board with their characters throughout the movie. The rest of the characters felt sort of bland to me, but I felt like they had some good story arcs there and interesting depth to them at the same time.So overall, I would recommend Warcraft to see for yourself and see what you thought, especially if your a Warcraft fan, then you have yourself some fan service.As it stands now, Warcraft, I feel deserves a 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is The Video Game Curse Broken?,"First off, i would like to point out Duncan Jones has made another fantastic flick. Better than source code, but me personally i loved moon so.... Warcraft isn't good enough to beat it lol. So Everything about this movie felt right. And i would like to point out this movie is about the warcraft storyline (First game) Not World Of Warcraft. The acting was good, the pacing was great. The CGI was amazing! Gul'dan was an awesome villain. Never heard of Daniel Wu But i feel like he will be voice acting more characters soon. I love how they wear that ridiculous armor that a normal person can't stand up in. Lothar was an amazing main character, and I only know Travis Fimmel because he's in the show vikings but i feel like if the rest of the critics like this movie this could be his breakthrough movie. If there is a sequel then i would definitely go and see it. And lads, The Video game curse is broken! Hopefully Assassins Creed will live up to the hype! Fans will love it, people who like lord of the rings or the hobbit will love it, just regular people who has never played WoW will love it! All in all, i think that the hype was well worth it and it is definitely going to be a recommend for me! After you have seen Captain America go see Warcraft, you wont regret it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Our hope is destroyed; there is nothing to go back to.""","I feel conflicted over this film because I want to like it, I want it to be successful and I believe the world created in the film can obviously be expanded upon and offer some truly great cinematic experiences. Duncan Jones, who gave us the brilliant Moon and exciting Source Code is behind the camera and brings a wonderful visual style, but as is the case with a lot of big budget CGI filled epic flicks, the visual style is not enough.The Orc world is dying and they need to find another to live. Gul'dan unite the Orc clans together to become The Horde. He uses a magical power known as The Fel to create a portal to another world, Azeroth. The portal needs life to be sacrificed in order to work so thousands of people are captured in Azeroth in an attempt to bring even more of The Horde over to conquer the lands. Sir Anduin Lothar, a military commander leads the humans in a fight to protect their land. Along with their King, a magical being known as The Guardian and a mage in training, they need to stop the portal from being built before it's too late.As basic as the premise sounds (evil invading / good defending) the film throws a lot at you in quick successions. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel overwhelmed by it all. I've never played the games, so I'm sure I missed a lot of winks and nods and of course my enjoyment of it might be on the lesser side of things, but Warcraft is exciting in many sequences. Those exciting sequences astonish the eyes with dazzlingly effects. I doubt we'll see anything that looks better this year, the Orcs feel alive. In particular Durotan, an Orc that believes his leader Gul'dan is doing more damage than good. He is the one Orc that is given something that resembles a backstory. His wife gives birth early in the film and I can only assume that the child goes on to become someone important in the game franchise.On the human side, Lothar is the character that Jones decides to focus on. He's a soldier, that's all he knows. He's even brought his son up to be soldier. His two duties in life are to protect his son and protect the King. With the invading armies of the Horde, his skills and loyalty are put to the test. The King, basically does what a King does, order people to do this, order people to do that. We get little interaction with a more humanistic side to him. Magic is also a big portion of the film, with a man known as The Guardian who holds what seems to be unlimited power and a Mage, who is still learning his spells. They fill their basic fantasy roles, but I can't help but feel that Ben Foster, who plays the Guardian, is miscast. Maybe it's his age, but I simply did not believe him in this film at all.Warcraft is full on fantasy. Giant birds, magical beings, kingdoms and castles. For those not interested in those things, Warcraft will not convert you. In fact it will make you feel more alienated. What it does do, for me at least, is be interested in the possibility of a sequel. The film throws a few surprises at you and does a lot of set-up for those future instalments, which might not even come. As it stands, Warcraft is a film to watch on a big screen, in high definition. I totally understand why the critics hate it, why the fans love it and why I'm somewhere in the middle.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Screw you pompous traditionalists,"I have no gaming experience. I watch movies while I work on the treadmill or airdyne, and love movies that keep me engaged. This movie did that. Sure, it's not Oscar stuff, wasn't meant to be, but the action, CGI rendering, and storyline is compelling enough to make me want more of the story. So, I give it a 9, probably closer to a 7, but I think a lot scored it low due to their gaming superiority syndrome.So there.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Never played the game but I'm already a fan,"You can be certain Warcraft is going to have a lot of fans. People that like fantasy movies with a lot of strange creatures and magic spells will love this movie. And gamers that play the video game World Of Warcraft will also like this movie. I didn't play World Of Warcraft yet but after seeing the movie I'm tending to do so if I have to be honest. If the game has the same story and good graphics as the movie then I will be sold. The story in Warcraft is what you expect from a good fantasy movie. All ingredients are there, like Dwarfs, Orcs, half breeds, magicians and so on. The CGI's are great and now I wished I saw it in the theater instead of my big television screen. The cast is good as well. There's clearly going to be more of them and I will for sure watch them. On the other hand people that don't like fantasy movies are probably think this is a lame movie. So just think about it before you start watching it.

Unexpectedly good videogame adaptation,"My knowledge of Warcraft franchise begins and ends with knowing that humans and orcs are fighting each other. I considered Warcraft to be all around underdog - until I saw the movie. My original ""Oh, I'll look and see..."" turned to ""I want sequel!""Yes, it's infantile, naive, predictable and artificial. But... Do you want solid action? Here it is. Intimate moments? No problem. Heroism and epicness? Cool orcs? There you go. Do you want art/new LOTR? Sorry, this is a movie based on the high-cliché-fantasy videogame, not the work of Tolkien of 21st century.Warcraft does exactly what it intends to do (transfer a videogame to big screen) in an enjoyable way, nothing more and nothing less.

"I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.","'WARCRAFT: THE BEGINNING': Four Stars (Out of Five)Fantasy-action flick; based on the immensely popular video game franchise, and novel series (of the same name). This movie tells the origin story, of how an army of orcs invaded the world of Azeroth; to take it for their own. It was directed by Duncan Jones (who also helmed such other popular sci-fi flicks, as 'MOON' and 'SOURCE CODE'); it was also written by Jones and Charles Leavitt (based on a story, and characters, created by Chris Metzen). The film stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Toby Kebbell, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Daniel Wu and Ben Schnetzer. It's gotten mostly negative reviews from critics, but it's also been a hugely profitable blockbuster overseas (breaking many records, all around the world). I really wanted to like this movie, and I did love it's visuals, but the story and characters are a little disappointing.The film tells the story of a world of orcs, called Draenor, that's quickly dying. They've discovered a portal, using a powerful magic force called the fel, that will lead them to another world (known as Azeroth). The army of orcs, known as the Horde, is lead by a sinister orc, named Gul'dan (Wu); who uses the fel to drain the life force of other species (in order to fuel the portal). One noble orc chieftan, named Durotan (Kebbell), doesn't want to enslave the people of Azeroth (for this purpose). So Durotan, and a half-breed (orc-human) named Garona (Patton), attempt to form an alliance with the humans there. The humans are lead by a king, named Llane (Cooper), and a knight, named Lothar (Fimmel).I've never played the game, or read any of the books (or comics), so I didn't have any real high expectations for this movie. I did love the trailer though, because of it's visuals; and I have to say, the special effects (in this movie) are some of the best I've ever seen. I also love epic sc-fi fantasy flicks, like this. I'm just disappointed that the story, and characters, don't live up to the film's spectacular visuals. Duncan Jones is a very talented director; but his wife did get cancer during the production of this movie (and his father, David Bowie, died of it). Still, I think he delivered. I think the movie's main problems are due to it's script (which Jones did help write though). I think it was probably too faithful to the video game series, and novels. The story might have worked really well in those formats, but translating it to other art forms (like film) doesn't always work. I hope the sequels are much better (I did absolutely love this movie's visuals though). I probably would have liked the film much more, when I was a kid.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/cnnfZjVyQIc",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A great fantasy flick, even for non-fans of the games","Out of all the movies I've seen this year, Warcraft sticks out like a sore thumb (and that's coming from someone who doesn't play the games). But like I'm emo and I really want that sore thumb to be there (terrible analogy).Warcraft has an great array of layered, sympathetic characters with deep personalities and motivations however Ben Schnetzer (Khadgar) stole the show for me. I had never heard of this guy before but now I can't wait to see where his career is headed. With that said, there is one actor that didn't sell for me and that's Travis Fimmel (Anduin Lothar). It's particularly frustrating because he is very much the main character and, while his character is very layered, he would have made for an excellent side character. But what really was the big kicker of this movie was the score. Game Of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi once again delivers a powerful theme that's been stuck in my head ever since. Also, the visuals are great... most of the time. The digitally-created orcs are the most believable cgi creations I've seen since The Jungle Book (2016). However they do look like a digital creation in some scenes, particularly whenever they interact with an object. Overall, Warcraft was a great movie that does not disappoint and I would recommend it to any fantasy movie fan.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Another poor work inspired by popular game.,"The epic battle at the center of ""Warcraft"" isn't the clash between humans and orcs. That's just what takes up roughly two hours of screen time. The true conflict comes from filmmakers trying to tell a story with soul and struggling against the inherent ridiculousness of the movie. Despite the noble effort of director Duncan Jones, who helmed the lower- budget sci-fi wonders ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"" , Warcraft just couldn't save itself from its unconventional and poor story tale.With its meticulously detailed realms built out primarily on soundstages and enhanced via CGI during extensive post-production, ""Warcraft"" aims for fresh and eye-popping and yet ends up shopworn and rather tacky. I am totally disappointed by Duncan Jones 'Warcraft'. I would give 1.5/5 for this heartless movie without any soul.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good Entertainment. Loyal to the video games.,"The movie came out this morning here in Dubai and I had the chance to watch it at the first show. I went it without reading anything about the film at all to give it a fair chance. Here are my thoughts.The film has a strong start that tries to explain the reason for the Orcs presence in Azaroth. It's a good start.I thought the movie lost a bit of pacing in the first 45 minutes of the film due to (occasional) weak acting and casting. Overall it's not bad enough to put any one off. Just don't expect GoT standards of acting and direction.The 2nd and 3rd halves of the film are full of some very good action sequences and the film doesn't hold any punches when it comes to character deaths, decapitations and skull crushes, which I found good and loyal to the video game lore. There were a lot of locations that took me back to my WoW playing days such as IronForge, StormWind etc. It has some very obvious characters throughout the difference locations that only the true video game players would recognize and remember.Having played the games since the mid 90s, I have to say Blizzard has started the franchise off on a strong footing. It deserves a few sequels that will hopefully do justice to the entire WarCraft lore. Go watch it. And no, I'm not a studio plant.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Didn't expect much, that's what I got","WarcraftAfter being a fan of the game, and having read a lot of the Novels on the lore it was kinda expected that I would go watch Warcraft the movie. Did I have a lot of hopes? Not really, they normally always find a way to butcher a game movie. In fact that's always been the case where games and movies don't match that well.This movie was not that different from my expectations. The acting was really bad, the script was really bad, the sequence was really bad. The Lore was sub par as far as the story went, in fact it was distributed by Blizzard so they had to get that part right. But the casting was poorly done, and the actors don't portray the lore that well.The only good part about this movie was really the effects, which I have to say was spectacular. The visuals were very well done, the CGI was very realistic, I mean you can tell the bulk of the budget went in the visuals and not the actors.I would recommend this movie to fans of the game still, it's worth a least 1 watch even if it wasn't that good. I would not recommend it to anyone who's never played the game. The story is fast paste on the lore which expects the audience to already know a background of who people all.I give Warcraft a 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An interesting adaptation although not everyone will follow,"Video game movies to this day are still struggling to get their transition correct from interactive to submissive entertainment. Unfortunately there's a disconnect between the fans of the movies and the fans of video games. This is due to multiple factors; lack of knowledge of the game, lack of people who have played the game and the lack of appreciation for the game. Things seemed to be on the up and up though for 2016 when some very different people got involved with the production of various video game movies. For Blizzard's popular Warcraft game, the adaptation of it to the big screen was under development for several years. So many times was it delayed for numerous reasons. But after long periods of waiting devoted fans were finally able to see their favorite gaming platform on the big screen. Sadly the response was about as predictable as expected. Critics were unimpressed and it barely made back its budget. On the other hand, majority fans were vastly grateful for the presentation. For non-video game fans though it's somewhat a mixed bag.The positive to the film is its director and writer pair. Writing the script was Charles Leavitt and Duncan Jones. Leavitt was known for penning Blood Diamond (2006) and The Express (2008). Duncan Jones on the other hand directed Moon (2009), Source Code (2011) and is also an avid World of Warcraft gamer. With that said, it only suits that Jones directs this film. The story follows the clash of two worlds, the humans and the Orcs. The Orcs' world is dying and the only way they can survive is by taking over a new one, that being the humans. In the human world, King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) leads the way with Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). Overseeing them is sorcerer Medivh (Ben Foster) and his apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) as protectors of the human world. Leading the Orcs is Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu), who has powers that only work by draining the life force of other living things. Following him are Durotan (Toby Kebbell), Orgrim (Robert Kazinsky), Blackhand (Clancy Brown) and half-breed Garona (Paula Patton).As a start-off point to a beginning franchise, the story isn't too hard to follow. The problem in the script are because of a couple things. Since this is based on a video game, it is understood that the filmmakers will want to give fan service to its passionate gamers. Yet there are times where special nods to the in-game achievements outnumber the explanations to what is going on within certain scenes. There's no problem with giving the fans what they enjoy. However for people not familiar with the game, this can be confusing because they will not be familiar as to why particular events happen. This is one of the issues with video game movies. Gamers would rather play the game than watch and non-gamers may not understand why things happen for a distinct reason. Also there are occasional motivation flip-flops attributed to a couple of characters. This may add to the bewilderment of the viewer because of their non-gamer unfamiliarity. Even with this though, the characters are likable and are sympathetic due to their situations.Out of all actors, the best of them is Toby Kebbell as Durotan. Kebbell plays his role with strength and feeling. Durotan's arc is a challenge to watch because of how conflicted he is. Durotan knows Gul'Dan isn't a great Orc but he's the only one powerful enough to lead them to survive. It's easy to see as to why this could cause internal friction. For the humans, Lothar is the more interesting of the bunch. He's had a career in the army for a while and his skills are valuable. For action, the sequences are entertaining to watch. For a PG-13 rating, some of the violence is actually pretty brutal. The humans use weapons that belong in the dark ages such as swords and shields. The Orcs use giant over sized workman tools like axes and sledge hammers. Not even the horses and other animals are safe in the battle scenes. Individuals are stabbed, thrown and even de limbed. Effects wise, the transformation of the characters and world are done expertly well. Using motion-capture effects, the half of the cast look nothing like themselves under the Orc makeup.With technology on the rise, motion-capture has come a long way in making creatures more and more realistic. Only a couple actors can be seen under the effects. Everyone else practically disappears and that's great. The camera-work by Simon Duggan is another credible component. Unfortunately it's not clear as to what scenes actually contained real life terrain. Nevertheless the backgrounds to each scene are well constructed. Duggan is known for filming other big CGI budget films like I, Robot (2004), The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008), Killer Elite (2011) and The Great Gatsby (2013). All of which had acceptable camera-work. Music wise Ramin Djawadi composed the film score. From an audible perspective the score is engaging and has an organic sound. The makeup of it sounds like that of heavy strings and horns. This falls somewhat in line with Djawadi's past works although some have varied. Unfortunately the tracks do not have a reoccurring main theme but the tunes do match their respective scene. It has its moments even to enjoy.Storytelling wise, the script has motive flip-flops and non familiar fans may not understand certain events that happen. However the overall plot is fairly simplistic and the characters are sympathetic. The visual effects, cinematography and music are also well produced.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

First chapter of a very promising epic saga. A must see for fans.,"What is happening says more about critics then the movie itself. Don't expect them to be able to tell a masterpiece from garbage, they never did. Need to jog your memory? Here's a list of movies that critics bashed upon release, I'll leave the conclusions to you:CITIZEN KANE - ""I thought the photography quite good, but nothing to write to Moscow about, the acting middling, and the whole thing a little dull...""PSYCHO - ""Gimmicky""METROPOLIS - ""It is a technical marvel with feet of clay, a picture as soulless as the manufactured woman of its story. [...] despite the fantastic nature of the story, it is, on the whole, unconvincing""2001 A SPACE ODISSEY - ""sluggish, pretentious and artsy fartsyTHE SHINING - ""the adaptation makes little sense"", ""massacres the original vision set forth in king's novel"" (it even received 2 razzies nomination for worst director and worst actor)APOCALYPSE NOW - ""Apocalypse Now is a dumb movie that could have been made only by an intelligent and talented man.""ALL ABOUT EVE - ""Its highly polished, often witty surface hides an unenterprising plot and some preposterous human behavior.""THE WIZARD OF OZ - ""I sat cringing before [...] The Wizard of Oz, which displays no trace of imagination, good taste, or ingenuity... [...] I say it's a stinkeroo.""THE GODFATHER II* - ""It's a Frankenstein's monster stitched together from leftover parts. It talks. It moves in fits and starts but it has no mind of its own.""THE BIG LEBOWSKI - ""meandering, pointless, amounts to nothing""FIGHT CLUB - ""Rebel without a cause""FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS - ""simply unwatchable""other honorable mentions:Blade RunnerThe Rocky Horror Picture ShowAND.... (drum roll)*STAR WARS* (1977) - ""I sincerely hope that science and scientists differ from science fiction and its practitioners. Heaven help us if they don't: We may be headed for a very boring world indeed. Strip Star Wars of its often striking images and its high-falutin scientific jargon, and you get a story, characters, and dialogue of overwhelming banality, without even a ""future"" cast to them."" [...] ""O dull new world! We are treated to a galactic civil war, assorted heroes and villains, a princely maiden in distress, a splendid old man surviving from an extinct order of knights who possessed a mysterious power called ""the Force,"" and it is all as exciting as last year's weather reports.... Why, even the most exciting fight is an old-fashioned duel, for all that the swords have laser beams for blades....""I think this can be enough to get the idea, now go watch the movie and decide for yourself.As a side note, I can see how those who are not familiar with the saga universe could fail in grasping its value, and could feel bewildered, and could scorn it as ""random bulls**t"", but that's not the case, quite the opposite, Duncan knows what he's doing.For those unfamiliar with it, you need to know that the Warcraft games are a kitsch mishmash of Tolkien, Dungeons & Dragons, everything that's fantasy and sci fi and comics...you name it. All with really exaggerated and over the top aesthetics. Nonetheless it has some ""magic"" quality that hooked million of us and made us dream. So no point in complaining about the ""unrealistic armors"" or the ""derivative"" nature of it and other stuff like that. That's Warcraft, and Duncan nailed it with astonishing skill.I also believe the two really dense hours of running time are not enough to clear the nature of what is being presented (characters and motives) to newbies. What you can see as newcomers is just a glimpse of what's coming, but if you can trust the director, you're gonna enjoy it (I suspect that the 40 mins of footage that were cut out could help making it more accessible to newcomers).Warcraft is not perfect, it has flaws (like many movies we now regard as masterpieces), but it is an impressive piece of work, it's innovative, it has a soul, it's got style, it's hugely fun. It's clearly just a setup for what's coming next, and I can't wait to see the rest.btw... extended edition now!!! ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Well this is Awkward,"As someone who only tried the game once or twice or thrice, I surprisingly enjoyed this rather clunky yet strangely enjoyable film.It's a pretty straightforward narrative that it doesn't wastes its time introducing much of its world. You gotta accept whatever you see; whether it's warlocks or orcs or whatever, the movie just embraces its world and trusts the audience to follow through. It kind of makes sense why those who were familiar with the game appreciated this more than standard film critics, but again, I'm not a big fan of Warcraft, but I can get immediately invested to this fantasy world (and I like fantasy stuff.)Yeah, some moments feel a little too rushed, I don't want to use the term contrived since the movie does earn some of those moments, allowing itself to establish the arcs of these characters, but it's paced a little too quick that it doesn't spend much time to breathe for a little more gravity on its story choices. This is a big story sustained in a two hour runtime, so it's a tough choice.The aesthetics however, while often being criticized for being too video game looking (yeah, isn't it obvious?) actually looks pretty neat. At times, it looks sort of uncinematic, but the scale it provides just brings an exciting sense of adventure to it. The acting is fine, there are worse ways you can expect from a video game adaptation, but here, you can actually care for these characters.Warcraft is flawed for sure, but to what it is, it remains to be kind of fun. I can see why many aren't impressed for this film, so far, it will perplex to those who cannot dive into this mythology and again, the storytelling feels a little too quick, but the movie is careless to be concerned to those things that it has become both a benefit and a problem for its own good. As a first part of a series (hopefully) it's actually a solid try. There are problems you just can't avoid, but there are still a lot of admirable choices to appreciate, in the end.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great portrait of orcs. And solid launchpad for future films.,"Let me preface this by saying that I am probably in the 0.1% when it comes to the lore of Warcraft. I have read at least 6 of the books, played all the strategy games and quite a bit of the world of Warcraft content. Contrary to what I've mostly been hearing, this is NOT a World of Warcraft movie. The story line of Warcraft progresses linearly, WarcraftWarcraft 2Warcraft 3 The frozen throneWorld of WarcraftExpansions. This movie ONLY includes story line content from the first Warcraft, indeed none of the characters should be recognizable to a WOW fan (except the baby, if you know who that is). Warcraft has always been a very character centered story, indeed nothing happens without a character leading the action, there is no such thing as X race doing Y. Instead it is character Z leading a portion of race X to do Y. As such the movie should be judged on how well it developed its characters. On the positive side I thought the orcs were very well developed, not only do we empathize with Durotan but we also get a sense of the cultural attitudes that the orcs have, with many chieftains and constant fighting between the clans. As such the orcs are successfully portrayed as an honor culture instead of just purely barbaric, to me this is a great success and something that has never been done on screen before. Warcraft to me has established a universe that has much more potential than the Lord of the Rings if only because of the empathy one feels for both sides. On the negative side I thought the humans were a little rushed. Khadgar, the young apprentice mage had rather unnatural dialogue and the actor playing him felt a bit off at times. Lothar was also slightly underdeveloped, perhaps a little more on his relationships should have been done, especially with his son.Visual effects wise I thought the movie was amazing, the spells are truly epic and there is a real sense of scale to be felt.This is not the fantastic movie I was hoping for but it has no large overarching faults, and within the time limit it probably achieves as much as it could have, it is only a shame that it wasn't longer so that it can properly hit all on the tonal cords. However with the universe established, there is much less world building to be done for the sequels and I am craving for the legendary characters to emerge.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Movie is amazing!,"Just seen it with a bunch of friends and it was amazing. My friends who came with me aren't even Warcraft fans and they even said they can't wait for a sequel, they said it was nothing like they expected, which is another shitty fantasy movie. They were on the edge of their seats the whole time and wanting more! Whenever they'd show Easter eggs in the background i'd go nuts and they had no clue why but they were too busy being into the movie to care to ask. I CANNOT WAIT to see another one of these movies!!! I even noticed a lot of people outside the theater who have never played the games or know anything about it, loved it. I even talked with an older couple for a good 10 minutes who loved it but didn't understand a few things and i cleared it up for them, they were very thankful. They were excited for another movie too!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Was that it?...,"While I can't claim to be an overly big fan of Warcraft in any of its forms, this was still a movie that was hard to miss. I mean, given the popularity of the game franchise, this was a movie that one simply had to watch.And with it now watched, I can in all honesty say that this movie was beautiful to look at, with grand CGI effects and lots of details in most of the scenes. And I must actually commend the CGI team on the orcs, because they were really, really impressive to look at.I have played the MMORPG for about a year or so, but I can't really say that the locations in the movie were memorable to me. Perhaps because I didn't really delve all that deep into the lore of the game and the world of Azeroth.With that being said, praising the CGI, then I have to say that the story in the movie was somewhat of a flaccid one, and it was way below what I had expected from the movie. So just how well the movie catered to the hardcore fans of the Warcraft franchise, I can only speculate.The movie was entertaining enough for what it turned out to be. Don't expect anything grand of anything even remotely thespian or Shakespearian. No, this was kept very simple and very straight forward.As for the cast, well the majority of the people were doing good jobs with their given roles and were cast well enough as such. But personally then I think that Travis Fimmel was a poor choice for the lead actor. He just doesn't really possess that spark of commitment and enthusiasm that was required.""Warcraft"" is a movie that invites you to sit back in the chair, way, way back, shut down your brain and just enjoy all the pretty colors - essentially. ""Warcraft"" is entertaining, for sure, but it didn't leave me particularly impressed, nor did I think that it lived up to what it could have been. As such, then it was just another fantasy movie dressed up in impressive CGI effects.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Warcraft's success is contingent on audiences accepting Xena-style cheese in the era of Game of Thrones""","I'm a fan of Warcraft and all the games and a big fan of epic fantasy cinema. But this film misses the mark and seems like it was made without any idea of what actually makes a story engaging.The opening scene is the only time I felt engaged in this movie, bringing shivers to my spine inspiring nostalgia of dueling in front of Orgrimmar. Yet the intertextuality of that experience is one that is exclusive to only those who actually played World of Warcraft. The entire movie must look like a completely incoherent mess to anyone who doesn't share that experience.Every scene after that demolishes any hope I had of this being an enjoyable experience. It's obvious that a ton of hard work went into this film from many talented artists, technicians, and professionals, but the truth is no matter how much lipstick you put on a pig...http://www.pcgamer.com/warcraft-movie-review/",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
7/10,"It feels almost obligatory to give a disclaimer before starting this review: I have never ever had remotely anything to do with the Warcraft lore and games, I had literally no idea what the story would be. Yet, I am a very, very big fan of fantasy and Duncan Jones, and that is why I was excited to see this film, despite the negative backlash it had in its first week of reviews and let me tell you that I've rarely seen such unmotivated negativity. Despite not living up to its potential Jones and Legendary Pictures have put out a very worthy fantasy film that actually was very close to being great...up until its last ten minutes.Giving any kind of vote to this film based on its first watch is really hard and I reserve my right to change it in the future, that is because I am still conflicted in how much I liked it, which is indicative of the chaos it induces with that ending.For a solid hour and forty five minutes Duncan Jones crafts a really strong fantasy picture. The only problems it bears for that duration are minor world building problems, they don't stop the story from flowing but sporadically the film is a little too ahead of itself and gives the viewer some confusion on how the world is organized, the opening scene should have been cut full-stop, it makes no sense at all, and it also happens to be slightly mechanical, in the sense that the flow of the scenes happens to be a little repetitive after sometime: emotional scene, character development scene, action scene, repeat. It isn't really that bothering, but it was something that did occasionally take me out of the film.Yet for the rest we are presented to an interesting world with characters we feel for on both sides. The pace is very tight and I was never bored for half a second, everything that was going on I wanted to see more of. There are some moments that really sting emotionally and some others that are story turns you don't expect and with which the filmmakers have the balls to stick to which makes them even more resonant. The actors involved I did not have much faith in, but they all managed to surprise me, in particular Travis Fimmel who is channeling his inner Aragorn and excelling at it. The social dynamics explored might be a little underdeveloped, but the when you are presented with such a rich vision to sink your teeth into it doesn't really matter, the world-building overall was enchanting, I was transported to this world and that is something that is really rare in filmaking.Moreover, the effects here are game changing. The 20 months spent in post production pay off from the first frame. Starting off the success of the effects is the fact that the CGI is used correctly as a tool and not a gimmick and integrated seamlessly in what is one of the best looking and designed movies in recent years. Then on top of that you add state-of-the-art looking imagery, you are left with a film that dazzles visually without ever taking you out of it. No matter how the film will be received critically, there is no question these effects will change the game for films, but more importantly they are an example of how to use computer imagery correctly.A killer score and breath-taking, goose-bump-inducing action sequences with storytelling momentum add to the list of great stuff I was enjoying from this film. Until the last ten minutes came and I realized I wasn't going to get a pay off. Look I am fine if you want to do a trilogy of films, ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is the best film ever made (alongside its two successors) and it doesn't have an ending to the plot, but it has an ending to the story, you get emotional pay off from the characters, you get closure for the time being. Here you are promised for the first two and a half acts of tight pacing a kind of resolution but it never comes, this film is lacking a finale, there is zero payoff, none of dynamics at play are resolved. It leaves you empty, I was catching my breath in the climax and then it was all rushed to the end. It could have done with 10-15 more minutes to give us something to grasp on.Despite one of the most frustrating endings I have ever experienced, which I don't know if fault lies in the studio or the director, I was thrilled and fascinated for the major part, I still look forward to possible future films if they don't repeat this one's mistakes and I still recommend this adventure ride. As I said my grade is really unindicative at the moment as the balance between good and bad elements I still can't really figure out.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warcraft is simultaneously a successful VG adaptation and a poor stab at fantasy-action.,"Did I miss the post-showing brief?! Little exposition leaves non-WoW playing viewers in the lurch; characters, locations and the very crux on the film – the Fell – are given very little explanation of base-building. ""Our world has been destroyed"" feels cheap and lazy for the whole Horde-invading premise. This poor foundation made the remainder of the film totally uninteresting to me.The CGI is classically Blizzard-esque and the Orc scenes and settings are the best in the film – character design is colourful and engaging – they all look different. However, the same cannot be said for the Humans – beards are dyed and have such well-groomed demarcation images of the Berlin wall are conjured. Their sets feel unlived-in, clinical and tacky in a Stargate SG-1 kind of way. The casting is equally uninspired – specifically in the plucky mage turned hero – an entirely average, intellectual-type who I imagine the aforementioned players are expected to relate to. A half-breed predictably attractive and buxom female Orc also seems to play to this demographic. The villain is lame and doesn't scare me or even his Human counterparts.Don't get me wrong, fight scenes and visual effects are certainly high points in what was a drudge in mediocrity, playing far too heavily to its existing fan base.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The only movie that made me truly forget the time in the theater,"I just saw Warcraft for the first time on IMAX 3D and I truly enjoyed it. Actually, I'm planning to see it again while I can still see it on IMAX.I am familiar with the Warcraft games including Warcraft 3 and World of Warcraft, so I knew most of the characters, the world and the core of the story, the reason I went to the cinema to see it is to get immersed in the world that I like adventuring and witness the events that I have been playing/reading about for years now.I will not say Warcraft is a perfect movie or it is the best it could have been (which is why it gets an 8 from me), however it is a movie that is immersive, fast-moving, full of action; that has a soul, beautiful soundtrack, beautiful scenery and many things that will make you smile if you are a Warcraft/WoW player.I have watched dozens if not hundreds of movies in the cinema and I can honestly say that Warcraft is the only movie that made me forget the time. Like how playing WoW usually does, hehe.I was in a large/crowded room (IMAX) and I was worried that popcorn eaters and smartphone checkers would annoy me. Except for one instance which did not repeat, I was hooked by the movie from start to end and watched it without remembering any distraction from my surroundings. I believe most viewers watched it fully focused like me. When the first half ended, I didn't believe that 1 hour had already passed. The second half passed quicker because when it ended, I was thinking to myself ""this never happened to me before with any other movie"" even though some of which I enjoyed more such as Lord of the Rings, Avatar or Interstellar. After the movie ended, I stayed till the credits finished rolling because it was the first time I was listening to WoW theme in an IMAX theater, which took about 5 minutes. About 1/5th of the room (30- 40) also stayed till the credits ended and I was hearing mostly nice feedback from the audience.To me, Warcraft movie, also as its name implies, is the beginning of a long story and it felt more like a short and fully packed prelude that tries to show a lot of things within a short time. It succeeds in a sense but at some scenes I felt the transitions were very quick and some other scenes could have used more build-up. Some characters could have had more screen time and also a bit more emotional backgrounds would have amplified the tone of the story. I would think that if it was about 150-160 minutes, it might have been better. That's my opinion for sure. Either way, I think it was a great intro and I am definitely looking forward to seeing many more in the series. After LoTR and Hobbit, hopefully this will be my third favorite fantasy movie series.If you are not familiar with Warcraft universe, or never played any Warcraft games, Warcraft movie is a beautiful and enjoyable fantasy movie that I can highly recommend. If you are a Warcraft, or especially a WoW player, Warcraft movie is a movie you shouldn't miss. I'm not sure if the 3D aspect added much to the movie but if you have the option, definitely see it on IMAX.For the Alliance!",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It does the games justice,"Making a movie based on a video game is a pretty bold move, because a lot can go wrong. A game's success can trigger movie makers to create half-assed products, that only serve cash grabbing and on the other side games tend to lack enough substance to make good movies. Luckily for Warcraft the latter isn't it's case and given to the right director and writers it can become quite a quality product. Also luckily for the fans, that's exactly what happened. First of all the movie absolutely achieved to immerse me in it's fantasy world. The presentation was beautiful and fitting to it's source material. It also deserves praise for it's great CGI (which happens rarely). When battles happened I genuinely felt excited. Compared to the Hobbit trilogy (as much as I dislike to bash on one of my favourite movie makers) they didn't feel like over the top CGI-dance routines. They had risk and intensity. Though I must admit, that a certain character did have a bit too much plot armor. As far as the story goes; it was overall interesting. I enjoyed the double perspective and world building elements. There were however problems in the plot transitioning. The exposition and early phases of the movie are quite lacking. It's all too fast paced and certain points, that should have been explained more thoroughly earlier only got to me after they kept bringing them up as the plot progressed. The acting was pretty good and you could sense some dedication within the portrayals of the characters. While the story was not too heavily character driven, they did deliver in being somewhat interesting to stick around with. Warcraft may not be the best fantasy film that came out, it however knows what it wants to be and gives it's fans, what they wanted to see. If you're not a Warcraft fan, you will likely have some trouble immersing yourself in this world at the get go, maybe it won't happen at all, but even then I find you could get some fun out of the impressive (while cartoon-y) CGI and the exciting action scenes.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I actually like it,"I do not know anything about the story line or video game cause I have never played. But as someone who doesn't understand the history of it I thought it was pretty good. The special effects were great (a few times you saw some errors) and the movie did not go as I expected. The acting was par however, Paula Patton did great but I felt the others were not on her level. I actually like this more then X-Men Apocalypse to be honest.

A truly wonderful movie.,This movie is incredible. After seeing the first movie I have to say we will definitely in the oncoming movies see a rising Arthas fall to evil. Incredibly well done.

AMAZING spectacle but seriously flawed storytelling,"As a Warcraft fan since 1995 who has closely followed the development of this movie over the last year.POSITIVESThe CGI is SUPERB.The action is GREAT. Some of the best I've ever seen.The cinematography is GREAT, many individual shots are very effective.The props are fine.The acting is mostly fine.NEGATIVESLousy writingLousy editingVERDICT:Storytelling: 3/10Spectacle: 10/10Overall: 6/10CRITIQUE: There are plenty of sequences that are compelling but other sequences have some of the most ham-fisted dialog I have ever seen. Like a soap opera, like a 12 year old wrote it, really cringeworthy Star Wars prequel level stuff. There's a lot of it and it's frankly embarrassing to watch. It's told/edited in a very clumsy and confusing way. Some parts make very little sense. There is nothing wrong with the story per se. Sure it's simple but simple stories can be good if they are properly focused and well presented. Warcraft isn't. It fails to explain/introduce some things that are important while at other times it repeats obvious and irrelevant points several times over that could have been conveyed in more subtle ways. ""Yeah, I get it"" scenes.But here's the strange thing: the spectacle is so good that it's worth seeing. It's so good I actually want to go see it again, in 2D this time, maybe even more than once. I think something like X-Men Apocalypse is a better ""film"", but it isn't spectacular in the way Warcraft is. Same with The Jungle Book, which I'd rate 9/10 but I feel no need or desire to see it again, but I do with Warcraft. I'll just have to cringe through a lot of it.If they make a sequel, which I hope, I hope they will have confidence in the movie and give it a longer running time so they can tell a fully developed story. But they really, really need to improve the crappy writing and editing. If they had done a competent job with that this would have been a truly great movie because everything else about it is good.I do think a director's cut could significantly improve the film. This isn't just speculation, I know they have cut good scenes because there was footage that leaked a year ago from San Diego Comic Con and there were several sequences just in that 4 minute clip that are not in the movie:These are the kind of ""slow"" establishing scenes the movie desperately needed more of, because these characters are hardly introduced. We haven't gotten to really know the characters before they start doing stuff so we don't care.A director's cut with those and other scenes restored would be a significantly better movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Deserving of multiple sequels.,"While perhaps hard to spot for the many, this movie does hold messages, even if for the few.
Messages that resonate through the world of fantasy. There aren't many movies like this,
chiseled to perfection. There is a S T O R Y told, even as I am unfamiliar with the lore of
World of Warcraft, I can see clearly that critics have been manipulative tools.
It is insane to think poorly of this movie.I think I've watched it about 4 times now and I always get sucked in for the journey, almost
as if watching it for the first time again. Even though I can remember the next scene, I enjoy
the emotions, the pacing, the acting. Just impeccable acting, great choices with the cast.
The CGI leaves short for words. A quality movie.One that will be rediscovered again and again.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A great watch to relax and dive into with FANTASTIC CGI,"I played the games what must've been 15 odd years ago, and just the snippets I remember about the lore and the stakes really translated to this movie. Yep, its complete fanservice to fans of the game, but also I LOVED the way they didn't skimp on the brutality of the action, I was surprised they didn't issue a higher rating for the frankly, if you think about it, horrific endings some of the alliance humans end up with.The CGI must be commended, its really quite good and very believable. Yes, the story is very simplistic, DONT try to compare it to lord of the rings like almost all the critics, its a different movie and a different goal. The music and the stakes really help get the otherwise uninvested to enjoy themselves, but don't walk into this expecting a critically acclaimed movie. This is something to turn off, delve into a new fantasy world and let it take you along for the journey, with the characters whist basking in the CGI.People bag on the acting but lets be real, you didn't come here for the academy awards, you came here for the big badass human VS orc showdown with a hint of Warcraft nostalgia.For what this movie is, if you're a fan of the games or a fan of grand fantasy, I think you'll like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nonsensical garbage - Don't waste your time,"I'm not a video game person but I do recognize a good story line, plot development and characters. This movie has none of the above. Sure, it's visually appealing but if you're paying the slightest bit of attention, it's obvious that this is nothing but fluff. LOTR was amazing until the last movie. This is in line with that bit of refuse. Had I known, I never would've wasted my time watching this. My energies would've been much better spent watching online porno. The story line is difficult at best. The characters are none appealing and probably deserve the peril that should be around every corner. Instead of peril, there's too much character development of characters who are truly awful. There is no justification to watch this movie ever.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely worth the watch,"I watched the whole movie and I was engaged in the story. The animation is cool. The orcs are nasty, huge, scary warriors, kind of like klingons or vikings on huge amounts of steroids. Importantly, some of the orcs are noble and honourable, but most of them are consumed by their loyalty to the evil sorcerer orc. So basically this is a fundamental story about good vs evil and about how it's never too late to do the right thing and that there is always hope. The choice of Travis Fimmel as Anduin Lothar gives earth and the humans a great warrior to fight the orcs. Generally, I liked the whole casting. Good bad guys and good guys. Probably I would really have loved the movie when I was a child or teenager. As a 45 year old I rate it 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Entertaining movie but the ending threw me,"First off, I don't play World of Warcraft, so maybe take this with a grain of salt.I went into this movie not expecting all that much- lots of fighting, lots of CGI, and not a whole lot of plot- but I left thinking 'huh. That was actually quite good?' While yes, there WAS lots of fighting, and yes, at times the CGI felt too much, the plot was actually cohesive and it was a massively entertaining movie to watch. The settings were deliciously detailed, the costumes were fun, POC were included, and the fighting was epic. What more could I want from a summer blockbuster? As the characters cheered, I smiled in my seat, as things went bad (as they often do in movies like this) I felt angry along with the main players, when they cracked jokes I laughed along. It was FUN. It was GOOD. I wanted more, and then- It ended? The ending honestly threw me off and is effecting the overall score I gave it. I was into it, things were heating up big time and crazy things were happening, but then it was over? The ending had no warning, and did not leave me satisfied. Honestly, they only needed to add ten minutes to wrap some things up and make sure that we (the audience) knew that the end was nigh, but we didn't get that, and I left confused, puzzled, and without closure. All of that aside though, it really was an enjoyable romp of a movie and I expect fans of the game will highly enjoy it, along with open minded main stream viewers.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Probably the worst film I've ever seen,"The fact that this film currently has a 7.5/10 on IMDb genuinely astonishes me. What we have here is what you get when a film is made by a group with a good budget and absolutely no idea how to make movie.The scenes are short and disjointed, so much so that comprehending the story line is like being on a speeding train, trying to observe the passing landscape through a hole the size of your fist. Blizzard's story telling has always been shoddy, and this film is no exception.The special effects are inconsistent. Yeah, the orcs look pretty cool, but so many other effects look as cheap as the guy next door's LARP costume (the night elves standout in my memory as horrendous.)I'm a long time Warcraft fan (WC2 → WC3 → WoW,) and the references to the games were so thin that it hurt. This is a film with absolutely no subtly. Yeah, that's the murloc sound. Hilarious.Over the course of two hours, there were very few redeeming qualities. For the most part, it was an absolute affront to the senses and sensibilities. Anyone who appreciates a film for its writing and cinematographic qualities should avoid this film like the plague, or risk being enraged and offended at the butchery Warcraft does to these arts.If I wasn't with friends I would have walked out of the theater.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Surprisingly good up until the muddled ending,"PROS:
Generally good CGI, except for giant orcs riding stolen (normal-sized) horses, and the council ""elves"" (or whatever) -- both looked very fake. The soundtrack was unobtrusive, which I appreciated.The story was OK and there were some fun (and quite vivid) characters. Paula Patton is GREAT as Garona, who seems to be some sort of human-orc hybrid. In other words, she's human enough to not require CGI, and her outfits provide welcome fan-service. But I liked her acting/character; she steals every scene she's in. It's also nice to see Ruth Negga here.It's obvious that many folks put in a LOT of effort to make this a decent film. They partially succeeded.CONS:
Some clumsy pacing and sloppy editing. The movie starts to lose its way in the final act, going for spectacle but becoming less and less believable (and more like a video game). The ending is crippled by a (studio?) directive to leave the door WIDE open for a sequel; it feels quite forced (to a non-WoW player, but maybe this achieves better game continuity).Travis Fimmel (playing Anduin Lothar) wasn't 100% believable IMHO, but that's a nitpick.I rate this at seven stars, with a half-star bonus for Paula Patton, a one-star penalty for the unsatisfying (and obviously contrived) ending, and a half-star penalty for being forgettable (except for Paula Patton). That's six (6) stars total.PS:
The characters were vivid enough to sell the movie, but NOT deep enough to sell a sequel using a soap-opera-style misunderstanding. That pitch is a swing-and-a-miss.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A spectacularly beautiful, but rough around the edges fantasy superhero movie.","Just finished watching the movie. As a major fan of the Warcraft universe and a big Blizzard fanboy, here is my wall of text:I have to applaud the attempt at bringing this movie to life. Similar to Civil War having a ton of characters, the insanely detailed and rich lore of Warcraft is incredibly hard to fit into a 2 hour screen time. However, unlike Civil War, Warcraft isn't that well glued together and suffers from many things a lot of critics have mentioned. Nevertheless, I think the movie has received an unfair amount of bashing and is definitely a good video game movie which follows the source material closely.I'll start of by saying that the CGI and the motion capture is amazing. Every single orc looks unique, moves and fights appropriately for their size and is menacing just like they are supposed to be. Lord of the Rings orcs are a joke compared to these bad boys. The true Orc stars are of course Durotan (the wise, young Frostwolf clan chieftain) and Gul'dan (the sinister, demonic warlock), who each shine in their own way. Durotan is probably the best developed character in the movie and his facial expressions are jaw dropping. Gul'dan is evil incarnate. The way he sucks the souls out of his victims is flat out terrifying.The magic in this movie is of the hook, balls to the wall, full throttle powerful. It is spectacular and a breath of fresh air compared to the lackluster, weaksauce magic you get in Harry Potter and other movies. The sorcery action clearly establishes that mages are by far the most dangerous and lethal people (and orcs) to walk Azeroth. I was afraid I was going to hate Khadgar when I saw the trailers, but surprisingly he ends up being rather compelling. The human armor is interesting, colorful and exactly what you would expect from a human army in this universe.While the armor is beautiful and shiny, some people wearing it aren't colorful enough personalities to make it work. The king, played by Dominic Cooper, is dull, uninspiring and is unreasonably friendly and naive (just like his Queen) when it comes to the interaction with the orcs. To me it felt unrealistic that both would be so open and friendly with Garona. A lack of prejudice on the human side made that side of the conflict seem too mellow, pacifist and boring in some cases. It is clear that a lot of hatred of the orcs was cut out of the movie (there is 30-40 minutes more available in the directors cut) since it was present in the trailers. This is a shame, since racial prejudice has always been a big part of the Warcraft lore. That makes the team up moments much more sweet when they actually happen.Other characters, specifically Medivh, Garona and Lothar are reasonable, but lack anything particularly interesting about them. They work for the movie but the performances could have been better. Specifically Lothar didn't get enough time to develop his relationship with his family. Everyone could have used a couple more minutes to give them more spice.The pacing in the movie, as mentioned before by many other reviewers, is bad. There is a bit too much jumping around from point A to point B, making each individual scene have less of an impact. As a result, the movie is not grounded enough to have proper world building, which in my opinion was what made the first LOTR movie so good. As such, a lot of mystery and wonder is lost because the movie doesn't leave the audience enough time to process what have happened. The movie has a lot of magic, but the magic of subtlety is not one of them.While flawed in many ways, I think this a decent first attempt by Blizzard to get into the movie business. What is great about Warcraft is that it doesn't follow a lot of terrible and boring Hollywood clichés. The Orcs are much more than just useless idiots, as they are an actual people with feelings and code of honor. The movie is bold with its plot (thanks to the story being bold) and these risks taken make it much more enjoyable. The fact that Marvel is playing it too safe with their characters is one of my greatest pet peeves.Warcraft has stunning visuals and a couple of very great and touching moments, but suffers from a story that is too rapid fire. 7/10 for me (and 7/10 for non fans also, if anything me knowing the story makes me more critical). Hopefully this movie gets the money and we get a sequel. The potential is there to get a great one.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Warcraft: The Beginning is very good entertaining fantasy movie with awesome special effects that anyone in your family can actually see and feel connected to,"As a Warcraft fan, I was very pleased with the final product and I really think this is a good movie. I won't get into details about the movie, as I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but I can say a few things:Story -Although the story of the movie is not 100% faithful to the original lore, the changes made are plausible and were laid out in a consistent and credible way; -This movie is about a fantasy world, and as a fantasy story, I am of the opinion that this is a very good story, very entertaining and immersive; -There were loads of funny moments, with fairly-cliché jokes and lots of easter eggs for the fanbase; -I think that Duncan Jones did an overall very good work with the script and directing the movie, he made choices and some people might like them, others won't, but solid story and acting nonetheless;Acting -The main characters in the film were very personable and while some people might relate more with Durotan, Orgrim or Draka, and others will relate more with Lothar or Garona, all the audience can relate to some character because they have the same sort problems real people have on a daily basis – as I said, they're personable; -On the other end of the spectrum, the ""bad guys"" (Blackhand, Gul'dan) are typical bad guys but Ben Foster was quite good at fleshing out Medivh's fight between his good and bad (corrupt) sides; -I'm not going to pretend I'm a huge expert in acting and have the ability to say what is and isn't good acting, but I can say if I felt actor A or actress B performed in a way that I felt was convincing or portrayed the character in a way it made me like that character. With that said, my personal opinion is that Paula Patton surprised me with Garona and I loved every scene of Rob Kazinsky's Orgrim. The character I liked the most was Khadgar, closely followed by Gul'dan and Durotan. So kudos to Ben Schnetzer, Daniel Wu and Toby Kebbel, you made credible and strong performances. A word of appreciation to Tom Clancy, Ruth Negga and Anna Galvin, I would've liked to have seen more of Blackhand, Lady Taria and Draka, respectively; -In parallel, I felt Dominic Cooper and Travis Fimmel to be a bit disconnected as I couldn't really feel much connection to King Llane and Lothar, respectively;Pace -The pace of the movie is quite fast, which can lead to some people who aren't familiar with the lore to feel a bit lost here and there. However, one has to understand that the movie is based on a story that was written over many books and whenever you make any movie based on a book, there is no other way than stripping out a lot of detail from the book(s), else you'd have a 10h-long movie. The same thing happened with Lord of the Rings trilogy, where a lot of fans criticized the movie for only showing a very small amount of what was in the book; -For the same reason, there are several points in the movie where scenes were laid out to support sequels and those are obvious for those who know the lore, and left the feeling that this will lead somewhere for those who don't. I think this was a good move, this movie literally screams for sequels. Yes, I used plural, one sequel is not enough;Graphics -I deliberately left this aspect to the end because I think it is a cornerstone of this movie. There's only one way I can define the CG used in the movie and that is: AMAZING! No, seriously, I always thought to myself and said it many times – if the guys doing the movie get the Orcs right, they already won. And that's EXACTLY what happened in this movie. The orcs are simply AWESOME! They look real, credible, even in scenes with hundreds/thousands of orcs, and surprisingly personable! You can easily relate with these huge beasts who are very aggressive and all, but happen to have feelings; -The magic in the movie is absolutely amazing and credible, I wish we had magic effects like this in-game! This was extremely surprising, it's so much better than any other magic effects I've seen in any other movie, ever!; - The landscapes are breathtaking, to say the least. Even if you don't know the locations, they're still very eye-candy; -I would go as far as saying that ILM did such a good job on the CGI that Warcraft: The Beginning's graphics are probably the best I've ever seen in any movie, definitely better than the ones we saw on movies like Avatar or Planet of the Apes;Sound -All the music and sound effects are top notch, especially the tone of the Orcs' voice, really thundering strong voices!For all of the reasons stated above, I'd say this is quite a good movie to see and I will definitely see it more than once. If I would advise anyone to do anything, was to go see the movie and form your own opinion. You might agree or disagree entirely or partially with me, this is just my personal opinion. But please don't dispute anything said above if you haven't seen the movie yourself. Criticizing something lacking knowledge, just based on someone else's opinion is just plain stupid.Yes, it wasn't the most enlightening movie of all time that changed my life entirely from a philosophical standpoint, it's not an Oscar/Grammy/whatever awards you prefer contender, but it's definitely a very good entertaining fantasy movie with awesome special effects that anyone in your family can actually see and feel connected to.For that, I'd give it a solid 7/10 rating and advise everyone to go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warcraft is surprisingly good,"Considering the reviews Warcraft: The Beginning has received and the general consensus of thinking that video game based movie aren't very good, I was fully expecting to see some what of a cinematic pan cake. Surprisingly enough, Warcraft works pretty well. It's no LOTR mind you, but it is relatively entertaining, at places a bit cheesy, fantasy flick with pretty good special effects.Warcraft is at its best when it revolves around the orcs. The humans are really the weak link of the whole thing, as very few of the actors chosen feel that they don't fit in a fantasy setting like this. A Finnish director Markku Pölönen said once, that some people have epoch faces and some do not. By that he meant, that certain people suit better on a movie set in the past (or in a fantasy world), where as some just look too modern. Most of the human actors here feel a bit too modern for the setting. Also the writing on the humans side feels more rushed.But the orcs. Now they're fantastic. They're gigantic beast, with tusks and huge weapons in their hands, riding on over sized wolves (or wargs, I'm not really sure, as I'm not huge Warcraft guy). The orcs themselves aren't really evil at all, they're just misguided by the fell magic using Gul'Dan. In any case, the movie just seems to work better every time there's orcs on scree, be it Durotan, Garona or Gul'dan.The pacing of the story is also a one big issue. It's easy to see, that there's a lot of story material been cut out from the movie and that really feels like it's hurting the overall experience. Some additional material might even make the humans feel more compelling as well, but now there's no real connection to them here, as the story keeps jumping quite a bit.Anyhow, Warcraft really isn't even half as bad some sources have touted it as. It's relatively easy to follow for even a person like me, who played the original RTS game years ago and has only skimmed WOW briefly before getting bored with it. At times it did feel like it expected me to be more familiar with the franchise than I am, but in all it still is fun.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually Stunning Journey into the Epic World of the Beloved Video Game Franchise,"Warcraft is a visually stunning film that brings the beloved video game franchise to life. With epic battles, intricate lore, and impressive CGI, it immerses viewers in a world teeming with fantastical creatures. The production design and visual effects are meticulous, creating breathtaking landscapes and captivating visuals. While the story can be complex for newcomers, the strong performances from the cast, including Travis Fimmel and Toby Kebbell, anchor the narrative. Warcraft explores themes of honor, sacrifice, and the blurred lines between good and evil. It successfully portrays the clash between human and orc civilizations, delving into their struggles and complexities. The film strikes an emotional chord, highlighting the desire for unity and understanding. Fans of the franchise will appreciate the references and attention to detail, while newcomers can still enjoy the grand battles and immersive world. Director Duncan Jones's love for the source material shines through. Warcraft is a visually impressive and enjoyable cinematic experience for fans and fantasy enthusiasts alike.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What were the critics thinking!?,"""Warcraft"" is directed by underrated director Duncan Jones, who brought us ""Moon"" (2009) and ""Source Code"" (2011). Both films are very underrated and so is ""Warcraft"".I saw the movie yesterday with a friend and honestly I didn't know what to expect of it. Many critics were hating on the film but it was directed by Duncan Jones, so how bad could it really be? Walking out of the theater I was very satisfied with the movie.Jones brings the Warcraft world to the big screen beautifully. I never got into the game and never even played it so I don't know a thing about the universe or the world itself. With ""Warcraft"" you don't have to know/play the game to enjoy the movie because Jones does such a good job bringing the universe to you and doesn't leave you hanging. Throughout the film I couldn't help but feel this ""Lord of the Rings"" (2001; 2002; 2003) kind of vibe.The film feels that way because the structure and the universe of the film very well resembles that of ""The Lord of the Rings"". One thing I must say is that the motion capture and CGI for the film is spectacular. Everything looks real and has beautiful detail.The movie plays the clichéd romance which felt very cheesy considering that the two characters didn't have that much in common and it was truly just poor writing. At times you can see where the CGI and actors differ very drastically, but considering how great the movie looks with all this CGI you can't help but let it slide. There were times where I laughed/giggled at serious or dramatic moments in the film. It felt cheesy and kind of cringe worthy.For a film to be called ""Warcraft"" you should expect a lot of combat and boy do you get it. I was actually surprised how violent the film was since it had a PG-13 rating. You see limbs get blown up and cut off, and bones being broken, and I love it. You feel the force and power that the film has during its combat scenes. At times I even did an ""OOOHHH!"" during a fight scene.The performances in the film are good to say the least, they're nothing spectacular but they fit for the film itself. The protagonist of the film is a cool character who I enjoyed seeing on the screen but I couldn't help but feel that his character was very underdeveloped. Toby Kebbell who voiced the main orc of the film was by far the most interesting and relate-able character of the entire film; and he's not even human! You cared much for the character and what was going to happen to him.The film has an issue with the human characters. Whenever we transition back to the humans I couldn't help but feel that the film slowed down drastically. The characters of the humans are very uninteresting and nothing new. Plus, they were at times boring. But whenever we went back to the orcs the film picked up its pace because the characters of the orcs are much more well developed, and they were simply more interesting than the humans. I cared much more about the orcs than the humans.Overall ""Warcraft"" is a solid film by director Duncan Jones, but critics tend to disagree with a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Honestly the critics got it wrong this time, I don't know why but they just did. If you're looking for a fun, harmless, Summer movie ""Warcraft"" is definitely the one to go see.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not bad,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Warcraft"" (2016) is a one OK / nice movie to see it in a movie theater for those who didn't play the games and couldn't spell one of many bizarre names of characters in this movie (i'm one of those). Special effects were good, nothing groundbreaking, but good. The weakest part of this movie for me was Travis Fimmel acting. That has to be one of the most uninspiring performances (which should have been inspiring) in big budget movies ever - he just went trough all movie with one face expression - even when something very dramatic happened - he was just staring at the screen, with no emotions visible. They need to re- cast the main actor in a sequels, if there will be any. And sorry Paula Patton, almost every time you went on screen with that ultra-bizarre looking haircut and make-up, i started to smile. The story was quite OK - like i said i only played one of the very first games, so all the characters for me were unknown, and many of them remained unknown after the movie. As not a fan i can say, this movie won't be as much impressive to see it at home, so if you want to spend 2 hours and see some OK flick on Friday evening, ""Warcraft"" is for you, but don't expect to be blown away.Overall, ""Warcraft"" is nicely paced movie, which at running time 2 hours made me to watch at my watch only once - and it was in a scene were some mags were fighting. Performances were between low and OK - better cast highly recommended for sequels (altough there was one very short cameo - i won't spoil anything, but this great actor / actress should have been more on screen - it's the biggest star of this movie for sure). ""Warcraft"" is a one nice flick to see it once on a big screen, and for home media - extended version is recommended (if there will be one), because the strange thing but this movie wasn't predictable overall, and there even were some glimpses for a great, epic movie, but on it's running time 2 hours the story didn't had enough room i guess. So - it's a OK flick for those who haven't play the games, and it wasn't as bad as critics said.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Imbalance on several fronts, though the technical finesse and stronger characters carry ""Warcraft"" to the level of amicable journey.","When the opening scene tells the story of Orcs in grand fashion, the wait for a true great game based movie seems to be over. However, the momentum doesn't translate to the human side, which prances about from one city to the next with heavy jargon and too many pinches of random magic. The hope is not completely gone as some characters still manage to deliver good scenes when given spotlight, but majority of the movie is spent in drab narrative.The orc side is definitely better, the warring clan is immediately appreciable with incredible use of special effect marvel and simple yet effective motivation. Toby Kebbell as Durotan is a right choice for the leader role, this is a character whose charisma and personality audience would invest in the most.Human fares much worse. The focus towards complex magic is not an interesting direction, yet the movie spends nearly half of its runtime with characters babbling about prophecies and dark forces. It also, commendably, tries to give political sense to the whole thing, yet it barely establishes anything and those wanting elf or other races might have to content with much less.Travis Fimmel as Lothar does his best, and to be fair, he exhibits an enigmatic role as Ragnar from Vikings series. Lothar is another case, it's like forcing Jack Sparrow to be ordinary pirate, but Fimmel at least gives a signature poise to it. Paula Patton as the half orc Garona is perhaps the more intriguing female, she has the balance between frailty and a brave front for survival. These two carry the scenes momentarily.Fortunately, the special effect and fights are done with considerable effort, but its liberal use of blue magic is numbing. There's a few attempts for humor or fantasy troupes, and these often come across as generic or simply distracting. While the emotional weight seems sparse, the world looks dashing enough, at least for cosmetic purpose.As a portal to Azeroth, ""Warcraft"" is definitely flawed, although it's sufficiently presentable for a fantasy spectacle. It is, sadly, won't reach the greatness of Lord of the Rings, which it will be inevitably compared to, or the height the fans want.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I feel bad for those looking forward to this film,"I saw an advanced screening last night, and was terribly disappointed. A little background on me: I've played every major Warcraft release, and dedicated years to WoW. I'm not new to the history and lore of the Warcraft universe. That being said, the writing in this film is awful. I don't care about changes from the source material. The issues in the script were dialogue, plot holes, and scenes that existed for no plausible reason. Also, the humans in this film are sub par at best in acting. Sadly, it seems all the talent was used on the orc side, hidden behind mountains of cg. Speaking of, the only two compliments I can give to this film are that it was beautiful to look at, and the soundtrack was impressive.Whether you are an old hand at the universe or completely new to it, avoid this movie. I saw it for free and still regretted wasting the 2 hours I spent watching it.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sequel Please!,"Lets starts with the positives!1. The visuals were beautiful, something which blew me away. The Orcs looked amazing as did the magic and backgrounds. Was amazing to see locations from the game on the big screen. All looked stunning. Nothing ever seriously felt out of place CGI wise to me. Fight scenes between the races were great.2. The acting was well done and the characters were interesting, even if they all had little screen time to themselves. Personally my favourite was Khadgar. I wasn't sure what to expect from Ben from the trailers, but I feel he brought the character to life perfectly well! Gul'Dan made a great and chilling villain also. A villain that I just loved to hate!3. Great and unique story filled with plenty of drama and action. The ending was very open, a little dulled down after all the action but it did it's job and makes me want to see more!My issues with the film were:1. Needed to be longer. By at least an hour. So much is trying to be told in one go that at times it did feel the story and characters weren't as developed as they could potentially have been. While the characters were interesting and fun to watch I felt that, as I said before, they needed a lot more screen time to get to know them and their issues even better. 2 hours just wasn't enough time. I could definitely see this being a problem to newcomers. It's almost like you're finally getting into the story and really starting to empathise and then woosh! New story to follow with new characters! I was never that confused since I am a fan of the games, but again, it may be hard for newcomers.2. King Llane... To an extent. Dominic's performance wasn't bad, but but I feel that he could have been a little more assertive as a King. It sometimes felt as though he was holding back a little but hey, perhaps this was just due to the lack of screen time and an inability to get to know his character well.3. A character that was blatantly put there as a plot device. Those who have seen the film all know who I'm talking about.Overall: Damn, I want a sequel! A wonderful start to introducing Warcraft! Just make sure the next one is longer, please ;)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This was extremely entertaining.,"I read the lowest ranked metacritic review and it's honestly all bs. This movie was extremely entertaining. The acting was good, the CGI was top notch, and as someone who knows absolutely 0 about WoW the world building was perfect. The beginning of the movie was fast but not rushed, and I'm sure those who know more of the backstory would be fine with the pace. At this point the only down side is the fact that, as of right now, there's no sequel in sight. The movie does end on a slight cliffhanger but it's the perfect setup for a sequel. I really hope someone revisits this because it was so sooo good.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flawed, but enjoyable. Ignore the Ebertian Inquisitors.","Going into this with no prior knowledge, no reviews and only by my previous experience of playing the games I went in with cautious optimism and what I got was a solid action fantasy, with well defined characters and admittedly simple story, but kept the film grounded, so when I eventually checked out the reviews I was really taken aback by how negative they were and after carefully looking through them, I hate to say it, but there is clear biases, they wanted to hate this movie, I even saw one review compare it to Battlefield Earth, BATTLEFIELD EARTH!?! Really? I concede Warcraft is no masterpiece but its no where near the ineptitude of Battlefield Earth and there are unfair comparisons to Lord of the Rings, this isn't that kind of movie, it actually reminds me a lot of Conan the Barbarian(original). Now like I said, it is flawed, I found some of the scene transitions didn't flow as smoothly as it should, so there are obvious cuts they made to keep the movie confined in its run time, but I can't help but think it could've really done with them scenes in so i expect a directors cut in the near future, also and this is a double edge sword mind, the movie does rely on the audience being familiar with the lore and world, but I think the casual moviegoer would get a kick out of this without prior knowledge. The CGI was impressive and the action scenes were top notch, I even felt like I was in the games and even took a lot of risks and went into surprisingly different directions. I highly recommend it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Low expectations, positive surprise","I went into watching this movie, when it came out on Netflix, with very low expectations, as I had heard a lot of bad reviews from WoW/Warcraft fans and enthusiasts, as myself.This movie really surprised me positively, however, and I don't understand the hate this movie has been getting. It really went through the most important parts of the First War in a well-executed way with decent acting and great visuals.I am definitely hyped for the next movie, which I hope they'll release.If you're a fan of the Warcraft story or just fantasy in general, this is a must-watch imo.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"This is for the fans, non-players of the game, best of luck.","So I've literally just got back from seeing the movie. Maybe a bad idea as the hype is still on my mind, but regardless.First of all, ignore the critics who are saying ""Disaster"" and ""tragedy"". They are wrong. If you were ever anticipating this film and then were put off by all the horrendous reviews, go see it. Make your own opinion of it.THE GOOD:The CGI, holy Christ was it good, especially on the Orcs. The magic used in the film is super pretty as well.Combat scenes. Admittedly there are a few interactions between the Mo-cap Orcs and Humans that look a bit clumsy. But that aside, and the fighting is everything you'd hope for in a Warcraft movie.The Story. There are a fair few deviations from the lore that I wasn't particularly on-board with, but in the grander scale it doesn't really affect the outcome of the story. But there is one pretty significant change that was an ""interesting"" decision. You'll know what I mean when you see it.Characters. Now this is kind of a double edged sword. Whereas Lothar's son feels like an incredibly un-needed character. Ben Schnetzer's Khadgar was great, probably the most evolved of the characters at the films end.Fanservice. There is a tonne of Easter eggs in this film. And I mean, a tonne. I won't give any away, but I'm sure I missed a decent handful. Most of them are nice and subtle, but a few characters that you'd recognise are placed in the background and did briefly draw me out of the scene at hand.The Horde. This isn't even down to me being a Horde player, but as the film fairly depicts both sides of the events of ""The First War"", I personally found much more interest in the Horde. I was fangirling pretty hard seeing Durotan and Orgrim converse, seeing baby Thrall, watching Gul'Dan be a dick, it was great. The brutality of the original horde is communicated extremely well through their sheer barbarism. Not to say that the Alliance side of things was boring, there was just definitely some very two-dimensional characters within the Alliance that made their side much less intriguing.THE BAD:The Pacing. Now this, was the worst trait of the film by far. It is made incredibly unclear in the film how much time has passed and you are jumping between several narratives and just as one starts to come clear, you jump to another. In what was a 2 hour film, it probably should've been given another hour to calm its pace and give time to expose more of the lore to the non-gamers of Warcraft.Script. Now, as a screen writing student, this is the thing I look to please me most in films. And although I put it under ""The Bad"", that's not to say it was awful. It just definitely wasn't good. The overall tone of the film is surprisingly dark and that is perceived relatively well. But there are some debatable one-liners in the film and just moments where you're like ""Yeah, he wouldn't have said that"".Continuity. This wasn't a major issue as it was small things. One moment, an Orc is speaking common, but in the next scene struggles to understand the human language and speaks Orcish again.Duration. Too short. Way too short. Trying to force feed the audience with all the Lore pre and during Warcraft: Orcs and Humans was never gonna work in a 2 hour movie. Had it been like an hour longer they could've slowed the pacing which would've probably made this the perfect video-game movie.VERDICT:The inevitable happened with this film. This film is made for the players. Although the intention was to open the story up to everyone, for me, it worked, as a long-time player, I immediately picked it up and fell in love, yet my friends who are non-players came out like, well it was pretty, but who was this, why did this happen, etc.I can understand where SOME reviewers were coming from with their confusion in the film and its jumbled attempt to convey a hugely dense amount of lore into a 2 hour movie. I'm glad some people were impressed enough to give it 8's and 9's. To me, this film definitely had its flaws. But, this is certainly not a bad film. Although non-players will most likely not attract to the story and it may seem hugely confusing as you are overwhelmed with lore, it's certainly a beautiful film in its visuals.Alas, if you are a fan of Warcraft no matter how big or small, you should see this film, watching the characters and universe you've known for the past two decades finally come to life in stunningly beautiful aesthetics is something that no fan of this franchise could hate.I liked it enough that I will be going to see it again, hopefully to find more of the Easter eggs I missed in the first run. Also, who doesn't want to see a Lich King movie?",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The grass ain't always greener...,"This is a film that I had highly anticipated since its first trailer was released; not because I'm a big Warcraft fan (never played the game) but because Duncan Jones has a nasty habit of making great films. Moon was an intriguing watch with plenty of nods to Kubrick and Source Code was an extremely entertaining Sci-Fi/Action tale, so what's the worst that could happen?... Warcraft is the answer you were looking for. Warcraft is an abysmal attempt at storytelling and it seems that the only thing the film sets out to achieve (and does so successfully) is setting up a sequel. The film can be forgiven for the CGI-fest that it is, it's based on a game and the scale that the film is operating on likely lends itself more to the green screen. However what it can't be forgiven for is a script that seems like its right out of some poor sod's fan fiction. There are lines in this film that are hard to believe got past the first draft let alone made it to the big screen, the 'no he's not/yes he is' argument between Lothar and Garona was head-in-hands embarrassing. It's difficult to blame the actors for simply going through the motions when the material they had to work with was p*ss-poor... but not that difficult. The acting was reminiscent of a back-alley stage production and made me want to disassociate with any humans on screen in favour for their Orc counterparts. It's hard to believe that there was more life to be found in the motion-captured Orcs than in any human equivalent but beggars can't be choosers. The one major positive that comes from this film is that Duncan Jones proves that it is possible to translate games to the big screen. There is a tangible sense that you are watching a game, from the camera angles that are evocative of cut-scenes during game play to the shallow dialogue and convenient plot points, it's unsurprising that many hardcore Warcraft fans enjoy this film. The problem is that where this should have been a film about a game and it became a film of a game. It's all too similar to sitting down at a friend's house and watching him play a game for two hours, the fun's going to dry up after about 30 minutes and this is exactly what happened here. I would only recommend this to those that are fans of the source material... and perhaps not a fan of film",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Hype is real in this video game film,"I really love on how they deliver the movie base on the game Warcraft human vs orcs.

They had to start somewhere,"Who doesn't love Blizzard? It always seemed, everything they touched turned to pure gold. With huge success of Diablo, Warcraft and Starcraft franchises, it always seemed they could not do no wrong. In this case, despite the movie being very decent in its genre, comparing to the current golden age of ""comic book\fantasy\sci-fi"" cinematography, it certainly does not stand out, as per usual Blizzard standards.The good. The world of Azeroth finally came to life outside of computer screen. The orcs are gorgeous and deep. Despite the excellent game-like action sequences, the movie focuses a bit on a back story (especially the orcs) which I enjoyed very much, as it feels a bit different than usual, all-action choreographed sequence ""Avengers"" style. It felt like computer game came to life, and that's what we like anyhow. Especially from the Orc side of battles. On top of that the motives of few noble ors, are explained and shown to the perfection. I am a series fan, so it was easy for me to connect the dots in the story. Simply Incredible CGI.The bad. As could be expected, the human acting would fail vs the green screen. First of all, young is not always better! The actors look way too young for their parts. Nearly all of them. Their choreographed fighting scenes doesn't hold a candle to orcs', and the feeling is that The story seems bleak , but as I said in the title, they had to start somewhere. I must mention the apprentice. Clearly wrong casting choice.The studios figured out the potential in ""geek"" theme movies, so they are cashing in. The true hope that it'll continue, and we'll see real epic movies from that universe in the future. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Fantasy Flick With Some Flaws,"When I read the first few reviews of Warcraft I wondered if it consisted of only fan boys who were promoting the movie just because of nostalgia and fandom. I was aware that some of the critics had given quite bad reviews and therefor I went to see the video with quite low expectations... I was positively surprised.Personally I've played all the Warcraft games and followed the series since the 90's. I know the general story line, but I would not consider myself as a ""big fan"". I'm just a normal gamer.This movie seem to be the first movie in a series of future Warcraft movies. Therefor it is trying to introduce the universe for the viewer, while at the same time presenting an interesting story. This makes the movie a bit confusing and it definitely feels like they tried to push a bit too much into too short amount of time.The movie has a love story which definitely feels rushed and comes out of nowhere. The movie jumps between locations and scenes very quickly multiple times which leaves the viewer a bit confused what just happened, and while it does this it also tries to stick with the main story line of the Orc invasion of Azeroth, while also trying to introduce this giant universe to the viewer, and explain a clash of different magic types between Warlock and Mages.Even me who has played all the games got confused and I wondered how other people in the theater must have felt.The CGI is top notch and it's not a single time where I feel that the CGI, Magic spells or other effects disturbed in any way. It felt very natural and the Orc's definitely felt natural together with the human actors. The CGI in Warcraft is way better than other fantasy movies such as The Hobbit trilogy.Even though the movie has some problems with its story line, where it tries to push a bit too much information in a very short amount of time, I still consider this movie a success and I consider it one of the better Fantasy movie that I've seen in a long time.The main story line was good. The bad guy was amazing, the art and CGI looked great and I look forward to see the coming movies in the Warcraft franchise.My wife who joined me for the movie, without knowing anything about the Warcraft universe enjoyed the movie even more than I did. She was confused about some parts but it did not prevent her from enjoying the movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Of The Best Movies Of 2016 SO FAR...,"I didn't expect this when I saw the trailer or the poster but MIND BLOWN . The Fighting Scenes . editing was excellent overall in the movie . Story was excellent . just loved it as . I really can't wait for the sequel cause the ending set it up really well.Magic was also pretty cool.Orgrim was a ferocious bad as*.It was a damn fine film . ""A MUST WATCH MOVIE"" I MUST SAY. Direction was amazing,one of the best motion capture for a film i've seen YET . Visuals are stunning and we can see probably the best implementation of magic that has been made in a movie. The Characters were amazing I Must say everything was amazing in this movie . I really thought it would a boring movie when I saw the trailer .A REALLY GOOD MOVIE",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fresh at it's genre,"Warcraft works surprisingly well to be a game movie. Even it has a lot of same visual as so many other fantasy movies does, there is still something original too. I was a little surprise that Duncan Jones took this movie to his helm, because earlier he has made much smaller, but great movies like ""Moon"" and ""Source Code"". But maybe it is a good thing that they gave this movie to him and not to any worse director. Under all that bombast is some original too. On the other hand it feels more copyright holder kind of movie, than Duncan Jones movie. Maybe the massive budget has tight his hands. Anyhow Warcraft is quite nice and well done fantasy movie, which entertain even audience like me who has never played the game. The Beginning at movie title predicts that more Warcraft movies is on the way. Let just hope that they find someone as good director as Duncan Joness is to helm upcoming movies. Warcraft is fresh wiff at fantasy movie genre in between all those Hobbit and Lord of The Ring movies. For once Orcs has some own character and are something else than just killing machines. The even have feelings and that brings some originality to this movie.After all Warcraft originality won't carry the movie up to end. Maybe the studio bosses haven't enough courage to let director make the movie on his own. The story ends too easily and it underlay too much of upcoming Warcraft movies. Warcraft is fresh movie at it's genre and it could have been even more, if studio bosses had let Duncan Jones bring more originality to his movie. Not bad at all.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good watch for all the Fantasy genre lovers which I most certainly am.,"As an Orc horde invades the planet Azeroth using a magic portal, a few human heroes and dissenting Orcs must attempt to stop the true evil behind this war.Warcraft, a movie version of a Blizzard Entertainment's video game. I have never played Warcraft so I was not versed on lore which would have made the film more powerful. Warcraft fans will love it. The acting was great, the effects were spot on and the action was epic. I was really impressed with the motion capture on the orcs, they looked amazing. I purchased the film 3D epic adventure of world-colliding conflict for my 3D Film collection .The 3D presentation and it was very well done for a post conversion 3D film. Warcraft is for the fantasy genre fan .All in all, I really enjoyed it. I guess I didn't go into this with a bunch of expectations other than to be entertained. It did that and left me wanting a sequel. As it was profitable, I am hopeful they do just that.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Warcraft""","Warcraft Movie is not a bad movie but it is also not good.The movie is a mixed bag with wonderful and stunning visuals that compliments to it's fantasy world.The environment,landscape,the whole thing was well visualized.The whole movie and also the characters were given enough details to make them stand out with it's cgi and the movie has magic elements and they were also well animated/visualized but if you go deep,the movie suffers pacing issues,Some scenes are in a rushed so rushed that the some characters feel irrelevant and just kind a there,blink,you'll miss them and doesn't do anything for the plot,The transitions were not smooth,jumping from one place to another and the film has a lot of stories to tell cram into one film(it would be much better to be a series) that makes the overall movie felt that it has so much going on,some scenes and dialogue are expositions.The movie has a lot to introduce and to tell that it suffers from it's own weight.The movie is not bad as critics says unlike other video game movies but it is also has some problems from those,It's well directed and has great visuals but has so many flaws that most audience and also the fans think it's minor but I think it's a major issue of the films.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Grossly Underrated,"Maybe I'm a bit biased by my love of the video game, but I found this to be one of the more underrated adaptation movies to come out in a long time. This should have be overwhelmingly more successful than it was. The characters were actually great, the CGI was outstanding, and the casting was spot on. The plot had its limitations, but all in all was greatly entertaining and well scripted. I truly wish more people could see just how much of a hidden gem this film was. The characters really suck you into the world of WOW and make you feel connected to this place of fantasy. I'd love nothing more than to get a sequel, or reboot to this, since one stand alone movie just doesn't do it justice.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Enjoyable, simple fantasy movie","Warcraft is a simple movie, but most importantly one that was worthwhile to watch, albeit short. With the allotted time do I think they could've done more to expand on the lore and characters that what we received? Yep. Do I think the acting was subpar? Yep. But there was not a single thing that was noticeably off-putting to me about it, honestly.Visually appealing with really nice CGI, and mentally appealing with a relaxing and straightforward plot that is largely carried by events taking place rather than pure dialogue.I like medieval fantasy, I like mythical creatures, and I love magic. Does that make me biased? Absolutely. But do I think that my rating for this is exaggerated? Not one bit. This is a pretty solid movie. And the industry is pretty much starved for good movies right about now. So 7/10 seems fitting. It's nothing special, just good.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Disappointing. **SPOILERS** I think? i couldn't follow what was going on,"Old School WOW Player back when it was good, what a joke of a movie this was, every Human looked the same, and the acting by them was FlatI can't comment much on the Story because i had no idea what was going on????Where were the other classes and races in this movie? I felt like it was just the origin story about the Stormwind NPC guardsThe story pushed on so quickly there was no time to care about any of the characters, I think the main Character gained a son in the second half...? At one point the Humans built some sort of Clay Man that came alive and started attacking them??Did not remember anyone's name by the endOn a positive note, The Orcs looked amazing, I rooted for them the entire way, because the humans where so disappointing and confusing.Also Disappointed in the lack of comedy, could of been so much better.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wow,"It's the best video game adaptation ever made! Although, let's face it, this is faint praise. More importantly – and I suspect this was director Duncan Jones's mission statement – it's a good film. Not perfect, but better than the wham bam trailers would have us expect, and nothing like those Rotten Tomatoes numbers.Most will have heard of World of Warcraft, the western world's most successful massively multiplayer online roleplaying game. Although Jones's movie actually returns to 1994, to the original game, Warcraft: Orcs & Humans, as its starting point.So, do I review this adaptation as a layman or a fan? I fall somewhere in-between: I've played Warcraft 3 and vanilla WoW, but then my knowledge falls away. Still, I know a Murloc warble when I hear it, and I understand the significance of the name Durotan.Durotan (Toby Kebbell) is an orc chief of the Frostwolf Clan. His homeworld Draenor is dying, and his leader, Gul'dan (Daniel Wu), is farming the souls of the indigenous Draenei in order to create a portal to Azeroth, where he intends to migrate his Horde and settle in the new world. Trouble is, Azeroth is already home to humankind (and elves and other species we briefly glimpse).The human military force in Azeroth is led by Lothar (Travis Fimmel), a powerful warrior who joins forces with the mage named Medivh (Ben Foster) and mage-apprentice Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer) to fight the Horde and close the portal. But Durotan is equally sceptical about Gul'dan's crusade, and he is seeking to halt the mighty warlock via orcish mutiny. When the humans capture the half- orc Garona (Paula Patton), she becomes the bridge between Lothar and Durotan. But will it be enough to prevent Gul'dan from completing his apocalyptic plan?The themes are broad and basic but laudable. Displaced people from a dying land escaping to a new place and a new culture? There are obvious parallels with modern migration struggles. But Jones targets a more nuanced dramatic core, focusing upon those individuals seeking common ground – who happen to be the proudest and arguably truest of each tribe.There's a hint of The Hobbit in the bright-but-grounded style of the movie. But the similarity ends there, because while Peter Jackson stretched a lot of content thinly across nearly nine hours, Jones and his co-writers pack more significant incident into two. I also feel that Jones has done a better job of integrating practical sets and props with CG environments.The special effects are something special, particularly during the orc scenes. I haven't seen such weight and clarity in CGI since Pacific Rim. While Warcraft doesn't seek to mimic the games' almost cartoony aesthetic it is evidently a work of great care and affection for the larger-than-life source material.On the performance front, Fimmel essentially reprises his roguish Vikings role as the charismatic Lothar. Patton's Garona plays a key part as the go-between for the clashing factions. I especially enjoyed her non-nonsense attitude to mating. Gul'dan is a wonderfully grotesque creation whose Fel power has left him utterly indifferent to the plight of the common man. There's a fantastically 12A-pushing scene in which he idly sucks the soul from a human captive like he's toking on a crack pipe. But it's Kebbell who steals the show. He lives and breathes the hulking Durotan – with this role and Apes' Koba, I wonder if we have a successor to Andy Serkis in the motion capture maestro stakes.The focus on characters and by extension themes is what elevates Warcraft above standard fantasy fare. Even when, in the final battle, the intimate drama threatens to be swamped by spectacle, Jones has the sense to give us emotional beats: pay-offs for the patient character-building of the first two acts.Warcraft has been hugely underrated by professional critics so far. The temptation is to rally against this perceived injustice. But let's reach for some objectivity: Warcraft is a flawed film. There's some seriously clunky dialogue, as per the need for exposition in a fantasy universe that will be all-new to many in the audience. And a sub- plot about Lothar's son never really resonates, perhaps because there are so many characters vying for real estate in the relatively brief running time.Warcraft's chief flaw may be its subtitle. It means we're left with a dangerously inconclusive ending. How much it's possible to enjoy the final act of this film depends largely on whether ""The Beginning"" is suitably confident or hopelessly optimistic.Knock off a star if your interest in Warcraft doesn't extend beyond one particularly amusing South Park episode – you're still in for a solid, enjoyable adventure story, somewhat old-fashioned in tone; and which also, in an era of turgid monstrosities, feels unusually brisk. For the fans, this is a no-brainer which happens to have some brains to go with its brawn.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Successful new fantasy universe created,"I've never played a Warcraft game, but I do like the Sword and Scorcerer/Fantasy genre, so I watched this not knowing what to expect.I was entertained, a surprisingly well done film, not so much for its story and arch, which in my opinion gets too long - particularly the battle scenes - but for the great universe that is created. The orcs are really well done and honestly much more interesting and better looking than the orcs of Lord of The Rings and the Hobit, this is what orcs are supposed to be like unlike the animalistic beasts in LOTR.I'm sure that many critics will find the movie primitive and even childish, but for the movie that it is then it fully delivers a believable (within genre) new take on the fantasy universe.As stated, I found it too long and too much time spent on battle scenes, not enough on the excellent story telling in the first part.If the director fixes a few of the flaws and adds more lore, then it could be a really good series in years to come.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than expected.,"Usually movies based on videogames end up to be ""mid"". ""Warcraft"" is not the case. I am not a fan of the WarCraft Universe, but even I got mesmerized and eventually hooked by the underlying lore. The monsters (orks) in this movie look exactly like they should look based on their videogame appearence and as a result they look phenomenal. No design of any character created by the movie industry looks as good as the orks in this move, which makes me think that gaming indusrty has the best designers in the world.It is a shame there hasn't been a sequel in over 8 years now. And as I understand, there won't be any in the future so let's appreciate what we have.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Primordial and Clunky but Still Gets the Job Done,"Let me just put this out there right now: I have never played Warcraft. My experience with Warcraft is limited to one of my friends from school being hospitalized because he survived solely on Dr. Pepper for a week while playing the darn thing. I say this because many within a certain community will see any criticism towards this film suspect; even more so coming from someone from the outside looking in. All that said, Warcraft the movie is not that bad.The story begins with a horde of Orcs invading the realm of Azeroth with chieftain Durotan (Kebbell) and his mate Draka (Galvin) among the first wave. Their leader Gul'dan (Wu) uses a ethereal form of black magic known as the Fel that requires mortal sacrifice, which many of the Orc clans look on with suspicion. Meanwhile Lothar (Fimmel), military commander of the human kingdom, and a mage named Khadgar (Schnetzer) find out about the fel and bring news to King Wrynn and Medivh (Foster) the Guardian of the realm. They investigate further and capture scrappy half-Orc survivor Garona (Patton) who agrees to help the humans and try to incite a rebellion along with Durotan from within.Draenor, Stormwind, Azeroth, Karazhan, Mak'gora, Dalaran; if these words mean something to you then guess what, you can probably pay attention to the plot with relative ease. Those of you who did not do the homework however will have to sit in the corner and feel the acrid pangs of being ostracized; like naively showing up to a party you're not invited to. It's even all the more punishing when characters speak in paragraphs of exposition and explanations. We get all the trappings of a fantasy adventure including palace intrigue, otherworldly artifices, fantastical creatures and sword- to-flesh chest pounding, yet the narrative fails to give us much reason to care. That's a pretty large feat considering the amount of death that surrounds Gul'dan and his horde.So why then do I say Warcraft is not that bad? Well for one, Duncan Jones's visual cleverness and attention to detail is still present, despite the film's need to frustratingly skip any honest-to-goodness emotion or characterization. Jones is not of the MTV generation of action filmmakers who use shaky cam, fast editing and dynamic camera angles to slam their audiences against the wall. Instead Jones litters his action with a fast processional of setups and payoffs broken up by tracking shots of people hurdling towards each other. That along with an affinity for epic wide shots of battlefields prove he may be among the forefront of a new generation of directors who take their inspiration from video-games.There's no value judgment here on whether lifting ideas from video- games is a good idea though it is refreshing to see a director take a different tact. The visual grammar is primordial and a little clunky at times but when it works, it really works. Warcraft could have ended up like the much maligned Dungeons and Dragons (2000). As it stands Warcraft is more of a bargain bin Lord of the Rings (2001- 2003) providing some interesting visual thrills though using bland characters that might as well be made of clay.In summation, Warcraft is kind of like the Dungeons and Dragons starter set. The one where you first create your character class, roll for ability scores, determine statistics and alignment while forming a solid backstory. It's a whole lot of setup and ironically very little actual war-craft but at least it leaves you with a lot to work with. Oh, you have no idea what I'm talking about? Do those last few sentences make little sense? Well then, you know how I feel.www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"To all ""critics"" out there ... DON'T TRASH OUR LORE !","The movie was PERFECT, if someone don't understand that's his/her problem, if someone don't like to watch BEST CGI to date then go watch Woody Allen movies (to all respect to the director), really i haven't seen better CGI and if you are so shallow not to see what this movie is about then don't write about it, ask other people to explain it to you. Don't mess with our way of life and the story that's too complicated for someone to understand it. Don't MESS WITH OUR LORE !!! Don't you DARE to say what is good and what is not good when you don't know nothing, remember for someone this is everyday LIFE and you put your finger on it. Just STOP and WANISH. And last ...this is a WARCRAFT movie not World of Warcraft, based on a game from 1994, this is the beginning of the best stories ever told.I love lord of the rings but they come second :) And one more thing , make the next movies longer :) FOR AZEROTH !",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I Hate World of Warcraft, but I Liked this movie 7/10","Yes. I'm proud to say I was one of a few American soldiers who never played World of Warcraft 2010-2016. It's all hocus pocus, dorky video games to me and a detriment to our armed forces and I'll fight anyone who says otherwise. It should be banned for the sake of western civilization.With my bias stated, I must say this movie prevailed in ways I never expected. For one, I am a man who loves a good story with action. I need meaning for me to care about something taking place. This STORY was simple and not too bad. And I mean simple. I mean not too bad. But I cared what was happening. However, I'm excited to see where the story goes. I do remember hearing the 3rd Warcraft game's story was incredible, so I would love to see if the Warcraft movies make it to the third game's story. It would be like Game of Thrones White Walkers and undead mixed with demons, elves, dwarves, men, etc. That's quite a combination!ACTION: This movie has a lot of it. Especially the largest battle (not saying when it happens). I was reallly blown away by some of the battle scenes, including the largest battle, which probably saved this movie by itself. As a soldier who is ok with fantasy, I really appreciated it. It's not Lord of the Rings epic, which is the best trilogy ever made, but its very satisfying.The CGI is this movie's greatest strength. It is truly a feast for the eyes. I can't praise it any better. COSTUMES such as the knights armor looks really nice.BAD: A lot of no-name actors. Travis Fimmel, our famous Ragnar Lothbrok from the marvleous Vikings series, does well, and the main Orc is pretty likeable even though he is CGI (again, well done on the CGI!). But my good gracious, why is Paula Patton a half human half orc baffoon?!?! She was talented in Mission Impossible 4 but her look in this movie made me embarrassed every time I saw her. Think Jar Jar Binks embarrassing moments wrapped up in her appearance. People laughed and mocked her when I saw the movie. In fact, all of Patton's scenes are a negative distraction, which is a good example of what brings this movie down to a 7/10. You get sucked in to this movie's entertaining value and then something stooopid distracts you.The movie stands very tall with a six pack of abs and arnold pecks and biceps, but then it pulls itself down with some saturated fats from multiple cheeseburgers that complete hides those shredded muslces we want to admire! These bad fats included corny scenes, bad acting, stooopid moments, stooopid looking elves (they need to fix that right away), strange looking dwarves, and the Paula Patton Orc.Another analogy goes like this: a 15 month girl starts running around the house making her parents proud as she stomps around the world showing those chunky thunder thighs of strength. She has graduated from crawling. What a moment! And then the young girl falls on her face busting her lip and begans to shriek loudly. The parents drop to their knees from the cringe shrieks and they run to stop their child's pain. The glory, the happiness, the cringe, and then the pain, all within a couple of moments! That is this movie. But like a memory, parents will remember their child's glorious graduation from crawling to running more than the cringe moment of the shrieks and the horrid pain. That's how I remember this movie and it deserves a 7/10, which is good, but not great.That's the best I can do without spoiling anything. It's worth a go through, but it seems females are not interested in this movie, so if your a alpha male like me, or you identify as a unicorn, you might wanna watch this movie alone or with your bros. My wife was not impressed and I had to watch Downtown Abbey later with her to make up for it. The Paula Patton orc had killed her immediately. She could not be revived the rest of the movie...",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pretty fun,"For an adaptation of a popular game, this is pretty fun. It tries to do both sides justice (good and bad are a fine line, when you get both perspectives), which may anger a couple of people, but is a nice touch. I have only played the original Warcraft games and never got around to the World of Warcraft one. Which on one hand is a good thing of course, considering how much time I would have been online playing.So I can't really compare what is being taken from the game and what they left out (heard some people complaining about missing characters). But you can imagine that a movie can not hold everything in it. Maybe there are (or were?) plans to include some things in a sequel. I doubt there will be one, considering the Box Office this made (or rather didn't make). Still if you like Fantasy and Science Fiction, you could do a lot worse. This is really fun",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very entertaining! 7/10,"Review: I really appreciated the effort that was put into this movie, and I thoroughly felt entertained throughout. The ORC Warriors looked great and the cinematography was spot on but the director needed a few A-list actors to play the human roles. King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) was useless put I have to commend him for physically going into war when he had to. Ben Cooper was great as the magical wizard Medivh, even though they made him look like Jesus but the guy who really impressed me was Travis Fimmel, who played Anduin Lothar. I liked the chemistry between Anduin and Garona (Paula Patton), and the relationship between Durotan and Draka was really sweet. The action scenes were pretty impressive, especially the fight scene between Durotan and Gul'dan towards the end and the director cleverly added a touch of wit, which lightened the intense situation. Everyone seemed to be ignoring the clever Khadgar, who ended up being a real hero, and the great touches like the flying birds and massive wolves, made the movie a joy to watch. The attention to detail on all of the Orcs, we're truly remarkable but the ending was quite abrupt, which spoilt the flow of the movie. Anyway, I completely enjoyed this movie, and I can't wait to see the sequel. Enjoyable!Round-Up: This movie was directed by Duncan Jones, 45, who brought you, the fantastic Moon starring Sam Rockwell, Source Code and the upcoming Mute, which will also have Rockwell in the cast. For his 3rd project, he really did take on a massive task, especially with all of the devoted video game fans being very critical about the project but I personally think that he done a great job, and he covered a lot of ground for the first movie.Budget: $160million Worldwide Gross: $433.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/adventure/fantasy movies, starring Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Clancy Brown, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Glenn Close and Daniel Wu. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warcraft,"Warcraft is a fascinating movie. Mostly because the enjoyment of it seems to heavily rely on the connection you have with the source material.The first time I watched it, I'd never played the game and really knew nothing about that world. As a result, the movie was a mess that jumped from weird place to place filled with characters I knew nothing about and didn't particularly care for. Had I have rated it then, it would have hovered around a 3.After that first viewing I was eventually drawn into World of Warcraft and played quite a bit of it. When I saw the movie sitting on the shelf I figured I would give it another try and WoW! It was a completely different experience. Suddenly those characters felt so much more important. The weird locations weren't nonsensical anymore, in fact I knew exactly where they were relative to each other and how to get there. The entire world had become richer as I'd grown more connected to it.That seems to be the experience most people have with it too. If you're a fan of the game, this will probably be a fun experience for you. If not... I really wouldn't bother with it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Give the movie a shot, you won't regret it at all","You think Warcraft is a bad movie? Just like allllll other video- game adaptions? (rly?) You think all these bad critics out there are right? The film is just that ~30/100 critics-score worth.Well, just let me say it as simply as it is: It's not!Me and my friends, all non-WoW-players but with experience in the old Warcraft-series and recently Hearthstone (besides me, hardcore WoW- nerd :D) seen it today at the midnight-premiere and we were completely satisfied.There is no humour in the movie? Eeermmm... what? There are soooo many eastereggs from the game, even Murlocs! Thats right man, MURLOCS! The cast is bad? Sry bro, but your mama is bad ;) The cast is superb. Maybe i'm biased, but i just love Travis Fimmel! And Paula Patton is awesome too. Even Khadgar, who was a little bit 'difficult' for me, when i saw the trailers, was better and better fitting.Don't wanna write a full novel here, but just remind yourself: BOX OFFICE counts! We all wanna see Part 2 and Part 3. Make this happen guys, people around the world, unite for good fantasy stuff. If you rly don't like Warcraft or the trailers, then be it. But else, if you are still thinking, give the movie a shot. Its worth it.Honestly, i would rate the movie in between 7-9, not 10. But i have the feeling, the hyped people have to do something against these abstruse bad-rated critics.Greetings from Germany ;) Sry for bad englando.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining enough,"I was surprised to learn that this movie was panned by critics upon its release and that it bombed in the box office, I thought this is a pretty decent movie. It has a good entertainment value, the CGI was actually excellent and you could rank it as same league with most high-budgeted superhero movies. The performances were good tho some could be better. The storyline's all over the place at times but it's not hard to follow and the score is fitting. It even set up a sequel which I doubt will ever happen due to this movie's performance, but you never know what the future has in store.As far video game adaptation goes, this was definitely better than many others out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Not perfect but good enough for me to rate it 10/10, does that even make sense?","This film was excellent. Some of the acting may seem slightly out but the time reference the film has to play to is the issue. The CGI is the best there's ever been and Ben Schnetzer, along with Toby Kebbell, stand out although everyone does a stand up job. The story has some gaps from a watchers perception that isn't already engrossed with the lore, but the movie flows really well. Duncan Jones does a great job with, what i consider, his first big project. I loved Source code but i can see its faults, i am a huge 'Groundhog Day' type movie fan though. I am yet to see Moon. Overall though i will give this a huge rating due to the technical difficulty in bringing this to a cinematic format. Its brilliantly done. There's the possibility that you wont get the movie at all, i know, if you are not as invested in it, which i am as a player. But i think you should be able to get over these things if you have never been a WoW or Warcraft player, so long as you watch it with the attitude of wanting to be engrossed. Dive in, let it wash over you, and enjoy the experience.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warcraft: The Beginning is a worthy attempt at being the first (of hopefully many) engaging big budget film based on a video game.,"Let's get a couple of things out of the way first. I have not played any Warcraft games and do not have a deep understanding of the mythology of this world. I was also very underwhelmed by the trailers for this movie and went in with very low expectations. See for yourself:I have to say, I was pretty well entertained by the film. The performances were really good for the most part; and we now have the heir apparent to Andy Serkis for all motion capture roles in Toby Kebbell. After his masterful performance as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, his portrayal of Durotan is the stand out performance in my opinion. I was actually surprised by the Orcs as a whole. We have now reached the level of technology that allows for warmth in the eyeswhich make the orcs believable.I also liked the story that was told and how it was told. Duncan Jones (the director) did something that is very admirable; he made me believe that I was on Azeroth within the first 10 minutes of the film. As someone who hasn't played the games before, I was never confused about where the film was headed and the motivation behind the decisions of most of the characters.One of my biggest problem was the performance of Ben Schnetzer who played Khadgar the young wizard. I don't really understand the purpose of this role as a whole. Why does he have to be a young wizard? Couldn't he have been a more fleshed out wizard who has been through some experiences. He looked like he was in a different film.Another issue I had was with CGI in certain parts of the film. At times it looked too glossy. It needed to be a little more gruff for me. I also wanted some more character development for a lot of the characters. There were parts of the film that seemed to be dragging as a result of lack of character development; I just didn't care at times.Overall, I was really impressed by what Duncan Jones was able to do with this. This is by far the best video game film we have had. But as a fantasy movie, it is no Lord of the Rings. It was a good film but not a great one. I still enjoyed it for what it is and what the potential could be for possible sequels and other potential video game adaptations.My rating: 6/10which is a recommendation in my book.Review from: www.pratikrambles.wordpress.com",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
it can be even worse,"at first, i am an old warcraft and wow younger from the first time, so im the fanboy they wanted to catch after the Trailers i didn't expect very much, well at least i expected nothing, and even as an former wow nerd i cant give this movie more than a 11# characters were flat2# dialogs and Story simply not good (Story too much and too fast told for such a complex world and doesn't fit with at all)3# CGI: it Looks cheap, i want to see a movie not a better Version of a wowaddon cutscene, u know orks in LOTR, yeah impressive and realistic, in warcraft the beginning they look like better animated Comicsconclusion: better save your Money and don't listen to the fanboys, every director could have done better, if Blizzard wanted to bring me back to wow after, they failed",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie i have watched for years,"I played wow for years and have dreamed about movie since ! when I heard they were making movie I was so excited then people started talking that it would not be good and still I hoped was not totally impressed with trailer but still I hoped today I saw it and oh my god I could not stop smiling it was great so great I can't even express my feelings , loved every second of it , great acting , good script , I felt that old Warcraft soul in it , good action , spectacular view magic just felt real. cg was great in front view background was little bit blurry but its fine I have noting to complain I strongly recommend everyone to see it ! it's a must watch ! great beginning of great story ! hope all of you will feel the same what I felt !",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better than the critics give it credit for,"I was really excited about this movie, but then I let early critical reviews poison my outlook. I ended up going, but with decidedly more trepidation than I needed to have. The movie was perfectly good. I think it might have been a little better when you understand the lore, but even to the uninitiated, if you pay attention, I still think it introduces its characters well.While some of the action was so, for lack of a better word, epic in scale, it suffered, sometimes, looking cartoon-y, but those moments are short lived. And the good stuff more than makes up for the bad. All in all it is well worth the time to watch.Another criticism was the acting. To that I say nay. The acting is just fine. I think these newcomers do a good job. There was once a time when Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher where unknown newcomers and today they are household names. I don't want to digress to much, but save for Oscar Isaac, the cast here are betters actors than the cast of The Force Awakens.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A forgettable flick that's everything I don't particularly like about Warcraft,"I can't say I was expecting much from the movie, but I at least anticipated that the CGI would look even better than the cinematics from the campaigns of Blizzard's popular game series. It did not. Maybe the detail and resolution was higher, but if so, it was heightened at the cost of the lively playfulness in the designs of the games. You can either make a movie look realistic or marvelously unreal - this was neither.The pacing also felt off from the get-go... there was no time to settle with any characters. No time to build a mood. Awkward and predictable dialogue, weird cutting between scenes and unnecessarily many ""character - learns - terrible - news - looks - up - to - the - skies - and - goes - ""my...God!""-types of shots. It didn't need to have ended up this way, considering how long this project has been underway.Blizzard have always been very keen on borrowing elements of lore and character design from other fantasy leviathans - Warhammer, LOTR, Starship troopers or whatever it might be, but they always do so thoroughly and with both inspiration and cheekiness. This movie didn't have much of either. It tried, and at times achieved the ""charming cheesiness""-level of the Star Wars franchise, but I think I prefer to remember the story of the first invasion of Azeroth the way it was told through the original game series.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Uncle Gol'Dan needs you. Join the horde.,"Fantasy can be so much better. It's original players have grown up and Warcraft could have chosen to grow up too. It didn't. It is as childish and cliché as one might expect. You won't be disappointed. I went in hoping for a good story. I came out with a shattered brain. The effects are good, but wasted on this movie. It's a dwarf standing on the shoulder of giants (Lord of the Rings, Star Trek, Dungeons and Dragons in this case). It imitates all, but surpasses none and it is more like a family album full of rather lousy parties, than a gripping tale. Familiar faces and nothing more remains to be said. BTW: those orc teeth must hurt the lips.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Warcraft: A beautiful but rough piece of ""game adapted"" cinema!","Can critics please stop comparing this movie to Lord of the Rings! Simply because they both have orcs and war, doesn't mean they are the god damn same! Or that this movie tries to imitate it!In my opinion this movie is gorgeous to look at. A technical delight, especially in the animations of the orcs. Set pieces are creative and colorful, and the visual presentation of the characters are also very creative. Sure the story can be a bit inconsistent, and the acting leaves some to be desired. But i still feel like this movie has a beautiful presentation, a serious take on the lore of Warcraft with a well-rounded story and cool scenes and characters. In addition, I find the topic of duality within the orcish society and within themselves to be both interesting and dare I say original for this genre.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"An excellent movie, full of action","Having dragged someone that disliked the Warcraft franchise and having that someone tell me after seeing the movie that it was good, and by good, he specified: better than The Hobbit, better than Lord of the Rings trilogy. I can only confirm its a movie worth seeing.As a Warcraft fan I can tell you these guys took a really great attention to details, there's far more happening in every scene than it meets the eye.The special effects are great, there's humor, drama, tension and mystery and whats more exciting: this is only the prelude to a really complex story that follows.Thus, its only downside is that it lets you wanting for more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The video-game-movie adaptation curse has been lifted!,"So I went to see Warcraft last night, although with tentative expectations. I had read some reviews beforehand and they weren't exactly glowing. As someone who had never played the game before, I didn't really know what to expect, but I liked the trailers so thought I'd give it a try. I was really surprised at how engrossed I was in the movie and at the all round balanced storyline. Starting off briefly introducing the characters and with an explanation of the magic force known as Fel. The Orcs although created using CGI were really believable characters and I especially felt invested in Durotan's character. These mammoth beings make for really stunning fight scenes, which were made exceptionally well, keeping me excited throughout them. Paula Patton's character Garona, a half- Orc was really enjoyable to watch, seeing her integrate with both the humans and the Orcs unsure of where she stands amongst all of the chaos. Her emotions really carried the movie along with Toby Kebbel as Durotan and his wife played by Anna Van Hooft. On the human side of things I was a little disappointed, I thought the main actor Travis Fimmel was a bit flat as Anduin Lothar and Ben Schnetzer as Khadgar was OK, but nothing spectacular. Although Dominic Cooper's character I really enjoyed watching, I think he's a phenomenal actor and with his recent TV series Preacher, he's definitely going places. The movie had a somewhat Lord of the Rings/ Avatar kind of feel to it and from someone who really enjoyed LOT, I felt that Warcraft didn't lose itself trying to be something it's not. It took the game's main concepts and turned it into a movie deserved of the big screen. This probably has to be the best game- turned-movie to date, and only Michael Fassbender's Assassin's Creed coming later this year could possibly top it. It's a 7/10 from me with a bit of work on the acting side of things, but an overall enjoyable, fun and interesting film.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sorry for haters,"1.The movie has a excellent VISUAL quality: by two-time Oscar winner and Industrial Light and Magic (you know, Star Wars, Avengers, Avatar, Jurassic World, etc)2. The movie has a excellent SOUND quality: DTS:X, Dolby ATMOS and Auro 11.13. The art is like classic but different in GOOD way. The creatures are astonish.4. It's a NEW universe, as I saw, they introduce two worlds at least. Several species, but only for a few seconds.5. The PLOT it's intense, almost every scene have a bunch of information in it. The Director did a great job. You don't expect that plot.6. Obviously it's a BEGINNING, so, It'll develop a lot.7. It's ENJOYABLE, fantasy, drama, fun, mystery, honor, corruption and even love. What more do you need for?¿It's 10/10? No. But, come on haters, take it easy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Make up your own mind,"I went to see this with my girlfriend and two other friends who have never touched anything Warcraft game. They just came for a good time. I think they enjoyed the movie even more then I did, while I played all the games.Don't believe the critics. Go watch yourself before judging. In general I tend to agree with critics, but this time they are completely wrong. With three people with me who don't know anything about the Warcraft Universe, I was in a good position to compare some of the issues from the critics with your neutral viewer. Hardly anything held up.The pace and it being ''all over the place'' wasn't experienced in the slightest by my friends. They wanted more and more. The special effects didn't bother me at all. Of course certain background information wasn't explained (you can only do so much with a movie), but it didn't bother my group at all. Apart from me being able to fill in the blanks after the movie, they just didn't think about it. They loved the story, characters and the world as a whole.We can only hope for another one of the these. Critics be damned!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Woof,"I have two thing to say right off. Me and my 11 year old only made it through about 15 minutes of this before we both agreed to leave. And 2) I was one of the biggest LOTR fans ever out there (books and movies), and the little I saw of this was total dreck. So PLEASE don't say gee man if you liked (the exquisitely grounded) LOTR well you're SURE to like this. NOT!! The best stories dealing with complex worlds start you out with a relatable character and go real slow, they add one piece at a time. This one throws you into an unpleasant setting and expects you to know everything right off the bat. It has the feel of manufactured substance when in fact this movie looked to me to be without much substance at all. Some of the scenes are impressive in Imax (the only way this was offered on premier, probably another tell on its quality), but that isn't nearly enough for me. I need a character I can relate to and a story I can understand and enjoy. There was a lot about this that reminded me of the dreadful Strange Magic, I think on that one we lasted about 5 minutes more than on this. I'm not saying there isn't an audience for this movie, I'm just saying I loved LOTR and liked Star Wars and I had no interest in watching another single minute of whatever this was supposed to be. Also note in the short time there there were scenes which troubled my 11 year old, and the Imax was way too loud for him. So my vote is save your hard-earned money for something else. I also must say that the chorus of positive IMDb reviews for this movie are just not believable.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Duncan Jones Delivers Once More!,"I went into the theater not expecting much, having seen the trailer, I wasn't pretty impressed, but having seen Moon and Source Code, I wanted to give it a chance, despite having low expectations.Having seen it now, I'm glad that this movie proved me wrong. Warcraft isn't without flaws, it has many Characters, and not enough time, I would've loved to see more of each one of them, some characters shine more than other, but they are nonetheless all beautifully written, the story is character driven, initially I thought it'd be generic, but that wasn't the case, many twists and turns happen throughout the film, although some can be predicted, they keep you on the edge of your seat wanting to know more. Duncan Jones with the limited time he had in the movie succeeded in building us a rich world and kept us interested in it.The CGI and visuals are astounding, heck the movie is worth it for them alone, and that's coming from someone who is skeptical of CGI, some shots are too beautiful to describe especially the ones while flying on the gryphon. As for the Orcs, CGI is so well done with astounding attention to detail, As you are watching you forget that the orcs are actually CGI, that's due to both the writing of the orc character and the attention to detail. There are some shots better than others, but that's to be expected in any film that has excessive use of CGI.In short, the movie has the action, the excitement, the story. It is never dull, and will keep you interested, all I wanted more was a longer running time because at parts it felt rushed and has some cliff hangers, but in overall it is a great movie, and I really hope for more sequels, Duncan you did it again!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Nonwarcraft player and no knowledge perspective (aka noob review),"Waaaay better than I expected and vastly greater than rotten tomatoes 22% and critics reviews! I saw this thinking being on the edge and so glad and wasn't bummed for losing $10. Breakdown for people on the edge: Definitely a good time! Even if you have no Warcraft experience. Who would like this movie: Lord of rings fans, Harry Potter maybe, any action science fiction movie or fight movie will like this too. The effects and are amazing. The main Orc monsters are 'beautifully' ugly and the villain is pretty cool and terrible. The action sequences are awesome and I'm no fan of imax 3D but some sequences felt like I was sitting on the battlefield. I was really impressed. It looked way worst in previews.Did I get the characters backgrounds, towns or fanfare? Nope but that doesn't distract from enjoying the film. What distracts from the film is the actual production. They obviously clipped this down and left out linking scenes that are very apparent as things just literally jump from scene and place to place with no transition. It's pretty horrendous and apparent but doesn't make it any less fun when things get intense.OK now for the negatives that in no way should hinder you from seeing it just make it from a film and movie piece itself have some glaring issues. The transitions from scene to scene are so sporadic, so quick and non-smooth it is literally like watching an animated jr high PowerPoint presentation with the ""slide"" transition used in overboard during scene changes. Then the next scene will have no intro or background just through you into a non set up convo or action sequence. Also the human support cast (other than main people) aren't in the same league and feel like children movie actors. They have potential but yeah. However those things don't make this movie unseeable just make this a bad movie from a movie critic standpoint, not a fan which is why I think movie industry buffs concerned with the movie production and flow cons give this a failing score and everyone else can give it a solid B for a good time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A decent action flick, but felt too rushed for its own good","I saw this film today. As a former WoW player, and someone who has read up on some lore about various characters, here are my thoughts on the film:Pros: 1. Visual details are very faithful to the WoW games. If you're a WoW player, you would feel like watching the leveling zones come to life. 2. It is a balanced movie; not too dark not too light. It has the even formula of a good action movie. 3. Visual effects - one of the things that I had reservations with initially. This applies mostly to the Orcs, and I think they pulled it off. They don't look too CGI, which is good. 4. Storyline is good. The lore is pretty good, so I don't expect less from the movie.Cons: All the cons I have found in this movie is because of the fact that the movie is too short. I cannot believe it is only 2 hours long.1. Too rushed - this lore is very extensive, with a lot of key players shaping up this era and also the future era. 2. Characters lacking soul - the movie serves cohesion for both casual and knowledgeable audiences, making it very easy to understand for the latter while not doing a disservice to the former. However, I just personally feel that the characters sacrificed a lot of their background in order to fit the main plot into a 2h movie. 3. Lack of build up - the war, the key characters, the resolution, they all lack build up because of time constraints. The plot just moved way too fast for its own good. 4. Action scenes could've been better - there is no drama, no anticipation, just pure action. This is mostly because of #3.In conclusion: It is a very typical summer action flick. It is not a bad movie, but it is also not the best.I am a bit disappointed because I expected something to a more of a LotR format where they build the characters and the plot to a point where the audience would gain empathy and understand where they are coming from.This could've been epic but really got affected because it was rushed. There is no apparent character development, if they die, you really don't feel anything. If someone dies, as a new audience, you won't even realize how much impact that would be.There is no soul between characters, the action scenes are generic. The lack of orchestration on the final confrontation was sub-par. There is no excitement, no fire, just something you'd say ""ok, that was cool"" and then you move on with your life.But for me, the movie was decent. But I'm not sure if it's going to entice new audiences towards reading up on the lore as it is not as detailed as LotR. It just felt like a flash in the pan movie that people will just say ""it's a movie I saw last summer.""You cannot underestimate people that reads up on interesting lore like LotR, Harry Potter, etc., this would've massively boosted WoW in terms of mainstream success, but for me, it was just there really.The whole thing could've been an intricate saga, but they really went the other way. It's like, instead of going for TDK, it went for BvS (but with a better faith to lore). Instead of going for The Avengers, they went for X-Men: Apocalypse. Take it however you want.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Excellent movie adaptation of a great game series!,"I just saw the movie in the cinema here in Manila and I must say I was happily surprised. Unlike the so called 'professional' critics I really enjoyed the plot, characters and visuals of this exciting film.I'm not sure what the critics expected, perhaps another fantasy classic? Maybe they have been too spoiled over the last few years by fantasy masters such as the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Game of Thrones series and even the enjoyable (but rather underwhelming) Hobbit series.Video game adaptations to the big screen rarely turn out good. This movie is an exception. It's not a cinema classic by any means, but you won't regret paying full price at your local theatre either.I agree that some of the acting could have been better and that some parts of the story could have been fleshed out more. Considering the budget they had to work with, however, I'm still completely convinced that the production team did a sterling job.Enjoy the movie for what it is: a faithful adaptation of Warcraft's early history with decent actors and delightful visuals.

Unexpected Surprise!,"I am not a fan of the Warcraft games and was not expecting much when my mates suggested going to see Warcraft.I have been a fan of Duncan Jones' other sci-fi films and was slightly disappointed when I heard he was venturing into fantasy. I had seen the trailers and thought it looked too CGI heavy and serious. Coupled with the initial poor reviews and my aversion to 3D I was not looking forward to spending £12 on two hours of Orc-y, Orc-y, talky, talky, Smashy, Smashey.However I surprisingly enjoyed Warcraft. It was a bit silly in places and characters sometimes made daft choices, like stopping i n the middle of a battle to chat and further exposition, but it wasn't too serious and, as a newcomer, I really enjoyed the level they pitched the back story, it didn't spoon feed us and expected the audience to keep up. The CGI actually looked great on the big screen and I found myself actually caring for the great, big green and brown characters as much as the human characters. All the actors were decent choices, with Ben Foster and Toby Kebbell standing out. The film could have done with some breathing space for the actors to emote as certain scenes felt rushed or were cut strangely, in contrast to this the final battle seemed to be over quite quickly for a change!You can tell that they are setting up for future films by leaving story strands unresolved, which is becoming an annoying trend in block- buster movies. In this case though I really hope that the Warcraft movie is a big enough success so that we can revisit this world and found out what happens to these characters next.7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Perfect for a fan, but not ""a Good Movie"" at all.","This film excels in money making cause it is suitable as a franchise to satisfy fans. Great green-screen scenery, imaginative static frames and camera work (1 star). Cast was also fine: none expected any kind of acting in game-based movies. Ben Foster and Travis Fimmel overacted but it worked out fine after all. I liked CGI and the make-up job at some point (not elven tho, they were horribly designed). For instance, discolorations on faces in various scenes were on point (2 stars). All of this do make a good wrapper to sell stuff.Positive signs had been destroyed by some ""A-movie criteria"" which are almost non-existent here. There are tons of questions about villains motivation. Of course you can guess about ""moving factors"" of global events. But no character motivation actually is explained, scene just happened and you are obviously left to wait for another part to figure all the reasons. That's not how you make a good movie, even franchised one. See ""Lord of the Rings"" on how this problem can be solved in fantasy genre.Director also abandoned character development for some reason and chose to focus on visuals. And sometimes you feel an overdose on visuals: long shots in action scenes are failed to impress. Particular shots and close-ups of main orks like Durotan are sexy, beautifully made. But all those theatrical props are no use since we have no character development. Cuz nothing can distract a viewer from cheap-looking requisite but a true Warcraft-fan excitement (look at their Ornate Plate and weapon: ""Life is plastic, It's fantastic!""). This excitement also supports the weak screenplay. Not even worth mentioning.It feels like the film has no director! Things are happening, ugly elves are talking, useless dwarfs remain useless, characters are dying, but you could not care less about them cause they were not developed and their motivation is primitive yet confusing sometimes.So here you have it: being a fan you don't need all those pesky ""good movie attributes"". Fans got what they needed. But does it have a creative value? Surely not. It has a commercial value only. It is entertaining here and there but not worth your money unless you are strongly addicted to ""Warcraft"" universe. Too much money and effort and time were invested in ""Warcraft"" to make another meaningless spectacle. And none cares if it's ""the best of the worst"" game-based film, it is still bad and looks poorly written. Maybe later they'll make something deeper out of it, but not now. Sorry.

"I expected less, got more.","tl;dr- Good mix of action and story, sometimes got lost on what is happening.The character growth felt like it was meant to be the strongest part of the movie because it touches on so many characters. In the end only two characters are actually strong, Lothar and Durotan. All the other characters acted predictably, almost comically. This made the movie pretty boring, and was exciting when there was fighting or a scene with Durotan or Lothar story plot. These two characters made the movie worth seeing. The two were not unworldly strong but showed growth, pain, and strength from experience. Just because they are the main characters does not mean they should be the only characters with depth.The CGI was very good, especially the Orcs. The designs of the Orc clothing, weapons and general culture (skulls as helmets or mantels, war paint, etc) is exactly how most people would imagine an orc. Humans were a little different. Duncan tried to capture the Humans as they are in the game, but this made them feel unrealistic and unrelatable. It worked with the Orcs because it is what is expected while capturing individualism and proportional to their body. The Humans looked like a comic book character that wasn't trying to be a comic book character by mixing realism with cartoon features.The fight scenes weren't bad, but aren't memorable either. Typical hack-and-slash fights, some awkward stumbling and stabbing if paying attention, but the general fights are what the viewer comes to see. Large battles, people being thrown around, and overcoming the odds of the fight through skill vs numbers.I would see this movie again, but isn't a great movie. When Blizzard spoke about the development of this movie as ""A mix of 'Lord of the Rings' and 'Avatar'"", it can be imaged in some areas how it was attempted to do both, but accomplished nothing great, but failed at nothing either.7/10 for above average and well above my expectations for this movie, let alone a video game movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
CompletelyAwful,"I am not going to rant, however, this review will be the first one I have ever written. I am no movie critic, just a fan of Blizzard and have been waiting for this film for over 10 years. It was just about one of the most disappointing films I had ever seen. Very well may have been my hopes were through the roof.Why was it awful for me, Blizzard had the ability to make 3 to 4 amazing lore films or even a harry potter series, but felt like they tried to cram 4 films in one. Graphics were stunning. Acting was rough, the script was poorly written, and the theme of the movie was OK. I rated this so low so Blizzard fans would read. I am a lover of all things Blizzard. There execution on video games has been terrific since I started playing warcraft 1 as a child, through now playing over watch, star craft 2, heroes of the storm, and diablo. I must admit I stopped playing WoW after Cataclysm. Thanks for reading, but was really bummed by this film.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Later, when the release came closer, I started to hear about the bad response critics gave it.

Sure, at times it's kinda cringy because of the high fantasy-style it's made in. The humans armor and so on. But considering it's based on a game, its understandable.It's not Lords of the Ring-good.

"A set up movie, but a damn good one.","I've gotta say this movie surprised me. despite me being a fan of the Warcraft series I had mixed feelings about this movie especially when the first reviews started to spring up but thankfully I really enjoyed the film for what it was. It does have a few flaws mainly in the form of pacing issues but this doesn't mean it automatically becomes terrible which some people keep jumping to despite it also having a lot of redeeming factors. It seems that a lot of people want to bash and criticise the movie simply for what it is, an extremely nerdy and often joked about source material trying to be brought into the world of franchises, yet people seem to forget that this is exactly what happened to comic books. Now I'm not saying Warcraft is as good as the first X-men or Iron Man but as a franchise starter it managed to be well contained story in its own right while still introducing us to the world of Azeroth and the later stories that can (and possibly will) be told in that world. Due to sheer size of the world and lore of the source material it's understandable why Warcraft didn't achieve the absolute perfect balance that things like X-men did, but I personally believe Duncan Jones did the best he could while still staying as true to the original as possible.So yes it can be argued that the film is just to set up other movies but there are plenty of films that were essentially that to begin with and have had extremely successful franchises, Hunger Games and the Divergent series all started off this way and I believe that Warcraft is a much stronger starting movie than the movies that kick started those franchises. Even this year Batman vs Superman was essentially a set up for the larger DC Universe but was mishandled greatly, whereas Warcraft feels more like it's trying to be a stand alone film and while it doesn't entirely achieve this it still holds up.As I said the film does suffer from pacing issues and this it's most glaring problem, I would be lying if I said it didn't take some enjoyment away from the film (one scene in particular comes completely out of nowhere and I still can't really understand it even now) but this is really the only huge flaw. Something to mention is the world of Azeroth is drenched in Fantasy and unlike much more grounded versions of fantasy worlds such as Game of Thrones the sheer detachment from reality will turn some people off. This is by no means a bad thing about the movie and anyone who believes this to be a flaw (which some people do) should not be allowed to write movie reviews. It is simply a matter of personal opinion, if you enjoy that kind of thing then you will enjoy the film but if you're not really a fan of that sort of thing then Warcraft isn't for you.Now moving on to the good parts of the film, of which there are many. By far the strongest point of the movie is the acting, every character was 100% believable and when the characters are as outlandish as these ones this is not an easy thing to achieve. The good guys all felt as though they truly had something worth fighting for and everyone of them felt innately human (even the orcs) They had personalities, they had struggles and worries and things that made them happy, they had people they cared about, people they hated and all felt very natural to watch on screen, Toby Kebbell particularly stands out as Durotan. Villains were scary and ruthless and you just couldn't help but hate them for what they were but still love it when the come on screen just because they are so evil.Speaking of the orcs, the CGI is damn near perfect as well, in fact I would go as far to say it was Jurrassic Park level of good, possibly better. The orcs all look like they are actually the hulking great beasts that they are and the level of detail put into them is incredible, so good you can see the hair follicles on the orcs arms. Everything just feels real which again is no easy task considering the source material.The story is simple enough that everyone can follow it but not so simple it becomes boring or tedious. Action scenes are stunning, dialogue is interesting and overall the pacing issues don't hinder the story too much, it just makes some scenes either pointless or rushed, but as said before it does not ruin the film by any means.In the end Warcraft: The Beginning isn't a perfect movie but it sure is a good one and is extremely enjoyable one at that, think along the lines of Pacific Rim but with a fantasy story and better acting. If you're a fan of the Warcraft series you'll definitely enjoy it and even if you're not I recommend you check it out, you'll be pleasantly surprised. This franchise has lot of potential so don't let a good movie or a possibly good franchise go to waste because of what it is or because it's not the masterpiece critics expect it to be. Grab some friends, enjoy a fantasy a movie and just have fun with it, it's truly a world brought to life.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
For me is a GOOD MOVIE,"maybe because i am not playing the World of Warcraft game so i don't know about story, then watch Warcraft without that knowledge, make me get surprise by movie itself, for this movie is really good, and with a great story line too! hope they do the sequel for this ^^ CGI itself for me is fine, well cant be compared to Avatar for sure, but for that fact doesn't really matter as long as they have great story that can make me stay to watch, and that exactly what i got from this movie. Good Story = Good Movie for me. i don't know about you guys, maybe that i got so bored by marvel movie that have boring story and high hope for BvS but in the end disappointed me, so that when i watch this movie without high hope, i became interested. oh well isn't really that great actually, but the movie not disappointed me after all.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A very enjoyable but flawed movie, deserving of a sequel.","I've just emerged from the midnight release of Warcraft in the UK and I felt that this movie needs a review from an honest WoW player.I will be blunt and simple. This movie is great for any WoW players or general Blizzard fans out there; the aesthetic and corresponding CGI are excellent and on-par if not better than expansion cinematics. The main soundtrack theme for this film is different to what you expect but fits well, I hope to download it when possible. What surprised me the most was that I actually enjoyed Ben Schnetzer's Khadgar, and if I'm brutally honest, I think he was the best part of the film.So now, the dreaded flaws... - Pacing: This film is all over the place, scenes are either too short or too long and not enough time is spent in each location (the world created was beautiful beyond belief) - Unnecessary plot points: Without going into too much detail, the film presents many ""emotional"" moments which are both unexpected to viewers and also failing completely to be pulled off by the director. I think that the film could have been without them and it would have flowed much smoother as well. - Changes to Warcraft lore: In short, there's a few SMALL changes to the lore in regard to how certain moments play out, but the result is still the same. I can't say that I personally like the changes at all.Smaller issues: - Young Varian looks like a girl - Much of the ""humour"" added in to humanise the characters (both Orc and Human) feels very cringe-worthy - Travis Fimmel wasn't good as Anduin Lothar and honestly I don't think he's a good actor in my opinion. - Ryan Robbins' character ""Karos"" was underused and his trailer scenes weren't in the movie - Romance: Anduin and Garona's romance is incredibly unnecessary and awkward. (This was in the trailer so don't call me out for spoilers)To summarise, ""Warcraft"" is a very enjoyable film but with a great number of flaws which, to be frank, distracted me at multiple times. I will say that it is not a bad video game movie, and deserves a sequel so to improve upon the mistakes it made. Go see this film, it's worth the money.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Do yourself a favour and go see it in a cinema,"First, let me say that although I have of course heard of the World of Warcraft, I've never played it.The film is visually stunning. Just breathtaking. This just simply cannot be stressed enough. I've seen it tonight and am planning on seeing it again tomorrow. The first 3D film I've seen which deserves to be called 3D (as the entire, and I mean entire film feels like it's happening right in front of you and does not feel like you just have one picture on top of the other, masquerading as 3D) - this needs to be seen in a cinema.Cinematography and camera positioning is as good as it gets - basically it wipes the floor with Captain America: Civil War (which I liked) and anything else you can think of. Trailer does not do it justice. At all.The plot is relatively easy to follow but you do need to follow it as it is not a typical blockbuster where you can almost always tell where the film is going (things fall into place after the first 20 minutes which you'll spend mostly drooling at the graphics anyway, bring tissues). There's an actual story, character development, things happen for a reason. No plot holes that I've noticed, no deus ex machina moments, the film flows without ever being predictable (at least for someone who hasn't played the World of Warcraft) which is not an easy thing to achieve.Acting is very good and the ending is satisfying.I have no idea why so many critics didn't like it but don't allow yourself to be mislead by them. Go and see it. I normally see two films a week in my local cinema and this is the first time ever that I've witnessed the audience going into a spontaneous applause at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Flawed, but good","Is it an amazing movie? Nah. It's definitely flawed, but so is every other film. But is it good, fun, and entertaining? Absolutely. I went to see this film with two of my friends, one a girl and one a guy, neither of whom have even so much as touched the Warcraft series. Both of them really enjoyed this movie. They not only plan to buy it, but say they enjoyed it more than Civil War. I can't say anything there as I haven't seen Civil War, but I still really enjoyed it. It's very true to the lore, with only a handful of minor changes and maybe one moment where I went ""waaaaiiit a second, I don't think that's accurate"".The CGI was AMAZING, the soundtrack was fantastic, and the acting was good all-around. The magic was also REALLY cool and felt very accurate to the Warcraft universe. Some of my favorite parts were just the interactions between Durtan and Drakka and Durotan and Ogrim. For CGI orcs, they had fantastic chemistry and were very believable.My only real complaints:Lothar makes a few too many quips. He was obviously meant to be a joking and sarcastic character, but there was a point where it got to be a little too much, IMO.The first 20 minutes is a big info-dump. For newcomers, this might be a little much to take in. It's a lot like watching the first episode of Game of Thrones where it's attempting to introduce you to every character and land and explain their motivations and who they are.Some characters didn't get a chance to be fleshed out and developed. King Llane was kind of just there for the most part, he never really got any story or development for himself. But I can sort of forgive this because the main focus characters like Khadgar, Medivh, the various Orcs, etc. were all the most entertaining and got a fair bit of development.So, if you enjoy the Warcraft series, you'll probably enjoy this. If you enjoy fantasy in general, you'll also probably enjoy this. Honestly, I'd say to go see this movie if just to support more high- budget game films. Don't listen to the critics who went into this with a negative bias. Worse than the Mario Bros. movie? Don't make me laugh.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
dull and boring,"comparable to the Shannara Chronicles, this is just plain bad. Acting, script, characterizations... as with many movies in the end it's just a boring CGI show, which makes no sense whatsoever. No humor, bad action sequences, nothing is comprehensible - it just feels like a senseless collection of scenes with slightly the same theme. I think no one even cared about it making sense a little bit or about continuity.The design, while true to the games which I like btw., doesn't fit the big screen in any way. It's just plain ridiculous.To the people, who seem to think, they must defend their beloved franchise by ignoring the failure of this movie: even as a WC fan you don't need to like this to be a true fan, you know? It's not heresy to be critical when something is as obviously bad as this adaption. Just think about, what would have been possible with some film making skills involved",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's make me want to play Warcraft (again),"It's a great movie FYI, I already played the game, but trust me, its different stories. so for you all the gamer, don't even think you already know the stories.Oke, the movie isn't perfect, thats why i gave it 7. but the movie is very complete.If you want to see a fantasy movie with so much effect for war, well maybe you'll get disappoint. but, if you want to see a fantasy movie that get everything in one movie, this one is very worthy for you to watch and spend 2 hours of your life for your better mood.You will meet (of course) war, wisdom, sacrifice, sadness, traitor, friendship and of course Love. They make it blended so perfectlyAfter watching this, I'm so exciting to touch the PC and play that game again. I don't know why, maybe the movie touched me so much. :)one advice, if you a ""cannot wait"" person, don't watch it now. because you would feel so teribble to know that you have to wait 1-2 year for the next sequel.so Watch it now, but don't blame me if you feel good and regret later :)",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good visuals but stunningly bad screenplay and amateur acting,"I went in with zero expectations, knowing that most game-inspired movies do poorly, but still had hope since it's Blizzard after all - and they're known for some pretty decent, large games - they wouldn't entrust their brand to some amateur.And that's exactly what they've done. The screenplay is painfully bad: I'm imagining a bunch of guys sitting in a meeting room, brainstorming, and then shouting out random ideas and cliché phrases, and then compiling them haphazardly into an incoherent screenplay.The voice acting, I thought, was pretty well done for the most part. This went well with the pretty good CGI. The CGI was probably the best part of this movie. It didn't try to be too realistic and managed to preserve the ""game"" feel still melding the Warcraft world with the real world.The acting by the human characters was horrible. This mixed with the terrible screenplay and the movie was utterly painful to watch. Some of the acting was alright (think minor characters in Game of Thrones), but the rest was face-palm inducing.The overall idea and story is good, however. That's why I think this movie had so much potential, but sadly, all wasted due to crappy dialogue and crappy acting.There are hints of a sequel. If they do decide to make a sequel, they should fire the director, the screenwriter, and specially Ben Schnetzer who plays one of the main protagonists. His acting was atrocious. Even a total amateur could've done a better job.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"For a warcraft fan it was fairly entertaining, maybe a bit less for other audiences","I am a warcraft fan, and I think that made the film more enjoyable. The movie throws the viewer into a beginning conflict between two races, and the plot follows that conflict. Normally this would be fine, but there is a lot going on on each side, especially in back story, and it isn't really explained or at least sufficiently. For non-Warcraft fans I think they might not be satisfied and confused. For Warcraft fans, you will know the backstory and can move along with the story in the movie. I don't know why they decided to use the story they chose, I think it would have made much more sense to pick a ""back story"" to do the movie around, for example what the book Rise of The Horde goes over.Other than that, the movie looked pretty good, there was some entertaining scenes, it catered to the Warcraft fans pretty well. Some low quality scenes. The story wasn't too interesting, but I am biased having heard the story already.Overall, it was entertaining, but nothing too memorable.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Could be better but no where near as bad as the ""critics"" say it is.","OK, so I've been waiting for this movie to come out ever since the rumors in 2007. I've played WoW and some WC3 in the past so I knew some of the lore. I went to see the movie on the first day, on the 26th. I read some of the early reviews before I went to see it, so I didn't really have high expectations. I think acting for the most part wasn't really great but it was OK. I think Gul'dan and Khadgar were good, Ben Foster played Mediv very well. Lothar and King Llane lacked emotion and Gorona was just bad... CGI was great, I've never seen anything like it. The only thing I really didn't like was the shortness of the movie. Most people here are saying that the story develops too fast and that's true. For people with no knowledge of WC's lore, it's a little hard to understand. I think if the movie was 30min longer, all that wouldn't be a problem.I enjoyed it but it didn't really meet my expectations. I was hoping for 3+ hours of epicness. But I'm sure if they make a sequel, it's going to be much better.I'd rate it around 7.0/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Superb Watch!,"I did wonder if anyone other than a player could appreciate this film or fathom out what on earth was going on... while this was partly true, it was a superb piece of entertainment, with fantastic visuals, stunning effects and some great characters - World of Warcraft regardless! Obviously, every player should see this film and it's sucking me back into the game again after a long break. For non- players, it's worth seeing for the visuals alone - has to be the best fantasy setting I've ever seen rendered on screen. The Orcs are stunningly realised and there are thousands of them - each with unique features and details. I only hope this franchise has legs - if this is the level of quality they can achieve then there is a massive potential for more and better. Good luck to them - I'll be back for more :)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A shadow of what it could have been,"So I watched the Warcraft movie and I found it underwhelming. Not in terms of visuals, of which I found amazing despite being mostly CG, but rather in terms of buildup and relate-ability. The pacing was slow, the characters were walking stereotypes, and the whole conflict could be resolved in a few minutes if people were listening to common sense instead of ignoring the obvious. Hey guys, that green magic thing is not good. Why are you all pretending you don't see it? Then it's the world building that despite feeling like there is a lot to it, they never go beyond surface level. You see Dwarfs and Elves, flying magic islands, lots of kingdoms, and none of them have any personality or lore to distinguish them from any other fantasy setting. Yes, there is definitely a lot of that if you play the game but the movie does not attempt it because it assumes you are already familiar with all that. This does not excuse how bland it feels for anyone who hasn't played the game, and even I who play Hearthstone daily, I found it to be very dull.Then it's the scene transitions which felt very sloppy at many points. They were showing a few seconds of something, before jumping to something else, resulting to not giving you enough time to comprehend or care about its importance. I understand that there are time restraints in moves, you can only do this much in two hours, which begs the question of why did they stuff so many characters when they knew there isn't enough time to flesh them out? They should have a smaller cast or the movie should instead be a series. With everything being bare-bones and shown in a hurry, you are just not engaged.Terrible pacing aside, the story is not special either. It's a pretty straightforward scenario of two civilizations clashing for survival. The concept is OK for making a mediocre war drama out of, but when the solution is so obvious and yet everybody is blind to it, then you cannot take anything seriously. Not to mention how vague everybody's motivations are. Why did the warlock resurrect the baby? Why did the female orc reveal everything about her people right away? Why didn't the wizards sense fel magic when it's everywhere? Why did the orc chieftain challenge the warlock to a duel before he brought all the orcs on Azeroth? There is no clear answer to any of that.Also, they were abusing magic to make anything possible way too often. I lost count of how many times the guardian teleported or opened portals to wherever the hell he wanted. There is never a sense of distance because they can fly or teleport anywhere they want, and the sudden scene transitions are making you assume the whole world of Azeroth has the size of a small country.It is not a complete travesty of a movie, since the colors are pretty, the battle scenes look amazing when magic is not involved, and it doesn't have a typical fairy tale ending. It was actually pretty grim and almost depressing. If you just want to have mindless fun based on a video game you play for years, it's going to be a blast. Other than that, it's only a shadow of what it could have been if it was a series.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Critics are Biased or Paid to Review!,"This movie is an excellent adaptation of the original video game Warcraft (released some 20 years ago).I went in with mediocre expectations but I was blown away by the Story telling / VFX Special Effects and 3D effects.It seems that in this day and age, either critics are paid by Marvel or they just want Marvel Movies to succeed.In my opinion this movie is tons better than Captain America Civil War and in terms of Special Effects its better than X-Men.I would encourage everyone Fans or non-fans to give it a shot as its very rare to find a great Adventurous flick in the age of Automatons and Super Heroes.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful and entertaining - with a few significant flaws,"I'm a gamer - and I've played all the Warcraft games. I never particularly cared for the stories in those games, though, so I didn't go into this with much in the way of preconceived notions.Based on the trailer, I was expecting an underwhelming popcorn B-movie with bad CGI.I was pleasantly surprised.First of all, I have to say the CGI is absolutely gorgeous. I've seen a lot of movies, believe me, and this has to be one of the most convincing fantasy films in terms of visuals alone. The Orcs in particular - are amazing.Anyway, in terms of the heart of the film - the story, characters and the acting - it's sort of a mixture of good and bad.The story itself is simple but effective - and it makes enough sense to give you a reason to care. That said, it's very high-fantasy stuff - and I'm sure some people will be turned off by the emphasis on extravagant magic and such.As for the acting, well, it's a mixed bag.Ironically, the human characters face the most trouble here. Ben Foster as Medivh, for instance, doesn't seem to connect with his role. He looks and sounds as if he's struggling with the material - and as if he regrets being there. Travis Fimmel as Lothar is better, but he also seems to have a hard time just standing still and looking normal. It's as if he's constantly trying to emote something, which makes him over-act on more than one occasion. Paula Patton as Garona goes back and forth between powerful, genuine expression and cringe-worthy melodrama. Surprisingly, I found Ben Schnetzer the best and most convincing actor, playing Khadgar. He was fun and not at all the comic relief I expected him to be.On the opposite side of the coin, we have the Orcs - and to put it simply, they're ALL great. They look incredible and the actors behind them give them real weight and pathos. Durotan, Gul'dan and Blackhand are particularly convincing and masterfully executed. The whole movie might well be better if it was all about these guys.Now, for the action. It's amazingly well done. I saw the movie in 3D - and the live actors meshed convincingly with the animated models - and the action sequences were more or less perfect. I didn't detect a single ""bad 3D"" moment - which is extremely rare. Very exciting stuff, for sure.Speaking of 3D - something I generally don't care much for, this was an exception. Everything jumped out of the screen at you - and it didn't seem tacked on at all. The spectacle felt appropriately close to you - and the striking background images were just fabulous on a grand scale.Sadly, it's not all roses from there.The ending was rushed - and everything wrapped up too quickly - and it didn't quite convince as a plausible series of events towards the end.There's a pretty serious lack of character development in the beginning of the film. The Orcs invade - and the humans seem strangely laid-back and almost casual in their initial response. Things happen without enough build-up. It's 20 or 30 minutes too short for the scale of what's going on, in my opinion.Unfortunately, there's also a somewhat unnecessary subplot involving the son of Lothar - and there's a problem with his acting and the age difference seems off. Lothar simply doesn't look or feel like a father to me. To make it worse, events related to father and son are too cliché and needed more impact.Things like these mean the movie isn't all it could have been.However, the critics are flat-out unfair - and if you're into fantasy movies and a touching spectacle, you need to go see this in the theater, and for once, you should go with 3D.I truly hope it will do enough business to warrant a sequel. Duncan Jones did well here, but he can do even better - and I'd love to see full justice done to the material.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the worst movies in the last 10 years,"This was painful to watch from beginning to end. The writing was atrocious and the acting to match. I couldn't wait for this ridiculous, overproduced movie to end. I have actually never written a review on here but it was so bad that I felt compelled to share how awful it is from beginning to end.The most amazing thing is that the movie made money!! That can only mean that the poor people of earth will be subjected to the birth of another Warcraft movie. I felt like I had to shower and cleanse my body of the cheesy lines when I got home this movie was so bad. hahaIf this doesn't win Worst Picture at the next Razzie Awards, I don't know what will.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Very Watchable,"Yeah, it was alright. I'd go so far as to call it very decent.Good special effects, decent performances and a serviceable story.The script was pretty weak and does let down the film overall, but if you're into this kind of fantasy flick then you'll probably have a good time.It's campy as hell and should have some humour but doesn't, which is disappointing. If you've played any of the old RTS games or WoW then you'll understand it a lot more clearly than complete virgins to the franchise, and there are some nice touches for fans.Overall, very watchable. Don't believe the pro critics, they're just bitter old hacks with no sense of fun. Duncan Jones has obviously put a great deal of effort into making a coherent narrative for something that could easily have been blazed over 4hrs. I'd actually have preferred that (double feature?) but clearly that was too risky for the studio.I hope this does well as there are some truly cracking stories that could be used for future films but only time will tell. Plenty of other terrible films have had multiple sequels (Fast & Furious anyone?) so it's not too much of a stretch to imagine it could happen.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fun for fans. Not absolutely terrible for everyone else.,"If you're a fan of Warcraft in general, then you probably won't get all the hate that's flowing around the internet. It's pretty much the worst thing ever according to a fair number of critics. Fans of the games, however, do get what they wished for (which is a whole lot).If you've never heard about this war and whatever craft they're talking about, then yes, you'll probably be overwhelmed by all of the names and locations thrown around. Sure, they could have slowed down its pace to make certain that everyone gets what's happening and why. Actually, they probably should have done a bit more in that regard.On the other hand, I'm also very glad that they realized that a fair portion of their audience is already quite familiar with the lore, so they decided to advance some of the story points rather quickly. That means you get to the meat of the movie, the battles, early on. As a Warcraft fan, I can appreciate that and vastly prefer the somewhat rushed plot advancement to, say, a Spiderman situation where you get the same origin every damn time in excruciating detail.The visuals look great, the orcs especially. In fact, I thought the orcs looked a great deal better than the humans did. The latter's armor had a distinctly plastic look to them, especially the king's shoulder guard and helmet. The magic also looked suitably impressive. So yeah, the CGI here works very well for the most part (the clay construct being the exception, that thing was awful).To sum it up: Visually impressive movie that does a great deal to please Warcraft fans. If you've ever watched a video game adaption before and were left disappointed because it was some watered-down mishmash that had little to do with the actual game, then you will appreciate what they did with this movie. To anyone else, yeah it may simply not be for you, which certainly isn't your fault. Just try to accept that this movie isn't terrible at what it tries to do, which is to meet the expectations of an already established fan base first and foremost.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good action movie,"Overall, Warcraft is a solid movie that will appeal to both fans of the games as well as others. The acting is good, the plot is not overly simplified and the effects are nothing short of amazing. However, one major shortcoming haunts the movie, which is a lack of proper character building and story arc. Everything seems a little rushed to get the plot going, which is a shame when there is so much lore and character background from the games. Its OK that the storyline diverts from the games a little here and there, but its less forgivable that the story is rushed so much. Its clear that more movies will follow, so there was no need to throw so much into one movie instead of letting the story flow a little slower and allow a more complex narrative to unfold.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

I will watch this movie again in 10 June and gather all my friends that were not lucky enough to see it yet and go again, maybe twice. I need more, there has to be more Warcraft movies. Dunca Jones working alongside with Blizzard was a genius move and it shows throughout the movie. Almost 2 hours of pure awesomeness. 9/10 from me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Give it a fair try!,"It is funny that with 95% of all movies I usually agree with the bigger review sites regarding their quality but ""Warcraft"" turned out to be the one where I don't understand the feeding frenzy of negative reviews. Granted, it is no ground-breaking work like the ""Lord of the Rings"" but it is a very solid piece of entertainment which looks visually stunning at times. Not a single minute was boring, the story (though a departure from World of Warcraft lore as a die-hard fan of the game who watched it with me mentioned) never got cheesy and the acting was up to par. Maybe critics were looking for a work of art and simply got entertainment and that made them so hostile. As an average Joe of a movie goer I got my money's worth here and that is a lot more than can be said about other recent big studio productions.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
An honest opinion,"Okay, let's make one thing clear: I am a massive Warcraft fan. From the games to the lore, I've loved it from the beginning up until now, played all the games, read all the books. But after watching the film last night, I can't help but feel disappointed.Let's start with the cons, the movie was just way too fast paced, especially at the start. On moment we're here, 30 seconds later we've flown a gryphon and now we're over here. It's hard to keep up if you aren't familiar with the game locations, and so whilst watching I felt frustrated at the fact that the film was basically just fan servicing fans of the game, and to move the plot along in it's 2 hour span, use cringe-worthy dialogue to keep it going.That being said, visually, it is amazing. The emotion captured with the cgi orcs was impressive, and the fight scenes were intense as I had hoped. I was still disappointed with the quality of the script and screenplay, but since the director's cut is 40 mins longer (hopefully this will get released on bluray) perhaps the extra scenes will add meat to the incredibly fast paced spectacle..",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Who was that?,"A film that should've helped people whom haven't played the game follow the story just didn't.. I enjoyed the orc story line but the humans was god awful. The CGI was badly done for he humans, would've rather have seen a full orc film, hope the second one is better. I just wonder if the fans of the series will be enough to keep the franchise alive. The cinema I saw it in was rather empty for opening day, I won't be going to play the game any time soon. They jump around place too place a lot and not every character was given time to grow, sadly That is why I gave it a 4/10 hopefully the fans enjoy the film and it did it fan service.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Film of the Year,"I like many people I know spend at least ten hours a day streaming movies on services like Netflix or Amazon. I like to believe that due to my extensive experience watching and critiquing films as well as studying all aspects of the film making process, my opinion carries some weight.Having said that I would like to also say that Warcraft was the best video game to film adaptation I have ever seen. It had everything a geek could want and more. Not only did it stay more true to the source material than any other adaptation, it also paid a glorious amount of attention to detail. This film transported me into Azeroth. Every single scene was filled with recognizable content. Ranging from the characters to the background it was familiar and accurate. The film painted an exact replica of my imagination. Taking my experiences while playing any warcraft title and making them real. It was literally heart poundingly real, thanks to amazing work from the special effects team.I could not give this movie a higher rating. I saw this movie on Friday and promised I would never write a shotgun review. Luckily, my opinion has not changed within that time. In fact, it has actually grown on me and is calling me back to the theater. THATS RIGHT! I am going to see Warcraft again tomorrow evening. I promise you it is worth it.Pros - Visuals, attention to detail, action, some of the characters (Gul'dan, Durotan, Orgrim=Fantastic performances), comedy, story, unique. Cons - only one! I could not get behind the acting of Khadgar. His accent would change a couple times throughout the film which as a result pulled me from the illusion.BOTTOM LINE - Must watch. At the very least 9/10",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good Movie,"I have to be honest. I am a big Warcraft fan, and so I acknowledge that I am somewhat biased to the movie because of it. That having been said, the movie was great. The effects were on point, the visuals were amazing, and all of it stayed very true to the source material, with a few acceptable exceptions, and was a fun experience. That said, I understand why some people were disappointed. It feels like a full third of the movie is missing our cut out, and the pace seems to pick up to be far too fast towards the end. There is no denying the shortcomings, (which will hopefully be resolved in the directors cut)even for us die hard fans. Unfortunately, I understand why this was the case: They have to introduce a lot of this world to get to the point where the story will really shine, and that is regrettably, at least a movie away if they want a coherent, understandable continuity . It doesn't make up for those shortcomings at the moment, but it is necessary to get to the real story, and I hope that its success will be measured in what it will herald in the future.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I was so excited to see this.,"As a fantasy fan, I was disappointed. As a Warcraft fan, even more so.This should have been a miniseries. There is WAY TOO MUCH lore left untouched, characters left undeveloped, and questions left unanswered. If you know Warcraft, you'll have fun. It won't be great, but it'll be fun. I've been a fan since Warcraft 2, and all the things they assume you know (like the orc homeworld, the races, the backstory of characters), was incredibly distracting and kept me from being immersed in an otherwise beautiful film.This movie tries to cram so much in such a short time, it leaves too much left unsaid, and not enough room to make you feel anything.I hate to say it, but I'd rent this one when it's out of theaters.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyable,"I saw the movie today. I myself haven't played Warcraft so I didn't have any expectations. The story itself was not difficult to understand and there were lots of cool graphics including awesome buildings, etc. So I thoroughly enjoyed watching the movie. About characters, Travis Fimmel did a good job as a main character. I liked his character in Vikings and there he made Ragnar as a great and unique warrior who doesn't resemble any other warriors in the movies that I saw. But I was slightly disappointed that his character as Ragnar in Vikings was still showing in this new role. Especially in the early part of the movie. Maybe it was intentional. I don't know. But I think he eventually developed his own Anduin later in the movie. The female characters in the movie are somewhat weak compared to the male ones. I hope to see more of strong female warriors in the next sequel. Overall, I would recommend this movie and am looking forward to seeing the next one.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A video-game movie done right?,"I first need to address where I come from going into this movie. I have played many of Blizzard entertainments(he creator-company behind the Warcraft Universe) games and I have also sunk hours upon hours into the lore of Warcraft. And as both a gamer and a Warcraft lore nerd I think this is so far one of the FEW(If not the only) movies, based on a video-game franchise, that can hold up to the franchise it's representing. And with that being such a rare thing this movie deserves the biggest praise.With that said though, as a movie, it has obvious flaws. But also moments that are excellent. There is some parts that you just can see where Blizzard have had their hand in making things that are as true to what makes their video games on a unparalleled scale. And that is the ""CGI"". The Orcs and their home-world looks amazing and you cannot help but to feel strongly for the animated characters in many different ways just because of how they look, move, act and talk. It's truly, yet again, a masterpiece of art created by Blizzard. They really feel like they have a soul unlike many other animated movies and cut-scenes created now a days.With that said though. If I had not read and invested so much time beforehand and already knew these characters and where they came from I most likely would be VERY confused as to what was going on on the screen. Especially the first parts that throw you from scene to scene and character to character making it very hard to follow and get emotionally invested as to what's being shown. And even though that is not as big of an issue in the rest of the movie it's still there and it made made it hard to be able to connect to the characters as I wanted to and many of the witty and emotional scenes that could have been great fell short because of it.And when the ""CGI"" parts still won my heart due to how excellently made they are. The parts with real life actors made me cringe most of the time and also the choice of actors felt off. It made the movie at parts more feel like a mediocre sci-fi/fantasy TV show than a big movie production. I so wanted it work but I knew it was going to be hard for me even before I went into the movie-theater as I have never been a fan of the mix of animated characters and real actors. And when the non-animated parts feel closer to a low budget production than a high budget one it throws me off even more.Now I could have been fine with all of the non-animated parts flaws IF they had taken the time to develop all the characters and the story. I very much want to make a parallel to Lord of the Rings since if they had followed a similar model to LOTR and made the movie 30-60min longer and worked the scenes(specially the parts in the beginning) in a way as to not make it feel as rushed, not only would the choice of actors have felt as weak but many of the scenes in the movie would have hit closer to home than it does in its current shape. One could hope that there is a Directors cut or something similar to get your hands on in the future, if so, wait for that. It would be worth it.BUT with that said, for this to be one of the few(or the first) TRUE movie based on a video-game world that stays true to the world at hand it does get a big plus, as well as for the animated parts.As a video-game fan or a Warcraft fan this movie is a yes. As someone who does not have any prior knowledge or interaction of the Warcraft world, I don't see how this movie would be anything for you. But if you like amazing animations. Go for it. But you most likely will not leave this movie behind you with your emotions swayed in any way even though many scenes try to get you there.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I wanted Warcraft,"When I went to see this movie I wanted to experience Warcraft.I wanted to experience Warcraft-game-trailer-like action, spells and magic, Blizzard humor, beautiful scenery of Azeroth and its kingdoms, the old heroes of Warcraft, well-equipped and skilled human warriors vs brutish bloodthirsty orcs, a worthy lore adaption, and much more...And what did I get? I got all of it! If you like and understand fantasy games and movies, well, you're gonna have a blast. I see a lot of poor reviews from ""professional"" critics and all I can think is; they do not speak for the communities that are passionate about medieval-fantasy and gaming (or Blizzard/Warcraft) at all. They are so far off.To be honest though, I wouldn't actually give the movie 10/10 if it weren't for 2 things; the way it is executed and my passion about Warcraft, gaming and fantasy. There were a few things in the movie that I felt were slightly lacking. I mean, I would still have given it 8 or 9. I raise the score to 10 because of how the movie is executed. The fight scenes and battles were truly amazing, even though they're not as epic as they could have been. To make up for that, the movie provided an epic utilization of magic and spells - I was blown away by this! With everything considered, including that it is a game-to-movie adaptation, I can't help but to feel that it is somewhat revolutionary. To me it was an unique experience, just like when I watched movies/series such as the Matrix, the Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones for the first time. I was entertained on so many levels. I got goose bumps and teary eyes several times throughout the entire movie.I highly recommend it. Go watch it! 10/10 from me!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Emotions and breath taking story,"Went to this movie with friends who play the game and friends who do not play the game. we all left with positive vibes and excitement. The movie is great the acting is very well done. I was surprised at how well they described the scenes for people who do not play the game while still leaving the audience curious to what is coming up in the next sequel. I usually take a smoke break or 2 during a movie, but the chain of events in this movie kept me pinned to my chair and time passed by so quick that i was disappointed when the movie was over. i was so ready to sit for another 2hrs to see what will happen next.Do NOT miss this movie definitely one of the best movies if not the best movie in 2016.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Worth watching, one of the best video game to movie adaptation.",I am not a Warcraft fan and have never played the games. I a familiar with the property.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.And critics saying that it is a inside movie where only the people that are fans and have played the game will understand the characters and the movie is nonsense. The movie explains and sets out what we a viewers need to know. and takes us on the journey. It is the beginning and if the franchise continues we will find out more.Saying that it I must explain that it is a self contained movie and they did not do a BvS where they were building up the next movie .This movie was very enjoyable and entertaining.

"Forget what the critics say about this movie, it's a well-made, fun and entertaining movie!","I'm no fan of the Warcraft video games or the lore (Didn't even know the movie is based on those the first I went to see it), but I've seen it 3 times now, partly maybe I'm a fan of fantasy movies, but most definitely the movie is fun, entertaining and easily transported me to that Azeroth universe.The last time I watched a movie 3 times in cinemas was The Guardians of the Galaxy, which is also a sprawling, high fantasy movie, albeit a space opera one.There's surely flaws with Warcraft, but when the movie has that magical quality of making you instantly feel you are right in that universe, all those flaws fade away. All the characters in the movie are likable, and they are very nuanced, not one character is black or white. The humour are sprinkled here and there delicately. And the magic! They depict the magic in such grand, and majestic way. I think what almost everyone say about the pacing is probably correct, It seems 2 hours was not enough to tell the background stories of many of the important characters (I wanted more stories of Khadgar, Medivh and Garona), and for a non-fan it can be confusing to tell apart one Orc from another, although on my second viewing, they become all clear.2 hours flew by (and that's a sign that a movie is very enjoyable) and I actually wanted more. I felt it should have been longer, which is very rare to say these days. One thing for sure: I will definitely watch the sequels and I am hoping Legendary and Blizzard give free reign to Duncan Jones in making the sequels the way New Line Cinema and Warner Bros gave free reign to Peter Jackson when making LOTR. Legendary should also stay away from editing the future sequels! Let Duncan Jones work his magic.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Screw the ""Professional Critics""","You know what? Screw the ""Professional Critics"" they're just out for Gamer clicks like Jimmy Fallon. Some of them are just talking pure poop. Honestly this movie is great! I enjoyed it every single minute of it.However I cannot give it a full 10/10 because of the abrupt ending. Other than that damn I wish it was longer dammit! Duncan Jones please make a 4 hour version of this! I definitely want more.I actually went in the theater with very low expectations because of the trailer with the dub step music. Dammit this is Warcraft! Fricking Dubstep for a fantasy film!Some parts of the film blew my mind as a fan of the franchise. It was just unbelievable how the story actually went. It's like a re-telling of the same story but with a different perspective and that different perspective add so much more depth into the original story.I implore you to go watch it with your family and friends.

Best fantasy since LOTR (even superior in certain aspects),"Characterisations are incredible and duels are outstanding.
I cannot imagine how better they could portray that disgustingly colorful the world.
Pity they had to cut the movie to reduce the screen time and never released a directors cut. Thus it may be a bit difficult for a casual viewer to follow the plot and understand certain character motivations (Medivh) without knowing the source material.
Potential directors cut could fix most of it and shift the score undoubtly to 10/10.
Yet the film suffers basically because of limiting the directors vision.
And in majority poor reviews are mainly revealing worthless reviewers.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So much better than the pathetic game.,"World of Warcraft is a boring pathetic game but Warcraft the movie was done fantastically! Its more inline (to me) with Warcraft which was fun and like the game the movie is fun with a hint of douchy for the world of Warcraft morons(the ones who didn't like it) so in my opinion it's a great movie. A movie is flat out entertainment, that's all it's supposed to be. I have enough drama and pain in my life I don't need to watch it, what I need is to be entertained and to forget about my problems and just enjoy something and this absolutely does that in a big way!Its well written, brilliantly acted and honestly directed, the cinematography is impeccable and the effects and sets are over the top fantastic!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply a must see for fans and a great way to show your friends what they've been missing!,"Fist off, I'm a long time player of World of Warcaft and so yes, I'm invested in the franchise, the characters and the world so this movie doesn't have to stand alone for me as an introduction to the subject.That being said I'm a grown man and this is a movie, not the game and I'm really very fussy about what I like and what I don't, so I must admit some of the reviews and the initial trailers had made me concerned I might be disappointed in a lightweight take on the hugely developed Warcraft universe.I should not have worried however as nothing could have been further from the truth. From the moment the film started till the very last credit scrolled off the screen, I and the rest of the mostly full (it was past midnight when it ended) cinema couldn't move from our seats or wipe the smiles off our faces.I can honestly say, go see this movie and take your long suffering Warcraft widows!! The only thing I would honestly have changed would have been for there to have been even more of it. Could have quite happily stayed another hour immersed in the world so lovingly reproduced on screen.Well done, can't wait for more.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"As a non-gamer, I was surprised how much I liked it","I don't usually like games turned into movies, however, Warcraft was a pleasant surprise. The movie was moderately violent, but I would be happy for my young teens to see it. What surprised me was the absence of ""girl power"" lines in the movie, which is a rare treat in itself when you aren't bombarded with sexism. It also showed fairly realistic female portrayals, which is almost unheard of in Hollywood in the last few decades. If you like over-the-top female ninja warriors who are smarter and stronger than any man in the movie, this is not your movie. The story is simple enough to follow. Different races and classes are well defined. Magic was fairly straight forward. There are two armies fighting for land for survival. Fight scenes were surprisingly easy to follow, despite large armies at play. The camera work made a huge difference as did clean special effects and solid story boarding. What I found hard to take was the slow pace of the movie and wooden acting of some of the main human characters. The 2 human sorcerers and human warrior were mediocre actors. However, the Orcs (excluding their wizard) were mostly excellent. I especially liked that orcs had genuine and rounded personalities (eg. Friendly laughs and comradery). It stayed true to their warrior nature, but gave them depth beyond the usual villain. With tighter pacing and better directing for the humans, I could see great things for this series. I would definitely see a sequel if it was released.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Amazing!,This was shown here in the Philippines on May 25 and I must say that this movie is really amazing. I like what Duncan Jones and Blizzard did and I hope that there will be more sequels to this movie. Hoping that more Warcraft characters will be added in the future. The Computer Graphic effects are amazing. I should say that they CG has almost the same quality with Avatar. All actors are good. One downside of this movie would be for the audience who doesn't have any idea about the Warcraft Lore. It would be hard for them to understand as the movie has a very fast pacing of story. I would recommend this movie and hoping for a sequel.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Brilliantly Executed and Totally Surpassed My Expectations,"I am a Warcraft fan ever since I was about 14 years old and old habits die hard to the game until now. Ever since I heard about Warcraft that it would be made into a movie, I was very excited to see it.When I heard that it would be delayed for a couple of years, it made me sad. So I have to wait and wait until such time that I am very excited from the announcement of Blizzard that they finalized the release date.And then when I saw the movie, I was amazed that the release date delays were paid off. I like the visual effects that they delivered from the characters down to the places that I could recall the places that they mentioned from the game. Glad that I can relate to the story from the game itself, which is by far hints the story plots from the game. Still I'm pretty stoked on the visual effects and I could not get enough of it.It did surpassed my expectations and I am not disappointed at all.

immersive magical fiction,"""Storyline"" right from the very beginning unwinds coherently to keep viewer completely engaged in the immersive blend between animated fictional characters and special-effected lustrous humans. Although, there exist segments like 'Medivh' going over to the dark side of magic while again protecting 'King Llane' and his army, that yearn some explanation.""Graphics"" make you feel the sheer force with which the orcs attack while equally contrasting the effect of magical forces that hold them in-line.

Warcraft it's not only the best video game movie ever...,"It's also one the most entertaining movies of the year, and for me, the best so far. I enjoyed every minute of it more than Deadpool, Civil War, X-Men and BvS (and I truly enjoyed them), but I think it's because I wasn't expecting anything of a video game movie, of a game that I haven't even played. But I gave it a try and... Oh, boy! This flick is AMAZING! A must watch in the big screen! A cult classic is born !!! 10/10!!! The CGI is FANTASTIC, rich in details and immersive. The cinematography, the action, the music... almost everything is perfect! And you can easily forgive the imperfections you can find, because you can feel the passion of the director who cares too much developing a great experience for the viewer. But you have to live this experience on your own and not by reading the reviews of others. In the fantastic realm, I put it in a level a little below of the grandiose LOTR series but better than The Hobbit series, and much better than any one of the Harry Potter film series and, obviously, all of the rest. I loved ALL the characters, especially Durotan (his honor), Gun'lan (this guy is truly evil), Medivh (and his last redemption), Lothar (a charismatic swashbuckler) And I want more! I want an ULTIMATE EDITION with 40 minutes extra and I want a TRILOGY, please!!! Thank you so much, Duncan Jones!

Underrated movie!,I needed to raise my voice regarding this movie as most of the reviews I have seen so far have been negative.It feels as if everyone is jumping on the bandwagon and that every critic out there can not admit that the movie was highly enjoyable. Because it really is.The plot is perhaps not deepest and the characters could perhaps been given a bit more depths.But it is beautiful and is a really good adventure. It is a beautiful movie with some amazing scenes and the CGI is otherworldly.I am really looking forward seeing more movies from the Warcraft universe.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Maybe it was those low expectations and my utter surprise that added two stars to those four. I really don't know, I just know I really enjoyed it.So the story line about the humans sucked. Sucked. Another reason I can't believe I rated it a 7. The film is so cliché it hurts. It was the story about the orcs that made it worthwhile. Maybe the orcs added a third star.And there you have it. 7 stars and me, all astonished and really looking forward to a sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
10 out of 10,I've seen this movie few days ago and all I can say is that it was absolutely amazing experience to watch all those amazing animations and action in 3D. The orcs and humans look seriously good and story is also well written. I hope that there will be more Warcraft films coming in future because the lore of Warcraft universe is huge. I'd love to see development of story and appearance of Illidan and Arthas on TV screen because I think it would be even more cool. So my conclusion is that I recommend everyone to watch this movie because it is truly amazing.

"A decently (war)crafted game adaptation, but what's the hurry?","Duncan Jones made a name for himself as a director of highly intelligent science-fiction movies with a fair dose of humanism, so he sounded like an ideal guy to deliver a game adaptation that would stand out as really good for a change. Choosing Warcraft was risky, however, since it has become a multi-game franchise over the decades, one with its own complex story lines, characters and mythology. Distilling a story thread out of a game's lore that is cinematically satisfying while still doing justice to the gaming experience is a trap that many a director has fallen into. So the question is: did Jones succeed? My answer is: yes and no.Although I have played my share of Warcraft, I am no hardcore fan or connaisseur (I sort of lost interest halfway through WCIII: Frozen Throne), but I cannot deny that Jones delivered a pretty convincing visual representation of how I remember the Warcraft universe. The cities and castles look impressive and lush; the Orcs look physically imposing, realistic and dangerous, but they never become mindless beasts; and the colorful human armors and weapons are instantly recognizable from the games. The battle scenes look impressive and brutal, without going into much gory and appendage-shedding details (since teens should also be able to enjoy this). The CGI, often the scapegoat that disappointed audiences aim for, looks almost flawless here, and convincingly helps to create this universe. It was a prudent move of Jones to cast mainly Caucasian actors as the Orcs, because many directors before him had to battle allegations of racism for having a tribal people played by non-white actors. Both humans, Orcs and half-breeds are portrayed by a diverse mix of ethnicities now, which works fine.But did Jones really need to be in such a rush to get the story told? I haven't kept a score, but the first 15 minutes introduces about 5 different locations, 10 characters and maybe 7 unique terms. It is as if the entire first act contains more information than both 'Moon' and 'Source Code' combined. I love a bit of fast pacing, but here I got exhausted to keep up with this frenetic storytelling. Jones' scripts are usually pretty well- written, but here it is easily the source of most of the movie's shortcomings, or maybe it is in the editing. I had the distinct feeling that this was originally a 3-hour movie that had to be cut back to 2 hours on studio demand. Many characters are thrown in with little to no introduction (it's usually not a good sign if you have to learn character names from the end credits); some of the peoples (Elves and Dwarfs mainly) are merely referenced, so you never get a sense that Azaroth is such a diversely populated world; and some sequences evoke the feeling that a lot of exposition is missing (even some of the action scenes lack coherence). That makes it difficult to get absorbed into the story, or care for the characters, despite some nice, unexpected twists at the end, which would have worked much more satisfyingly had we known the characters better. Maybe I am spoiled by Game Of Thrones, where I get to know and love the characters over the course of many hours, and feel genuine heartache when they get killed off, but Jones should really have put more effort in building a solid foundation with a backstory and the characters.So, a nice visual attempt to make a faithful game adaptation, but again, the difficulty of translating game to screen is showing. I had a good time with it, but as the subtitle says: it is a beginning, and hopefully a good starting point for a better fleshed-out sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Excellent Film,"As a longtime fan of the Warcraft series, upon hearing about the film, I feared that it would be horrible. Up until the moment I reached the theater, I was concerned that the movie might be as bad as critics have been claiming. I was so wrong. The movie as a whole was filled with stunning special effects, the actors portrayed their characters perfectly, and the story was very well put together.I watched the film alongside a friend of mine who was not familiar with the original story of the Warcraft games, and outside of a few questions, she was able to completely understand and enjoy the entire movie.If you are a fan of the Warcraft franchise or are simply looking for an entertaining fantasy film, I would highly recommend this film to you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly not bad,"I've played MMo's however lasted all of 10 minutes in World of Warcraft however after Duncan Jones, David Bowie's son and director of Moon, got handed the reigns I was interested. Then the movie got released and slammed. When I got around to watching it was anticpating something awful. 5 minutes in I was to my girlfriend ""god this looks like the video game its pandering"". Me and my girlfriend who's not really into this kind of thing then got pleasantly surprised. Thanks largely to a decent cast, the charismatic Fimmel, Patten and underused Cooper who's lines were as bad as his hair, Warcraft manages to reveal a bit of the bones of a decent director at the helm underneath all that Warcraftiness. Its steeped in it's Warcraft clothes but still manages to rise a little bit above the generic fodder it should have been.

Sound is great, animations are not bad but everything a movie needs (A Storyline that grabs and holds my attention, good character development, believable characters, ...) is not in it. The movie has so many flaws I can't even keep track of them. Sure there are some moments where you might smile, but those moments are not worth the money.

"Warcraft gains zero experience points for a compelling fantasy movie, but something for amazing effects and battle scenes","One memory that will last from college was simply passing through my dormitory. Why that? Because most of the open doors became ironic statements when most of the students were at their desks with headphones in as they placed themselves in a fantasy world. This adventure they were a part of was the World of Warcraft. While I've seen it and even saw the episode tribute on South Park, I have never played the online sensation that still remains one of the biggest selling computer games of all time. Like anything popular, Hollywood is going to want to take a shot at it at some point.The issue once again is that Hollywood has a terrible track record for video game movies. Hit-man: Agent 47 and Ratchet and Clank have proved that the material is simply incompliant in a cinematic light. Is it the people making the game? Is the people in front of the camera? It's hard to say, so Blizzard, the company behind World of Warcraft, has taken more a production role to try and ensure a proper adaptation. They've even hired Duncan Jones, the creative genius behind Moon and Source Code. With the game company and a good director in tow, does Warcraft finally crack the video game adaptation problem?We begin in the fictional world of the orcs, Dreanor, where the planet is dying. Several orc clans follow the direction Gul'dan (played by Daniel Wu) and his magic through a portal that leads them into Durotan, the world of the humans. One of the orcs that made it, Durotan (played by Toby Kebbell) joins Gul'dan's war band as they raid several villages to take the land in their name. The humans of this world are a part of a medieval kingdom as run by King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper).Top knight commander Sir Anduin Lothar (played by Travis Fimmel) does his best to strategize against the bigger orcs which prove to be a bigger problem then anticipated. He starts to work with a mage (magical person) Khadgar (played by Ben Schnetzer) who consult the guardian wizard Medivh (played by Ben Foster). They gain their first clue when they can trace bits of the magic that the orcs have been using. While scouting, they encounter a half-orc woman Ganrona (played by Paula Patton) whose caught in the middle of this invasion. Meanwhile, Khadgar is questioning the intentions of Gul'dan as both sides face each other for the first time.Did you get all of that? I hope so, because Warcraft spews A LOT of fantasy elements that I assume are from the source material. I'll take a wild guess that the movie follows the game very closely, because this made me feel like the guy coming to a comic shop trying to eves drop on a bigger group of fans trying to understand what their talking about. The problem here is definitely the script that has trouble trying to create some history and understanding of the orcs. This seems like the best thing would to have simply made the villains evil.Now what's interesting is that the orcs are the best element in Warcraft. The motion-capture and CGI is some of the best I've seen. They way the skin tones react to the light really make you forget your watching animated characters. The story of orc Durotan was the most intriguing side to hear from, so why couldn't they have done the same for the humans. I could care for any of these people cause all, not some, but all of the human actors were terrible. They only got good when the battle sequences happened, which were also well staged and shot.I'll give this three copies of World of Warcraft out of ten. If the other video game movies made the mistake of hiring a director with little knowledge of the source, then this is the other extreme; hiring someone who can't translate everything into an entertaining fantasy movie. Warcraft had a lot of potential but will be seen as too much work for a mainstream audience. Even if I did know the material, I doubt the movie would still be good.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

First I thought: This guy ries to act like Ragna until I regognized it was the same actor.Sure, its far away from a really good movie.

"A sometimes very campy fantasy movie, that manages to deal with questions of identity and different family types in an interesting way.","So, it is easy to dismiss Warcraft - The Beginning as a campy, convoluted fantasy movie. But if you take a closer look, you can clearly see Duncan Jones' handwriting. The way, this movie deals with topics of identity, relationship and finding your place in the world, lifts it above average.I have very little knowledge about the lore of Warcraft. Actually, all I know about it comes from playing the related Hearthstone card game. Compared to the HUGE behemoth, Warcraft is, I think, it's safe to say, that I know nothing about it. And yes, I often felt completely lost in the packed story line of this movie. You could see the director struggling with at least a dozen major characters, trying to give everyone enough screen time and something meaningful to do. To my surprise, this worked much better, than it could have. But still, I often found myself asking: What on Azeroth is going on here?What kept me in this movie was the way, Jones' managed to give the story arc a greater meaning. There were interesting things about different family types and how to live with them in it. There was the Wechselbalg, raised by people who would be their enemies. There was the average family with parents who cared about their newborn, just trying to live a normal, peaceful life as everyone does (and how great, that we find this type of family amongst the Orc, who are supposed to be the villains). There was the widowed father, trying to be a good dad, despite blaming his son for the mother's death.Jones has dealt with identity, the question, what makes a person a person and stuff like that in his previous movies. So it absolutely makes sense, that he picks up on that in this movie as well. He also manages to have strong female characters and even passes the Bechdel test, who would have thought that!? This movie has flaws aplenty. But there is also a lot of interesting stuff in it and it's definitely one of the better computer game adaptations.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good concepts but messy execution,"There are a lot of pros and cons to Warcraft. The movie unfortunately struggled to communicate a lot of ideas very quickly and as a result it came across as very rushed and lacking in depth. The characters aren't really given enough time to be established and as a result many of their interactions came across as forced. It was difficult to relate to the characters because their motives aren't given an opportunity to be fleshed out. I think it's a shame because a lot of the ideas were actually good. The use of magic within the story worked quite well and rather than characters simply firing off random spells without explanation, only a few spells are used but they are explained, each one has a distinct purpose and is used in multiple ways. The plot itself wasn't bad but the events themselves seemed disjointed and poorly paced, so as a result it was hard to invest in what was happening.While I have a reasonable understand of the Warcraft story and I have played most of the games I still found it a bit difficult to get familiarized with exactly what was happening. Characters seemed to jump from place to place without a lot explanation as to what they were really doing. There is no sense of scale to the world because everyone seems to get everywhere nearly instantly without any sense of time passing. The human battle strategies are poorly explained and the outcome of many of the battles doesn't seem to make any sense. For a movie that is based off of a series of strategy games it would have been a lot better if battle strategy actually had more relevance to the plot.Many of the relationships between the characters also come across as unnatural and unearned. There are multiple betrayals in the plot but when they happen it doesn't really have a lot of impact because the time wasn't given to establish the initial bonds between the characters. Twists and turns in the characters relationships seem to happen overnight, without a lot of explanation as to how and why their feelings change.Overall, I don't think the movie is as bad as a lot of critics have indicated. Warcraft at least aspires to tell a story that is more than just a straight up action movie. There was a plot here that could have been quite good. The problem was that it was very rushed, the events and characters were poorly established and the ideas aren't really explained in any depth. The rapid pace of events offered very little time to establish its characters and sink into its word and lore. If the movie had better pacing and showed those establishing moments in a more immersive way it would have elevated the quality of the movie substantially. The Blizzard cinematics do an excellent job of doing that, so it really is a shame that the movie failed to provide that same excellent sense of tone and atmosphere.I would give this movie 5.5/10 it is slightly above average. It had a lot going for it in terms of ideas but the execution fell short in many different areas. It's worth watching if you are hungry for a decent fantasy movie, if not I would say the movie probably won't do much for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I had a blast!,"Just came back from the WARCRAFT movie premiere with my guild (germany).First of all: It was fantastic! I felt being home every second of the movie. The settings, the scenarios and details couldn't have been better.The CGI was except for 2/3 small scenes the best I've ever seen (Can easily compete with Avatar and Planet of the Apes).The only criticism I have is that Travis Fimmel, who is really great in Vikings, kinda seemed not to fit into Azeroth (He actually stated in a interview that he felt very uncomfortable filming with green screens)My favorite characters of this movie are Durotan, Orgrim and Khadgar. The villains were also very believable. Ghuldan was frickin bad-ass and our other beloved Warlords had there moments too!There were some small lore-adjustments for the sake of better translating the game into the movie. But nothing game-changing or important! As a lore-expert (WoW Veteran, played the RTS series, watched all Nobble-videos and read most of the books) I was totally satisfied since Duncan included all major events in the movie sticking to the original game-lore! I just sat there waiting for the next major plot-point and Duncan delivered perfectly!The movie was loaded with game references and eastereggs from the MMORPG and the audience loved it. Even the non-players were amazed...so don't hesitate bringing your friends that never tried Warcraft before!The movie could have been slightly darker, but the fighting scenes were already borderline for the age-restriction that the movie got. The tone was similar to the Avengers 2 movie (partially humorous partially serious).I rate this movie 9/10 as a Warcraft Fan. If I leave all the references aside that are made for Fanservice it is still a very solid Fantasy-Movie, so I'm going with 7/10 for regular movie-watchers!-> Think the movie will settle at 8/10 overallHave fun everyone. I'm waiting for the BluRay now and pray for a trilogy announcement",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A great start for a movie that will turn into a masterpiece of a series.,"Let me just start by saying this movie is beautiful, it is visually stunning.The first thing that struck me with this movie was how lifelike the orcs were. The details were absolutely amazing, and you forget that these are CGI, as they are just so lifelike. On top of that the movie truly shows of Azeroth in the most visually striking way. The combat, the magic, and not to mention the costumes are nothing but perfect.Now for the story and the execution of the movie. I have played the RTS games, WoW, and even read some of the lore, however it is several years ago, and I can't remember much. To me the story was a little thin, and I would have liked more backstories, to get a deeper connection with the characters. This is the only movie ever I wish was another hour long. I can understand that to some this movie is difficult to follow. But if you pay close attention, and remember faces you will never feel lost. The movie is executed very well in the time it uses, the action scenes were glorious. The movie found a good balance between battles and character interactions in order to best introduce the Warcraft world to the viewer.I believe the movies needs more work in the future, but now after the first movie, it will be much easier tweaking the next to become the perfect game to movie adaptation. The reason for the vote 10 is because the movie left me wanting more, and truly entertained me. It is packed with action, drama, comedy and of course the greatly appreciated fan service.I want more.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warcraft : Feels like rain,Warcraft (2016) was based on a video game which is 20 years old and still loved among video game fanatics globally.But I never played it. So the criticism by game fans and critics of making injustice to the video game's universe by the filmmaker's is invalid to me.So as film fanatic this was kind of like a drizzle to the fantasy film genre in a long time. Besides the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit franchise there were not many fantasy films in the modern context.The benchmark LOTR kept was intense and hard to achieve for another fantasy film but this tries okay with new innovative CGI and story arcs.The characters and emotions are flat. But that's what fantasy is.A really good fantasy action film.Overall - 3.5/5,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
0 out of 10,"From a Warcraft ii fan: this movie stinks.Cheesy, wooden, slow, formulaic, amateurish.. the list goes on.I expected Easter eggs, inside jokes and fan favorite units, but all you get is plot device, heavily scripted dialogue and boredom.The action consists of really slow battles, no special creatures, again lots of dialogue.I stayed, hoping to see creatures and scenery, but got neither. You really can't have cgi characters unless they're fantastical and expressive, like golem etc. Too bad the real actors in the film give dull performances as well. O out of 10",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A very exciting movie with great effects that lost me a little bit in the story aspect, but fans of the game will love it.","""From light comes darkness, and from darkness, light."" After their homeworld is threatened a horde of Orcs open a portal to the human world of Azeroth in hopes of conjuring it and claiming it as their own. The humans, led by Anduin (Fimmel) begin to fight back with the help of half-Orc Garona (Patton). The humans must not only fight of the oncoming Orc army, but also evil magic forces that threaten everyone involved, Orc and human. This is a movie I wanted to see even though I have never played the game before. My son plays it but honestly until this movie I didn't know the game even had a story to it. While I will admit the effects and action sequences are very exciting in this, this is not a movie for the casual fantasy fan. This reminded me of the Hobbit movies in the way that the movie expects you to come in with some knowledge of each race and back story. For those that have played the game that is not a problem, for the rest of us it comes across as confusing and muddles the movie a little bit. For me at least. Overall, a very exciting and action filled movie with great effects that lost me a little bit in the story aspect, but fans of the game, or this movie genre will love it. I give this a B.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Now this is a all-out fantasy film,"This film makes me smile. I mean, when they announced they were going to make it, and especially after seeing the first trailer, I couldn't believe what I was witnessing. The Warcraft games are... such nerdy games. I mean, they feature all kinds of overblown fantasy races engaging in war eternal against one another, each of them extremely silly in a way that only geeks and nerds can really appreciate. And the film seemed to reflect that perfectly. Had the nerd culture really penetrated our society so thoroughly that a film like this could succeed.Yes, yes it has. This film is exactly like the games. I mean sure, there's far more plot than in the games, it's not just battle scene after battle scene - thank the heavens - but it's still instantly recognizable and remains extremely faithful to the story and, most of all, spirit of the games.So yeah, if you're not familiar with the games or at least bulk fantasy style in general, there's a moderate to high chance that you're going to feel a bit lost. It's filled with exotic names, weird creatures, vast landscapes and lore so deep that even I as a hardcore nerd despair at knowing it all. It certainly works as a generic action adventure fantasy, but the lure of it is in its faithfulness to the games. And the visuals, I suppose, though the film relies very heavily on CGI, like it really has to with the visuals themselves being so outlandish.So yeah, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Sure, the plot is clunky, the characters clichéd (though the actors actually managed to pull almost all of them off beautifully), the visuals silly at times and overall I can definitely see that it's not for everyone. But for fans of the genre, it's something we've never seen before. Something I personally didn't believe we'd ever see.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Professional"" Critics are wrong!","Don't even read the professional critics or reviews for this movie, they are and have always been biased against video game adaptations.The story starts off fast and could be an information overload for some viewers but eventually catches up into the middle of the movie to display a vivid insight into the struggles and stories of both protagonists. The voices, musical pieces, and CGI are all well done. There were no awkward moments in the film which is something many of us have come to expect from fantasy films,this is great because it leaves much room for jovial dialogue to appear sporadically throughout the scenes.Warcraft is colorful and a very accurate representation of the Warcraft franchise that fans and newcomers alike will enjoy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Great video game movie, good movie and an even better spectacle.","If you like games or fantasy you will love this film. It's not lord of the rings, not Game of thrones. It's something by in and of itself. It's a fantasy film that raises the standard for fantasy films and especially video game ones(not that these standards were very high). The story is coherent and easier to follow than most movies of it's genre. To set expectation a little. It's not a Oscar movie and that is not to be expected from a summer blockbuster based on a indie game from 1994 (no, not the WORLD OF Warcraft, ""Warcraft: Orcs and Humans""). The visuals are the most gorgeous in any movie yet. The action is also phenomenal and has some brutal moments. The best part yet is that the movie is a contradiction (some orcs not being bad guys) to most fantasy making it controversial to a fantasy purist, however for most others this will be a breath of fresh air.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"While I feel mixed, I finish watching it satisfied","Legendary Pictures has had some stinkers in the past and made even worse choices when it comes to the tone and set up of a movie. There are moments within this movie that feel stilted. They feel unusual and a little uncomfortable. However, that doesn't mean that it pulls away the positive aspects of the movie making it not worth your time. The action within this movie is fantastic. Visuals are well done. As a former player of WoW I was more than pleasantly surprised by certain levels of proper continuity, and the places that they made sure to include, and their true grandeur. I finished this movie, happy with what was chosen as a story, the characters they chose, the voices for the CGI, and for the most part the actors in charge of the non-CGI roles. What I disliked was the dialogue between characters, and the actors choice in how such words were spoken. This will go into my cult favorites. I only hope that they take the errors made in the fine details of this production and produce a better sequel.

If they ever resurrect MST3K expect to find this movie on their short list.,"Take a hint from Star Wars and scroll some text by! Let us non-gamers understand what is even going on!

"Warcraft, fantasy in it's purest form.","Unlike the critic's epic fail in giving this movie a fair review, Warcraft was an epic win for Blizzard. Warcraft is not the usual crappy video game spin-off movie, it feels and plays like it was meant for the big screen. In general, Blizzard made the movie while keeping the fans in mind giving priority to their needs (as it should be) rather than dumbing down the lore for random moviegoer. Yet, for the non-fans it does not disappoint. Warcraft bring to the table a series of epic battle and dilemmas that will keep you engaged throughout the 2 hour run time.If you have no prior exposure to the Warcraft universe there are 3 major aspects that Warcraft does better in than any other movie of its genre. Dare I say it does better in them than LOTR did.1. Magic.Warcraft does not have your typical wise gray bearded wizard who sits on his ass all day reading, and when the situation becomes dire, he flashes in and save the day. Nor is it Gandalf who can blast enemies away by just swinging his staff. In Warcraft, a huge variety of magic can be witnessed. Incantations are used, mages can use the elements arcane, frost,and fire to fend for themselves in battle. On the other hand, warlocks can use Fel magic that feeds of life itself to cast dangerous yet powerful spells to aid them in battle. Magic and its various types are easily seen in Warcraft. Also, mages are not the old man in the pointy hat, they are young people who sharpen there skills in direct combat on the battle field, whether its with other mages or fully armored warriors. Moreover, mages are not invincible as they can be jumped, captured or incapacitated via conventional means.2. Battles.Another plus for Warcraft are the battles that were fought. The orcs fleeing a dying world try to invade another to survive. They then send a small warband to pave the way, and ensure the rest of the horde can make it to Azeroth. Amazingly (sarcasm) the small warband follows a logical strategy of warfare, as we would expect from creature raised in a culture of war. The orcs acknowledge their small numbers stick to swift raids and ambushes to fight the enemy. The most satisfying part of the battles is that these hulking monsters are not massacred by the humans with relative ease like LOTR. Surprisingly the orcs fight like hulking beasts would do by using brute force to crush the enemy. The humans who never encountered orcs before try to adapt to orcs and slowly start to put up a fight.3. Orcs.Last but defiantly not least, orcs. Just to make things clear orcs in Warcraft are not the inherently evil orcs and uruks of LOTR. In Warcraft, orcs have there own culture, architecture, language, free will, and the respect for tradition. The tribal orcs of Draenor did not unite and invade Azeroth purely for blood lust. The path they took was out of desperation as their world collapsed, it was necessary to ensure the survival of their race (you would understand this better if you played the game as it was not explained well in the movie). Another thing Warcraft does well is that they show how barbaric these orcs are, but they do not cross the thin line and mix it with being evil, and the viewer can clearly see this distinction between evil and a barbaric way of life. As a result of this, the viewer will adore some orcs while deeply despising others.Other than the stunning CGI, these features distinguished Warcraft from other fantasies, and could be appreciated by all viewers. (Some viewers my find the movie cliché, but remember, the story came out in 1994 as the first Warcraft game was released. Orcs having their own way of life and are not necessarily evil was pretty original back then.)Fans, with prior knowledge of what will happen and where the story is going will be greeted warmly by the movie. As the lore does not explain itself a lot, Blizzard had more time to insert Easter eggs for the fans to spot, while the characters venture through familiar locations were all WOW (World or Warcraft) players have visited. Also, due to the small time invested in explaining the lore we as fans are treated to ambushes, raids, and epic battles unfold similar to the battle of Warcraft III ROC intro.Blizzard has given us a movie that any fantasy lover could enjoy, and fans who already know the lore could relate to as everything unfolds. Regrettably, no movie is perfect and in Warcraft, a lot of the cast members aren't familiar with acting in a fantasy movie (Dominic Cooper). Sometimes emotions are not present were they are needed the most. The lore was not explained well as there was no time (again the movie was for the fans), so some viewers may be lost and not know completely whats happening. A personal dislike I had for the movie is that they changed a small part of the lore for dramatic purposes (it is a movie after all) that as a die hard fan of the lore I didn't appreciate. All-in-all the movie was amazing and its not worth missing, whether you're a fan of not.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Watchable but AVERAGE movie,Nothing New At All! Definitely No LOTR/Hobbit.","I don't know anything about WOW or whatever this movie is based on. The trailer looked average, it didn't have anything different or too spectacular in it and could well be cheesy, but i went to see it anyway as i had a free ticket. My friend had seen it and told me it was rubbish but i still went in with an open mind because the reviews on here were VERY good and the box office seems to be really impressive as of right now, so i thought i'd go and see for myself as i like this genre.Anyway, the movie turned out to be average, a seen it all before thing. I wouldn't have paid to see this, the only redeeming parts for me were the fight scenes because im a sucker for action, but having said that, it isn't anything you haven't seen before and it has been done better. Without those parts i probably would have thought of walking out. Its not that much of a interesting story, boring in places, it isn't gracefuly told/made like the LOTR/Hobbit films i've seen,haven't seen all of those btw but they're the closest things i can compare this to. Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster gave cool performances though.I think this is maybe more for the fans of the Warcraft games and people who like these kind of movies that will settle for an average review. I love this genre of movie too but it needed to be better, there needed to be more to it, considering what we've had before with the likes of Harry Potter, LOTR!

Cold have been better,"The one thing that I expect from a good fantasy movie is to transfer me to that faraway place where magic is possible and fantastic creatures are free to roam the land. And this one only partially succeeded at this. Funny thing is that CGI parts look much better then the live ones. The thing that this movie is chronically missing is shooting at locations (something where LOTR, for example, excelled and became legendary for). Most of the live scenes are shot in front of the green screen and that is painfully apparent. Still I think that it will serve as a good opening for the beginning of the franchise and I hope that they will do a better job in their next attempt.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

for fans great for anyone else maybe average,"First of all don't believe the critics they are way to harsh with this movie. Most of them are from old men with art-house taste they will destroy every cgi movie they might even give -points for color movies.For me the experience was comparable to LotR. I don't see much of a quality difference between this movie and the first LotR. If you're not in to fantasy you might hate it because there is a lot of magic, demons, teleporting etc ... but if you like the genre you will enjoy this movie. If you are an Warcraft fan you will love it. It's by far the best cinematic Blizzard ever made.The story is not bad actually i like it more than SW or LotR which are IMHO simpler and more one sided. You don't have to chose between horde or alliance both are good and bad. Actually the character the audience will like most might be Durotan even if you are alliance. The CGI is mostly great but sometimes when there is a lot of fast movement it gets blurry.

WarCraft - a good movie but not a great movie,"I've read articles stating that critics disliked this movie. I've read user opinions who liked this movie. I've played WarCraft 1-3 and I very much liked those games, but never played WOW. So I've had minor (?) experience in this universe and I was curious about it.When I watched it I've seen minor issues including too much motion blur in distant shots when the camera was panning (which will probably be fixed by the Blu-Ray release or IMAX), and I didn't like those shots from the ground level. Those are just not good at all.However I liked the story, the characters, dialogues, and the king's final command in a very tough situation.

Another bad video game movie...,"Let's get right to the point. The Warcraft movie is bad. It's really bad. I wanted to like this movie but it's just not a good movie. The acting is beyond horrible. Especially the main human cast. The CG orcs act circles around the humans in this movie. The movie also does a horrible job of explaining the world to the audience. Thank God I actually know the lore of Warcraft and love the games otherwise I might have just walked out on the movie. The tone in the movie is all over the place too. On the orc side of things with Durotan it's fine but on the human side they try to insert some witty banter which just falls flat, a ""romance"" that is beyond forced, and finally some tragedy which they simply have not earned. The CG is really uneven. Sometimes it's damn impressive and other times it's flat out bad. All this makes for a pretty terrible movie experience. Sure, fans of Warcraft will probably enjoy it but that doesn't make Warcraft a good movie, just like Twilight fans enjoying the Twilight movies don't make those movies good movies.

"Solid, very entertaining film","I'll start off by saying that I am a fan of the source material. If you fit that description, you really need to see this film, if you haven't already. I saw it with my girlfriend who never played the games and she loved it. Even for a newcomer, this is worth watching and should be at least a 7-8 rating.PROS:1. Incredible visuals. I think it's worth the price of admission for this reason alone.2. A credible, CGI race you can empathize with. Remember how critically acclaimed Gollum from Lord of the Rings was and expand that to the entire race of orcs.3. Great, entertaining soundtrack. For the Game of Thrones fans, it's worth mentioning that this film has the same composer.4. Fast-paced, epic action. I know plenty of people who complained about the pacing of The Hobbit trilogy; this is pretty much the opposite. Not a minute passes without a battle, an awesome spell being cast, or another key event for the plot.5. Spectacular magic. This ties in to point 1, but I think it deserves its own mention. I have seen plenty of fantasy films, but never anything like this.CONS:1. The pace means you might lose track of the characters without prior knowledge. In my opinion, the movie should be at least 30 minutes longer. I will definitely see an extended cut if it's made available.2. Only for fans: there are some minor lore changes, but they mostly involve the way some characters are killed. The film sticks very well to the core elements of the lore.You should really go see this film; you won't regret either the money or the time investment. Also, the source material becomes more complex, detailed and epic as the time-line advances. This means that sequels can be on par with the Lord of the Rings trilogy.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Lacks character motivations but succeeds in creating a fantastic world of conflict,"After several years of back and forth, the game giant Blizzard finally united and chose Duncan Jones as director and leader of their first film, Warcraft: The Beginning. It is based on the first Warcraft game from 1994. Azeroth is the world where the humans for several years have lived in peace together with the other creatures. The orcs are forced to leave their dying world Dreanor behind and travel to Azeroth to survive. The crazy orc Gul'dan lead them into battle with the help of the warcheif Blackhand. But all orcs are not impressed with their thirst for blood and their lack of respect for life. Conflicts appear in several directions. I have played these games when I was younger and I am also pretty familiar with the story because I've read some novels and facts about it.I will start by saying that Warcraft is an incredibly good looking film. The computer made effects combined with real actors, makes for a nice contrast very fitting to the style of the film. However, the characters of the film are a bit messy. It is a lot of characters on both sides and also certain ones who hasn't chosen a side which makes it even harder to keep track on everyone. We are quickly thrown into the story without a proper background explanation which is a pity and may cause confusion before you really understand everything. I like the fact that they have chosen to focus on both sides of the conflict. It makes the battle so much more interesting when we can follow it from two angles with two perspectives.The big weakness of the film also lies in the characters and their at times lack of development. Sometimes we are quickly cutting from one scene to another without ever really staying long enough to get to know anyone. This forces the filmmakers to use cliché dialogue to quickly make us understand what's going on. They've also added a forced love story. The thing that's really good about the film is the story itself. The conflict between the humans and the orcs who just invaded their world is very interesting. I personally really like following the orcs. They have everything to gain after leaving a dying world behind. When we follow them we also see their family situations with children and life mates. I care about them. Medivh, the guardian of Azeroth is also very interesting when he uses his magic. Warcraft is like I said, a bit messy and at times clumsy edited with strange short scenes and fading black screens. I do however like the world and the conflict itself so I forgive these blunders. It's no masterpiece but definitely an entertaining fantasy film.David Lindahl - www.filmografen.se",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"One big shiny mess. But oh boy, is it shiny","First of all, I didn't expect much from Warcraft:The Beginning. If it was a shallow fantasy action film, I would be content. But sadly Warcraft tries to be many things it is not.Let's start with the things that were done well, though. The film looks perfect. The designs of the characters, the CG effects on the fantastic beasts, everything looks superb. I myself have only played World of Warcraft for a few hours, and none of the original Warcraft games. but I do play my fair share of Hearthstone, the card game based on the world of Warcraft. And I can say that a lot of the fun comes from recognising the characters. Most of the designs are almost one to one with the original video game designs.Also, the opening scene is gorgeous, but it sets expectations too high, sadly. The rest of the movie doesn't live up to the very first scene.Now comes my biggest gripe with the film. With Warcrafts extensive lore, the makers of Warcraft:The Beginning tried to stuff as many aspects of this lore into the film, which doesn't work out that well. The story feels extremely rushed and left me with a face struck with disbelief. The viewer does not have enough time to develop a bond with the characters, which damages the story, as there are many events that are supposed to have a huge emotional impact on the viewer. And then, during the last quarter, everything goes to sh*t. I will not go into detail since I do not like to spoil anything, but oh man, is it bad.Overall, Warcraft:The Beginning is a pleasure for the eyes, and I'm sure that hardcore Blizzard fans will enjoy it, but if you are a regular movie goer without any knowledge of the world of Warcraft, you will most likely not find this film worth it. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pleasantly surprised!,"Yesterday, by chance, I saw the new Warcraft movie in the local theater. I have never played any of the Warcraft games (nor any other Blizzard game for that matter), so I wasn't particularly planning on seeing this one on the big screen. Knowing how live-action adaptions of video games (or any other animated media) have a tendency to turn out complete failures, I went in without any expectations. I was however pleasantly surprised! Sadly this movie is getting panned on a lot of platforms, which is a pity since I found this movie to be much better than expected. So I decided it was only right to give this film a positive review from a non-fan.Fans of the games obviously love this film but it has enough to offer even for people like me who are completely new to the Warcraft universe. Of course if you're expecting to see the next Lord Of The Rings or Game Of Thrones, you'll leave the theater a disappointed viewer, but the charm of this movie is that it doesn't aspire to be the next groundbreaking fantasy epic. It doesn't try to hide it's video game origins either, rather it stays true to it's roots, which works very much to its advantage. Storywise some expected fantasy clichés are present, but at the same time it takes enough unexpected turns to maintain the balance and keep the viewers interested. The characters as well, though having their roots in fantasy stereotypes, have enough complexity to keep them from being caricatures and places them somewhere on the axis in between good and evil rather than at one end or the other. I particularly enjoyed having sympathetic characters on both sides of the fence.Visually the movie is stunning as well. Blizzard, being notorious for it's high quality cinematics, and Industrial Light & Magic, known for breaking new grounds in VFX, let their expertise shine through abundantly. Although I was initially skeptic of the live-action approach, preferring the movie would have been made completely animated (like their famous cinematics), they pulled off the blend of real actors and mo-cap creatures surprisingly well and all actors involved gave decent performances. The design of the characters and the environments as well is one of the best things about this film, no doubt the merit of Blizzard's renowned team of concept artists.I've heard complaints about the pacing and editing of the film, but despite the 2 hour run time I didn't feel any problems in this area myself. I am of course not familiar with the lore surrounding Warcraft, so I can't really tell which parts of the greater story were cut or rushed and which ones were dragged. In this regard it might even be an advantage to watch this movie as a newcomer to the series. The ending ties up the story arc pretty well, but leaves enough out in the open for a possible sequel (which I very much hope to see).If you're not a fan of the games, Warcraft won't blow you off your feet, but it's a very good film nevertheless that does what it set out to do with great style!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The fantasy flick you have been waiting for,"You know the feeling you get when you see something Epic, when the hairs on your arms stand up, Well.. get ready for full- on werewolf arms because This s**t is bloody fantastic.

A very solid fantasy movie (which are scarce),"My first review on IMDb and that says something.I grew up on fantasy. Read all of the Dungeons & Dragons books, was fascinated by Warhammer, Read LoTR and Silmarillon, read the whole thing by Tad Williams (much better than LoTR btw, read it again a year ago just to make sure). Ultimately, when I was younger, everything was captivating: the landscapes, the power, the EPIC of it. You can find it all in Warcraft the movie. I was trying to find a comparison, or a contender to this movie. There are none. The only thing that comes to my mind is the Huntsman for their fairy tale world. People keep comparing this one to Game of Thrones, or LoTR, saying that this is not it.. well it's not, neither it was supposed to be. And this is by design. What Warcraft proposes is a completely new quality, a different approach, visual and narrative, to hundred years old tales. Spoiler: it doesn't use the ash filters very much. And people in it are not generally looking sad, or malnutrition-ed.I gave it a 7, in my opinion it's closer to 6.5 and I believe that this is fair. The story is the same one reinvented, the story about power and the corruption it brings. About its price. A story about loyalties, responsibility (for your kin, for your clan, for your race). And the story unfolds steadily and with proper pace.There is a couple of things that might be counted as the movie vices: - there is a lot of CGI, and I mean A LOT - it is generally pretty good, but if you're not a fan, then you might just as well skip the whole thing (and if you're a fan I can recommend Final Fantasy: Advent Children, Appleseed and Ghost in the Shell 2) - The motivations of the characters included are not always sufficiently explained - and upon reflection, this is pretty big, I mean we can imagine them, but can't know for sure and this affects a lot of characters in the movie. I think that the only motivations we know for sure are the group character - Horde, Anduin Lothar, Durotar and Garona, maybe Llan Wrynn, but certainly not Gul'Dan, Medivh, Khadgar, or the Kirin Tor mages. Which brings us to the next point - this is the first installment and the amount of things it is trying to convey is head spinning. I get it, first installment, you need to set the stage, but LoTR 1 did it over 3 hours and there wasn't much fighting in it, so it could really develop the story. You didn't have this comfort, so the script should've been reviewed. - The CGI in a couple of instances sucked - like in that fight scene in the mountains, or the last fight scene - generally not a big thing, just needs notingMajority of the movie thought was excellent, I am just trying to be fair. The things to look for and those that were particularly good: - depiction of magic - magic play a big role in fantasy movies, however people generally don't know how to show it, this movie does an excellent job of it - (as said previously) good storytelling tropes showed in a fresh way - well paced, well balanced - high fantasy without the obvious: beautiful people are good, ugly orcs are bad attitudeAll in all 6.5 is fair. Even if you never heard of Warcraft but is remotely interested in fantasy as a genre, you would do yourself a favour to go and see this movie. I know that the previous sentence is an oxymoron, but I choose to end with it, Thanks for reading!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the best fantasy movie ever,"Since LOTR I'v waited so long for a movie to be that good and it felt like Warcraft could have done the job. And it didn't disappoint. All is great in this adaptation and I just can't understand how the critics can be so negative. Sincerely, what can you expect more of a movie based on Warcraft lore?? Acting is great, special effects too. The plot is just what you expect it would be.I mean the only regret you will have at the end of the movie is that the lore of Warcraft is so huge that you feel that this movie is just an introduction and you want to see more and more...In fact they could do 20 movies easily.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Beautiful visuals almost carried the weak plot, almost","So, I don't really know if this contain 'spoilers' but just in case, beware. First going into the cinema, I was pumped. My dad and I have avidly played World of Warcraft for many years and I personally have looked into the lore and read some of the books. Although I haven't played the first three Warcraft, I know a lot about what happened regarding lore. In general, the story was eh when it comes to accuracy, but the visuals were amazing. For having an 100 million dollar budget, they did good. Seeing iconic towns and areas come to the big screen in such detail was pretty great. The orcs looked pretty realistic as well so you can tell they put a lot of effort into the CGI. But its hard to say if the visuals made up for the lack of character development and very fast plot. I don't know if it was due to budgetary reasons that the movie isn't even 2 hours, but they could have made it a little longer and thus put more story behind the characters. Personally, I could follow what was happening and following the characters, but for people that have never even heard of World of Warcraft, it may have been a struggle to keep up with all of the names and pretty much who was doing what. All in all, the movie could have been amazing if the plot was as good as the visuals. Hopefully the filmmakers lived and learned because I really wouldn't mind a trilogy, not going to lie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Nostalgia is a dangerous thing ...,"Let me put it this way.At some point, World of Warcraft had 10.000.000 paying customers. If we take this plus everyone who bought Warcraft 3 and the other titles in the series, you've got a pre-sold audience for a best- selling movie.Movie adaptations of games usually are hit and miss. Resident Evil was okay but that's about it. Most are a joke. Warcraft though ... is okay, even good.The production value on this is very high. From the effects used to the editing to even the story, it makes sense. There are some small easter eggs that only WoW players will understand that are a nice add to the movie. It is not the next Lord of the Rings movie but it is way more than a way to capitalize on a video game.Why have I've paid the ticket for it? Nostalgia is dangerous. After spending tens of hours in Azeroth, I couldn't resist seeing it in a movie adaptation and I wasn't disappointed. Even if I barely remember the characters by name (they do sound familiar though), it stays true to the universe and the entire two hour was a roller-coaster ride, with hardly any moment to catch a breath.It is a perfect movie? No. It is one of the best video game adaptations ever made? Yes. I've seen most of them. This takes the first prize by a large margin. However, with a $160 mil budget, it was expected.And with an potential market of: 1. 4.5 millions from Warcraft 3. 2. 100 accounts created in WoW ...... You have a pre-sold market that wants to see it, no matter if it is good or bad. The thing is that it is actually good. If you also add the fact that there are many people who never played the games and want to see it, I don't doubt this will enter the top fifty best sold movies of all times. So yes, spend your $10 on it, it is worth it.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
No tingling,"First of all I must say that I am very easily swept off my feet when it comes to fantasy movies. I am also a long time Warcraft nerd and really wanted to love the movie.I have, like so many others, waited for this movie for several years with excitement. I went in with maybe too high expectations and left with an emptiness. Not because the movie was bad but because it didn't really move me.The movie sets off with the orcs on their journey to the new world. Only the fans of Warcraft lore will know why things are set in this direction, the others have to accept the terms and perhaps google afterwards. The orcs are big and ruthless. I liked how they weren't afraid to let the orcs crush a head or two.The first character that we got a really good look at was Durotan and I think his face up close is amazing, it gives out more emotions than most of the real actors during the movie. He is an interesting character but as the others, we don't really get to know him or where he comes from. That is a problem with all of them, there is no real story behind the characters and we don't get a chance to bond with them which later on leaves me wondering if I really care about them.The CGI is not very convincing, perhaps they tried to hard to remind us of the games. We get green screens everywhere and I wonder if they really tried at all to convince us that the buildings and environments are real. A lot of prop look like plastic toys.As a Travis Fimmel fan, or more Vikings maybe, I really liked to see him in this movie. It was nice to hear him talk without the Norwegian accent and he played his role well. He reminds me a lot about Ragnar in Vikings, if it is from lack of diversity between playing different roles I can't really tell. His so called relationship with half-orc/half-human Garona felt a bit pushed and sudden. I had a hard time with her not because of her acting but because of her teeth. Remember the plastic toys I mentioned? That's right.A character I was looking forward to see was Medivh but instead I found him rather boring and dull. I preferred younger mage Khadgar, who Schnetzer portrays well. Khadgar was also the one who gave me a smile here and there during the movie.This is a good story, and I think that if they just give it a little more effort the sequels can be great. There are several important characters and places I want to see. I also hope that the DVD version will be extended with more scenes regarding character development.I love the feeling of when a movie makes me think ""Wow, this was amazing!"", when sensational scenes give my spine a tingle and I just can't wait to see the movie again. This movie simply didn't do it.As I said I am very easy to sweep of my feet. However, this movie left me standing straight up.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Visually Stunning, Lacks Characters and Story","Warcraft is a fantasy epic based on Blizzard's video game franchise directed by Duncan Jones (Moon, Source Code) and starring Travis Fimmel, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Paula Patton and Ben Foster.Warcraft is set in the fantastical world of Azeroth and follows the race of orcs as they start to seek a new world in which to settle in, considering theirs is dying. The orcs are led by Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu) who uses dark sorcery called The Fel, a sorcery which requires sacrifices, thus keeping the portal to the new world open. One of the orc chieftains, Durotan (Kebbell) does not agree with Gul'Dan's methods and he starts to doubt his intentions. The world the orcs flee to is called Azeroth, the house for races like humans, dwarfs and elves. Thus, a conflict begins the two factions.First of all, let me start by saying that this movies was savaged by critics. It currently holds a 22% rotten score on Rotten Tomatoes and some reviewers have even said this movie is as bad as Battlefield Earth. This is truly not the case. This movie is far from perfect and indeed it has some flaws, but to go as far as calling it a new Battlefield Earth is simply ludicrous. This movie is very good for what it's supposed to be: a fantasy epic with exciting battles, unique characters and a rich mythology.Fans of the video game franchise will surely love this movie and will notice all the little easter eggs and references thrown throughout the movie. I myself am not a huge follower of the game series and I still enjoyed this movie. By far the weakest link of this movie are the characters, especially the human ones. Travis Fimmel plays Anduin Lothar, commander of the human army who is supposed to come off as witty and charming but unfortunately is just annoying most of the time. Dominic Cooper plays King Llane, a good king who cares about his people and wants to protect them from the coming invasion. Cooper is a great actor but he's not a good fit for this character. His looks are too boyish and make him seem like he lacks experience, thus not having enough gravitas. In fact, this is a problem for most of the human characters, as Ben Foster and Ben Schnetzer both play mages, but they don't fit at all in their roles.One of the best characters in this movie comes from the orc horde, and that's Durotan played by Toby Kebbell. Kebbell does a great job in bringing to life a character that cares deeply for his family and people, a just and noble ruler. He is also the wisest from the Horde, as he realizes an alliance with the humans must be made in order to save his world. Kebbell plays Durotan using motion capture, his second role of this nature (he also did a fantastic job in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes). All the orcs in the movie are portrayed by this technology, and, for the most part, they look great. CGI is a must requirement in this kind of movie, and even if it falls flat in some of the scenes, the look of the orcs is very well achievedHaving said all that, Warcraft is a movie that's beautifully directed by Duncan Jones, with some great visuals for the most part, with beautiful looking landscapes and battles. Unfortunately, it falls short in the story and character depth departments, but the way I see it, I knew what I was getting in to. I was not expecting a Citizen Kane, I wanted to see crazy giant battles between orcs, humans and other beasts and I got all that. Warcraft is one of the best video game adaptations out there (not saying much) and I give it a 6.5 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My first epic drop over again.,"We all had hopes, we all prayed for so long. That this would not be a failure. While wow is decaying, how could blizzard step up to make a movie worthy of the warcraft universe. But they did. /clap /dance /cry /lieThey did exactly what they were supposed to be doing. The CGI is just spot on, and gives you the epic feeling you first had with the warcraft/wow cinematics. The spells are amazing, although i'm not going to spoil which ones are used in the film.One key feature to the epicness of the whole show, was the relationship between Durutan and Draka. The orcs where not just a violent race (but violent they were), they were also loving and funny to each other.This filmseries will bring a whole new generation into to warcraft universe.

"A great movie, reviewed by a person with no experience with the gaming franchise","A great movie if you're one who is a fan of the gaming franchise, but coming from a person who has never had any experience whatsoever with the game (apart from hearing a lot about it), i thought that it gave me a great introduction into the future of a great blockbuster series.The move was full of intense battle scenes much to the likes of representing the distinguished moral of the story and the grief and raw new rivalry between the mighty humans who are decisive in not holding back from letting their land be taken over from the orcs of a different world. I thought that the director Duncan Jones coordinated the movie to an average standard that just about suited the needs of viewers, giving any rookie a very informative introduction and any thoroughly experienced fan much more to be entertained by through their beloved gaming franchise.But, although the movie had many ups, there were also some downs, which i couldn't help to argue with. These include the idea of nearly every scene of the movie being computer generated, which from my point of view didn't made the movie look as realistic as it could have been. I had caught a few iffy parts in which i could tell that there were some mistakes made with some scenes in which the perspective of the CGI characters movements were almost made to look a bit dodgy and unworkable with sustaining a realistic environment meant to make any audience feel engaged in the movie. I couldn't help to feel disengaged during some scenes were I was caught picking up these mistakes, most notably during one of the last scenes of the movie where it was most certainly shown that green screen had made some default mistakes in making the setting and buildings in the background make the cast look out of the scene to a point where I could definitely see that mostly everything around them was computer generated.Although the movie had some ups and some downs I personally thought it was a fantastic movie with a promising blockbuster franchise on its way (if there is a sequel). Once again I must note that this has been reviewed by a person with no experience whatsoever with the well established gaming franchise, although the movie has inspired me to try out this popular game (with the free game I was given when buying the movie ticket).Overall rating: 7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great movie, definitely worth watching multiple times","As someone who's never heard of the game until this movie came out, i honestly loved the movie. The CGI was beautiful and the relation to each character was real, the world itself felt so real. I could feel strong emotions even from the orcs which was a big plus for me, usually most movies that have ""monsters"" in them are too focused on how evil they look and don't show emotion. I was actually really attracted to the orc side of the story. Loved duncan jones movie ""moon"" so i had no doubt he would be able to pull out another great movie. I am going to take my kids to watch this movie again, also my wife hates fantasy movies but i convinced her to go and she actually really liked Warcraft. kudos! I just saw some bad critic reviews on this movie and was a bit confused as to why they would bash this movie so bad. I usually don't write reviews for movies, but after reading those horrendous reviews I had to come here to give this movie some justice of what it really deserves. I really hope there is a squeal because I will definitely watch it. Don't listen to the negative reviews, i believe most of them are just for attraction. Check out the movie yourself and have your own opinion, i was a bit skeptical about this movie but ended up loving every moment of it. 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
plain and simple,The two things i did not like about Warcraft was 1st the romance part which was boring and could have been excluded.. and the 2nd is that in some fights the choreography was a bit poor.The fact that the orcs when we first saw them at the beginning of the movie they were overpower against the humans and by the end they were equal if not down-sided was a bit irritating. I wouldn't mind as a horde fan even to make the humans overpowered but when you decide to something keep it that way for the whole movie. On the other hand the visuals were great (for those who are a bit skeptimistic of the quality) and the acting was satisfying.p.s. I'm very happy to finally watch Warcraft after all these years cinematized and can't wait for the sequel.,7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
So not great,"Warcraft had the potential to be a great movie, and looking at the sheer quality of the visuals/CGI it's clear that the necessary budget was there. But the movie is not great. It's very average.The visuals alone would probably ensure that the project doesn't incur loses. But that is about the only thing this movie has going for itself.The core story itself is good enough but it's missing details, sub-plots, and proper execution in story-telling. So what you see seems very generic. The pace at which events unfold seems very inconsistent and often rushed.There's no character development at all which is always a big deal but even more so these days with Game of Thrones setting the bar so high. Durotan and Gul'dan are the only characters that you may (or may not) find even mildly interesting. Garona feels like a completely unnecessary character with no real importance in the story.The acting is poor. Most of the cast did a lousy job here but Paula Patton as Garona seems like a rank amateur. So not only is her character poor, but she herself seems just as bad.The score is uninspiring. A movie like Warcraft needs a great soundtrack but it just doesn't have it. Think Lord of the Rings, Troy, 300, Game of Thrones.... You can't create epic scenes without epic music. But I suspect there is more to blame for that than just the music - the editing.The visuals and some familiar faces may make this movie feel rich on the surface. But it's very shallow. That's very sad considering how rich the source material is. Its still a watchable movie if you go in without very big expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
World of Snorecraft,"It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. It isn't even the worst movie I've seen lately. But it is one of the most boring movies I managed to sit the entire way through in recent memory. The magic effects are done well. I had no problem with the acting. But I could not get invested in the story. They didn't develop the world or the characters sufficiently for someone who has never played the games to care about. Every character is a cardboard cutout. The action scenes are unthrilling and leave *a lot* to be desired. Obviously everyone has their own tastes, but I can't even figure out what it was the people who liked this movie (who did not play the games) saw in it. It has no other redeeming qualities.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The curse has been broken.,"I watched it in IMAX 3D today. I was very worried that it would suck after being disappointed by the initial trailers. Everything looked so fake in the trailers that I had seen.Holy crap what a movie. The CGI was awesome. The orcs, dwarfs and high elves looked so lifelike. The actors also did a splendid job and Ragnar/Travis was legendary as usual. The magic spells felt powerful.Do not believe the film critics poor reviews of the movies. They are idiots. This movie is worth it!The only bad thing I can say is that it is a bit fast-paced. It is quite clear they had a hard time putting the entire of Warcraft 1 into a 2 hour movie. I think that a Director's Cut increasing the length of the movie by some 20-30 minutes would make it a marvel.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Catering to the juvenile Warcraft gamers.,"There is a reason why real gamers pick on Warcraft gamers as being immature, and the least respectable of gamers. Blizzard doesn't care so much about quality as they do for their bottom line, so integrity in gaming goes out the window, especially obviously in movie making as well, and flashy over the top seeming special effects trickery get lost with the extremely weak and unmotivated story line. The majority of most of the character motivation are lost with unexplained illogical pettiness. All of the civilian reviews are of Warcraft gamers base. If Blizzard didn't have that they would never have made a movie knowing they would not have gotten their money back.There are some that even dare to compare this to 'Lord Of The Rings'. Are you kidding me? They are different worlds, and don't even belong in the same universe. If Bizarro would have made a fantasy movie based off of 'Lord Of The Rings', 'Warcraft' would have been it. Flashy special effects can fool the least intellectually challenged among us, and the weak story line, and conversations can and did smoothly slip by like a snake to the uninitiated. Even the special effects really weren't that well done. If I can tell it's CGI then it's not very good. The whole point is to fool you that its real isn't it? It's an 'Avatar' wanna be. It's the same people that think '2012', 'Battleship', 'Hardcore Henry' where phenomenal movies. If you are one of those people I'm sure you will be tickled pink by the lost attempts at humor, and puns. The only time I knew there was a joke intended was because of the very awkward long pause. Then I was left thinking, what was the joke?I have played Warcraft for years, and had thee most successful guild of over 300 active players on my server, and quit, because of the maturity factor with the game and the players. Too much trolling.So if you are of the more cerebral variety you won't get much from this movie including your money back. There is a reason why we need to ignore the wanna be civilian critics since they tend to always be wrong, and rate opposite of official critics. Why is that? Take a look at Rotten Tomatoes. 27%. I didn't think anything could be worse than 'Superman vs. Batman'. I was wrong. You will get the same shameless overzealous immature wanna be critics of that movie as well saying it's the best movie ever! I think there should be consequences for these critics that they pay for your ticket if you didn't like the movie, and I don't mean little bit, but hated it. Maybe then they would be a bit more conservative with their over zealous critique.Comparing this to 'Lord Of The Rings' is beyond laughable. No Oscar nominations for this movie, not even for special effects. LOL",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply amazing.,"Warcraft is a fantasy film directed by Duncan Jones and stars Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster, Dominic Cooper, Toby Kebbell, Ben Schnetzer, Robert Kazinsky and Daniel Wu. The film is based on the Warcraft video game series and portrays the encounters between humans and orcs taking place in different locations that have been set by the video game series before. I personally absolutely loved Warcraft from beginning to end, the incredible visuals that are perfectly mixed in with the amazing written story make up for one of the best summer blockbusters in a long while. All the actors do a fantastic job here, with Travis Fimmel as the leading character on the human side, who is really good on the role. I personally bought Dominic Cooper as the king and Ben Foster as the guardian who gave a very intimidating performance. On the orcs side the motion capture performances were absolute perfection, with the amazing Toby Kebbell on the lead as Durotan. Without spoiling anything I was really caught off by surprise by the amount of deaths of the main characters on this film. I have never played any of the video games and I had no idea what I was walking in to but that really raised the stakes up for the finale against the ever so brilliant villain of the film Gul'dan portrayed by Daniel Wu. The soundtrack composed by Ramin Djawadi is also beautiful and epic at times. It fit in with the battles perfectly all throughout. Overall I truly enjoyed this film and my only issues with it is that the beginning is kind of slow but everything else was amazing and just breathtaking to look at. I am a big fan of the film and I hope there will be a sequel in the near future to arrive.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Great Effects, OK acting, DARK movie","The move was entertaining. The special effects were pretty amazing, but, like the Hobbit movies, it seems to me that the reliance on CGI is getting out of hand. That being said, this movie would not be possible without it. I thought the Characters were OK and the writing was fair. i would say the PG-13 rating was accurate but for those sensitive to dark magic, scary images and the like I would say be careful. I also prefer stories where the evil is evil and the good is very good. My thought coming out of this was that the evil was VERY evil and the good was just kind of OK. For those of you that really like fantastic images, special effects and action, this was a decent movie. Otherwise, wait for the DVD.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"A surprise hit, especially for the unknown!","Okay so I am a Warcraft fan and as I went in I already knew most of the original story and I had seen a ton of footage from trailers, short clips and whatnot. Now being totally honest, that was my first mistake.But hey I didn't realize that until after the credits started rolling! As a fan I kept thinking and thinking and then thinking ahead of what was coming. I told myself before watching it that I would go in with a clear mind and just enjoy it as a new fantasy movie. Which I tried, but ... yeah.Well anyway. AS A FAN I came out of it with very mixed feelings. I already knew from Duncan that certain things had changed, so that didn't surprise me. But what surprised me was the actual changes. One thing for sure: if you are a lore freak, you will probably dislike these changes A LOT.However. I do think that these changes were needed to make the original story into a movie. Some changes were required to make the viewer feel this and that.Let me move on about all of that now. I got so many things to say, but to keep it short, here is a list of flaws I felt during the movie: The movie is too short. This leads into the next point which is... its length meant that certain characters I would loved more of, didn't get enough screen time. They cut a lot of scenes which we had previously seen in trailers and such. Which means... we NEED a director's cut!Yeah that's about it.My fave characters from the movie was, surprisingly, Garona and Khadgar!Oh yeah, the important thing which is why I wrote this. This movie will be most enjoyable if you are not a fan of Warcraft. Yeah, I am being serious! I watched this movie along with 2 friends. One is a fan, while the other wasn't. And guess what? My non-Warcraft friend loved it so much! And I am so happy for him for that and kinda jealous too! When I asked for scores, he gave it 9/10!To end this review/reaction: we need a sequel. A certain thing in this movie brings the hype for a sequel to the clouds! And it needs to happen ASAP! Duncan get on with it! :D",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is suffering while it carry too much potential in the world made by blizzard company,"Warcraft is a movie based on video game made by blizzard. It is one of the most popular game in this generation. The game itself serve a very authentic kind of world with huge characters. Too bad, Jones cant implement the incredible world in the game into his movie. There are so many things can be improved to make this movie on par with its typical such as lord of the rings's world by JRR Tolkien.If we analyze, nearly from all category, acting, editing, and writing, warcraft even not reach average level. Too be honest these are so bad. Its like the creative director Jones just lost his movie making skills. The actings are cheesy, but in this storyline typical, characters must drive the movie. Its because this movie focus on characters- based not story-driven or visual-based. If the characters, cant give impact into the story nor neither they're not given much appearing duration in scenes or maybe they cant deliver their motivation for the storyline-purpose such as race- safeguarding, then this movie is left with visual effects only. Even the panoramic effects not as good as The Jungle Book or LOTR trilogy, then no other things could carry this movie from plunging.So some improvements that i think could intensify this movie in the first thing is reduce its silliness. Some jokes should not be added and the jokes should executed precisely and classy, not like stupid things. Battles with magic should looks cool, not with some prolonging spell words which even too kiddy to watch. The camera position seems not precise in some battle scenes and it has too slow pace. Increase its pace in battle with good camera set piece to intensify its magic visual effects will pump the audience. Too much forced sentimental scene too increase its characters development with false timing also obnoxious. The ending or the last solo battle seems not epic as it could be. Magic battle or physical battle seems using oldish and kiddy choreography.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Warcraft,"The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilisation faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonise another. As a portal opens to connect the two worlds, one army faces destruction and the other faces extinction. From opposing sides, two heroes are set on a collision course that will decide the fate of their family, their people, and their home.Duncan Jones embraces Warcraft's world with commitment but when it comes to charging it with life, it is quite difficult. His adaptation of the online game has a sense of grandeur but also a strong fixation with CGI spectacle which makes the emotional core lifeless. Though it is clear that as a professed Warcraft fan, he clearly has put a lot of love and care into fleshing out a story. Warcraft is an expensive, high-fantasy epic reminiscent of The Lord of the Rings or Narnia. Newcomers - like myself - have a lot to get up to speed with here. As far as I understand all this, our home world is Azeroth, a Middle-Earth-like realm along the lines of Medieval Europe. The population is mostly human, mostly white, but there are also dwarfs, elves and various other mythical creatures in the fringes.There's a lot going on and yet we're never quite engaged with the storyline. In Lord of the Rings, we had the Shire, the Hobbit's idyllic pastoral realm, as an image of what everyone was fighting for. Here we barely see Azeroth, outside the Royal Castles, Wizard's towers or epic battlefields. There are much to admire in its ambitions and its design. Still, I don't know why I have this John Carter feeling about it. Like the 2012 Martian Disney flop, Warcraft is a complex, jargon-heavy, battle epic. This film occasionally manages to feel both rushed and dull, impressively staged and disengaging as well. Indeed, the heavy use of CGI and its awkward interactions with the live-action elements, distance the audience even more.Overall, this film feels incomplete and if Warcraft's fans want a sequel, every single one of the 12 million players - even their extended family and friends - is going to need to turn up to see this one, if they want this film to get past its first instalment.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It turned out to a good movie after all.,"Finally, it has arrived in the cinema.It was me and my brother (both playing World of WarCraft) and with a friend who is not familiar with the game itself and we were surprised he liked it.I was a bit concerned about all those trailers. I imagined it will be so predictable and expected to be disappointing one, however I always wished to see a movie based on this game since 12 years ago when I first started playing.I really don't give credit for those with bad reviews or people saying it was bad, that's there problem.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I was expecting more...,"Don't take my review as a reason not to go see it honestly. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is because while the movie itself is lacking the visuals are indeed incredible in my opinion.I gave it such a low rating because it's like playing Warlords of Draenor all over again, the hype far surpassed my expectations of what I would be receiving. In any case my biggest concerns for this movie were that it was extremely clunky, it's like the story couldn't follow a line and you jumped all over the place giving it a very...empty feeling. It's not to be said either that Blizzard can't tell a fascinating story. For any of you Blizzard fans who haven't check out the short series they've done for Overwatch characters, a stunning example of their capabilities in just a few 5-10min clips.I feel like most people are simply rating this high because they were impressed by the graphics and ignored all the other lacking features, because the battle scenes I have to admit were nice to watch. However I believe the biggest reason this is rated so high is because they've never actually played a game/know the lore.TL:DR If you've played the games at all, I feel you'll most likely be disappointed more than someone who's never played anything who would most give this 8-10stars. I did cry at the end though, not because of the movie but for the fact I had to pay 60$ for me and my girl to go see it in I-max with snacks.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As a fan of WOW and Fantasy in general i was disappointed,"I had booked to go to eat at Chiquitos afer this movie. Mexican chain restaurants aren't my usual bag but at the cinema i went to it was either that or Frankie and Benny's and unfortunately they couldn't cater for my vegan wife so we were left with little choice. I mention this just so that you understand that when i started looking forward to the movie being over at around the halfway point it wasn't because i had a table at Claridges booked. All i had to look forward to was a fairly average chilli con carne, not something that normally puts me on the edge of my seat, although i can recommend their habanero chilli sauce.As a fan of World of Warcraft and a lifelong lover of the fantasy genre i feel like i was primed to love this movie. Even so it just didn't do the business. The characters fulfilled functions but had no depth, the human cast didn't really have a lot of script to work with to engender any sort of emotional response and the orc's seemed cartoonish and contradictory in their nature. The movie jumped about a lot, the story line required a lot of leaps of faith and/or knowledge of WOW lore. It kinda put me in mind of that god awful dungeons and dragons movie they made a while back except much prettier (credit where it's due, the CGI is extensive and very well rendered).All in all it was another fail in the video-game-as-a-movie genre. I'm surprised there are so many people raving about it in their reviews on here, maybe they had their Chiquitos before the movie and it seemed better by comparison.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The elf-dwarf love affair,"First feeling after watching the movie: Have you seen the Hobbit trilogy?Remember the love affair between the dwarf and the elf?It felt a bit forced and without much background storyline,so every scene with those two you were like ""next scene please"".Well that's the plot of the warcraft movie..Storyline/pace:4/10 Don't get me wrong,the story itself is pretty interesting but the way they showed it was like someone chasing them with a stick in order to reduce the run-time(which kinda happened).Warcraft has an enormous history and i get that it would be amazingly difficult to explain all the details,but unfortunately the movie fails to deliver even some of the basic stuff.Graphics/cgi:8/10 This is the redemption of warcraft.If you exclude some scenes where the background is blurry,you can easily compare the graphic quality to Avatar's.Actually sometimes it goes beyond that..There are nearly no dark scenes,the details of the cities and costumes were spot on and the orcs were exactly as they should have been.Epic feeling/battle scenes:7/10 There is a lot of action in this film.The choreography is fine,the battle scenes are good and the spells are amazing.Best portrayal of magic i have ever seen in a film.The thing is..For a movie called WARcraft, the war scenes should have been GLORIOUS!Good is a fine word,but not for a movie that we have been waiting for a decadeAll in all/Fun factor:This is an entertaining pop-corn movie.You will not get get bored and there are 2-3 scenes that are excellent.No less but no more..If you are a fan of warcraft you will probably have a blast.If not,drink your soda,enjoy the beautiful cgi and try to go along with the plot",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,"This movie got quite negative reviews from Movie Critics, but fans of the game will, no doubt love this movie! The Autistic Reviewers aren't even fans of the game, and we thoroughly enjoyed it! Orcs and humans have had a hatred for each other thousands of years and no one really knows why. They were just different species. But now the Orcs need the humans help to bring down the real evil behind this whole war.The pace of the film was pretty good. It gets a little boring for a minute or two, and then straight back into the movie. The action and fight sequences are really good and intense. The direction was good, no complaints there. The acting was better than we expected. Paula Patton and Ben Foster really steal the show here. Their acting was the best. The writing felt like a PC game, but not a bad thing as it's meant to be one! All in all, it was obvious from the word go that Warcraft was going to be a Franchise. It ends with you wanting more. We're sure the second one will be just as good as the first one. Autistic Reviewers give this 3.5/5 stars/7.5/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Movie made for people who love Warcraft,"The stunning visuals and amazing effects invite you to the fantastic and beautiful world you know from the games.First of all I have to say that I am a big fan of the Warcraft franchise, but I am not that fond of the lore, especially the lore of the beginnings which is pictured in this movie. So I don't know if there is a lot of discrepancy to the original lore, but frankly that also doesn't really matter to me.In terms of story the movie is not outstanding, but it is good and the characters are written and played well for the most part. It is not told out of only one perspective, which makes you see the motives of both sides and both are not plain good or plain evil, even though there is a main antagonist to the story. Coming to the characters as such, most of the actors fit their characters, had logical motives and made me empathize for them. The only flaw for me was Ben Foster as Medivh. He didn't do a really bad job and the role also wasn't badly written, but i think he doesn't really fit the role. But again I don't know the original lore. He just seemed unfitting for me. Especially because the rest fit their roles very well, most notably the Orcs, who looked and were played amazing, both motion captured or live acted.Which leads me to my third and for this movie most important and best part: The visuals Warcraft manages to dazzle you almost every second during the entire movie with it's incredible beauty and visual effects. The places you visit all seem real and you feel like you're coming home to the world you know from the games, because it looks just the same, but more beautiful and real. Everything is so detailed and gorgeous, you can really feel the love and fandom, that went into this movie. The battles and there are quite a few of them are very well choreographed and you never feel like it's just another movie fight.To sum it up, you should definitely watch this movie, especially, if you're a fan of the Warcraft franchise, because it takes the Warcraft universe and puts it into a mainly visually stunning film with good lore behind it. And of course the movie is full of fan service for the people who know this franchise for a long time. I don't know how people who aren't in familiar with the Warcraft lore in any way will take this movie but for fans it is most definitely a must see in my opinion and I can not wait for another one.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Video Game Movie Curse FINALLY BROKEN!,"Holy light am I in awe. The more I think about the movie as time passes the more I love it. Here are my two cents-First of all what you all heard about the length of the movie is true- it should have been AT LEAST a half an hour longer. Some of the things could have been explained more thoroughly, given more depth. This way it feels like it cuts off too fast from certain events.The MUSIC was bloody marvelous. Accompanies the ongoing action perfectly. Definitely going to get my hands on the full OST.Not even going to talk about the CGI, because everyone already said that it is mind blowing, which I COMPLETELY agree with. (Even though I watched it in regular 3D, not IMAX)Now, as for the story, for fans, there is a lot of things that are changed, aka not canon within the lore. The changes are not absurd and they fit pretty well with the movie. I actually ended up preferring some of the changes to the canon stuff, even though ONE certain deviation kinda left me unsatisfied.The action/fight scenes are done with an amazing level of detail to them.Even with the lack of detailed character introduction, you still easily connect to them. There are many emotional scenes, and there is a particular one that literally left me speechless and a bit teary- eyed. Overall, I rate it a solid 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really boring and incoherent movie,"I have done a lot of online gaming , warranted WOW wasn't something I ever got into so I thought I'd see this movie to see what the hype was about. I wasn't impressed and started falling asleep half way through. It was a plodding mess with so much CGI and boring battle scenes that I began to wonder why people in China are so into this movie ? I guess there are a lot of hard core WOW fanboys in China. Lucky for the backers of this movie as it is bombing here in the states. Summing up, Warcraft is a really poorly made boring video game movie that is on par with Street Fighter and Super Mario Bros. And no doubt it will get a sequel because of the idiots in China and other countries shelling out the cash for this bomb.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I would say a good video game adaptation movie.,"The characters need to be more energetic, the armour for humans was bad, the guardian should of been an old guy and the half way about in the middle of the movie the fight sequences wasn't good but half way through the movie, it really starts getting good overall I would say a good movie. Hell if they made a second one I would go and watch it. The movie was entertaining. IMDb is making me write ten lines. Overall it was a 7 out of 10 rating movie. I really liked Duraten character, His wife, and the human fighter and magicians. Are they making or will they be making a sequel to Warcraft because I don't know man common this is stupid.

A Cringeworthy Experience And An Absolute Waste Of Duncan Jones' Talents.,"Fantasy may not be an easy genre to pull off but one doesn't need to look past the prologue of The Lord of the Rings to get an idea of what all it takes to plant the seeds of interest in the minds of the filmgoing audience and compel even the newcomers to tag along on a journey to a world they don't know anything about. Even Harry Potter series serves as a pretty good example, if not an ideal one.Warcraft, on the other hand, is cringeworthy from start to finish. Infested with excess CGI, terrible screenplay, soulless characters, forgettable performances & incompetent direction from the very filmmaker who's responsible for two of the most amazing sci-fi flicks in recent memory, his latest is a bland cinema that fails to create any sort of interest at any given time, and is simply a pain to sit through.Based on the popular video game of the same name, the story of Warcraft unfolds in the kingdom of Azeroth where peace is disrupted when it is invaded by a fearsome race of orc warriors who are fleeing from their dying world into Azeroth through a portal. With one world facing destruction and other facing extinction, the plot follows two warriors from opposing forces whose actions ultimately decide the fate of their family & race.Directed by Duncan Jones (best known for Moon & Source Code), Warcraft is an absolute waste of his talents and marks the first dent of his impressive career. Without familiarising the viewers with the world it puts on screen, the film dives into its main plot within the opening minutes and follows it up with one inexplicable scene on top of another. There isn't even an attempt to explain what's happening here as most of it makes no sense at all, and the film as a whole is far too up its ass to notice that.Even the technical aspects are a letdown in this effects-laden picture. The grand set pieces have no sense of awe to them and the production design team fails to infuse a live-action feel to those props. Camera-work is lazy although it does duplicate the ambiance of its source material, Editing is a nightmare as this narrative is all over the place while its pacing is even worse. Characters are cardboard cutouts and performances aren't any better either. Even Ramin Djawadi's soundtrack fails to provide an epic vibe.On an overall scale, Warcraft is one of the worst films I've ever seen and this level of monstrosity wasn't expected from someone like Duncan Jones. No introduction, no explanation & no sense of direction, this uninspiring feature is shoddily crafted, sluggishly paced & horribly performed and I can't think of one redeemable quality about it. Failing at even the basic aspects of storytelling and presenting its director diving head-first into the sea of CGI excess, Warcraft is fantasy filmmaking at its very worst. An absolute waste of time. Skip it, folks.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fan Service ?,"Warcraft is probably one of the most well know game of all time and one that actually has a huge influence on gaming community to date, with that in mind there's no doubt that this is the movie that fans has been waiting to see for years and years and one that hopefully will break the curse of ""movie based from video games are bad"" .first off, i want to clarify things and talk about the real quality of the movie without that gaming fan (which i am) in mind, Warcraft is not a bad movie but it is no doubt has a lot and lot of trouble especially with it's scale, Warcraft is a HUGE game there's tons and tons of things to talk about but this is not a game it's a movie which mean you have a limited amount of time to tell story and get things right with precision.Unfortunately Warcraft just want to do too much stuff without thinking how much resource they have and that makes everything feels rush because they want to fill as many characters as possible while progressing the story and with out real time to just sit and talk about background of all these characters it's just a mess, in the end i feel disconnect from the character and the story itself which is the worst thing you can possibly do.With that reason i can see why a lot of critics and audience who don't know about the game and didn't care about the game didn't like Warcraft because honestly it's just a mess and lots of things go wrong, i don't want to pinpoint the main reason here but maybe this Huge scale of movie (like lord of the rings scale) didn't fit with director Duncan Jones who did a amazing job at Moon (2009) and Source Code (2011) but the scale of these 3 movie is just too much to handle.Now for the gamer and fans point of view Warcraft is actually a pretty good experience just seeing your favorite characters, world or story in the movie makes you want to shed a tear or something it's just so beautiful and with fans that already know a lot of backstory of these characters these story they will have no problem understand what's going on in the movie at all which is something that a lot of people will have a problem with.In the end Warcraft is probably a middle-ground movie it's not a bad one but it's not good either it's a movie that depends a lot on your knowledge your nostalgia your love a lot to understand or even like it, gamer and fans will probably love the movie while others will scratching their head and wonder what's going on in the movie, i can't denied that Warcraft has a lot of miss-step even i'm a fans of the franchise but i still want to see it more, so if you're a fans you should watch it support the movie, if you're not a fan then maybe give it a try but keep in mind that you should not expect much from it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Dedicated to fans, made by fans","Me and my lady went to see this highly anticipated movie yesterday, and since i have been a hardcore gamer for the last 10-15 years, - which included games like warcraft 2, 3 and World of Warcraft, my expectations on this movie was enormous. My girlfriend however, who has played WoW but not really payed attention to the lore, didn't know what to expect and had little hopes for this one.And its also here the biggest problems for this movie is. The fans of the games will have a significant better understanding on the circumstances of the characters and the world in this movie than a regular movie-goer would.The movie is truthful to its source material, but the issue lies within the characters, some of them are just borderline flat because a regular person or any reviewer doesn't ""read"" the characters motivations, but ""we"" who are familiar to Warcraft, knows the intentions of Gul'Dan f.ex, is much more intricate than ""just"" invading a new world to conquer for the Horde, the Fel magic isn't just a type of magical resource, but it ties to a significant threat which is not the orcs but something completely different. Same goes for Medivh, his past does affect him and his action in this movie, but a regular person doesn't know this, which will make this characters non- important to them when it should be the opposite. Instead this movie is dedicated to Travis Fimmel's character Anduin Lothar, Ben ""Schnitzel""'s Khadgar and Pattons Garona, although we get glimpses of their personalities, you wont feel any connection or any empathy for them, not as much as you wants to at least.The performances of the actors are... OK. Lothar and Khadgar have a strange chemistry which feels awkward. Lothars insults to Khadgar doesn't bring any reactions or any emotions, it feels like they are just reading the script loudly to each other in these cases.Patton's Garona on the other hand is the most interesting figure in this movie by far, a orc-human hybrid (at least that is what they want you to think) with a dark past. This is a persona i want to delve deeper into (not that i have much other choice when the movie ends). Besides being the only orc which isn't in mo-cap, she blends nicely in performing with the other orcs, with Kebbels Durotan, (""i am Durotan"" sounded a lot like ""i am ape"" from another movie Kebbel was part of,) and Wu's Gul'Dan is excellent. Kazinskys Orgrim get little screen time, but gets to say more than Grommash Hellscream at least.All in all, its a very good movie, and i believe Warcraft could easily become a popular movie series, but peoples taste in movies are very different, and the fantasy genre isn't that appealing anymore, not when Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones have set the standard for this genre, with its high production quality and design.Im not saying the quality of the warcraft movie is any less, far from it, the CGI of the orcs and the landscapes are phenomenal, but the style is quite different. F.ex: LotR and GoT are gritty and more realistic compared to the more ""colorful"" nature of Warcraft, with over-the-top magical light effects and glow-eye-enchantments is very different from what we are used to see.After reading many negative reviews on this movie, i cant directly blame them, because they are right, they don't have any insight in Warcraft's lore, and those who know the games from before, praise it.I am huge warcraft fan, but i wanted this movie to be more appealing to those who isn't familiar with Warcraft and its rich lore and interesting characters.Im afraid this movie will flop majorly because this isn't anything but visual feast for the eyes with flat characters, and a OK enough war story.Duncan Jones might not be the right man for introducing the characters, but the direction of this movie was of similar quality to his other movies, which are fantastic!I would recommend this movie for everyone, its great, but the level of appreciation for this will undeniably favor those familiar to the universe by a lot!I would know, i spent about 2 hours after the movie to explain the lore to my girlfriend, all the way back to the dark titan Sargeras and the creation of the burning legion... which Isn't MENTIONED ONCE IN THIS MOVIE!It was a bold choice of Duncan Jones not to include Mannoroth, or Sargeras even, hopefully he will be given a second chance to correct this in a sequel.For a fan like me, it managed to capture the essence of the Warcraft universe, but the characters falls short and isn't properly introduced as i would like it to be.For a fan, 9/10, for a regular this is a 5-6/10, for me its a 7.Feel free to comment if you agree or disagree",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Surprisingly Entertaining,"After reading the terrible reviews, and not being a fan of the World of Warcraft games, I went into this movie with very low expectations. Initially, the low expectations seemed to be appropriate. The movie introduces a number of different characters in a rather haphazard way, barely explaining what they do or why we should care.Similarly, there's very little world building in the beginning, and people are just expected to have a basic understanding of how things in the Warcraft universe fit together.Pretty quickly, though, the movie launches into a surprisingly compelling plot. Unlike many other movies in the genre (Lord of the Rings, for example) doesn't just focus on the human (or ""good"") side, but explains the back story of the Orcs, and gives them personality and motivation. After a lackluster start, the movie manages to give the characters at least some depth, and despite having a pretty large cast, almost everybody has at least some character development.Technically, this movie is flawless. The amount of work that must have gone into creating the Warcraft universe in this movie must have been incredible. The attention to detail is breathtaking. In scenes where dozens and dozens of Orcs are shown, every single one looks unique, and has his (or her) own characteristics and movements. The world in which the movie takes place is beautiful, and the fight choreographs are amazing.The colorful world in which the movie takes place defies the grim-dark trend in recent years, where even Superman movies have to be sad and dark and rainy, and that alone makes Warcraft a refreshing joy to watch.Despite being quite long, the movie always moves ahead at a brisk pace, and manages to convey a ton of plot.In short, this is a really well made, very entertaining movie. It has its flaws, particularly in the beginning, but I truly enjoyed every second of it.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What can i say ? excellent or awesome ?,"I'm a fan of Warcraft, but i started late when the Warcraft 3 was released. In this review i will not spoil any story-line in Warcraft, i just wanna show how i like and dislike this movie in my view and my people's view ( i mean my Indonesian brethren )what can i say ? excellent or awesome ? i think it is excellent. the video angle is awesome which can make every single scene of this movie become desktop wallpaper. the act of the actor and actresses are natural, seems like they studied hard every scene. the graphic is so cool, it could make me amazed every single scene, and sometimes i dropped my jaws while put my hands on my cheeks because it was so fantastic.when i stepped out the theater, i overheard some of the viewers said that the story-line was not good. i think because my Indonesian people is not accustomed to the Warcraft lore and folk. i think they are same like me, started to play Warcraft when it was already the third game. which means that they skipped a lot of story behind it. we (Indonesian) maybe expected that we could watch Warcraft 3 or DoTA heroes played in this movie.Overall, Good Job Blizzard and any others that involved in making of this movie. we are so glad that finally Warcraft is being taken into a great and awesome movie. we expect more, we want sequel. tee-he",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
LOTR meets D&D with a side of Hamlet,"Paula Patton, best known from films like 2 Guns, Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Déjâ Vu, and Traffik, stars alongside Vikings lead Travis Fimmel and the acclaimed Ben Foster in another perfectly encapsulated story arc from a video game, and then some. As 'fel'-infected orcs, led by an evil orc warlock, invade the human realm, a faction of rebels helps the king and his wizard defeat the evil magic.Based on the popular multiplayer fantasy war game, but rewritten to include a touching father and son story to contrast all the war and magic. Paula's Garona also shows some depth of character in an otherwise obvious casting and acting. The unnecessary Shakespearean contemplations by the King's wizard, the basic soldier concept, and the Camelot king acts are shallow at best.While secondary actors let it down, the sets, CGI, and LOTR-type vistas propped it up... a bit.Not the worst nor the best. A good entry, and hopefully, they can build from there unless the upcoming D&D film overshadows it!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Even Uwe Boll could not make it worse !!!,"I am not a Warcraft gamer, so I do not know what the story behind is !!! I watched it as a movie and my rating is based on that !!!The first thing is that this movie does not have any story to tell !!!Being based on a game all I was expecting was just some action !!! Even that was not done well !!!The second and most annoying part was the acting and directing !!!The main character (Travis Fimmel) was extremely annoying (the CGI actors were way better than every human actor in the movie ), his acting was horrible, (was he really drank or was he trying to act as a drank ???), anyways all I saw from that guy was a very bad imitation of Johnny Deep's Jack Sparrow !!!Overall the action part (you would expect pretty good ones for a movie based on a action game) was even not good enough !!!Uwe Bool is known for making worst movies based on games, but even he could not make it worse than this one !!!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
True to the Game & Enjoyable,"Its a good movie which is true to the game, I was entertained for the most part through out the film along with my other three friends, there is some slow points as it is in all long movies but overall it was enjoyable. Two of my friends had never experienced the World of Warcaft game before and believed it was a good watch from an unbiased view. I believe people who have never have played the game will have to go in with an open minded because its not in any shape or form Lord of the Rings!People have been slamming the amount of CGI in use but how else could they have done it? The scenery was true to the game and I personally enjoyed the CGI. We all thought the Orcs aesthetics where done brilliantly along with the magic from Medivh. Honestly, I thought there was some dodgy exchanges in some scenes between the characters! at times a little rushed or leaving you wanting more, especially between Lothar & Garona.Warcraft is a good film and a solid introduction to its world, not by any means fantastic, but its left completely open for another film which I believe is a good thing! Hopefully we will see another one with a more open view of the world and its lore!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
No Craftiness,"I don't know anything about Warcraft except that it's a game. I was going into this as a blank slate: tell me your story, show me your movie and I have no biases to start.Ala LOTR and Game of Thrones there is a kingdom with many districts/outposts, etc. Orcs, from a separate world altogether, have found a portal into the world of humans, dwarfs and other beings. These Orcs have only conquering on their minds and the humans must stop them to protect their world.The story is pretty good, nothing groundbreaking. I had no problem with it for the most part but there were some definite inconsistencies that I found annoying. The CGI was solid (it was a major undertaking considering all of the Orcs were CGI) and there were some nice battle scenes. Beyond that, there's not much to say about it. They tried to go for some depth but it fell very flat. In fact, it came of as sloppy and trite. I think they would have been better off going a less serious route and making it what it was: a battle of humans and Orcs.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"So Much Story, So Little Time","I'm not a Warcraft fan. In fact, I didn't even know there were games before World of Warcraft until this movie came out. However my qualms with the MMORPG have nothing to do with the gameplay or story, so I was still reasonably interested in seeing the movie version (or the movie version of those older games, at least). I went last night, which is unseasonably late for me to see a movie, I'll admit, but there were too many smaller movies that I feared would stop their run if I substituted either for Warcraft.Warcraft: The Beginning follows the start of the war between the Humans of Stormwind and the Orcs who have been driven away from their dying world. I figured that would be the extent of fantasy races we might see, but thankfully I was wrong as mages and wizards have a very strong presence (as someone who always plays the more mystical characters in an RPG, this made me quite happy), and dwarfs and elves have small cameos every now and then as well. There's even a strong hint at demons and dark magic.One of the biggest things that drew me to Warcraft was how it promised a balanced look at the two opposing sides of the conflict. Typically a movie like this will favour the human perspective and paint the alien creatures as the faceless enemy. It was refreshing to see this other race explored and developed, although it's very easy to pinpoint the changes Duncan Jones made to the script in order to do so. The development of the Orc factions is largely relegated to it's own little sub-plot, which disappointed me a bit. It has it's own beginning, middle, and end (an end that occurs well before the movie's climax), and rarely intercedes with the main storyline at all. In fact it almost squanders it entirely as it builds up to a different trade-off, but ultimately the movie has to reset it's status quo for the finale to still make sense.In this respect, and many others, the film does feel a little rushed at times. If there's anything I've learned from the movie, it's that the world of Azeroth is huge, with many different races, factions, cultures, and ways of doing things. There's no way anyone could do justice to this massive world in two hours, and as such some elements are included but glossed over. Often something happens and we quickly move to the next event with little downtime or explanation of whats going on.That said, what we do see of Azeroth feels rich and plentiful, and while the development of the Orcs could honestly have been cut entirely without any impact on the main story, it is refreshing to see their side of the war as well. We come to understand why they've been forced out of their world, and more crucially see that they're not just faceless evil, but they face their own form of evil and corruption. There's also a lot of development for the magical elements as well. Like everything in the movie I feel it should have been developed more, or just left out entirely.But moving away from the story, the special effects were sublime. This is high fantasy at it's best. The humans use big, ornate pieces of armour and weaponry, and yet it never looks campy or too over-the-top. There's griffin-like creatures, and giant wolves, and even some kind of large frog- like thing (yeah, it's starting to become obvious I've never played), and all look great, although Lothar's hand does seem to fall through the griffin when he pats it. The biggest triumph when it comes to the CGI though is with the Orcs. They get the Avatar/Gollum treatment, with motion- captured actors underneath, and it adds a huge amount of facial expression and body language that just wouldn't have been present otherwise. The sheer depth of variety in the Orcs is also great, as no two Orcs look the same.Warcraft: The Beginning, is a strong, if understandably flawed start of a promising franchise. It's biggest sin is trying to cram too much story in so little time, so I have no doubt it would have benefited from a longer running time, or even being split up into multiple movies. There's no denying that adapting such a rich universe like Warcraft would be a huge undertaking, but Duncan Jones took the challenge, and he was largely successful in delivering an entertaining, bombastic movie that appeals to fans and non-fans of the games alike. The music is top-notch (had the main theme stuck in my head all night), and the fate of many characters don't end at all how you'd expect, even if the main twist itself is hugely predictable. I give Warcraft an enjoyably flawed 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sollid film,"They say this blockbuster season was the worst in decade but so far I'm surprised by the quality of films such as the latest X-Men film and this movie. Sure, they won't become classics but they are bonafide blockbusters: 100% epic entertainment from start to finish.I'm not a Warcraft fan at all. I do play roleplaying games but I found World of Warcraft to be rather mediocre and I was never a fan of strategy games. So I went into this film not being a fan or even very familiar with the Warcraft franchise but still knowing its cultural impact. I can say that I finally understand the obsession of the fans with the lore of Warcraft. It is rather compelling and I'm looking forward to the next film to continue the saga.Having said that, this film is far from perfect. It is clear they have a lot of great content to work with but somehow it feels half done. Even so, that's still sufficient for a solid score in my opinion. But it feels like the movie could have been better if they had given us a slower introduction to the world and the characters. I only started to care for most of them in the final act of the film.At the same time I feel the film shouldn't have been longer since I sometimes wasn't fully engaged as it was. Characters make or break a film so I don't endorse simply adding more content but if the film had add 30-45 minutes to better flesh out the characters and story then it would have made for a better film. Particularly the opening felt rushed and was uneasy for me as someone who was new to the franchise.I advice the creators to look at Lord of the Rings (LOTR). The discovery of the orc invasion and the dark magic behind it could have been revealed at a much slower pace similar to the discovery of the ring in LOTR. They would have made me more engaged in both the characters and the story which would have also made me more interested in the action and effects (which remain topnotch by themselves regardless).In short, this movie showed a lot of potential and I think the sequel can fully realize it. The great thing about the Warcraft franchise is that it appears to deal with generations and the next could focus on the son of the king and the orc chieftan. So the creators have a change to re-introduce the world and the plot line at a better pace and in a more compelling way in their next outing! Looking forward to it!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome!,"I was so excited to see this movie--and also afraid of having my hopes dashed. There have been so many poorly made fantasy movies made in the past (I'm looking at you The Seventh Son) and I was afraid this one would be no different.But Warcraft is everything I hoped it would be: huge, epic, magical, wondrous... This isn't Lord of the Rings, in many ways it's better. LOTR was so focused on being epic that it felt overly long winded. Granted, I suppose that's due to the source material too, but Warcraft manages to cram a lot into it's under two hour run time. Yes, it has lots of magic; yes, it has lots of action; yes, it is a total escape into a world very different from our own. But somehow, even while the film is packed to the gills with the fantastic, it still manages to stay grounded in characters we care about.I was totally riveted for the entire duration of this fantastic film, and I can't wait for the sequel.I'll admit that I was nervous about seeing this film after hearing all the negative press it's receiving, so I'm happy to report that while some critics may not like this movie, I sure did and I highly recommend it!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Really enjoyed the movie.,"Honestly I really enjoyed watching the movie Warcraft. I was surprised when others have said the movie was horrible with bad CGI. I really don't care the opinions of the other movie critics. As a Warcraft fan, I am quite satisfied with this movie. Although I really loved the plot of the story, I am quite disappointed on how they implement it. I noticed the scene were quite disorganized. It isn't like the LOTR or Hobbit, where the scenes are more organized and the pace was consistent. However, the graphics such as the magic power, the background, the design of both orcs and humans, I love it. I highly recommend you watching this on IMAX or 3D. I am a huge fan of medieval fantasy story plot such as LOTR, Hobbit, GOT, and this movie is included. I really hope it will be successful and I cant wait for a sequel.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Entertaining, albeit a bit messy, watch","Warcraft is a video game adaptation of the popular game series of the same name. In order to escape their dying world, the orcs invade the world of Azeroth, while the inhabitants of that world, namely the humans, try to stop their efforts. Now I have never played World of Warcraft or any other game in the franchise except for Warcraft 3, and that too only online matches with my friends, meaning I have little to no knowledge about this universe, its lore, its characters etc. Having said that, I was still interested in watching this movie as I just love fantasy worlds and this looked like another good one.From the very first scene to the very last, this movie was RUSHED AS HELL. There was literally no breathing room, none at all. This is the core reason for all of my problems with the movie. It felt like they had the material to make two movies, or even a trilogy, but crammed it all into one 2 hour long movie. The movie just went from scene to scene, locations to location, without giving you time to take it all in. This also resulted in little to no development for majority of the characters. There was also a super rushed forced romance in the movie. And the movie just ends. No proper resolution. Seriously, it feels like they just butchered a 3 hour movie to make it shorter. I hope there is an extended Bluray version or something.Keeping the extremely fast pace in mind, the movie was somehow still entertaining. I wanted to know more about the world, the characters, the races and what have you. The story was straightforward with some interesting characters. Surprisingly, the main Orc, Duratan, was the one who had the most depth and emotion in the entire movie. This was not only thanks to a good performance, but also thanks to some amazing motion capture work. The facial animations and detail was almost on Dawn of the planet of the apes level, which really brought not only Duratan, but other orcs to life, whether it be Guldan: the big baddie or Duratan's wife.This brings me to the overall CGI work. The orcs, as stated above, looked amazing. Huge, fierce, powerful beings. Their fights had impact and you really got the feeling that humans were puny little things in front of them. The locations looked great as well. The different landscapes and cities were quite beautiful at times. However, CGI was inconsistent. The creatures/animals didn't look as good, and at times, when there were both live humans and CGI orcs and environments in the mix, things did get too green-screen-ey.The action was good and entertaining. It wasn't anything outstanding, something I was expecting for some reason ( :p ), but it was good enough that you get thrill out of it. I wish there were more Orc vs Orc brawls cause that looked AWESOME!! The magic stuff was great. The effects, the power and feel, it really made magic a force to fear, and I loved it. Soundtrack was good enough with some really good tracks on the orcs side.Coming back to the characters, while Duratan was great, most of the humans were really hard to care for. This again can be attributed to the fact none of them got any proper time for development. BUT, some of the acting was bad too. Stilted and lifeless. And with movie being so rushed, sometimes characters just pop out, even near the end for furthering the plot, making things more messy.Still, surprisingly enough, it was an entertaining watch, even if a messy one. The 2 hours flew by. If it wasn't such a rushed job, this could have been a great fantasy action movie and the general audience would have liked it more. As for the fans, I get why they like it more as if you know the ton of lore already, the rushed job won't have a big effect. My recommendation is that it is worth a try if you like fantasy worlds. There are things to appreciate in the movie and can be a good time for many. Seeing the box office, I don't think we'll get a sequel but I really hope they do make one. I wanna see more of this world.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perhaps it was ten years too late,"It's hard to take this film seriously, or even see it as an installment to the Warcraft franchise. To older fans of a now twenty plus year old franchise, it might just seem like a bad parody video on Youtube. To newer fans, it may seem wonderful because they believe its reigniting the legacy of a franchise's heyday they were never around for. To those uninitiated with the story at all, it may just feel like yet another bad fantasy flick on par with Gods of Egypt or Wrath of the Titans made for children.A severely diluted and inaccurate retelling of Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, one might wonder what the point of this film even was. Why go through the effort to dramatically change it for the worst, and deliver it through poor dialogue executed through overacting which starred actors who might not even be considered B List quality? We're introduced to bland and dry humans who wear bad Ren Faire garb or armor that is humorously far more ornate and impractical than what we even see in the games (which is accompanied with an excessive amount of post-production metallic clanking sound effects), and to contradicting and superficial orcs donned in pseudo-primitive attire rendered so poorly that you might begin to question the effectiveness of motion capture. Through superfluous narrative, the plot thrusts us from one green screen sound stage to the next, barely giving us time to garner a sense of atmosphere as we're whisked away within three to five minutes to yet another random locale. To those unfamiliar with the franchise, they're never likely to remember the goofy names or nomenclature of the characters and unique story elements, and they're undoubtedly lost in the sheer amount of backstory that's never unveiled but simply implied to fans who spent years soaking it all up. The CGI rendering of the inhuman races (sans elves) might make one question the wisdom in such a decision; to waste more money on rendering them, rather than simply using practical effects and costumes on appropriate actors as has been done in fantasy films prior. The elves in question might present an answer to that, as they appeared to be shoddy quality cosplayers with poorly fabricated latex ears, foam fantasy outfits, bad wigs and LED light contact eye lenses. The question as to whether this will prevail over the likes of Lord of the Rings or not is quite evident: it will not. Lord of the Rings provided great immersion for longtime fans, while Warcraft could hardly make one believe any of it; from the over usage of huge light show spectacles for otherwise simple magical spells to incoherent plot progression and more than questionable (or confusing) character decisions, it's certainly not going to dethrone the LotR films anytime soon.When it all boils down to the future of this film venture, the franchise could only continue if it willfully alienates those who have never played the games and caters strictly to those who know the wide berth of backstory, as the vast amount of plot holes and unanswered questions can only worsen as they delve into the stories of the later games, which feature far more plot elements which the filmmakers could never squeeze into the respective subsequent films. While at the same time, how soon could we expect to see a sequel, given the production hell this very film endured, and the divided response it garnered? If not for China, this film may very well have failed to break budget, as it hasn't even grossed three times what it cost in total. Given Legendary Pictures was acquired by a Chinese production company during the production of this film, what fans this film has garnered may be relieved if a sequel is produced if just because of the positive interest the Chinese audience has shown in this film, as undoubtedly no American company would trust a sequel to succeed based on the poor domestic US box office results.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Ignore the Critics, This Film is Utterly Fantastic!","I went to see Warcraft with my girlfriend; we had totally different perspectives on the source material when watching this film. She could not be less into computer games, especially World of Warcraft, which I have tried and failed to get her addicted to as I was. I however am a complete nerd and knew all of the lore, and I mean all of it, before even going into the cinema. We both loved it. The style of the cgi, the story, the fights, the actors, everything! We both say totally engrossed for two hours, me nerding out massively, her jumping and laughing and experiencing the sadness as the story played out. Duncan Jones has done a fantastic job at adapting the source material, which is especially good when you consider that said source consisted of a computer game with let's say not quite the deepest of plot lines! I would say it is the best 3D film and computer game adaptation I have seen to date, and both my girlfriend and I cant wait until the next one comes out! Oh and just as a side point, at the time of writing this review the film had a poor review rating on rotten tomatoes. In response I would say look at who has given the poor reviews and look who's given it what it is rightfully due in my opinion. This kind of film needs and open mind in order for you to enjoy it, and it's definitely safe to say that the people who have reviewed it poorly have not given the time and thoughtful approach that this film deserves, much to their own loss.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Non-Warcraft player, but I liked the movie","I've never played any of the Warcraft games but thought they did a good job making an entertaining movie. The fantasy was great and didn't mind getting thrown in the middle of the story.

It's not Lord of the Rings nor did I feel like it was trying to be but I liked what it was trying to do despite a few nitpicky flaws, cough, romance, cough horrible Orc tusks on the half-Orc female lead.

The CGI protagonist gave a better performance than Travis Fimmel,"MOVIE-MAKING LESSON: You can't build a complex world lore when you have Travis Fimmel ruin it with line-reading straight from Rian Johnson's ""Actor's guide on subverting the audience's expectations"".Go see Warcraft if you like Duncan Jones's other work. This movie is not nearly as bad as it deserved to be, but you'll still be surprised by how little you cared about Warcraft, and how nothing changes after 2 hours. Its main fault lies in a script that tries to unload too much exposition to an audience that mostly couldn't care less; in some noticeably bad editing; and in Travis Fimmel doing over-the-top subverted Shakespeare nonsense.

The definition of being sufficient,"Watched it, liked it!The critics bashing it, understandably, the fans and non-fans like it, also understandably. Who is right? BothAlright, so let's just put the premise of this whole thing. A film adaptation, for a game, still a very tricky thing to do which could easily go wrong, and did for many tries in the past. It has to be appealing for the fans, non-fans, for movie goers, Avatar movie-like fanatics, snobbish people, adults and children etc. and just then we still didn't get to the fact, that it is a movie, and it has to tell a story from A to B, having a structure, in which a movie should work.We're living in an age where a film adaptation for a game has finally managed to bring exactly the same image which the game itself represents, well, in a way. Some are saying it's not a World of Warcraft movie, I say it is, kinda, mixed with the Warcraft I's simplicity, creating a hybrid which tells a simple but important story for this franchise, introducing elements which may be important for the latter storytelling. It's indeed a beginning for possible sequels, just as it should be after several ones were released in the format of books, and games, summing up massive lore, from which the film makers could choose and put as a sequel next to this really ambitious, and overall well made movie; Warcraft, the Beginning.It couldn't be that easy to bring all the feelings, experiences which we could come by in games, or in the world of literature. That's merely impossible, that's why I think that without Duncan Jones' talent this movie couldn't work, which want to tell many things yet it still don't. It starts to bring up information which should be noted, but in the end, their role and part will only be seen in the future somewhere, so now they only take participation in making the represented world believable and credible, creating the atmosphere the game itself has.It may have been made for the fans, but it also could be appealing for non- fans, however the truth is, each side will take the communications of this movie differently, 'coz no matter what, some pre-knowledge wouldn't hurt to really get the movie's real intention. It may be liked by non-fans, and the uninitiated, the information they collect from this 2 hour story restores whole differently as in a fan, or a viewer, who has played some time with any of the games. So in my opinion, the REAL quality could be experienced if you have some knowledge about the franchise, whether it is from the written format or gaming platform. Because no matter what, the world of Warcraft is a grotesque but still a dangerous place, it's as serious as it is not, it holds as dark moments as light ones, and this is a language that Warcraft held with itself from the beginning of its existence. So when a guy, like Medivh speaks totally seriously about the Fel magic, as the camera holds the position on his face, it is as serious as cringe-worthy, it's someplace in between, and that's the simple reflection of the world of Warcraft's language, when you look at the orcs, they are not just scary, they are also adorable in a way with their huge hands and tusks, with their simple perspective of life, when we see Lothar, a totally cheeky appearance throughout a film showing off how deadly and sullen can he be in the end.However some changes have been made in order to make the movie work, so in some percentage it really doesn't matter what your pre-conceptions are, a partly new story will be shown in front of you, and here is the answer what a film adaptation for a game should be, in my opinion: Be true to the source, but also make purpose to bring it on screen. How could be that possible? Simply with thinking a bit outside the box, understanding how could the elements of a game work on big screen in order to bring new experiences for the audience, making it clear what's the difference between communicating information by the game and the movie.Familiar faces, names, stories, a bit differently, bringing back memories from the past in a form of modern communication, and the language of motion picture. We see what we expect to see, yet get it in a whole lot of different pacing that we got used to watching any cinematics made in this franchise, experiencing a story, that has heart, and soul, an ambitious production which possibly holds many surprises and also nostalgic feelingsSo simply put, Warcraft: The Beginning is a fresh and solid experience, giving a good fun to the audience, that may not be a masterpiece, or legendary, far from that, but as a movie adaptation for a game it is a pleasant momentum, and for a start it is sufficient. Just let us see some effect of elevation or evolution for the sequels.P.S.: They say that 40 minutes footage was cut out from the full length, maybe that's why it is a bit chaotic in several places... so we better get a director's cut. Oh, I cannot wait to see the Lord of the Clans.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually impressive but slow and underdevelopped,"As far as computer game movies go it's one of the better ones, but as most game movie are total sh1t that isn't saying much... I had very high hopes for this one as the director is no one less then Duncan Jones, director of gems like 'Moon' and 'Source Code'. Jones also claims to be a Warcraft fan and the meaty 160m$ budget should alow to visualize most they can think of without monetary constraints. Well, first the good things: the movie looks pretty awesome. The cinematography is great, the colors and production design are very consistent with the game and the CGI Orcs (courtesy of ILM) are almost photoreal and neatly integrated into the live action footage. So an A+ for eye candy. But that's where the good news stops. The movie plot is just to thin for a 123 minute movie and there are so many scenes where nothing is happening. Characters are just talking their face off but they aren't saying anything useful or aren't advancing the plot. The characters themselves are rather shallow. Sometimes when they die you won't care one bit. The Orc Durotan and Garona are fleshed out the best, but the humans are one sad cardboard bunch. This as you can imagine makes the movie a bit boring and quite slow at times. There seems very little at stake and almost not tension buildup. Has Duncan Jones actually seen his own previous movies? Jones said this is supposed to be a franchise but it should have gotten a better start to keep people interested. If they make a sequel it will be for the Chinese I'm sure.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Reality Check For Fanboys,"Oh boy...where to begin? Well I think it's fair to say that the majority of the uninitiated to Warcraft didn't expect much from the film given mainly what we had seen in the trailers & in general what kind of quality that game to film adaptations have in the past presented us with, unfortunately I have to report the despair has to go on.We're getting to the point now where we are hoping one game adaptation can prove all the critics wrong but the search still goes on, the main problem I had with it was I'm an uninitiated in respect to the game itself therefore I had no knowledge other than what's appeared in popular culture (so not a lot really for me) & the film generally didn't help me out, lots of places are named, there are lots of characters to remember & you've quickly got to get on board with their motivations & goals & the film generally didn't convey them to me well enough, I personally had a bit of a problem with the effects as well as some felt like they were merely just more polished up game cut scenes & I couldn't get my mindset out of that, they didn't know the best way to present this vibrant world to us & it ends up being a mishmash of neither completely convincing CGI nor top notch practical effects, also to say that the dialogue is generic would be to be kind, don't get me wrong it's not terribly written (*cough* *cough*...Jupiter Ascending) it's just that we've heard its kind before so therefore you give out unintentional groans as you hear it & the worst offense a film as big as this can do to an audience is bore them & I had moments where I was exactly that, this is really unfortunate for the director Duncan Jones (or is it? As he's also a credited writer) because his previous films have been greatly entertaining (Moon & Source Code), certain scenes seemed weirdly edited as well, as if they suddenly remembered they were a lower certificate/rating, the film did pick up towards the final third of it & the actual magic effects were pretty good.It really does sound like I thought it was an utter disaster doesn't it, but I did find humor in the film but in unintentional places (shiny eyed people anyone?) but I suppose it still makes it entertaining if for the wrong reasons, we've got to be honest though this is damn mediocre at best & all the fans on here stating that it's as good as the Lord of the Rings in the fantasy stakes really do need to have a reality check & I think I'll leave it there as I'm sure I'll feel their wrath, oh & Hello to Jason Isaacs.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Crafting the tools of War,"My review of Warcraft: The Beginning (spoiler free)*** (3 out of 5)Cast: Travis Fimmel, Paula Patton, Ben Foster with Dominic Cooper and Toby Kebbell.Plot: The peaceful realm of Azeroth stands on the brink of war as its civilization faces a fearsome race of invaders: orc warriors fleeing their dying home to colonize another.2016 so far seems to have a few game adaptations like Angry Birds and now this both of which were better than they made out to be. Were as Angry Birds started off as a mobile game this one is completely different because it is based on well you know what World of Warcraft is.Director Duncan Jones surely challenged himself because this type of film isn't easy to make other than the fact it was done by CG. With a mostly unknown cast the film triumphs and is probably the best game adaptation ever.There are a quite a few game adaptations out there and most of them were disappointing like Resident Evil, Doom and Super bloody Mario Brothers, this one achieves the one thing that they are not that this is visually stunning and well good. It had the perfect director to make it because he knew what kind of challenge it would be and also he's a World of Warcraft nerd.This may not be the greatest movie of all time but certainly has it's perks here are some points as to why this prevails on it's genre:CGI: This movie is CGI based from start to finish but it has to be some of the best CG ever, and it makes for one hell epic ride through the world of Azeroth. The CGI makes it look so real it almost seems like a real place and you can just bet if you go then you'll most likely see orcs. Even the CG battle scenes are just beautiful to look at with something different happening every time.Origin: We all know how this started it started as a PC game and became ever so popular but because this is mainly CG based it couldn't have been done, personally I've never played the game but this is a truly epic ride into that world. Even though this is a fantasy game it has been done well and it is very fun to watch.The OK point:Action: The action has been very well to which there is something different happening every time, but the battle scenes get dull fairly that's not to say they are boring it's just the action is a key component and it just seems like it could've been better. Other than the that the film is very pretty and well action packed.The bad point:Plot: The movie doesn't follow the game to the point, because the plot is just non-existent it just makes it look like the director focused on making the movie look pretty and full of action, without actually having a plot. To make this movie it should have succeeded in all three points just mentioned instead of just two.Other than that the movie was enjoyable and completely bursting with action and it was just absolutely gorgeous to watch, ignoring the fact the plot wasn't there.Verdict: Entertaining, captivating and just beautiful this is another game based film that isn't disappointing, and definitely worth a watch.6/10 Good.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awful.,"The last movie as poor as this one that I watched was London Has Fallen.Truth is I was very excited about it being fan of the game and also I had read the reviews here and they were very positive.So the disappointment was complete and at some points toward the end of the movie I was like please God make it stop.The CGI was great but everything else was just crap - the story, the dialogues, the scenes that were not shot on green screen looked really awful, like childish-lego stuff. And I really rarely write something like this but even the casting was poor. Except Travis Fimmel - Ragnar Lodbrok of course, but everybody else were just so out of place, even just physically.They were like skinny even for humans, considering these were supposed to be warriors, kings, hardened people and so on. The apprentice and Ragnar's son looked like some 15 year-old spoiled children and looking at that kid in armour was just so ridiculous. I hope they don't make another one.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Didn't like this film that much,"When I went to watch this movie, I was expecting an action movie with some animated graphics, which it is. However,in the story line I did not find anything to catch my eyes and I was bored all the time I was in cinema. No excitement, nothing specific! Animations was not good but I think acts in this movie were acceptable in general. I think the shortcoming of such a movie is in the depiction of the new world it is describing. This world, is indeed an interesting thing and I liked the whole idea, but the story didn't let us to view more of it. The ideas were not mature enough and the movie could be much better than it is .It seems that it is not the last of Warcraft...",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It was alright,"I went in with very low expectations for this film, and was pleasantly surprised. The special effects are some of the best I've ever seen. The degree to which they brought the game to life was truly amazing to behold. Travis Fimmel (of Vikings fame) particularly stands out for his crazy yet dashing performance. To be honest, I was rather disappointed in the seeming lack of a story line, (and I thought Garona and Lothar's scenes together were quite awkward-no sure what they were thinking there) but I'm hoping they'll fit more plot into the sequel. I would recommend this to anyone who is a fan of MMORPG's like I am, or even just whoever can appreciate a good old-fashion fantasy flick. Will definitely try to see it again.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Maybe it's more about feelings,"Maybe it's more about feelings. From a film point of view, special effects are excellent, but the story and plot fail. There was no cushion for Drano's collapse; there was no introduction to many of the characters (even a subtitle for a name); and in a war of survival, there was no need to add false love scenes. In short, for the ashes, the things given are too small; for the ordinary viewers, there is too much information about filling ducks. We should learn from Marvel and make more single character series to promote the development of the main timeline. Otherwise, always want to use a clear account, time constraints, will be scattered.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Impressive CGI, less impressive story","I thought the movie was pretty good. Well, that was until I read some of the reviews on metacritic (the exceptionally low metascore captured my curiosity, so I investigated the cause). And as it turned out some of the critics were actually spot on (which is why I chose to reassess my final score).Let's just be honest. This is not Tolkien-level fantasy lore and the narratives were mediocre. With that being said it could've been way more intellectually stimulating in my humble opinion. Furthermore the movie lacked in the comedy department (every good movie gets ten times better with the right amount of humor to counterweight the seriousness of the topic. It's a proved method).Also, what disturbed me the most was the fact that they nonchalantly incorporated the infamous ""Baby Moses in a basket, safe afloat the river"" scene from the Old Testament (The book of Exodus to be precise). As if this movie trope hasn't been abused enough already.Concluding remarks: this movie was clearly made for a very specific target audience (die-hard Warcraft fans and younger audiences who don't demand complex narratives), and with the intention of releasing various sequels. The ending was very telling in that regard.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overly stuffed and overly clean,"The history of video game movies is torrid, but Warcraft seemed like the film to break the curse. The publishers were involved with the film's production, the franchise had a rich lore to draw on, and it was directed by Duncan Jones who was a director on the rise. However, Warcraft was a critical disaster and nowhere near as profitable as everyone hoped it would be.Warcraft felt more like a three-hour film or a season of a TV show condensed into less than two hours. It had too many characters and plotlines. It either needed a simpler narrative or needed more of a run time. It was a film that focused on world-building and setting up the franchise.There were some decent ideas. The Horde were the more interesting faction because they teleported to Azeroth out of desperation and they were shown to have a noble, warrior culture. They weren't simple beings of evil like in Lord of the Rings. The motion capture for the Orcs was fantastic and Toby Kebbell and Robert Kazinsky were the best actors in the film. There were so decent battle sequences, like the final battle.However, there were big issues. The setting looked like a theme park, it was too clean and pristine. Compared it to Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, and Pirates of the Caribbean where those worlds felt lived in. There was also so bizarre casting choices with some actors speaking in ill-fitting American accents. It made the film feel more like a cheap TV show.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not much Warcraft as it should have been,"As a long supporter, since 2005, and to have watched this 2016.It didnt at all, for the much time effort, feelt as an World of Warcraft related movie, besides might the Warlords of Draenor expansion lore perhaps.Didnt like that one.One of the worst exp ever released until this day in my opinion.Its just to much for the Orcs and Humans.I wanted Blood Elves,
Death Knights, and even Pandarians for a show.Travis is way a let back as an a actor. Almost feelt like he was just a disturbens.

Why is it bad?,"This review is going to be short, informative and honest. Let's get started!Screenplay is bad. Universe is not formed. Rushed and forced story.Human cast is horrible. Paula Patton deserved a Golden Raspberry Award. I wonder how she managed to not to crack while saying all those lines. Travis Fimmel is a good looking man but he clearly overacts. He behaves like a soccer player on a field, not like a mighty warrior. Casting Dominic Cooper as a King was a complete failure. No stars for this set of ""stars"" (kek).CGI could stand out. But it did not. It's all become unrealistic the moment the human characters are joining the set. Makeup is bad, requisite is cheap. You either do balance animated characters and humans or you remove someone to get a realistic picture.Let's talk about music, shall we? Oh, wait... There is no music! I mean, Blizzard, what happened? Even Warcraft TFT had a good music. Diablo 2 had different and memorable score. Here you got nothing but clacking sounds.I see why this film had a warm reception in my trashy country (Russia) and other third-world countries. People with lack of intellect will indubitably love this.Conclusion: it has no cinematic value. Not worth watching.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Deeply Flawed, But Entertains. Just Like Me.","While the flaws of Warcraft are glaring, I find that the film does enough to warrant a positive review. With a 6.7 user score in IMDB, happy to know others share the same sentiment.Warcraft was undeniably atrocious in overall production & presentation of its human characters. The costumes were visibly cheap, as if homemade but with a bit of flair. This renders characters as laughably playing dress-up, which was a thorn in my eyes. The lack of star power in its cast was also a letdown although minor. What drags its heroes to new lows is the serious lack of interest they convey. The glossed over backstories, generic screenplay, over the top acting & aforementioned cheap visuals sadly contribute to this. Save for Travis Kimmel, the rest of the portrayals were then forgettable for both the audience, & for the actors as well. I'm sure of it.On the other hand, the saving grace of Warcraft starts with director Duncan Jones. The battle scenes & ensuing action are masterfully shot, brimming with energy, thanks to his visual touch. Apart from this, another upside is Tony Kebbell's Durotan, who is one fascinating character. His storyline & conflicts are worth investing to, and easily the films' strongest asset. As for the CGI, the motion capture was perfectly executed as certain scenes & close ups were life-like. There are however, shaky moments when humans (again?) and magic comes into the picture, as it gets too cartoonish for my taste.Overall, the undesirables of Warcraft does explain the critics' lambasting of it, but its assets do entertain. For that, a 7/10 rating seems fair.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I learnt a lesson today: For a video game based movie don't ever trust reviews of critics who have never played the game which causes them to write bluffing reviews,"Warcraft is a legacy and those who have played the games made by blizzard would understand.I was very excited to watch the film since the trailer released and was waiting for June 10 .Got demoralized after reading the reviews of a group of crictics ( who apparently seem jealous of this game's fans) and thought it would turn out to be a shitty film. Since I had already booked tickets for a dozen of kids and family members and neighbours I had to go to watch it with them. I though if the film turn out crap i would apologize to my family and neighbours for wasting their time.But guess what this turn out to be epic for a warcraft fan , lovable for the kids and amazing animations for my family and neighbours.All seemed so happy after they came out of the screen .Kids are waiting for the sequel after watching the ending scene.Story has been kept on the lines of warcraft 1 game and i admit that non fan viewers will find it a bit difficult to digest the names and utility of the characters .But if they do not wish to indulge deep into the characters but watch it like a war building movie theyll love it. for eg my 70 year old grandpa.So today I learnt that a normal movie critic who has no idea of the video game will bluff while reviewing the movie made. blizzard game fans are very huge and they will not be bogged down by such bluffs. The results can be seen in China 90 million in first 2 days , the place to find true Mmorpg fans. Till then m waiting for the sequel#moreWarcraft",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

We have to stand up, stand up against this trend, otherwise there will be absolutely ZERO innovation in game or movie industry, but just a repetition of same old stories with improved graphics.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Still short of the champion we are hoping for in video-game adaptations,"As soon as the movie kicks-off, Warcraft wastes no time and plunges its viewers in a headfirst gryphon- ride into its mythical realm. This might be overwhelming for the uninitiated but for the devotees of the RPG, they will immediately embrace its world in the first minute. The orc world Draenor is on the brink of extinction and sinister orc/warlock Gul'dan (Daniel Wu) uses his soul-sucking magic to open a green portal that will send the orc horde to the human world, Azeroth. Chieftain of the Frostwolf Clan, Durotan (Toby Kebbell), questions the brutal ways of his clansmen and believes that co-existence without bloodshed is possible. On the other end of the spectrum, Knight Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel), along with the Guardian of Tirisfal, Medivh (Ben Foster) and the young mage Khadgar (Ben Schetzner) have been sent on a collision course by King Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) to stop the ""plundering, dimension-hopping"" orcs. This conflict leaves the half-orc, half-human slave Garona (Paula Patton) somewhere in the middle, torn which side to choose.What elevates Warcraft from a typical fantasy film is that it offers something refreshing with its plot: the blurred sides of good and evil. Just like the game you will find yourself rooting for either race – the humans or the orcs, based on what morals you personally believe in. Of course notwithstanding that there is a main antagonist, these two battling races are essentially just beings fighting for their survival whom the evils of war find a way to corrupt.Director Jones is tasked with balancing the lore and the soul of the film. It is clear how much love Jones has for this universe and his team's visual effects do an incredible job in translating this love on-screen: from the primitive textures of the orc world to the glowing whoosh of magical spells. This attention-to-detail is impressive especially with the orcs: from their freakishly huge hands, hulky robust physiques, up to the rings attached to their tusks (yes, there are). Blended with a pulse-pounding musical score from Ramin Djawadi (Game of Thrones musical composer), Warcraft is easily one of this year's biggest films that established aficionados will be more than willing to pay for.At times though, the source material may be just too rich that it becomes a disadvantage in effectively telling its story. For the first installment, Jones wrestles with so many characters, locations and subplots which result in fast-paced story-telling, offering no breathing room and ample time to fully- develop most of the characters. (Think of a one full season of GOT jammed into a two-hour film.) While there are a lot of scenes with exposition and minor characters are also used as plot-devices to get us emotionally invested, they all seem not enough as they are merely short backstories and fragments of characterizations. Hence, by the third act when some of these characters are lost, the emotional punch is weaker than how it should have been.Warcraft ultimately feels like a sequel where audiences are expected to do their homework on the world's history rather than a franchise-starter that effectively builds up characters for the next film. This movie would have been better served if it was thirty minutes longer (hoping for a director's cut) or best, it's depth could have been better highlighted as a well-funded TV series. With all the things it aspires to be in such a short run time, the end product comes out as a boisterous and flashy piece largely stripped of poetry compared to LoTR and GoT. Impressively staged yet disengaged, Warcraft is still short of the champion we are hoping for in video-game adaptations.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good movie but not spectacular,"I have played Warcraft 1 & 2 and always enjoyed it. I do not know much about War of Warcraft. This is to say that I am a fan. I might add I am a huge LotR fan. I have had great expectations for this movie ever since it was introduced in trailers last year. I was very interested in what the story will be about. I went to the cinema to see the movie today and and here is my take without hopefully any spoilers. First of all, the movie is beautifully done. The animation is great! The music, well, is fine, kind of what you'd expect from Warcraft, nothing touchy. There is a fair bit of magic in this movie. I wish there was more magic in LotR, this movie is packed with action and a fair deal of magic. All great points here! The plot, however, as expected from a movie based on a game, and it comes true, sadly. The plot is not profound and very weak. I am not going to reveal any of that here. Acting and cast. It's a mixed one here, but overall the acting is weak, or rather off. It's all in the Human side. The acting gives a very Millennial feel, not a historical one. The actor playing the king looks well but his voice is weak and his composure is not regal and majestic enough. In short, lots of action, plenty of magic. If you are into profound plots, you might be disappointed as there is a lot of stuff left unexplained. The acting might get to ya as well. Not necessarily by wrong casting, or actors' inabilities, but rather the director's poor choice of how he wanted them to act.Go and see the movie, not a waste of money, but this movie will not dwell on your mind too long.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you have enjoyed any of the games past or presently, you will like Warcraft.","Just got back from the midday screening of Warcraft here in the UK and I thoroughly enjoyed it.The soundtrack is awesome, and even though there is a fair amount of lore (which might be a bit confusing for those not familiar with any of the history), the story is still very good and surprisingly complex. It does a great job of portraying both sides as having both good and evil,and in particular actually spends time with the Orcs in exploring their cultural and political processes, so they feel like real beings and not just mindless monsters. This means that despite its rather straight laced high fantasy appearance, the more complex narrative gives the movie quite a modern feel.The action itself is great, the Orcs in particular are awesome, and there's a bunch of cool Easter eggs. The CGI can be a bit jarring at first, but I think that's because you're used to CG trying to be photo-realistic (and it is very good, very detailed), but once you realise it's trying to be more stylised, closer to the animation style of the game, you kind of ""get it"" and it's not really an issue anymore.I'm not a hardcore fan either. The last time I logged into the game was about 4 years ago, and even when I did actively play I wasn't in a clan, I didn't go on raids. My highest level character was about 70 from over several years. Just a casual gamer. So I would advise any fans of the games, past or present, to go and see this movie and make up your own minds. I was skeptical myself having seen some critical reviews, but I actually really liked it.For the Horde.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"As a WoW player, I didn't love this movie. :(","I am a longtime World of Warcraft player, so I was thrilled to see the game world come to screen.I did like this movie. Alas, I did not love it :(The movie is an operatic story about Gul'Dan, Durotan, Medivh, and Wrynn, with lots of Garona and Lothar, and a little Thrall as baby Moses. The world-building visuals were splendid, and I am so grateful for how well the cinematography made my beloved MMORPG world come to visual life. But when it came to the emotional experience of this story, I was let down. I felt no connection to the characters. I was left feeling emotionally flat at the end, like I had just eaten a tub of buttered popcorn, but it still left me feeling hungry afterwards.Don't get me wrong: if you play WoW or Warcraft, you are absolutely obliged to see this eye-candy movie at least twice! Your chance to see widescreen murlocs, Karazhan, Redridge Mountains, Blasted Lands, Stormwind, Goldshire, Ironforge, Dalaran, and a mob getting sheeped: those scenes alone are worth the price of admission! But I recommend keeping your expectations low for the characterization of Lothar, Garona, Medivh, Llane, and Khadgar. Each of those characters comes across like a good-looking cardboard cutout.p.s. this show is not for young kids. While the camera stops just short of gory squirting intestines in melee combat, the violence is definitely adult. The orcs smashing humans could be disturbing to watch.p.p.s. I kept watching to see which characters were going to carry 32-slot bags x 4. No such luck :(",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Terrible Exposition,"Seriously, a quick 5 minute exposition in the beginning about the titans, burning legion, Drinking the blood of Mannoroth, Could've made this movie so much better. Yeah it's supposed to focused on what the characters, but it's kind of harder to relate when you don't know wtf their doing. That was a seriously bad decision on Duncan Jones part. With a quick foundation like that in the beginning you have a solid enough fantasy foundation to just have the liberty to make a fun story. But what we got was a really quirky attempt in trying to make up for that missing 5 minute exposition for 2 hours.In the age of open acceptance for fantasy movies, medieval movies, without shame of it being too nerdy, quirky, or weird, I don't understand why they don't just straight out come out with concepts from the game universe without being embarrassed about it and hiding it underneath the rug.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Review from a devoted and enthusiastic WoW gamer.,"About me: Hardcore gamer during Vanilla and TBC spent a combined /played time of 900+ days.Movie vs lore: The movie is like many others not entirely correlated with the lore, but fairly close. To avoid any spoilers I will not mention them here, but there are some deviations that could potentially compromise great lore in the following movies assuming more will be produced.Actors: Travis Fimmel: Does an amazing job and is very likable just as he is in Vikings. Toby Kebbel (Durotan) also does an amazing and convincing job. The only actor i didn't particularly like is Paula Patton, she doesn't fit the lore character and her acting is just not convincing making her the reason i gave 9 instead of 10. Just to mention 1 scene, she gently drinks a cup of water during imprisonment after wiping her mouth. <-- not the typical behavior you would expect by a wild half orc. there are plenty of other scenes were she just doesn't act according to her character. Its sad that a pretty face with little talent are allowed in such epic movies, i would rather have a talented ugly orc that could play her part instead of an emotional, good looking, unconvincing actor.The effects and CGI: Simply fantastic and it should definitely be watched in Cinema with good sound system, because the sound effects are also a major factor in this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It was a little bit confusing for friends to understand the story , despite it was the easy version of the lore, also there many changes of the story , I do not know now which is the right story.

The movie looked so pathetically hokey with the mix of real actors and CGI that I literally was wondering if this was some sort of parody movie of Lord of the Rings.The actors seemed like they were just in it for a paycheck. I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.The musical score was decent and there were a couple of good battle scenes, but honestly nothing special and not nearly enough to save this clunker of a movie.They should have made this movie all CGI or used a lot more live actors and a whole lot less CGI.

"Visually stunning, stunted performance","Video Review: https://youtu.be/PYSjuDFN15AWarcraft, starring Travis Fimmel and Paula Patton. This is the new movie from director Duncan Jones, and is based off of the worldwide video game phenomenon; World of Warcraft. Let's jump right in.With Warcraft, I didn't quite know what to expect. I knew of the games of course but never played anyone in particular. I was worried that not knowing the backstory might make the movie confusing but this film actually does a great job of letting you know the characters and the world at a gradual pace. Whether or not I find these characters good at all is another story but we'll get to that.Warcraft looks amazing. Duncan Jones has proved from previous films like Moon and Source Code that he can make a sharp looking movie. With that, I was interested that he decided to do Warcraft, something so different from the films he's directed so far. This movie is on a bigger scale than his other films and he does a great job of bringing the Warcraft world to life. The motion capture CGI for the orcs looked great, the sets and CGI backgrounds are expansive and the overall style gave the movie a very cool look and feel.Now speaking of orcs, their characters were the ones I felt to be the most interesting as they had the best emotional core to them. Travis Fimmel plays Lothbar, our hero on the human's side and I just didn't care for him much. His performance wasn't lacking anything but I just felt he was a boiled down version of every major action movie hero of the past 5 years. Paula Patton is a half breed orc and I was on the fence about her in the whole film. She had a lot of good lines and great delivery but then had scenes where she'd just grunt a lot. Ben Schnetzer played Khadgar, a sorcerer who to me seemed very flat and I kinda wanted him to get hit in the face with one of the orcs hammers for his deadpan performance.The combat of Warcraft was very impressive to see on the big screen although it almost feels like it's the same fight scene each time. Most of the fights are clan vs clan and lacks variety, as a result the movie lacks those stand out bad-ass moments. The only great 1v1 fight we had comes in the last act of the movie and was a nice treat for fans but is never followed up with a comparable sequence. The ending is also anti-climatic as the final battle scene is pretty lackluster after a boring second act.Overall this movie does a good job of showing and introducing us to the World of Warcraft.

Brilliant CGI Bad story,"For God's sake can somebody tell me where is the story, dialogue, acting in this movie. I didn't give a damn if orcs invaded Azeroth, killed humans or not because the script didn't make me sympathize with any of the characters. The movie name is Warcraft and the fight sequences were terrible. Dominic Cooper such a waste of talent Im sure he must have signed this movie because it was a huge gaming franchise but the movie had nothing for him. To be true the movie had nothing for anybody. The CGI and 3D made the movie somewhat bearable else I would have walked out. It was blunder of a huge franchise. Totally disappointed. 6 stars for CGI and 3D.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best Movie in 2016,"Everyone know Superman, Batman, etc.. but not everyone known Warcraft. Warcraft introduce it self real fast..First thing first, it must fill the hunger of Warcraft fans, which i am gladly satisfied.. 2 hrs of Action, which Gamer do.. Action.Drama? not everyone know this character really well.. so, introduction first, then maybe drama on next sequel.. in my opinion, it have its drama and its mystery.. cant wait the sequel.The CGI awesome, character Superb, and Warcraft is my first choice over others. I love the Orc, the Animal, the City, the Battlefield, the Magic, the Sound and how this story told.It's Gamer Fantasy, and maybe It's Yours too..for me? it's 10 of 10. Perfect Score..

"Average,. but not bad","I am not a World of Warcraft fan, never really played any of the games, nor read up about its lore, but was drawn to this movie due to its fantasy themes, so my review is from a non fan, as I assume many people who watch this movie will be the video game fans.This movie is no way near as bad as many critics are making it out to be, but then again, critics are fools, and only believe a film is good if it is going to nab that best Oscar. However, while not bad, this film is not good either. It is a mess.The good things about this film, is its visuals. It is visually stunning to look at, with almost perfect CGI, gorgeous art direction, set pieces, and costume design. The actions scenes were very well done in some scenes, and the magic in this film is spectacular to see. There have been many fantasy movies that have never displayed magic like this. The acting is also good in this film, with each main lead performing as best as they could with the average screenplay.The main villain in this film is ... OK. I understand that he 'is' a video game villain, but they could have make him a little more realistic, rather than the over-the top one we got. The characters are so boring, that the only one that even draws you in, is the main orc, but even then, he isn't actually in the film as much as he could have been. He is the only character that has any development, as the others are pushed aside.Now the bad. The faults here do not fall on the director, who does a great job at converting a video game into a movie, but with the screenplay. The story is all over the place, and is a wasted potential. This film could have rivalled that of Lord of the Rings, if it had been written better. The characters are bland and boring, and the pacing is dreadful. The editing was also very poor, with many scenes cut together, seeming very mismatched, and don't make much sense.One of the major issues I would personally say about this film, its the film not giving us more to explore. I wanted to see vast wilderness, more of the beautiful cities, maybe some oceans, villages and towns, give us more to look at, as the film is visually breathtaking.Other than that, this film is not bad, it has its flaws yes, but it is an entertainment. It is one of the better video game adaptations, but don't go into this film expecting a great movie, or a dreadful one. Expect to be entertained, but that's it.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Awesome Fantasy Tale,"Considering the source material, which I am marginally familiar with at best, this was an highly entertaining movie. The writers and director had a lot of material to express over a very short amount of time, what could take an entire novel to express they were able to deliver in a very concise movie. No scene was wasted, but more importantly, none of the scenes felt rushed.Travis Fimmel bought into his role, and while it may seem ridiculous from the outside (the source material being warcraft), he was convincing, entertaining, and not alone. All the other cast members displayed levels of talent that truly impressed me and made me want more. I know no one will ever read this review, being two years since this movie came out, but I'm writing this review for me, because i really enjoyed this movie despite my heavy initial bias against it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Waste of time,"Mediocre story, absolutely terrible cast and acting (someone should have told Travis Fimmel that he's not filming vikings and should act out a different character), and every scene that included real people and wasn't completely CGI looked about as realistic as the Dungeons&Dragons movies.The only good thing is that Durotan and his fellow orcs were animated beautifully, with extreme love for detail. The facial animations, as subtle as they were done sometimes, made Durotan more believable than any characters played by actual actors.Honestly I expected nothing and was still disappointed. Wouldn't bother watching again.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Better to watch instead of this movie all the intros of the game series.,"The feeling after watching this movie is one that you feel like you got betrayed, they screwed your dream and fantasy and memory of the game ""World of Warcraft"".

"More than a simple fantasy movie, Warcraft is an experience","After the movie ended I came back and bought another ticket for the next show. Warcraft is the second movie in my life that I watched 2 times in a row, the first one being Avatar. I am a huge fan of Avatar, mostly because I am considering it to be much more than a movie, but a real experience. Same thing I felt with Warcraft. Both are a real spectacle where you become part of a fantasy that feels so real that you don t even question what is happening there, because... it is real. You don't question something that is real, you just accept it. Because reality is different than movies, reality can be cruel, unjust and so many times not according to your plan. I also enjoyed a lot LOTR series, but Warcraft and Avatar are something different. LOTR is a pleasing movie, easy plots, very good guys vs very bad guys and with the good guys having happy endings. This, plus the great visuals and good casting made it a movie for everyone.Warcraft has war in title, so expect to see a movie about war. It is NOT a ""feel good"" movie. It is a not a movie with happy endings, it s a very sad war story where heroism and sacrifice are not rewarded accordingly. It is also a movie where bad and good are relative. It feels more like a reality show from a war zone. The characters are what they are, with flaws and weaknesses, driven by simple motivations like survival or protecting their family and friends. The relation between them are honest and simple. The movie is not trying to make you love them, the movie just tells their story in a very difficult moment of their existence. You can sense their fear and there is a permanent tension in the movie that in my opinion is the reason why some may dislike it. The movie does not have those feel good moments where tension is released, instead the tension builds up until the last part of the movie where the dramatic charge is overwhelming. If you add the tragic and dramatic fate of the characters I can see why the movie was not been appreciated by some folks who expected an easy going movie with handsome elves and good wizards defeating the bad orcs and the bad wizards.Go see Warcraft with open mind and enjoy this amazing experience. It is an unique movie, a real work of art that deserves some sequels. I will be a very sad panda if the hatred of the critics towards game adaptations would ruin this movie to the point where no sequels will be made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

ATTENTION: Those Whom Never Played the Games,"I should note that I am a 27 years old from the United States, who at one point in time fell deeply in love with Blizzard and their games (Diablo I & II & IIX, Warcraft, WoW and even Starcraft for a period). I have since then moved on to experience college life, enjoy a social life, and obtain a degree while at it in Electrical Engineering. Recently I became a member of the workforce landing my first job as a developer! So now that you better understand who the reviewer is and have gotten to know a little about me ...on to the movie:Very rarely do I feel so compelled to chime in on a motion picture. But after sitting through a screening of Warcraft, not realizing how tightly clenched my jaw had truly been, was I able to recognize the impact: A successfully told backstory for a video game, brought on fierce nostalgia for my inner-nerd. Furthermore, a tale which offered up similar emotions to those shared by other great films of our generation.First, and foremost, this was a movie whose intent was primarily mass entertainment! Blizzard wants to provide something that anyone can sit through and enjoy. Only then, as a bonus is there the story of a video game for us geeks.With that being said, the story is solid and easy for anyone to follow. The action scenes (despite there being no blood) were positively outstanding. IT WILL NOT OCCUR TO THE VIEWER UNTIL AFTERWARDS THAT THERE HAD BEEN NO SIMULATED BLOOD!Don't miss out on a groundbreaking effort by Blizzard to create a solid piece which provides us an opportunity to come together as two historically opposite populations united (that is the nerds and ""non-techies"") ...or was it the orc and human faction (sorry but I had to get in at least one for old times sake)?Much speculation on box office numbers has been thrown around, but I honestly haven't even batted an eye. Friends, even if a sequel does not manage to emerge (and I hope that not to be the case), Blizzard has already done us a great service through this epic. I for one am already grateful!----- 8/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Ambitious and energetic.,"For a long time the hype was through the roof for this fantasy blockbuster, not only as a potential Lord of the Rings successor – orcs and dwarfs and wizards (oh my!) – but also as the motion picture to break the pattern of poor computer-game adaptations. Thankfully the resolutely mediocre trailers brought expectations crashing back down to Earth, because if you enter the cinema hoping for a fantasy masterpiece you'll be sorely disappointed. Go in with more restrained anticipation and there's two hours of silly fun to be had. Unlike LOTR there's no set story to adhere to for writer-director Duncan Jones, so the narrative takes the form of an orcs-vs-humans war saga, with the (pleasantly respectable) runtime split equally between the two races. The plot is largely predictable and uninventive – undefined magic powers are lazily employed to gloss over holes – but there's a surprisingly strong focus on character development that lends the movie an emotional side and subsequently increases the stakes at play. Considering the source material, the massively multiplayer online role-playing game 'World of Warcraft', the universe isn't explored or fleshed out as much as it could have been either, with the finale frustratingly open-ended. Of course the action is priority number one though, and there are a plethora of clashes, both big and small, to get the adrenaline pumping. Despite the numerous all-in battles, it's a bone crunching one-on-one fight between two powerful orcs that is the standout. Unfortunately there's an over-reliance on CGI that detracts from proceedings; all of the orcs are created via motion-capture technology and majority of the external environments are entirely digital, feeling particularly hollow. Not the most memorable of beginnings for what will undoubtedly become an ongoing cinematic series; Warcraft is nevertheless an energetic, ambitious and successfully diverting piece of escapism.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Harmless,"I feel bad for watching and reviewing this, as I am not a fan of ""World Of Warcraft"". Then again, this is based by name on ""Warcraft"" which isn't quite the same thing. All I can say is that this movie was just okay. From what I have seen of the Warcraft games, this seems to be quite loyal to them. I especially appreciate how good the CGI is. There are some moments where it's off, but for the most part, it's a pretty good effect. I guess it does have the feel of the actual game. I just wish I was more familiar with it. I don't want to have to go through all the trouble of getting an account to understand this, as I know how complicated this game is.I do recommend this to people who are Warcraft fans. The acting isn't bad at all, although there are some pretty badly done scenes. I actually like the Garona character and think she has some pretty good moments. There's even a nice little scene at the very end of the movie. This is a lesser film for me this year, but maybe that's because I've seen so many great movies.

"A VERY solid summer blockbuster, critics don't know what they are talking about.","I literally came back from the movies like an hour ago (watched Warcraft) and it was a very solid movie. Far better than what the critics said it would be. I am maybe not the most neutral person because I am a fan of Warcraft... but my dad, who knows nothing about Warcraft gave it a 8/10. Very solid film, not a masterpiece but it does not in any way shape or form deserve the hate its getting from critics. Those pretentious assholes can eat a bag of dicks! Go see it for yourself and make your own decision!﻿Pacing was a bit fast in the beginning, but it isn't nearly as much of an issue as some make it seem (it was expected though since they needed to pack 9+ hours of lore into a 2 hour film). My dad understood nearly 100% of what was going on in this movie (he knew nothing beforehand) so it is absolutely NOT true that you need to have played Warcraft to understand the film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You'll like it if you're already familiar with the Lore,"Movies based on video games tend to not be so good, Warcraft might be an exception. Nevertheless it seems to have gotten a lot of bad press. I noticed that most of the critics who gave the film negative reviews were people who have never played, or were were not familiar with the games.I've been a long-time fan of the Warcraft series since the second game came out in 1996. Since then I've played through all of the Warcraft RTS games, and was a World of Warcraft subscriber for several years. I was one of the few WoW players to earn the achievement ""lore master"" for completing all of the quests in the primary zones vanilla WoW (and the first few expansions). So I'm pretty well versed on the story.I did get kind of burned out on World of Warcraft after Wrath of the Lich King. I canceled my subscription soon after reaching the level cap. I would resubscribe for brief periods here and there just to see what's going on, but for the most part I was done with WoW. Still, I'm a fan of the game and lore, so I guess I'm probably the target demographic for this film.The film was pretty faithful to the lore of the games (and the lore of the games has, itself changed over time since the original warcraft ms-dos that came out in 1994). The film is basically about the first war from that first game Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, focusing on the characters from the first game: Garona, Lothar (probably the main characters), Medhiv, King Llane, and Blackhand. Now if they limited themselves to focusing on just these characters and limited themselves to sticking to just the story of the first game, the film, while being pretty simple, would have probably worked better for those new to the story of warcraft. There would have been fewer characters. Fewer simultaneous plots, and they would have been able to focus on developing the stories and characters and easing people into the fantasy via more relatable protagonists.But there's one major problem with doing it this way. The story of the first game was very human-centric. The POV of the orcs was told entirely from the half-orc, Garona in the instruction booklet that came with the first game, and it didn't portray the orcs in a very good light at all. On the contrary, it portrayed the orcs as evil warlike savages with almost no redeeming qualities. You actually don't get a deeper understanding of the orcs until Warcraft 2 when we are introduced Gul'Dan, Ogrim Doomhammer and Kil'Jaeden. And it's not until Warcraft 3 that we actually start to view the orcs in a more sympathetic light with the introduction of the orcs Gromm Hellscream and, of course, the warchief Thrall, son of Durotan, a character who was not introduced until World of Warcraft (and plays a major role in the most recent expansion). In the film, Durotan is, in fact, one of the main protagonists.So, to make a long story short, the problem with this film is exactly that, they're trying to make a long, complicated and lore rich story with a lot of characters, into a short two hour film. Perhaps if it was split into two films, one that told the story from the humans POV, and another that told the story from the Orcs POV it would have worked better, after all that's how the story was told in the original game. It split the story up into two separate narratives. And, in the end, isn't that always what war comes down to? Two opposing narratives competing for dominance. This movie tries to to be sympathetic to both sides of the conflict at the same time. And as result the audience can't get as invested in any of the characters or the conflicts they are engaged in. It loses the sense of urgency and drama. When you try to please everyone, you please no one.Well ... that's not true. The film did please me. I enjoyed seeing the lore I've grown up with over the passed 20 years come to life on the screen. I did enjoy the spectacle and the special effects as well. It was a cool movie all things considered. But I understand why people who weren't familiar with the games walked away from this one disappointed.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Too less time for story telling,"Went to watch it on last night as it's on screen in Philippines, thanks goodness, after a long waiting ever since its announcement.The greatest thing that production team does on this movie is to keep every character 100% based on its game appearance, but the story line isn't convincingly good as Duncan Jones did before on his 2 previous movies. It would be better if separate into 2 parts, which offers more time to build up the character and their stories.Everything is happened too soon and explanation is too short.

Back to Azeroth,"I grew up with the Blizzard video games and couldn't lose the opportunity to watch and comment this movie. As first as I saw the trailer last year I was pleasantly surprised : what I had dreamed of as a child, a movie based on the mesmerizing universe of Azeroth, was finally becoming real. Watching on the big screen the characters I used to click on with my mouse was honestly a moving experience. Regarding the technical aspects and the contents of the movie, I confess, as most of the reviewers, to have had my prejudicial expectations completely (and positively) overthrown. The plot was linear and coherent, the CGI was conveniently faithful to the game (the Orcs were remarkably designed) and the ending scene with little Thrall travelling in a basket in an almost biblical way just gave me what I needed : the desire not to lose the still unannounced sequel.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Regular People Love it, Critics Hate it (are you surprised?)","The Bad: Cringe worthy cheesy lines, younger actors don't carry their parts well, too short of a movie to adequately develop characters.The Good: Simple fantasy story made interesting with a unique take on the traditional fantasy story of good vs bad, excellent CGI, strong main characters carry the movie very well, believable action scenes, great fantasy world feeling.Summary: The critics hate this movie because it doesn't play to their stereotype of what a fantasy movie should have, that being: a go-to director with a proved history of boring movies, old-fart actors, boring old-fashioned action scenes where the hero kills 50+ bad guys, traditional bad vs. good story with the predictable twist.Truth is this movie did what no other modern fantasy has been able to do: create a suspenseful fantasy movie. True Warcraft's story is overcrowded with characters, but the main characters carry the movie very well. The action scenes are refreshing for a fantasy movie. We are so use to the boring Lord of the Rings war scene where the supposed fearsome Orcs get mowed over by a sissy with a bow. Watching LOTR gives you the sense that a 4 year old could successfully wage war on the armies of orcs with a plastic spoon. Not so in Warcraft. The Orcs are real, they are well developed, they are strong, they are scary and warlike. This new take on fantasy makes critics on over-ripe potatoes very uncomfortable who want to maintain their monopoly on movie thought.

The film Warcraft fans deserve,"First of all, the important question: Am I a fan or not?I am not a die hard Warcraft fan besides some characters from Warcraft 3. I do not know the entire lore. I never read a Warcraft book, I only started playing with Warcraft 3. I played WoW in 2005, dropped it after a month or so and only joined again in 2015.That said: I do not get the critics AT ALL. This movie is by far better than the critics want it to be.This movie has so much love and details, it is breathtaking. You can tell, in every scene, how close the film is to the source material. Especially for the fans who know all the small pieces and were like: ""OMG! It is exactly like in the game.""The acting was okay, far from being as horrible as described. I actually liked Khadgar's more clumsy appearance which visibly lightened the overall very dark tone of the movie. And Ben Foster as Medivh actually played surprisingly convincing. The orcs all acted flawlessly via motion-capture.The CGI was top notch. The orcs look better than Avatar, so does the overall CGI (for the budget). The CGI environments were a feast for the eyes. Again, the fans will love it because they recognize every single detail of it. Stormwind, the forest, Deadwind Pass, Dalaran. Everything looks so familiar.The set pieces were lovely crafted and there were more than I expected. Every interior was at least partly real.The pacing was no problem for me, as I did pay attention throughout the film. I got myself into the setting and some concepts and then it works.The overall story was okay with some nice twists. Not Oscar-worthy, but compelling. It is a good vs. evil story but with some heavy twists to the standard fantasy formula.About the orcs. Oh boy. The orcs are all outstanding. Very likable ( or not ;) ). Gul'dan and Blackhand are just as bad-ass as Durotan and Orgrim. And fans will see a VERY important character in the background for future films.There are emotional scenes but they could have been a tad more emotional. The death scenes especially were too emotionless.Yes, it can get confusing if you do not know anything about the Warcraft universe. 10 minutes more would have been okay to explain some stuff a bit more. And would have guaranteed higher ratings.I do not trust the US critics anymore. No a single one. They clearly do not know what they are reviewing. They are far from being realistic. Everything that is 'only' okay is panned. This is unrealistic.""Unrealistic movie"" - It is HIGH FANTASY! ""SMB The Movie is better"" - Eh what?! ""The movie is racist"" - There are at least 3 black actors (Soldier, Taria, Garona). ""The movie is too serious"" - Is LOTR or GoT that humorous? And there is no Trump in the film either, dear The Guardian.The European foreign language reviews (german, french, danish, Swedish) are correct in this case, they are all favorable. They range between 5-9 with some exceptions which is fair for the film. The US reviews are NOT fair.It is a feast for fans and still okay/good for non-fans. The film still works if you take away the huge fan service it has to offer.Of course, it is not the next LOTR. None of the fans expected it. Not a single one! But those critics, which make them unbelievable. They do not even give this movie a chance. Warcraft: The Beginning is far from being perfect and even if you are a fan it still has some flaws. Therefore no perfect score.For fans: 9/10. For non-fans: 7/10.As I am a fan, somehow, I still give the film an 8 because I, personally, had a blast.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It really isn't a bad movie,"First of all, I love the work Duncan Jones has done uptill now. I can't say Warcraft was not a bit of a letdown. And I tell you why. First of all way to much CGI... to exesive on the use of it makes it look cartoonish. I don't mind cartonish if that is what you are aming for. But I don't think it was aimed to be that way. Secondly, not all the actors where up to the task. Movie had a feel of Phantom Menace. Forced acting from otherwise good actors. Again I blame CGI for that. There where couple of scenes in the movie that just didn't work. So script was not up to par either on some occasions. All in all I like the story and the dilevery. So Duncan didn't really fail in his deparment, but he didin't exel as usual. I've read we can thank producers/studio execs for that. I don't understand critics bashing it as they did.

You will not get your time back ..,"If you're a fanboy.. it will be like watching someone play Warcraft on a big TV.. you'll love it.If you're not a fanboy.. avoid this horrible film at all costs.The actors cannot act with everything looking staged and mechanical (I AM talking about the acting not the CGI)The CGI is nearly as good as Avatar .. now, this isn't a compliment .. Avatar is 7 years old. The CGI is as 'clean' as avatar (or a cartoon..) doesn't look anyway 'weathered' to make things blendThe scenes with actors with 'real' plant-life looks like it was shot in a local garden centre with some bamboo stalks stuck into the ground as the mediocre actors read out a mediocre script putting on mediocre expressions on their faces as they turn mechanically around making it painfully obvious they're trying to avoid the camera or don't realise when people talk to each other they're not trying to bore holes into the other persons skull without blinking or looking away at and stage of their 'deep' conversation.I'd have thought acting 101 would have been a prerequisite for a the cast, but apparently not.I must admit, some of the acting did improve in the last 20 minutes .. it's amazing what 1.5hrs of (usable) work experience does.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A bit of a mess. But a fun mess.,"I've never played the older Warcraft games on PC, nor WOW. So that's where I'm coming from. But even if I was a die-hard WOW player I doubt I would have gotten much more out of this CG heavy fantasy action spectacle. Fact is, it's a bit of a mess. Warcraft is what you get when you try to cram an epic LOTR story inside a 2 hour movie.Because of this the movie feels rushed, and a little disorienting. It feels like they were trying to cram decades worth of Warcraft lore into one film, whilst at the same time trying to make it as accessible as possible to the masses. Whilst the story can be followed (it is a fairly generic formulaic tale) we get little bits of information that don't really make sense and aren't explained enough, or at all. Example: the magic. To put it basically, Blue = Good, Green = Bad. But I was waiting for information about the magic itself, how the orcs came to possess it, why there was only one orc to become corrupted by it, how the Guardian became possessed by it etc etc. So much of Warcraft's story needed to be fleshed out more thoroughly. It feels like there is a 4 hour cut of this film that has been butchered down to 2, and as a result is far less enjoyable than it could have been.Performances are pretty average across the board. Nobody looks that invested in the material. The CG is decent, albeit occasionally pretty cheap looking. Its a bit troubling when CG in 2016 is not on par with LOTR circa 2000. But honestly it is pretty good. The orcs all look pretty impressive, and the lighting effects are good.Warcraft is a fun, no brainer kinda film. But the problem with Warcraft is that while watching I couldn't help thinking i would rather be watching LOTR instead. Epic tale, great CG, great acting, fleshed out story and characters. All the things that Warcraft fails at for the most part.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Warcraft: The Beginning has positive aspects, but there are things that makes it distance itself from a great video game adaptation.","Warcraft: The Beginning may not be the movie that broke the curse of horrible movies based on video games, but that doesn't mean it's bad and it deserves the praise on the things that did right. It's a movie that was made with love and care not only to satisfy fans of the video game series, but also to introduce newcomers to the world of Warcraft and everyone after seeing it will probably be interested to know more about the lore that was created. You can tell that Duncan Jones really did know what he was doing and cared while making the movie, but he could have done way better with the script; the human story; the music; the cinematography and the human characters (although King Llane Wrynn, Medivh and Khadgar were the best), while the orcs were the most interesting and the ones, who were given more development.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
As a Fan: awesome 9/10 (me); as a Normal Movie:good 6/10,"So i see all these posts on 10 stars and then 1 star and i hate that movie and i need to counteract this hype, I'm just gonna talk freely because i hate this nonsense to counteract reviews cause you liked or disliked a movie.First point is the CGI, it looks fantastic and visual are stunning if you let the movie in.Second the music damn its good. Its theirs when it needs to be theirs and it never gives u the feel of overpowering the scene. Side Info:Its written by the Game of Thrones dude.Third the Narrative and that's the point where i can understand why people think the movie loses points. For a fan its fine, we are used to the kind of dialogue which might seem off. But in my opinion is actually really fitting to this kind of a fantasy world. The movie starts way to fast for a movie watcher. For a fan its just fan service in the beginning for a ""starter"" its irritating. But the movie saves this with the time its going. The only real problem now is, because of the rushed pace THE ""starter"" isn't connected to the characters and when the first plot points hit, they don't. Except your over emphatic like me. For fans its way easier, because they are connected to the characters already. But from that first emotional hit the movie starts to excel and the characters get so much depth you hadn't even thought about it being possible before. And that stone roles till the end. About the story, its understandable and closed in its own... BUT there's room given on a second movie. And i want that second movie so bad. So if you have the slightest interest in the movie go see it... PLEASE?So if you can life with the early flaws you'll have a good time, if not then this movie is the 3/10 the critics say, but i would love you to see the movie cause its awesome if u get into it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This movie is awesome,"So... Yeah. I'm a Warcraft fan. My girlfriend isn't. And we both came out of the theater wanting more. The acting is great (but sometimes a little bit overplayed), the cgi is amazing, the story is worthy of warcraft, but it doesn't want to force down all of Warcraft on a moviegoers throat. It was a flawless experience. And I have to tell you, the landscapes are gorgeous, Stormwind, Ironforge and the Dark Portal never looked so good, the orks are mighty, their mounts are full of strength and the music, oh my GOD the music is on point at every time.

I wanted to like this so much,"No, I'm not a die-hard 'Warcraft' fan on the computer games this film is based on. However, I am a huge fan of its writer/director Duncan Jones (and of course his late/great father, David Bowie). If you're a fan of sci-fi then you really should check out Jones' first two films: 'Moon' and 'Source Code.' They're a great example of what can be done on a smaller budget with a decent script. Therefore, my hopes were high when I saw the amount of money and resources being poured into 'Warcraft: The Beginning.' However, as many who have studied film since the mid-nineties will know films based on computer games rarely work out.If you have no idea what 'Warcraft' is (and my knowledge is based on playing 'Warcraft II' on the PC many years ago and that hilarious 'South Park' episode that rips into it) then it's kind of like 'Lord of the Rings' i.e. a medieval-type world and an ongoing war between humans and Orcs. Now, I mention 'Lord of the Rings' not just because of the (loose) plot similarities, but also because the trilogy is currently around fifteen years old and dealt with battles between green-skinned Orcs and humans. Therefore, you may think that the special effects will also be fifteen years more advanced that what we've seen before. Not in my opinion. This was my first major gripe with the film – the CGI. It just didn't look real. The dwarfs and elves looked almost comical and the Orcs were basically so blatantly made with computers it took me right out of the story. Unfortunately, the costumes weren't an awful lot better (and these weren't even made with computers!) – they looked like what you'd see at a cosplay event and were way too clean without the rugged 'battle-worn' look that's been displayed in Lord of the Rings.Then we have the plot. Yes, it could simply be described as 'Orcs vs humans,' but they at least try and mix it up a little with some good Orcs and some bad humans. However, the characters are so one-dimensional that the baddies (or either species) simply come off as cartoonish (and doubly cartoonish if they're already drawn on computers and look like a cartoon anyway!). There's a plot in there that kind of reminded me of 'Avatar' (for some reason) about inter-species relationships and working together to save both races.The action was okay. Yes, there are battles, but nothing that Lord of the Rings hasn't done before. All in all this film feels like painting by numbers. It's not terrible, but it probably could have been a lot better. I could imagine a young boy (most likely) who hasn't seen many films being totally blown away by this and loving it (and then going out and buying all the toys afterwards!). However, I'm just too jaded and have seen all this before. Maybe I should be more forgiving when it comes to films like this. I guess it's aimed at children rather than me. But, love it, hate it or – like me – be kind of indifferent to it, I still have faith in Duncan Jones that he'll come back with another awesome film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I can only assume that this movie is better if you are a fan of World of Warcraft,"I'm a little scared to post my review cause something tells me nobody is going to like it, but I got to be honesty, I'm getting a sense of what It must be like to gush over a Marvel Cinematic Universe Movies to non Fan Boys.Like every human on the planet I've herd of the game, but I never played it, so going into this movie I knew nothing and it was up to the filmmakers to tell a story to a blind slate. Warcraft is extremely overwhelming. A lot of things are going on all at once. Not that it's so hard to grasp the story but it was hard to get into.Everything just seem so chopped up and squeezed together. I never thought I would say this, but the movie actually moved too quickly, Something happens and than something else happens and the film gives you little time to process, but once again this may not be a problem for you Warcraft fans who are already familiar with the characters, but for the rest of us, the characters became so one dimensional from this process.One true high light, other than Paula Patton in that slave warrior outfit, was the war scenes of War Craft. the CGI was not that great but they did have some very energetic battles that looked really epic.Overall, like most Fantasy films, it looks like the first of an epic saga, that may be better if viewed as a whole trilogy or however many movies come out, but then again, the Fellowship of the Ring worked better on it's own for me than Warcraft.I would recommended playing the game before watching the movie in order to get some satisfaction out of it.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Everything I've been waiting for,"First off, do not trust or listen to the critic reviews. If you like fantasy, you have to see Warcraft! I have no clue why it had such a bad reception from critics, but I can honestly say that it's been everything I have been waiting for.Having played all the Warcraft RTS games and WoW for close to 6 years, the only criticism I have for the movie is that it is not as close to the lore as I would have liked it. Don't get me wrong, the story is great even in this form and I can't wait for the next one.It is by far the best movie made based on a game and I would put it in the same league as Lord of the rings.The CGI fights and spells are some of the best I have ever seen. I would have loved for it to be longer and explain/explore the relationships between the main characters a bit more.Stormwind and the general scenery look amazing and I can't wait to see the other capitals in more detail as well.I registered on IMDb just so I could review Warcraft and tell everyone to go see it!

Who exactly was this made for?,"I am pretty disappointed with this movie.Don't get me wrong. It's still a decent movie, I gave it a six, it's verging on good, but not quite there.There are a fair number of things in this movie that you won't notice or won't quite make sense if you aren't familiar with the material... they never get explained or commented on. But at the same time they seem to have randomly changed some things to no benefit, and even to fairly obvious detriment. There's no one they won't kinda annoy a bit.'Decent' is pretty good for a movie, but this movie was a collaboration between LEGENDARY PICTURES and BLIZZARD. This should have been the best movie of the the year *easily*. It had everything lined up, it had piles of money behind it, but it just didn't quite...It's still a solid movie, and it's still a good choice if you're not sure what you want to watch... but this *could* have been a epic to reverberate through the ages. It's really not though.But hey, if you're bored, definitely go for it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great visuals and world; nonsensical plot and characters,I am a huge fantasy fan and was willing to give this film a go despite the negative reviews. I honestly thought it was just another case of critics unfairly criticising the fantasy genre. I couldn't have been more wrong.The character development in this film is extremely poor. I did not care about a single character. The only character whose motivations were even partly fleshed out was the rebel orc and even he has little more than basic motivations for his actions in the film. All of the key emotional scenes in the film fall completely flat. This film is watchable because of some cool action sequences but beyond that it's entirely hollow. Towards the end it was a struggle to stay focused. I wouldn't recommend watching it.,5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

In other words, it is kind of like a comic book movie but without the cool characters behind it.Actually now that I've watched it completely, it's a disgusting attempt at at a cross between Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings and some kind of comic book movie. Do not waste your time or money on this drivel. I do not think I can even call it a ""movie"". It is a video game, trying to be a movie and it fails miserably. Bad. Just bad.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great film if you are familiar with the lore,"If you are a Warcraft player and is familiar with the lore. This movie is amazing you saw that the movie was created for fans of the lore. But if you aren't really familiar with the lore then this might be a bit confusing. But non the less the movie was spectacular, everything from the acting to the visual, oh boy the visuals they were astonishing. So even if you are not familiar with the lore of the franchise it is still worth the watch. Would recommend and I can't wait for the sequels that bring in the real cool characters like Arthas and Illidan.

Warcraft Delivers! Sequels Please!,"From the first, this film has had the weight of the world on its shoulders. A literal decade of anticipation and hype with the added pressure of invigorating an entire genre. No film can live up to those expectations under any circumstance. However, Warcraft delivers a truly remarkable cinematic experience. The CGI is the finest to date in any film. The story, while perhaps a bit to take in as a newcomer to the universe is well crafted and true to its source material. It would be silly to say that people unfamiliar with the world cannot understand the film. That is insulting to the audience and simply untrue. The action sequences are pulse pounding and gorgeous feats of cinematography. The acting rings true with some faltering here and there due to some clunky dialogue. Any fan of the fantasy genre must see this film! The magic is a beautiful and is expressed visually in a way we haven't seen on film before. Early negative reviews should be take with a mountain of salt. This film is a fine first entry into a new franchise that deserves sequel upon sequel in order to refine the writing and fully flesh out this world. Fans of Warcraft will be in heaven. New comers will be delighted to see a film that isn't a reboot, sequel, or prequel. Fans of action films will be on the edge of their seat. Fans of fantasy will be orgasmic.

War is upon us...,"""Warcraft"" is an Action - Fantasy movie in which we watch the planet of humans being attacked by the Orcs of Draenor. Orcs attacked Earth because their own planet was destroyed by an evil magic and their powerful warlock created a portal to the world of humans. In order for the portal to be open, their warlock captures many people and uses them as a fuel. Everything seems lost but always there is room for heroes.I liked this movie because it was very interesting, it had good CGIs and also a nice plot. I liked the interpretation of Travis Fimmel who played as Anduin Lothar, Paula Patton who played as Garona and she was very good at it and Ben Foster who played as Medivh. The direction which was made by Duncan Jones it was simple but interesting in its own way with many action scenes and very good CGIs.To sum up, I have to say that ""Warcraft"" is a nice movie to watch and I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much. Something that is very important and this movie succeeded in it was the combination between of action and romance. Since I am a fan of Warcraft and I had high expectations from this movie I have to admit that I wasn't disappointed by it.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Breaks the 'video game to film' spell,"I'm a film lover. I have also played a considerable amount of Warcraft in the past. This is to say I wasn't sure if I could write an honest review of the film, not because I feel biased towards the Warcraft universe, but simply because I might subconsciously understand a lot more of what is going when compared to someone who hasn't been in contact with the games.With that said, Warcraft is a good film.Starting with the good:Characterisation. A lot of fantasy films fail because we can't relate to the characters. Warcraft pulls it off. You immediately sympathize with the characters in both factions.Balance. You don't really get to pick a side here, there is no such thing as ""these are the good guys, those are the bad guys"". Both sides bring strong characters to the table, characters you can relate to. The Alliance is lead by men who put the well of their people first. The Horde is lead by a villain, but the Orcs show they value honor the most, and it becomes clear throughout the film that change is coming to the Horde.The art and cgi. It's loyal to the games and fans. Anyone that has played the games will find plenty to relate to here. From full blown environments and scenery, the cities, the spell effects, the Orcs, the human armor, the weaponry, the little details here and there... It's clear this was made out of the love and respect for the franchise.The excellent: Durotan. What a character, you completely forget about the CGI here. A 5* star performance from Toby Kebbell and the art team.The bad:It's fast paced. Maybe it's hard to get around this, there is only so much you are allowed to fit in. I guess that if you're a fan, it's easier to follow and you already ""know"" a lot of what is going on... I can imagine this will be a bit harder for the rest of the audience. It might just feel a bit too much at times.Travis Fimmel. Don't get me wrong, I think he is a great actor - I just have a problem understanding him at times! I've been a fan of him since Vikings, but the man needs to step up his voice, speech lessons, whatever. It's hard to understand the man.All in all, Warcraft pulls it off extremely well. I do hope it performs well enough so we can see future sequels, fans know the best is yet to come: There are amazing stories and characters the ""rest"" of the world needs to see.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Not as good as the short-cinematics that Blizzard puts out...,"It's sad that that really any of these cinematics are a better story and more action packed than the Warcraft film... why did they spend 160million USD on a full cast/crew/actors when they could just spend like 10million USD to put the animation team at Blizzard on a FULL TIME cinematic-making schedule? I bet that that team can crank out a 2hr full feature cinematic in a year or so... and it would perform WAY better than the Warcraft film did... 30million views on YT, will probably translate to the same views in the cinema, so that's 300million USD gross easily, from a 10million USD budget...

I'm not saying Warcraft's IMDb reviews are fake/paid...,"...but they very well basically might be. OK, I'm saying that. They're paid reviews. The positive reviews are fake. This movie is not good. Use your judgment. Don't be a fool. There are people who get paid to write fake reviews. Of course everyone knew Warcraft was going to be a trash movie, just like the game has been going totally downhill since 2011 or so. Of course a huge company is going to pay PR companies to write positive reviews and artificially buff the score of the film. Why wouldn't they do that? So, I'm not necessarily upset about that. They made a movie, they want to make money off of it. But the movie shouldn't have been made to begin with. This film just randomly throws in a bunch of superficial aspects of the game (e.g., Oooh, they're flying on Griffins!) with some atrocious writing and acting. The film exemplifies just how bad the game has gotten and how removed it is from the actual culture of WoW and all the things that made the game appealing and good. The movie is downright awful. The scene where the orc chick calls out the insufferably nerdy mage for wanting to go to bed with her, and then refusing, is so completely telling of the targeted demographic of this film. The demographic is the nerdy mage. It's too bad this film was made. I'll admit the game was really great in it's heyday and started to decline with Lich King and overcomplicating and over-noobifying everything. Any true fan of the game will agree with me.

visually stunning summer blockbuster,"First of I would like to note how mad I am at all those ""official"" reviews from critics who think they know how to really rate a movie. It is absolutely preposterous what some of them write.WARCRAFT is visually one of the best films I've seen in recent years. The animations and special effects are absolutely gorgeous and it is one of the very first movies that shows magical effects and spell-weaving in this glorious fashion.WARCRAFT is first and foremost a movie for the fans of the Warcraft-universe but it is also a very nice fantasy/action flick for people how don't really know this rich universe. The fans of this rich lore will have an even bigger blast seeing it, that's how good and genuine to the source material it is made!Those 2 hours and 3 minutes just fly by the viewer and when it's over you don't want to believe you already have to exit the movie theater. One valid point in a lot of reviews is, that the movie should be longer (or should contain less plot) and a more detailed explaining of certain things would have been nice. It is a good possibility that people with no prior knowledge of this universe will have a hard time connecting a few dots. That's because WARCRAFT pushes the story nearly too much and Ducan Jones maybe put too much plot into those 2 hours.But as mentioned before, this movie is a glorious summer blockbuster with breathtaking visual effects and I highly recommend it to all fantasy/action/science fiction fans out there!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Movies based on Games :(,"""Warcraft"" is a mess and still one of the best movies based on video games made so far. I think no one really can explain why none of the various attempts of adapting succeeded. They all feel kind of dumb and constructed. Warcraft is no exception, although there was hope with Duncan Jones directing this movie. He made one great and one good sci-fi-movie before and is known as a huge fan of the game.Some of the CGI in this movie looks surreal and Ben Fosters young but elderly magician didn't work for me. I liked the main orc character, but his character arc was wasted and felt poorly made. Nevertheless, most of the orc scenes felt like they were made for a game and not a movie. The main human character was flat and i did not buy him as a loving and carrying father. He simply seemed to be too young.Everything sad, there where some unexpected story points and the general world was very well carried out.

The Beginning,"Not perfect but a really good first movie of Warcraft for the fans and who don't know the Warcraft lore.

BUT! There is something with the movie what could be very frustrating. The story.. Yes 123 minutes is not enough for this movie which caused some deficiencies like storytelling and characters.

Had potential to be better than average.,"Warcraft - The BeginningTo put it simply, the film serves well to fans of the already established franchise. That is, if you are familiar with the Warcraft universe you have a much higher chance of enjoying this than someone who is not familiar at all.I liked the film, seeing the characters and locations I know and love up there on the screen is what made it for me. But, that is all the film has going for it.Where this film fails as an actual film, is in its pacing. There were moments where within a 5 minute window, 3 scenes would have already passed. Some scenes so short they consisted of only 4 lines of dialogue before being thrown into the next scene. Leaving you with the sense of either wanting more or asking 'was that scene really necessary?'The CGI to me felt lacking, too stylized for my tastes, there were moments where it looked really great and then there were moments where it looked like I was watching a game cut scene. otherwise the world the CGI department created was beautiful.All in all, the film was a bit better than I had anticipated, its score was true to home, feeling very Warcraft-esque, the characters felt relateable and they way 'magic' was portrayed was fun to watch. It just needed better work on its editing/pacing, the script itself (Bad dialogue and character decisions) and some of its CGI.I rate it a 5/10 (5 is average - a lot of people seem to forget that, you find a lot of people using 7 as an average these days)",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Am i missing something?,"1) I literally just created this profile 5 min ago to comment on this after seeing the word ""Great"" used in every second comment.
2) I had been waiting for this movie since 2007 when it was first announced and watched it upon its release.
3) Just keep in mind, this movie cost as much as ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" to produce...
4) I never comment on movies, so excuse my lack of 'professional movie review' terminology, however i feel that this is one film i am qualified to talk about.Yes, i did have high expectations for this movie and i honestly thought that Blizzard had the opportunity to temporarily make WoW the largest MMORPG in the world once more if they play their cards right.Whether you have heard of the story of Warcraft or not, you need to understand that Warcraft has arguably the richest story-line out of anything ever written and even some 'random' characters have very deep history.So considering the above, the movie was utterly disappointing. This should never have been a movie in the first place, it should have been a series with 3 to 5 seasons of 10, 1 hour episodes in each season.This movie was so rushed that when i tried to briefly explain to my wife (who is not familiar with the story) who the extremely important character which is integral to the story was (because the movie did not bother to do it at all), by the time i could finish my sentence the character was already dead...When Garona Halforcen went from talking dirty to talking about her terrible past basically in a span of about 7 seconds had to be the cringest dialog in history.Basically if you have had no expectation what so ever and have no idea about the story, objectively speaking, especially for a less mature viewer who does not take movies to seriously and who values fast, mindless action above all, the movie is about a 5.5 or 6/10. If you are more mature and not familiar with Warcraft and value a decently constructed plot with some character development then the movie is about a 3 or 4/10. If you are Chinese person who lives in China then, for got knows what reason, the movie is a 10/10 for you. If you like a well constructed story and character development and are familiar with the story (and understand the potential this movie had) then it is a 0/10.The movie needed to collect USD 450 million to break even so i am happy it i did not reach that mark and OFFICIALLY flopped because it sucked!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I just might buy this one,"I knew of this movie, that it is coming out but it did not interested me that much. I never played the game and the trailers didn't do a thing for me. Than the movie opened in the states and critics wrote it off right away as a failure.Today I wanted to see a movie, and this was the only one on play that I have not seen yet but was willing to pay for. Given that my only expectation was to be entertained, I must say that this movie was a very pleasant surprise. It is not a great movie, not by a long shot, but it does the job it was set out to do rather well. And that job was: set up a franchise.The good: The basic plot of the movie is quite good and there were some twists and turns that really payed off. The ending especially was very satisfying to me. The orcs look freakin great and basically all the scenery look beautiful. The genre of the movie is fantasy and it shows. another thing that I really liked is that the wast majority of the actors who were not doing motion capture are best know for their TV work, so this movie could be a career launching pad for many talented people.The not so good: The movie is based on a computer game and has to set up the franchise, meaning that it has to show locations and factions and stuff that are not relevant to this movie. Now, this movie already has a build in audience of millions of gamers to whom all this exposition is useless because they already know the mythology of the world our story is set, but as for the casual movie goer, that only knows that warcraft is a popular game, at best. So half of the first act is basically a huge information dump that is incomplete, unnecessary (for the current story) and overall unusable. But it will make sense 2 years from now in the sequel. My second problem with the movie is that its too short. There must be a good 20-30 minutes of story that were cut out because of length. Because of this some things are not set up as well as they should be. Like, the motivation of the main villain is not explained. There is a hint towards the ""why"" but thats about it. Also, some lines of dialog were rather flat, like if they were taken right out of the game, so yeah, some better dialog is badly needed. And as a personal taste, some of the costume design of the humans were rather tacky. It just goes to show that some elements needs to be adapted for the big screen as they do not work as well as they did in the game.Overall, this is a decent movie, and if they will nail the sequel, which will come, we will have the first good fantasy franchise since the lord of the rings.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The film is alright.,"This film is alright. By alright i mean it isn't great is another blockbuster film which doesn't live up to its expectation. The story is very fine. There wasn't much suspense nor was it very intriguing. The pacing is quite slow and there really isn't much to say about the plot as it is very simple.The CGI however is great, the imagery shows mythological concept quite well. Most of the CGI was excellent and had quite a realistic feel to it and wasn't really overdone. Money well spent.The acting is also quite bland. The actors show do not show much emotion and it looks to me they are not portraying their characters in the way they are supposed to. However, Toby Kemmel and Travis Fimmel were brilliant how they represented the characters. As a motion picture character, Toby Kemmel had a hard job show emotion and have an emphatic effect and he did this very well.However, the problem with mythological films is that most films do not explain mythology or at least its origins. This is immensely key especially in warcraft as it has such a brilliant backstory with its many games yet fails to show this.The film does show a character being developed later on in the next film foreshadowing something quite mysterious happening involving Durotans son.The cinematography is splendid.Quite scrumptious if i may add. Films like Warcraft need to have great cinematography in order to capture key elements of the film. warcraft did a great job in this department.Duncan Jones is a good director. Although with very few films under his belt, he is great director. Watch Source Code, the film is great and he did a brilliant job keeping the film together running everything smoothly. However, the lack of experience and only one film which was critically acclaimed to have done quite well, there was too much expected from him. Duncan Jones ruined this film and had a hard time keeping it together. I believe he wasn't the man for the job.This film is yet another blockbuster film which isn't great and is another film with critical controversy. Hopefully the next film will be better after its intriguing conclusion of the first film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Clash of Industries.,"1. Movies 2. Music 3. Television 4. Books 5. GamesThis is how the world perceives each industry in order of popularity, fame, wealth, coolness and sophistication.. The lower down the list the harder it is to make the transition upwards.Gaming is still to this day considered 'for children' by so called peers of the realm which makes it very difficult for a feature film of even one of gaming's most recognisable adult based, story/lore rich brands to receive credibility..In my opinion, the movie industry for some reason is truly terrified of the gaming industry most of all.. and if a 'game' were to ever achieve success in the movie industry the world as we know it may (end) change and gamer's perhaps would be somewhat forgiven/understood for spending (wasting) their free time within these worlds..As for this movie, I had my doubts to begin with but when I learned just exactly how much influence Blizzard were going to have, I relaxed.. Basing the movie on the original game was a risky but genius move.. Unquestionably there are much more entertaining stories and events within the 'Warcraft' universe but starting from the beginning just feels so right and that is what I feel this movie has achieved, something which Blizzard are known for.. Fantastic storytelling..I personally feel the pace of the movie is acceptable because there was so much to get through and even if your not a fantasy fan you can easily understand the premises of this movie and because of this frantic pace I can hand on heart confirm that there are precisely zero dull scenes within this because they simply didn't have time to include some..The actors and Travis Fimmel in particular were completely suitable and portrayed Lothar exactly how I would imagine him to be which is pretty special for an actor who has very little knowledge of the universe.. The cast as a whole were perfect for this as none of them are considered 'huge household names' which could have taken away some of the focus from 'WARCRAFT' itself..As for the CGI environments and the Orcs I am not going to waste my time reviewing because this is blizzard, they know their product well..Yes the movie could have been improved but without A New Hope you would never have had Empire.. This is a solid and impressive 'beginning'.. Please go and judge it for yourself, because I am unsure what movie critics have against gamers but I feel they believe we are second class citizens.. Show your true passion!Thanks for listening... :) Love",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Best film of 2016,"Most of the 'critical review' sites will not have played Warcraft or World of Warcraft and so cannot appreciate the depth of story that this film attempts to fill in the length of a single movie.This is a must see for everyone, and supporting it will hopefully lead to more films being made covering even better stories from the Warcraft series.For those who are not familiar with the games or the associated books and enjoyed the movie, any interest sparked by watching this can lead you to discover a rich lore with over a decade's worth of work making it far more vast than others such as Lord of the Rings.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A mediocre fantasy movie,"I'm a little puzzled about some of the other reviews and I'm wondering if I saw the same movie.I think it was a mediocre film at best. The acting was bad and contrived with actors expressing very little in the way of emotions and displaying a forced solemnity that made me cringe a couple times. The story is lackluster and bland with serious pacing issues and tropes seen dozen of times before. While I was watching I couldn't shake that feeling the film tried very hard to achieve an epic grandeur like a Lord of the ring but failed at that because its source material is just not very deep. It felt amateurish, frantic, trying to cram too much things in one place. Only watch it if you are a Die-Hard fan of the Warcraft games I guess.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Blizzard fans, unite!","Honestly, the first point I want to make before going in depth is that in no way am I a professional reviewer and I am simply writing this review because I feel A LOT of the reviews written for this movie, have been based off of subjective opinion rather than us looking at it for what it is, a movie franchise with what might be the greatest potential in the 21st century. Now, for all of you still reading, let's start off with some facts. Blizzard Entertainment first introduced Warcraft, to consoles in Warcraft: Orcs & Humans in 1994, the following year they then released Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness and the expansion Warcraft II: Beyond the Dark Portal 1995, then it took them another 7 years before the sequel Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos (RoC) came out in 2002 followed closely by Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne (TFT) in 2003.The year after that is when World of Warcraft was released, which in its opening year had 1.5 million people subscribing, now to World of Warcraft alone there currently are 5 expansions and a 6th on the way. The movie Warcraft: The Beginning is about the very first game that dates all the way back to Warcraft: Orcs & Humans.With all this in mind, let's explore what has been done to bring the world of Warcraft to life on the cinematized screen of a movie theatre. To start off, I'd like to say, I have been anticipating the release of this movie for almost going on 3 years now, and back in 2014 when I noticed it on IMDb for pre-production it said it wouldn't be out until in 2017, so being here in 2016 having watched it on the premiere date too, I'd say I'm more than ecstastic. Now, what I as both a player of the game, and a fan of the lore experienced is, keeping in mind that it is a work to be critical about, am very pleased with the result. What I think we all noticed during the first release of the trailer is that the production team kept the animated look to the pauldrons and armor of the humans, because they wanted to illustrate how this is a fictional world, where magic roams, where creatures you'd never dream of in your wildest nightmares also walk freely.A lot of people are also criticizing the use of CGI in this movie, but, the fact that all CGI-characters were based on motion capture, where the actions were performed by actual actors in suits, made it not only exceed the expectations but create an entire new plateau for what people in the future will expect from CGI. And as a moviebuff I am personally really invested in that concept and idea, and I think we all should be.With all this being said, and not much of the actual movie having been revealed, I'd like to extend an invitation to anyone who hasn't seen this marvel with their own eyes, to go see it, because not only do I believe, but I know for a fact that if people see this movie and dislike it, it's not because of what's been shown on the screen, it's more likely they're perplexed by the fact that their expectations to the movie were wrong.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A good tribute!,"I don't understand why so much hate honestly! I get why some players did not enjoy it but overral this was a good tribute to both Warcraft and World of Warcraft! Definitely flawed but I was pleasantly surprised by the accurate portrait of Stormwind, most scenarios and even the fights. I expected this to be crap but I liked it. And if you are a fan of the Blizzard masterpieces you'll like it too.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Visually stunning, but confusing.","I have mixed feelings about this movie, I came away from it thinking it was ironic that World of Warcraft beat LOTR online to the punch in the mmo genre, but the Lord of the rings trilogy smashed WoW on the big screen.Visually it's a treat to watch the cgi is great and the orc's look fantastic. The fight scenes are done very well, and the spells look amazing.The tone seems all other the place. The comic relief character khadgar just didn't have the flow that the two hobbit's had in LOTR. The sad moments never really hit home with me either there's scene's that should be pulling on your heart strings, but for lack of screen time or some other reason you just don't care.I have been playing wow on and off since vanilla and I'm pretty good with the lore, but there's time's where even I don't know what's going on. The movie make's a very decent effort trying to keep the story condensed, but it soon unravels and gets lost pretty quick.So to summarise it's a decent movie to watch but doesn't hold a candle to other fantasy movies, and I think it's because it has a hard time balancing certain aspects of the fantasy genre. While LOTR knows how and when to turn from a beautiful fantasy flick with great visuals to gritty and realistic war scene's to drama with real characters and dilemmas that make the audience care about the current situation there in. WoW simple does not do this.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best movie I have ever seen,"I have seen the movie 2 times in the cinema and I have no regrets, it is by far the best movie I have ever seen. I literally cried because of epicnes, 2 times at the same point. This movie is an absolute must-see for people who are familiar with the lore. For myself, I know every single letter and number of everything of every character in the Warcraft universe so for me I knew exactly what was going on. But you don't have to know the lore to see this movie, in fact this movie can definitely get you into the lore if not it can turn you on for playing the game.Just so you know: GARONA IS NOT HALF HUMAN, SHE IS HALF DRAENEI!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The story is great, should be very appealing to fans and non fans of Warcraft universe. I went with my girlfriend and she is not aware of Warcraft and she absolutely loved it. Many funny moments as well, great acting and epic soundtrack. For me it was just as epic as Lotr.Great premise for a trilogy or even more.P.s. I would suggest not to listen RT, those guys are not credible anymore. Just go and watch it yourself.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I like it pretty well,"I watched this from the viewpoint of having played the game/games for a long time. I'm not some stickler for details, so I'm not here to nit pick. Even if I was here to nit pick discrepancies between the game and the film I didn't notice anything glaring on my first viewing. I never got too involved in the lore though. I mostly just played the game to have fun.I thought the production values were top notch. A lot of work went into set design and cgi. The locations made me a little nostalgic for all my old imaginary questing. Sound design was excellent in my opinion. The special effects for spell casting were pretty good. They had the feel of a video game. The battle effects were pretty intense but without graphic violence like a video game for children. For me it was the production values that swung my rating towards the good.The plot was pretty much a video game script that was fleshed out with some human interaction and details, even if not all the characters were human. Love, loss, redemption, there were moments that added character to the character giving it more depth than a video game can really render. This film wasn't made to blow minds with plot twists. There were a few plot twists but most stoned kids could see them coming. The pacing of things moved along pretty good. There was a lot of options to explore.I didn't really like the casting and acting . It was cast to appeal to the targeted audience of younger people. I get that and don't begrudge the decision. And it tracks with the game lore. It is pure fantasy after all. There's just just something that doesn't sit right with me about a king and his general that look like they should be on a college football team and going to frat parties instead of saving the world. The king looked like he kept his sword lodged up his butt most of the time. He is as so stiff. I just didn't buy it.My overall review is it doesn't suck. It kept my attention throughout. I'd think it's good viewing for an afternoon of bong tokes and pizza. I wouldn't watch it again though without some external reason.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The  WoW geeks are out in force writing views,"It's worth seeing. The special effects are incredible. The actors playing the orcs are outstanding. And the ending is almost awesome then becomes tropish but still good.You've seen this happen before.. when writers/directors try to shoehorn 50 things into 30 seconds.. but don't have the talent to do it. What LOTR did perfectly (conveying 50 things in a 2 minute scene with hardly any dialogue) this fails at. You can tell every scene is cut for time and the actors try to babble their piece of the exposition in.. it doesn't work. You cant blame the actors.. thats pure writing/directing. They've set up for a sequel but honestly they should have taken their time, split this into two movies and done it right. If you miss it .. well you didn't miss anything. If you saw it.. well.. it's entertaining. You wont remember the plot or the characters a week from now.. even if you're a wow fan.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Thinking outside the bubble!,"I think most reviews hold a lot of prejudice against the video game industry and people need to stop expecting another Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. Duncan Jones makes a new approach into the fantasy universe and doesn't have fear to use color and action. All the action scenes make sense and fit well into the universe, working with the story. The story is just like the game, and if someone go to the movie expecting something different than Warcraft, obviously will be displeased. It is a movie about WAR, MAGIC AND ORCS! It meets all that was stated from the beginning. When you go to see Warcraft, you can't expect a new Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones. Neither a new Marvel movie or DC. Warcraft is another kind of history, and Duncan Jones insists in this. He brings another aesthetic and another kind of history pace. And let's face it, today we are living a boom of superheroes (and ""geek"") movies, just like there was a Western boom years ago, for example. Movies that try to go against the river are ignored or vilified. And most movies are classified into two types: intelligent movies or blockbusters. The ones which will try an Oscar and the ones which make a good money. Warcraft, being born from a game, is the focus of much prejudice. ""Who dares to try to make a movie about a video game?!"" For most critics video games are childish, but for our luck, game designers think different and are ahead, making games like Heavy Rain and The Last of Us. The Game Industry already uses cinematography strategies to achieve an unique experience. And it is stupidity that the Movie Industry keeps ignoring this new universe of media, and lives inside of a bubble of constructed rules. But hey! Let's think outside the bubble!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Well Crafted War,"I have played video games where while watching the cut scenes I thought 'This would make a great movie'. That is what this movie is. It is a well made video game with the gameplay removed.The story follows the orcs, whose home world is dying. To survive, they have decided to take over another world, the realm of the humans. The human world is a more peaceful place, but able to defend itself. And so there is war.The story is simple, with a few twists. The acting is decent. What makes the movie stick out is the action and CG. The fighting is awesome, the magic is beautiful. They did a fantastic job of bringing the world alive.Overall it is not worth watching for all people. But if you have ever thought a bunch of video game cut scenes would make a good movie, you will likely enjoy this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fantastic special effects can't help the poor pacing and plot,"""Warcraft"" looks incredible. From the time the movie opens all the way to the moment the credits roll, I sat on my couch stunned at how fantastic everything looked - the special effects were visually stunning, the battle sequences epic in scope and brutal in their consequences, the settings and set design jaw-droppingly gorgeous, and the orcs as lifelike as any CGI orc could be. From a visual standpoint, ""Warcraft"" is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, when it comes to pacing and plotting, the movie starts to show its weaknesses.This is a film that would've greatly benefited from a longer running time. I have no doubt that the less than exciting plot and poor pacing were caused by studio executives meddling in the filmmaking process. That said, we have to judge a film based on the finished product, and the finished product is a plodding and boring movie. ""Warcraft"" starts, thankfully, from the perspective of the orcs. The incredible special effects alone is enough to draw one in; once the movie pivots and starts showing the humans, the pacing slows to a crawl. Practically every sequence regarding the human characters is one of exposition. People walk and talk, sit and talk, maybe run and talk, and rinse and repeat. Plot points are explained to the audience, as are specific backgrounds of certain characters, meaning that ""Warcraft"" does a lot of telling, and not enough showing. The scenes with the orcs are slightly better, but they also follow the same formula as the human sequences. The orcs too go through the motions of standing around and talking to each other - the only difference is these scenes are slightly more entertaining because of the great visual effects.When the orcs and humans finally start to collaborate the movie does pick up a bit, leading to some cool battle set pieces. Even though the movie is PG-13, the violence doesn't feel too neutered. Humans are crushed with larger than life hammers, and orcs are dismembered and decapitated, with green blood splashing onto the screen. The action is entertaining, and a true spectacle, but there's not nearly enough of it to make up for how slow this movie is. There are maybe two small action scenes before the final battle at the end; in between, you'll find scene after scene of people going from one location to the other and talking to more people. Thematically, it doesn't work, and it leads to a mostly boring film.The climax picks up, featuring many stunning battles and intriguing character moments. Unfortunately, many of the most interesting elements are moments that set up a sequel that we will never get. I wish this movie would've done better in the box office, because I did enjoy the worldbuilding and the characters enough to want to see a sequel. However, as its own movie, ""Warcraft"" is disappointing. It's not exciting enough to be a good action film, not interesting enough to be a character study, and not paced well enough to work as a standalone story. In the end, it does leave you wanting more, but perhaps not in the way the filmmakers wanted.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Film Review: Warcraft,"OK, first and foremost, I will begin this review by saying that I am not, and never have been a Warcraft player of any sort; meaning, I have not touched the online game, board game, card game or any Warcraft product since its inception. So, going into Duncan Jones' third directorial feature film Warcraft, I was a complete outsider amongst an army of loyal and very aware Warcraft users. Unlike most built-in audiences, each and every person who was in attendance of the early screening, possessed none of the typical geeky, fan-boy characteristics I have come to expect from franchises such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings film franchises. So, how did I feel finally being an outsider and what exactly did the audience I attended the screening looked like?The thing with the Warcraft universe is that everyone at some point tried it and you would never know who is a Warcraft fiend. Young, old, men, women, Warcraft is the type of obsession that could be just about for anyone. So, while I am somewhat aware of the massive universe Duncan Jones was responsible for bringing to life on the big screen, I had no idea how expansive and detailed this world really is.Upon the opening frames, seeing humans battle off against Orcs, and beginning much of the story in a fantastical world of Azeroth, I was one of few audiences members who was just along for the ride, and not for the love of the universe, but for the love of cinema. Having been late to the party with Lord of the Rings (truth of the matter is, I have never seen any of them nor have any interest to), one of the biggest complaints with many of my friends now with Middle Earth is, thanks to the massive success of HBO's Game of Thrones, violence, sex and exponential gore is what audiences want with fantasy films. The action solely isn't enough anymore. And while Daenerys Targaryen actress Emilia Clarke's newest film Me Before You, a romantic drama was playing in the cinema beside mine, I couldn't help but laugh at the fact that, fantasy doesn't always sell anymore; but sex surely does. As I can assure you, I may have never seen an episode of Game of Thrones, but you can sure as heck bet I have seen pictures on the interest of Clarke's bodacious naked bod.With Warcraft, the premise is simple. Orcs, lead by a sadistic leader who possesses the fel, Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu), sucks the life out of other world's inhabitants and uses their energy to open up a portal to a new world, inhabited by human, called Azeroth. To the dismay of Durotan (Toby Kimmell) an his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin), they follow along with Gul'Dan's plans only in hope of finding a peaceful life in the new world. Once through the portal, Gul'Dan wages war against the humans who inhabit that kingdom, putting him in a direct collision course with King of Stromwind Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), and as well as his trusty and noble military commander Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). A fierce warrior and destructive orc killer, Anduin finds himself partnered with the fumbling Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), a young and inexperienced warlock whose powers have yet to be contained. Advised by the council due to the recent threat of the orcs, Anduin and Khadgar head to Karazhan to summon the Guradian Medivh (Ben Foster) and use his wisdom and powers to help defeat the army of orcs and Gul'Dan once and for all.Fantasy isn't my preferred genre of cinema to watch. Being able to capture these films on the big screen is something wonderful though, especially amongst all its loyal and faithful fans. While the world of the Warcraft universe is highly new and almost unheard of to me, I can honestly say that I was very intimidated by its great reach and length, along with its history. After all, the first ever sighting of the Warcraft real-time strategy game came in 1994, when I was only a child. Imagine how much the world has grown since then? Like anything fanatical and with such a rich history, the more you know, the better. Was I a fan of the film as a whole by the time I left the theatre? Maybe not the biggest, but, does that suggest it was a bad film overall?I believe that audience members, especially ones for this fantastical, built-in audience, is important to consider, especially given the universe's endless possibilities. But, what is the difference between a built in universe such as Warcraft, or, say, the cinematic universe of Marvel or DC? Comic book characters that have been around decades and whose worlds mix, blend and cross- over to other universes regularly? Nothing really. So with that said, as a whole, was Warcraft an amazing fantasy experience? Absolutely not. At times, the film suffers from straining and overwhelming special effects, especially during its action sequences, its action is brute and forceful, giving audiences a bit of a spectacle overload. Where does the film succeed most? In its glory and beauty of showing off the orcs by the firelight, in the dark or marvelling at the great narrative scenes of honour and glory, especially when the camera gazes against the massive arms and shoulders of its main orc protagonist Durotan.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolutely Great,"This film is the best video game based film ever. I know that's not saying much but it's great above and beyond what myself and family members expected. It follows the source material faithfully and honestly it's a good film because of it, it gave us as fans of the series of the game a film that was just as good as the game we have played for years, not to mention the CG work that went into this film is just amazing, a visual masterpiece and the writing is so well done giving you an incite into certain characters that we never really knew much about.

Beautiful,"I really loved pretty much everything about this movie. It was beautiful, the story was great, the characters were fun. After all of that I couldn't shake the ""book one"" feeling I got from it. That feeling you get when reading the first book in the series. All the character introductions and the interactions that tie them together either at first or eventually. The great thing is that after you get through that part the rest of the series is typically amazeballs. I hope that these films will follow in those steps. They promised a lot with this first movie, the talk if you will. Now it will be time to walk the beautiful walk that blizzard can be KNOW for.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perfectly adequate. Wouldn't mind seeing more,"I will start by saying I'm not a big Warcraft fan. I was back in the day, but haven't played since Warcraft III (about 12 years ago). Having said that, I'm a fan of the fantasy genre, like LotR, Hobbit, GoT etc., so I gave this a shot out of curiosity.I wasn't expecting much from this film since the trailers didn't really get me excited, and it neither surprised me by being great, nor disappointed me by being bad; it was somewhere in the middle. Basically, it was just ""good enough"", but not really ""good"". I didn't feel like I wasted my time, but it's not something I'm going to rush out to recommend to others. Perhaps fans of WoW will enjoy seeing these characters come to life more than I did. I just took it at face value as a film, with no bias from love of the game, and found it to be adequate. Many reviewers said it was too busy setting up a sequel rather than focusing on its own story. I didn't get that vibe, though there are definitely hints at more story to come. I am curious to see what a sequel holds, but because of its lackluster performance at the domestic box office, they'll either reduce the budget of a sequel, which doesn't seem likely if they want to recreate the world/characters of the first film, or just not make the film. Or they might just make it a Chinese production since it did so well there. I guess we'll see.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

But,ugh,it starts promising and soon went straight downward.The story is broken,and the acting is bad.I almost feel asleep during the half!This movie really has destroyed all my hope for the Warcraft series! I can see there's much potential in it,but i don't know what happened and these people simply ruined it!Conclusion: Don't waste your time and money watching this movie.It's not worth it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant effort,"I went in to this film with low expectations based on the poor critic reviews but as a veteran player of the MMO I just wanted to see something on the big screen do the lore a little justice.The initial pacing of the film is slightly off and the characters progressed a little too swiftly(I take it this it where the bulk of the 40 minutes cut impacted).But once it got going the details and the characters were fantastic, I just couldn't stop smiling throughout the film, Duncan Jones and Blizzard have created a movie that any Warcraft or fantasy fan will enjoy.Hopefully this film leads to more as there's so much story to explore within the Warcraft universe.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A high fantasy video game adaptation done right,"Despite being an adaptation of a video game, and despite being the point of introduction to a sprawling fantasy world, Warcraft: The Beginning achieves just about everything it set out to do.Stepping beyond its well-trodden high fantasy setting, Warcraft: The Beginning surmounts the traditional limitations of its genre. By providing us with an emotional, and above all believable, narrative exploration of the Orcs, the audience is not just given room, but compelled to empathise with both sides of the film's narrative conflict.Populated by a host of believable characters, and some solid performances too, the fledgling Warcraft cinematic world gives us a taste of a compelling wider universe.Where the film stumbles, however, is with what lies beyond the central narrative. While there are a few complex human characters, Lothar and Medhiv spring to mind, without the powerful emotional drive of the main Orcish narrative, most of what's left fails to pop.Beyond its textual successes, Warcraft: The Beginning succeeds in its visual presentation. The computer-generated characters are rendered with such care that their presence greatly enhances the central narrative. The visual believability of the Orcs builds on their emotional authenticity, heightening their cinematic presence dramatically. Where the visual presentation fails to live up to such high standards, however, is once again in the areas beyond the Orcish narrative. While the standard never dips below an acceptable level, beyond the Orcs, the visual presentation fails to leave a lasting impression.As a fan of the pre-WoW Warcraft narrative and a fan of the woefully mistreated High Fantasy genre, I find myself impressed by Warcraft: The Beginning. It rose above the typical good and evil tropes found in High Fantasy to deliver a compelling emotional core, surrounded by a competent if somewhat unremarkable exterior.All things considered, I would recommend Warcraft: The Beginning as an entertaining, epic, experience, that carries with it a spark of its Tolkienian forbears.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A big disappointment,"Duncan Jones is best known for the films Moon and Source Code. Two very successful films! However, the director of Warcraft has acquired a lot larger project. It is a film adaptation of a very successful and well-known game. If this works out well, then we can assume that this man will work on more larger projects. I myself have never played the game so I won't compare this movie with the game. I consider this film as a film that brings a new fantasy story, a genre that is quite interesting because of the many things you can do with it.Warcraft is set in a fantasy world in which man is threatened by Orcs. We know them already from for example the Lord of the Rings. The orcs' world is dying so they need to find a new world. The world where the people live. These two worlds are connected to each other by a portal, and this is how the orcs try to take over the world of the people.A fantasy film is a good film when the story draws in the world in, you can empathize with the characters and you get to see lots of novelties. Unfortunately, this film has too little of these elements. The story is pretty standard; good vs evil, so there must be something extra to make it interesting. The characters unfortunately aren't. This is mainly due to the actors and the frequent (say almost full-time) use of a green screen. The effects look way too inadequate to take you into this world. The orcs look very unrealistic, because it is all generated by computer. The humans are played by real actors, but aren't convincing. The acting is very moderate. Therefor it was impossible for me to be sucked into this world. So much money was involved, but we don't see it on the screen. It looks close to awful at most.Love is blind, they say sometimes. I therefore believe that only the true fans of the game can enjoy this film. They will probably take the shortcomings for granted.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A spoiler-free review of Warcraft: The Beginning for both fan and non-fan movie goers,"First of all, I need to let you know that I am a huge fan of the Warcraft universe and Blizzard games for a long time. I have big expectation for this movie for two reasons: it is a Warcraft movie and being made by passionate individuals who respect, understand and love the source materials, namely Duncan Jones, the director of the film.With all that being said, lets get to the review so that I can tell you my opinions about various aspect in the movie. 1. The story and settings: Warcraft: The Beginning is a movie about the war between two races: the humans, who are natives in the world of Azeroth, and the orcs, whose invasion was forced because of the decaying state of their homeland. Jones intended to bring a more compelling perspective where both sides have their own motivations to participate in battles as oppose to the generic, straight-up good versus evil stereotypes we saw many times in Lords of the Rings or the likes. And he nailed it with the excellent portrayal of the orcs. You feel that they are not monsters. That they are sentient beings. That they have culture,language and traditions. Even though their baring tusks, outlandish hairstyle and warmonger, tribalistic demeanor are not exactly empathy-provoking. In contrast, the human world and its population are as dull as they could get. They run around, doing their epic quests in their amazingly-put-together, faithfully-designed armor sets while the orc's storyline explores very humane problems like the destructive lust for power, the helplessness in the race against extinction or the ever-ending conflict between duty and personal priorities.It is ashamed that the human's robotic, lack-luster nature really clouded the movie's noble attempt. 2. The acting and charactersOverall, the acting is averagely good. With the humans being mediocre, and the orcs being decent, especially the orc main protagonist. The film features a big,if not daunting, cast of characters from either sides. I like the approaches Jones and his talented team took on each character. However, the problem is, some of them show off their lack of personality depths and one- dimensional writing fairly quick the deeper you get into the movie which is a little bit unfortunate. I grew to care about the orcs, and their fate more than I did with the humans. I also thought an important role on the human side was a miscast. That the actor did not fit the role (hint:the character's name starts with M.) 3. The sounds and visualsThe sounds and visuals in Warcraft are amazing! From the statuesque, towering physique of the orcs to the bone-crushing blows of their hammers bringing fury upon their foes. You can feel the human bones and their frail bodies just crumble under the massive onslaughts that penetrate through their shields and armors. The music was great, and the CGIs looked more realistic than ever. The battles were brutal and in your face. Some of the action and fighting shots just blew me away. It really spoke volumes of the dedication,talents, and quality that went into the production of this movie. I can say without hesitation that the film is still enjoyable for its action alone even if you have no ideas what the hell is going on most of the time. 4. The narration and pacingThe pacing is what brings the movie down the most to me. Warcraft, along with Batman v. Superman, became lesser when they entered the editing rooms. The film rightfully deserved (and definitely would have profited from) more screen time. It had a very strong start in the first 5 to 10 minutes, but it flashed through locations and characters so fast you could not grasp any emotions or ideas for the next 20 minutes. Transition is jarring, and in some case even disappeared, indicated that the movie was heavily and rawly cut.It was quite anti-climatic when this happened in some scenes. The speed of narration was eventually the greatness-killer of Warcraft. 5.ConclusionIn the end, Warcraft is an entertaining movie that has a few stand- out,epic moments.As a non-fan movie goer, you probably would not understand half of the things that are going on. But, again, the action, the awesome CGIs and cinematography still grip your attention. I guarantee you shall find enjoyment in it, and your money is well paid. However, I strongly recommend you stay away from the critics'reviews of Warcraft which has been bashing the hell out of it since its release. They scored it 0, 1 or 2, calling it the worst movie of this year or all time. My advise? Do not listen to those garbage. Go see the movie and judge it by yourself.Warcraft is mediocre at worst. And condemn it as trash, or crap is outright arrogance or lies. I hope you will have a good time with the movie. Thank you for reading my review.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Subpar Action and Convoluted Narrative.,"It's not difficult to guess where the tension and dramatic build up are going in WARCRAFT: The New Beginning, the big screen adaptation of the global RPG hit, World of Warcraft. There is an incredible display of flair and build up in the early minutes, all pointing to a riveting dramatic heft that the rest of this another attempt to transpire a phenomenal video game into a massive box office franchise, seemingly tries to unload. And it does hit that point, but it crumbles right away as it gives way to numerous subplots it doesn't seem able to fully get across. Much of this film is funny when it tries to be serious, and it is too serious (and dark) most of the time, but ends up being funny, anyway. But this isn't the fun that even most game fanatics would probably root for.At its helm, director Duncan Jones tries to juggle all the worlds and realms, all their mythical creatures, and their substories, together. There is a readily perceived effort to get to narrative and visual success, but the victory can't be claimed by both. Even where its better, the glory can only be half- baked at best, and it deteriorates toward the rest of this ambitious saga, as it aspires for reaches it doesn't seem capable to make. The ensuing result plummets past mediocrity.Much of this film follows the epic battle between the defensive human race and an invasive other- worldly Orc species. When Draenor reaches a brink of collapse, its Orc inhabitors must flee the planet and search for a new home in another. A portal connecting to the Earth- like Azeroth is opened, and begins a brutal battle between the two races. But a spark of hope emerges from both sides when Durotan (Toby Kebell), an orc soldier, questions the savage measures of his clansmen, and insists that a peaceful mediation must be pursued, a campaign which human knight, Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) also proposes to his king and queen. But this motion could might as well trigger an in-house hostility within both sides, and the resulting chaos may be even more disastrous than both races can ever foresee.If its visual grandeur could compensate for its narrative shortcomings, this oncsreen attempt might have actually delivered an at least tolerable presentation. Much of this technical prestige comes in excess, but often still unable to blend with the tension of the sequences it is meant to enforce. A sizable chunk of this failure also emanates from its utter inability to efficiently utilize its characters, whose being overly underwritten, makes rooting for them extremely hard for the audience. This mistake plagues some of the central characters like Ben Foster's Medivh and Paula Datton's Ditto Garona, whose either boring demeanor or laughable appearance can make them struggle for chuckle or affection.Where it stands, it's not hard to see how earnest Warcraft's motivations are. The narrative itself holds some sentimental weight, but unless they're not employed at right places, any attempt to go a step higher could only ensue a staggering fall. There are some hints of genuine efforts to this, most of which, heartfelt, but ones horrendously not enough to compete with the film's aesthetic ambitions. There is a screaming hint of sequel that protrudes out of this convoluted complexity, but we might be wishing for the enmity between the two factions to immediately cease, before that said follow-up gets realized.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Long awaited... Exceptional film!,"As a player of the game, I've been waiting a long time for this movie! It had a massive task of bringing people who now nothing about it into a vast world - and also keeping people like me happy! I can say with pride... what an epic film! Good to see Ragnar (Vikings) at the helm of this new film series! I cannot wait for the next! I feel as though they now have a platform to build on and bring out more and more from the Warcraft universe which would have made this initial film a little too much to start with. Good luck to all the cast and I really hope people take to this series well. I would love to see this movie get all the appreciation it deserves, after all, it has been a long time coming. The people at Blizzard entertainment really have built the most amazing world for players to explore in the World of Warcraft game, and I've no doubt they can bring the best of that universe to the masses through these films... Hopefully people will finally start to understand why people can easily get lost and enthralled in such an extensive and epic world... of warcraft.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Warcraft: The Beginning - Orcs, Humans, and a Smackdown Festival","When you open a magical portal to a world full of green muscle tanks built like trucks, you shouldn't be surprised when all hell breaks loose. Azeroth is a beautiful fantasy kingdom, but this isn't a fairy tale-it's Game of Thrones meets World of Warcraft with a heavy dose of brawls. The Orcs aren't here for sightseeing.The CGI is so well-crafted that even Gollum would be begging Blizzard for a contract. The Orcs have more detail than a final boss's face, the magical spells explode like a firework display on steroids, and every battle is a visual storm. But fair warning: with so much eye candy, the movie sometimes flirts with pixel overload.Travis Fimmel looks like Ragnar Lothbrok traded his axe for shiny armor and a white horse. He plays the cliché human hero, but it works. Opposite him, Toby Kebbell as the Orc leader is so massive you'd think he's been farming creatine between quests. Shoutout to Paula Patton as Garona, the half-Orc, half-human powerhouse, who delivers her lines like a top-tier DPS in a raid.The beginning is promising-the two worlds collide smoothly, and you can feel the impending chaos. But after an hour, the epic momentum starts to fizzle out. It's like playing an MMORPG where the side quests drag on, and you end up clicking ""Skip Cutscene."" Thankfully, a few key characters step in to revive interest, like a boss finally dropping that epic loot you've been waiting for.The final battle isn't perfect, but it hits hard enough to make your trip worthwhile. With magical explosions, brutal duels, and unexpected twists, it comes close to being the ultimate Blizzard cinematic. It could've used a bit more tension, but it's still a satisfying brawl.Warcraft: The Beginning doesn't revolutionize the fantasy genre, but it lays down solid foundations. If you're a fan of epic battles and sprawling fantasy worlds, this movie's for you. Sure, the plot has holes big enough to fit a poorly patched MMORPG, but visually, it's a quest worth taking. So, strap on your armor, accept the quest, and dive into a world where even the Orcs can smack you straight into respawn.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good attempt but with issues,"I gave it a random shot on Netflix, I thought it was all right.Considering this movie came out a long time ago, we can't be too hard on it.For a video game-based movie, Warcraft is better than most. The story is simplified to the point where anyone (even non-gammers) could get a rough idea of what's happening.Everything about this film from the setting, views, etc is impressive considering the time this movie was released. It's just one big fantasy action-packed adventure.The positive points end here, there are a series of pacing issues followed up with gap holes. If you pay close attention, you'll notice a lot of..skipping and a lack of explanations for why certain things happen.Even with these severe issues, the movie Warcraft really is about as good as any video game movie could be.Not excellent or terrible, but perhaps a little below the middle.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining movie,"""Warcraft"" is an entertaining movie. With orcs and humans, magic and swords, it is tempting to try and compare it with ""Lord of the Rings""--but since those movies were based on a treasured novel and ""Warcraft"" inspired by a video game, Warcraft's goals aren't quite as lofty. But it is a fun film. It was cool seeing King Ragnar from the ""Vikings"" in the lead role. And the scenes with the orcs are really amazing. It is pretty clear that the end of was setting up a sequel, so I will look forward to that. And at the end I even had an excuse to dust off some old David Bowie albums. Congratulations to his son, Duncan, for directing a fine movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Entertaining!,"Based on the massive Blizzard Entertainment game we probably all played at some point with differing success as kids and maybe still play, ""Warcraft"" stars Australia's Travis Fimmel amongst others in what is a pretty spectacular adapation. There are human warriors, sorcerers, evil Orcs (a seemingly inexhaustible supply of them) and spectacular settings on the planet Azeroth that reminded me of Lord of the Rings. What more is there to say? Well, there's plenty of action matched to a decent enough plot - though plot is not why you watch a film like this - and it's all on a epically large scale. Who doesn't love a good versus evil, man versus evil horde struggle? An entertaining two hours.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Could work for some,"Maybe it's just because my expectations going in were so low, but honestly I had a pretty good time in Warcraft. Now look, I'm not going to try and convince you that it's a ""good"" movie, but as a man who's been playing Warcraft since way back in the Orcs & Humans era of the mid-nineties, I did have a pretty good time. It's dumb, it doesn't make a lot of sense, and it feels like there are tonnes of connective tissue cut out from between scenes of ""cool stuff"". But there is a certain dedication to the format I admire, and the animation was (on occasion) pretty damned impressive. I don't know that this will be one for the movie going audience at large, but for fans of the video game, and for devotees of the Fantasy genre looking for some new blood, I can give Warcraft a soft recommendation as a not-bad-first-step.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Film that was promised,"Great film although it's not lotr but i wish they had the feeling of elevating into a new realm as lotr did, but it's okay since this movie covers the basic story, i hope we see a sequel,the story gets more into the lore as it proceed. The lotr used to take us to that place where we live the moment in middle earth the music the story the feeling, i hope they make the same essence because feelings are universal, any how i consider this film a substitute to the hobbit that failed a bit comparing to lotr but this film brings a promise that the journey begins not ends. My last comment is that warcraft really reflects many things happening in the real world, you could easily compare orcs to Muslims and demon orcs the ISIS who fell under the magic of gull'Dan and the good orcs tries to make amends, i know it seems silly to thinks that way but I'm being honest and that's what i felt and that's why i loved the movie more yet so many things other than the example i gave reflects real things happening in our time. Anyhow this movie sure could use a bit a good setting some things straight specially if're a warcraft fan such is myself, this had became my new lotr series, good job for Jones and the cast",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Warcraft is worth watching for the humans versus Orc fights alone, but the overuse of CGI prevents this film from reaching greatness. It needed to be more like Hellboy.","My daughter and I recently watched Warcraft (2016) on Netflix. The storyline follows the Orcs, who have a wizard that unlocks a portal to the human world. The Orcs begin forming colonies in the human world and plan to take over. The humans have their own magician who will help them defend against the Orc invasion.This film is directed by Duncan Jones (Mute) and stars Travis Fimmel (Vikings), Paula Patton (Precious), Ben Foster (3:10 to Yuma), Dominic Cooper (Captain America: The First Avenger), Ruth Negga (Agents of S. H. I. E. L. D.), and Clancy Brown (The Shawshank Redemption).This movie is always an uneven viewing experience for me. I really enjoyed the costumes, backdrops, and think the CGI for the Orcs looks so cool. This actually reminds me of the first couple of Hulk movies in many ways. The fight scenes are entertaining but at times overdone with excessive CGI. The storyline is also pretty good, but the magic and portal scenes are overdone at times and too convenient. The resolution is predictable but makes the journey worthwhile.In conclusion, Warcraft is worth watching for the humans versus Orc fights alone, but the overuse of CGI prevents this film from reaching greatness. It needed to be more like Hellboy. I would score this a 5.5-6/10 and recommend it to fantasy enthusiasts.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Solid, entertaining movie","I saw this movie back when it was in theatres, and watched it again recently. And there's a lot to like about this one! The acting is pretty good, the effects are done well, the story and characters are interesting. The action is done well too - action scenes are choreographed well, and they're used appropriately - they fit with the pacing, they're not unnecessarily long, etc.If you're a fan of the games, there are also lots of fun little call-outs you'll enjoy. But you don't have to have played to enjoy the movie - my dad watched it with us, and he hates video games and doesn't usually watch fantasy stuff, but he really enjoyed it and wishes they made a sequel (as do I).My biggest criticism is the pacing is a bit off in the beginning; it jumped around a lot unnecessarily and you could tell there was a lot of interesting background info that was skimmed over. That setup probably could've done better.But on balance, this was an entertaining and interesting movie, well worth a watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Definitely for the WoW Player / Fan,"Where do I begin? I have never played WoW & I believe fans of the game will quite enjoy this film. The Orcs looked really cool & I liked the main orc character, but coming into this with no understanding of the world or characters I was mostly lost. The problem with introducing so much in so little time is that everything falls a little flat. The characters don't develop strong enough to care for them and you get a sense there is something really great going on, I'm just not seeing it. I believe this might have worked better as a 10 episode series and then a feature film, especially in today's media universe where detail and development are key to engaging the audience. I can't imagine the film did anything to expand the audience. I will say many of the sets, costumes and cinematography is nice, but a little too computer graphics generated to help make the environment more believable. Had I produced this film, I would focused the story down to the main orc, made it a smaller story in a larger universe, like A New Hope, and used more real constructed sets and less CGI, much like what Star Wars is now doing. I am sure there will be more to come, so my best advice is to find someone else at the helm, but I will check out the next one and see how it grows.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not as bad as critics are saying,"Based of one of the most popular video games of all time,'Warcraft' tells the tale of orcs and humans fighting for their world. The orcs world is dying and one big bad orc opens a portal to the human world where they can rebuild. Except, they don't want to coexist with the humans. They begin destroying towns and taking slaves. Naturally the other people inhabiting this place aren't very happy about this, and they fight back. Now, I have never played the game and am not really a fan of Blizzard games. Even though I have never played the games I feel like this movie was one for the fans. (Even though most of those fans say this isn't like the actual story.)As I watched, there were many obvious things that were fan service that I didn't get. But when these things popped up they never really stayed for to long. I was happy that the film was actually trying to be a movie instead just fan service. That being said, this is a film that many people who haven't played the games will be frustrated with.It never goes into much detail about, really anything. Very few things are explained or spoon feed to the audience. While I appreciate when a film does this, this one didn't really know what it should and shouldn't explain. There are many things that, because I am not a fan of the game, didn't make sense. This is unfortunate because a film shouldn't be dependent on the thing that it's based off.You shouldn't have to read books or play games in order to get what is going on. This is the main problem with the film. There are far to many things that are left too vague. I shouldn't have to go through an extraneous process to get why a character is doing the thing that they are doing. I really had no idea who these people were and the film didn't do anything to show me who that person is.Even after two hours with these characters I was no closer to knowing them. Not a single one had any personality other than the motive that drove them. Not knowing or caring about the characters made the middle portion of the film very tedious. It cut between almost every main characters backstory back to back in the most sloppy way possible.It would show us a boring scene between two or three bland characters chatting about who knows what only to be cut off by a terrible transition. This happens nine or ten times. It seemed like the film knew it's characters sucked so it just jammed extraneous nothing into the middle and hoped you didn't notice. It made the 2nd act of the film so incredibly boring and tedious to site through.If you were to pull the majority of the second act from the film you would actually have a pretty good fantasy flick. For a movie that is being panned by critics it does a lot right. Most notably thanks to Duncan Jones and his direction. Because holy crap is this film pretty to look at. What I loved about it was despite the large use of CG It never felt out of place.This is mainly a product from having the majority of the sets be practical. Being in an environment rather than in front of a green screen seriously helps you believe that it really exists. But a lush world would be nothing without stirring music to capture the feel of the environment. And it does that very very well.This is made even better by the great cinematography. Watching as the camera navigates between giant book shelves or take on perspective shots is pretty cool to see. Doing this shows a level of grace and maturity that you don't see from many other directors today. It showed that Jones really cared about what he was doing and the effort put into every shot makes that sing true.Is it a perfect movie? No. But is it the disaster most critics are calling it? Of course not. The level of effort put into the technical aspect is unmistakable. It's very well directed and offers some really stunning visuals that your eyes can feast on. That being said, its story is pretty messy. It's uneven, poorly edited, and overstuffed. It tried to cram so much content in the film that it was impossible to really get involved in what was happening. If you're a fan definitely go see this but if not, it's probably best to stay away.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
First game adaptation that convinced me to play the game.,"In my opinion this movie is fantastic. Why then you should go and watch it? CGI, I'm usually not a big fan of CGI, but this movie has best CGI since Planet of the Apes or Avatar. Apart from that there are two reasons to watch Warcraft. First of all, is to prove to the critics that they are wrong. Believe me, it gives a lot of satisfaction. Second thing is box office. Maybe this movie deserve good box office, or maybe not, but if you want see more movies like Warcraft or more fantasy movies, or game adaptations with big budget then is necessary to support this movie. Only good box office will show to the producers that is worth to reach for more games or fantasy books and put them on the big screen. More than that, Warcraft is simply worth your money. I love Warcraft, and I never played the game. I've already seen it 8 times in cinema, and I want more that kind of movies, and how about You? Ask yourself and then go to the cinema and watch this movie or stay at home. The choice is yours.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sensible review from a movie-lover and long time wow-player,"Once you've plowed through all the tens and zeros fans and haters brand on frankly any movie these days, you might be looking for a sensible review if you haven't thrown your arms in the air yet by now.Well, let me make an attempt. As a movie, Warcraft fails on a few levels. As a fanpiece there's enough there to make you smile and enjoy the world you're already very familiar with...except there where the lore takes off in a direction I can't for the life of me remember happening that way.The movie suffers somewhat from an all too familiar ailment when making these epic multi-character stories. Not enough investment in the characters leads to you not caring for them at all. The story centers largely around Lothar, Garona, Khadgar and Durotan. Now for people who are familiar with Warcraft lore, there's not a lot to fill in for you. You know these characters and what their feats have been, you have already an emotional investment in them even before the movie started. For people who are not familiar with them however, the movie largely fails to deliver on that front. I went to see with a friend, who is not familiar with the universe, and at the end he admitted not caring for any of the characters in the movie. There is no real exposition of who these characters are and what they believe in, except maybe for Durotan, who gets a little more color. They were also looking for a female lead and I guess Garona was it, for lack of any other alternative. She gets a bit pasted onto the story, and gets more screen-time than her character actually deserves story-wise. Good stories are either plot driven or character driven. It becomes a bit of a mess if the story can't really decide which one it wants to be, which is the case in Warcraft. It tries to tell us who these character are, but we don't get deep enough into any of them for them to drive the movie; and the plot is not really all that impressive either, there is no intrigue or suspense, just a lot of clobbering, the occasional spellcast and a bit of character parading. Stories are driven, because they should literally move you emotionally from one place to another, be it through a fear, an anticipation, through experiencing a characters emotional change, etc. None of that was present in Warcraft.The acting is not very good. In fact the acting of the cgi orcs was far better than most human performances. The human side lacked a bit of presence, while the orcs are quite impressive. Travis and Paula do what they can with the little they have. Again due to a lack of character development, which even a romantic nudge between the two and the storyline with Anduins son can't help, they remain very two-dimensional. Seasoned actors will often fill that void themselves with what they believe should be the character, but that's not a given when working with a fairly young cast. I've seen better performances from most these actors in other movies.The music is one of the better things in the movie, from Game of Thrones composer Ramin Djawadi. The score definitely felt Warcraft. The cinematography is not bad, and manages in this cgi heavy setting to deliver some awesome pictures. Fans will smile at accurate depictions of familiar settings...even flightpoints in Stormwind.Overall, this is a fanfilm. You'll enjoy the familiarity of it's settings and you'll fill in the blanks with your own knowledge and in the end you'll find it OK. For movie-lovers without any warcraft knowledge however, this movie will not entice you at all.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fine Fantasy movie,"WarCraft : The Beginning is the newest movie from Duncan Jones, the son of David Bowie. It's something totally different from what he done before. Is this worth to watch?If you are a WarCraft or Fantasy Fan! YES YES ABSOLUTELY YES! Even tho the movie has some flaws here and there, it's an absolute roller- coaster and fun movie. It doesn't get you bored.As said before, some lines are cringy or cheesy but it delivers the job. Especially on the Humans side. However on the Orc side it blows you away and you actually start caring about the chars.The movie has a sickton of references to the games, so if you are a warcraft nerd. You will enjoy it.Imho, ignore the critics just sit-down relax and engulf yourself in the World of Warcraft.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Over-ambitious and flawed,"Orcs and humans try to find common ground, both on and off the battlefield, in this sweeping, large-scale attempt to bring Blizzard's best-selling video game to the big screen. The thing I appreciate most about this effort is its even-handedness. Unlike Lord of the Rings before it, there's an admirable amount of grey-shading on each side of the struggle and a very small number of either irredeemable or infallible characters. The menacing orcs, towering and tusk-mouthed, worry about their children and maintain honorable traditions within their own ranks. Their human counterparts show trepidation and uncertainty, nearly coming to blows as they debate their defense strategy behind closed doors. This makes the simmering war feel more two-sided and honest; no faceless horde of pitch-black bad guys here. Unfortunately, that meditative tone never allows the plot to gain much steam amidst so much pontification. It's overstuffed with characters, bearing complicated names that might be familiar to fans but only blur together for the uninitiated. There's probably enough room for three or four really good character arcs, but instead the narration hops around to cover more than a dozen. The acting is stiff and wooden, whether provided by flesh-and-blood humans or fully-CG orcs, which probably has a lot to do with the abundance of stilted dialog. In a lot of ways, it feels like the first disc of a Playstation-era RPG. A whole lot of setup and world-building, a few mini-bosses and a surprise death or three; maybe a good teaser to keep us on the hook for the next chapter, but only the earliest hint of a resolution. Over-ambitious and flawed, it's an effective CG showpiece but far too slow, wordy and self-important for its own good.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I never played the games but,"I really loved this movie.I've never liked the whole Orc Fantasy scenario. It always felt off putting so I never touched any of the games this movie was based on either.However for this movie what really made it for me were the Orcs. They look strong, fearsome, violent yet they were able to convey emotions such as sadness, love and compassion too. You normally don't expect that from such scary looking things.The cast is great as well, Travis Fimmel was a great choice as the main Character, and the rest too, I think.Anyways I honestly cant wait for a sequel and hope it gets here soon, preferably from the same director as he did a really great job here.I hope this review helped you, excuse me now, this movie has made me want to buy n play the Warcraft games.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Visually striking fantasy adventure sadly lacks the characters and narrative to be compelling,"Following the success of his two science-fiction thrillers 'Moon' and 'Source Code', Duncan Jones has entered the realm of overabundant CGI ignited with motion capture technology; and this world happens to be a cinematic adaptation of the massively popular MMORPG (a.k.a Massive Multiplayer Online Role-playing Game) 'World of Warcraft', a game that lured in thousands upon thousands of players in a high class fantasy world through online social interaction and immersive gameplay. For many curious moviegoers and fans of the game, the question is does Duncan Jones effectively translate the popular source material to the screen, not exactly. In fact, the only aspect keeping this fantasy adventure from being a soulless disaster is the eye-dazzling CGI that brings the mythical world of life in a stunning visual treat, everything else from the characterization and the plot development is a bit of a slog. So what is this film about? It follows the story of a world called Azeroth that segregates mysterious creatures known as Orcs and humans. When a King Llane Wrynn (played by Dominic Cooper) of the human species and his brother-in-law Anduin Luther (played by Travis Fimmil) learn about a portal between the two realms is opened up by Orc warlock named Gul'Dan (played by (played by Daniel Wu) which leads to an attack against their realm by Orc warrior Duraton (played by Toby Kebbell), the two divided species engage in an all-out war, while each species questions the loyalties of their comrades.This film adaptation of the online computer game of the same name appears to going for another 'Lords of The Rings' knockoff, but without the substance and spirit uprooted from J.R.R Tolkien's source material. Furthermore, this fantasy action vehicle ends up being nowhere near the exciting fantasy spectacle its intended to be. Though it shines beautifully the visual effects department with the use of motion technology and CGI that supplements both the mythical Orc creatures and the magical world of Azeroth into a visually stunning paradise, the film squanders its source material on the charmless, unsatisfying adventure with a sorely inept script. The film proceeds with a premise of an escalating rivalry between the Orcs and the humans that eventually boils up when Gul'Dan, an Orc warlord opens up a portal to blast open the boundaries between these nations, but before long the plot ceases to make sense. The story hits us with so many twists and turns, it turns the plot into a complete jumbled mess; and the lack of any interesting characters certainly don't do it much justice. Throughout the picture, we are introduced to cookie-cutter characters who are so underdeveloped its difficult to even remember their names, except for those who are avid fans of the game franchise. And to make matters worse, the performances by the cast aren't very compelling either. Though the hack-and-slash battle sequences are somewhat exciting in style of execution and cinematography by Simon Duggan, particularly the over-head shot of the character flying down on the back of an eagle; there isn't a whole lot of charm to be delivered here.Warcraft is sad fantasy adventure wastes its potential on an unfortunate lack of compelling characters and narrative, though not without a little excitement from the tasty action set pieces. For those who are fans of the game series, there may be some silver lining to be found beneath the poor writing especially as fans are likely more familiar with the source material. Everyone else are most likely in for a disappointment, if not a disaster.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Fan-thought: GREAT! Non-fan thought: Okay.,"As a Warcraft fan... I loved it! It had everything, from the way lore plays out, despite changes to the original, it kept the important key moments of it, all the way to Easter eggs. I couldn't be more satisfied and wanting a extended edition or even a sequel soon. It deserves 8-9/10.As a non-Warcraft fan... I can see where the problems were, but even that didn't deserve 1-3/10 rating it's getting on Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes, that's just bias opinion from upper-class snobs, bribed assholes or even people who are determined to have the mindset of ""game movies are inherently bad"" forever. The problems come from one regrettable fact: Movie was cut down way too much! It should've been at least 30min longer, or be the original 3 hours length, like LotR was; because you notice that there's some very abrupt cuts happening and there are missing scenes we've seen in the trailers or even SDCC leaks. That's why certain characters feel the certain lack of depth and/or character development and that's where the movie suffers greatly.So I'm a bit split on this matter; on one hand you see almost all the chieftain/warlords in the movie together (apart from Ner'zhul for obvious reasons), yet they have no speaking lines, but on the other hand, it avoided the cluster-problem the Hobbit had, where 13 dwarfs only had 4 dwarfs that really mattered, while others where there for comic relief or for just being there because the adaptation demanded.All in all it was still enjoyable to watch, so it deserves a 6/10 at least, and I would go watch it again simply because it looks amazing.I just hope that Duncan is able to release the Directors cut so we can finally see the movie in FULL SPLENDOR!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Shallow and underdeveloped,"The movie tries hard to cram as much game lore as possible into its runtime, likely aiming to please dedicated fans. However, this approach leaves everything feeling shallow and underdeveloped, making it difficult for casual viewers to engage with the story. The lack of depth is further compounded by the artificiality of the digital effects and the weak, unconvincing relationships between the characters, which make the film feel flat and uninspired. That said, it does deserve credit for a few surprising twists that genuinely caught me off guard, adding some excitement to an otherwise lackluster experience.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mediocre,"I am a hardcore Warcraft fan, my first RTS game was in fact Warcraft Orcs and Humans that i bought in my first visit to the US in 1998, followed by Warcraft 2 and all the other Warcraft games (including World of Warcraft), so this review is coming from someone who knows and appreciates the Warcraft world and lore.Now, i am not going to spoil anything nor am i going to bash the movie for going with something new (outside of the original lore, something you can see just by watching the trailers) i am going to speak of what i felt and experienced while watching the movie yesterday.The CGI and the effects were the pinnacle of the movie, never has magic been so well executed on screen, it was fantastic and at the same time not unrealistic at the point you could not accept its existence. The Orcs were very well done (except for Durotan, in my opinion, who was ""humanized"" too much) and you could actually believe they could be in the same frame as human actors.Unfortunately, taking aside what i just said in this review, the rest of the movie is very disappointing to say the least. The story goes so fast that it created a long list of cons. The first one is that i could not feel immersed in the movie, it felt that everything was going so fast with the plot that i never felt like i was captivated by it, everything felt so forced because it had to happen so fast. You know you are not immersed in a movie when you are aware and concerned while watching it of how late it is or how long has it been going for. Like for an instance, in the latest Captain America movie i was so connected to what was going on screen that i disconnected myself from reality during that time, i did not care how late it was or the time i would get home, all i cared about was the movie. The Warcraft movie never had that effect on me.Another flaw caused by how fast they advance the plot is that i could not feel connected or found myself caring about the characters. Their dilemmas, their problems, their hopes, their victories, it meant nothing to me. The characters have little to no background and become like fictional distant people who you can't care enough about what happens to them. Like when Gandalf falls in Moria at the first LOTR movie, i actually felt sorry for him and his friends, when Aragorn picked them up and the sadness was palpable. In Warcraft i couldn't care less about who lives or dies, you just don't get to know the characters well enough to care for them.Last but not least, i found the acting on some characters to be very poorly executed. For an instance, the Lothar character, i felt like i was watching Ragnar Lodbrok if he had been born in Azeroth. The actor acted exactly like he does on vikings and i, personally, don't feel that Lothar and Ragnar have the same type of character or act the same way. The other characters felt like they were gray, they had little to no personality. The ones that escape from that are Khadgar, Durotan, Draka, Gul'dan, Ogrim and Blackhand. The rest of the characters (and there are a lot of them, believe me), are all sub par, with mediocre acting at best.In conclusion, the movie have awesome CGI and it does a great job translating the magic and fantasy from the game to the screen but it does a terrible and awful job in telling the story, you feel like they did a 2 hour film containing 8 hours worth of information, like you are watching a movie been played with fast forward, with no room for character or plot development.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great movie,"Hi all, first off I'm a big Warcraft lore fan. With that being said i was doubting if the movie would honor the lore...Well, it did and it was an awesome movie. Good pacing, good story, awesome cgi. Just a few things changed lore wise like certain spell won't be in effect.The set was amazing time over time again. It was great to recognize many thing of the different games Blizzard has released. Like the winks to the players. Outfits and weapons were mind blowing!I can't judge how the movie will be for non-Warcraft fans. I think they explained enough ongoing in the movie to make it a solid story.Can't wait for the sequel!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This is the movie base on game that we waiting for,"From where to start?Everything in this movie is perfect, the characters, the cgi, the story. I am really surprise that this movie actually succeed.I was so skeptical when they announce this movie in first place, even when i saw the first trailer, but in the end everything that i was expecting from this movie base on this legendary games happen. Pure masterpiece, we have so many failures in a past but this one is not on of them.Thank you Blizzard that you give us this movie, i hope that we will have 2nd and 3rd part, because Warcraft universe is huge and has so much potential to became one successful franchise.And for the end, this is not World of Warcraft, this is Warcraft movie base on the game release in 1994, Orcs vs Humans.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The War is Just Beginning,"Flushed with astounding CGI and epic scale fights, Warcraft is the next big blockbuster of 2016 that will wow viewers with its flare. Unfortunately, its messy plot and questionable character choices drown what could have been the next great Fantasy flick.Initially the largely CGI/green screen world building had me hesitant after seeing 2014's Hobbit installment, but that's not at all the problem here. The motion capture of the orcs and colorful landscapes that director Duncan Jones displays may very well be the best thing about Warcraft. The story centers around the orcs arrival in a human world and the inability for the two to coexist. Surprisingly, I found myself more emotionally connected to the orcs, and in particular, Durotan.Toby Kebbell isn't new to mo-cap. He burst onto the scene in 2014 as Koba in Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, and his performance in Warcraft proved to be just as impressive. Durotan is one of the few orcs who saw the need for the humans and orcs to work together against the all too powerful, Gul'dan. His arc didn't necessarily go the route I had hoped, but it was the part of the film I felt most invested with.On the other side of things, the humans, led by King Wrynn (Dominic Cooper) and Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel) were far less interesting. Not only is not enough time taken to explore the depths of each of the main humans, but the story is taken in a frustratingly predictable route. In order for me to feel the weight of an emotional scene, there has to be enough character depth set up, Warcraft fails to do that on numerous occasions.What Warcraft does have going for it is promise. While I wasn't all that invested in the story they were trying to tell, I see potential for future films taking a more daring approach to the battle between orcs and humans. Shave off the confusing lore of Warcraft that seemed shoved into the first act and balance mind-blowing action with intriguing character drama. Even if this wasn't Duncan Jones at his best, I believe there was a good film here somewhere. There seemed to be quite a few missing scenes or background information that could have been helpful with a longer cut. Hopefully, that cut will see the light of day.+Great CGI+Kebbell's mo-cap performance-Didn't feel emotionally invested-Missing scenes and confusing lore make for a messy-feeling plot-Could have been more daring, less derivative5.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
