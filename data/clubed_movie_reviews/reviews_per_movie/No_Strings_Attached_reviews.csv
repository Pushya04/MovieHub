"This is yet another romantic comedy with a cookie-cutter plot, but it will make you laugh!","I had very low expectations for No Strings Attached. The couple would make the decision to use each, one would fall for the other, and in the end they would live happily ever after. I was correct about the overall story line, but, impressively, the writers found a way the mix in enough comedy to keep you entertained for the full 110 minutes. On top of that, there is enough cutsie romance to make for the perfect date night movie. Comedy to make you laugh and romance to cheer up any romantic girl.... sounds like a romantic comedy to me!Natalie Portman shows her range of acting abilities by having two extremely different films in theaters at the same time. I was thoroughly impressed with her ability to drop the comedic one liners and portray a unaffectionate woman who's fallen in love realistically. Comparing this to her award-winning role in Black Swan made her abilities even more impressive. I cannot say the same for Ashton Kutcher. He has a great face and is great at comedic acting. However, each serious, romantic scene he was in became unrealistic and uncomfortable.Overall, this is the perfect date night or girls night movie. It has some great comedic moments and brings in the romance that most ladies love to see. If you are looking for a light-hearted romantic comedy, this is a great choice.See more reviews at http://burningreview.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
a raunchy rom-com from the female perspective = interesting,"What is most fascinating about this movie is that it's a raunchy rom-com from the female perspective. Knowing that the film was written by a woman prior to my viewing it made the nuances jump out to me. It's those nuances and that perspective that make the film enjoyable. No one scene or moment merits more then a minor chuckle but the characters themselves expand and grow as the story unfolds. It's hard to care about the leads at first because there's no set up or real establishment of character. Then, they kind of grow on you even though neither really rang true for me in any real world sense. Natalie Portman is great as many would expect but Ashton Kutcher did a fine job as well. I've seen others criticizing his performance but I think that's based on a pre-determined hatred of him rather than on his work. The supporting characters were VERY weak and useless save for the father character played by the wonderful Kevin Kline. Overall, better than I was expecting it to be.",,Anonymous,Romance
A very funny chick-flick that both men and women will enjoy.  Nothing new but still very entertaining. I say B+,"Can you really ever be just ""friends with benefits""? After a drunken adventure ends with Adam (Kutcher) naked on Emma's (Portman) couch they decide to strike a deal. When Adam wants something more the problems begin. This is a chick flick that many guys will also enjoy. A little more girlie then I was expecting, but still a really, really funny movie. The movie is pretty raunchy in some parts and you will find it difficult not to laugh. If you are looking for a chick flick that your boyfriend/husband will watch with you this is a great choice. If you are looking for a movie for your girlfriend/wife that will not be two hours of torture for you this is a great choice. Very, very funny for both sexes, enough romance for the ladies, and enough comedy for the men. A perfect movie for date night. A little predictable, but most romantic comedies are. I give it a B+.Would I watch again? - I actually would.*Also try - Going The Distance & Love And Other Drugs",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
A Good Movie! Natalie Portman was GREAT!,"OK... i was NOT expecting much from this movie but i was really WOW at the end!!!Yes, the movie was alright for some but I LOVED IT!!! As a Natalie Portman FAN, i was really worried about her doing a full-on Comedy role... from her past films like Leon and the Star Wars movies (Her role: Padme Amidala has a SAD ending...) Closer, V for Vendetta, Brothers... her roles from these movies were sad and sweet and her recent film Black Swan - she was super-powerful and gave an Oscar Winning role as Nina!!! I was so happy after watching No Strings Attached - Natalie Portman was super, super FUNNY - she did an amazing job!!! There are scenes where Natalie Portman is over-the-top - but i think she was great... the amount of ''BAD WORDS'' in the movie is WOW... loads of it!!!The movie overall was good - Ashton Kutcher was alright & funny..... did an OK/ good job! The side-actors were average and the soundtracks were good...Anyways, No Strings Attached is a must-watch movie!My review: 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Cute!,"I gave this movie an 8/10 simply because it will keep you laughing the majority of the time. Sure the ending is predictable and a few of the background actors deliver lackluster performances but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher fit very nicely together as the main characters, you could really tell they had fun working together.I see a lot of other reviews criticizing Portman for ""stooping to this level"" and I'm not too sure why, maybe they didn't go see it in the right frame of mind...this movie is what it is, a romantic comedy about two friends who decide to take their relationship to the next level without having any of the commitments and ""duties"" of being an actual couple, that's what the trailers showed it as, that's what the actors described it as, nothing was a surprise...she did a cute, funny romantic comedy, it's not like she dove head first into the adult film industry.Will this movie be nominated for awards, probably, will it win, probably not, but overall it was cute, it was funny, and I left the theater feeling like the $10 I paid for a ticket was well worth it.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Silly and Incoherent Plot, but Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher Make the Film Worth","Fifteen years ago, Adam Franklin (Ashton Kutcher) and Emma Kurtzman (Natalie Portman) meet each other in a colony and every now and then they stumble on each other.In the present days, Emma is an MIT graduated doctor and Adam is the stage assistant of a TV musical show and aspirant screenplay writer. When Adam visits his father Alvin (Kevin Kline), who is a successful TV producer, and finds that his ex-girlfriend Vanessa (Ophelia Lovibond) has moved to Alvin's house and is dating him, he gets totally drunk and calls every girl in his cell phone's contact list. On the next morning, he wakes up at Emma's apartment and they have quick sex. Emma does not want to have any emotional involvement and proposes a relationship driven by sex only without romance or commitment. But love is not possible to be rationalized and the couple is affected by their behavior.""No Strings Attached"" is a romantic comedy with a silly and incoherent plot since the motives for the behavior of Emma are not well developed and she becomes an inconsistent lead character. The story is visibly inspired on the adorable ""When Harry Met Sally"", with elements of Glee and spiced with sex.However, the film is cute and the chemistry between the lovely Natalie Portman and the pleasant Ashton Kutcher make the film worth. I believe that a high percentage of viewers love Natalie Portman and it is a pleasure to see this talented actress in any movie.Kevin Kline has a small part but is also hilarious. This is the first time that I pay attention in Lake Bell and she is really a beautiful woman performing the role of a clumsy and nerd character. However several support characters are neither funny nor interesting. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Sexo Sem Compromisso"" (""Sex Without Commitment"")",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Its enjoyable, may not be great but it was good enough","Don't let the""7""fool you, its still a good rating coming from me.OK so this movie is a very well...its about friendship taken to a whole new level, and if you saw the trailers it asks you""can best friends be sex-friends?"" The movie itself does answer that question with one of those""You have to watch it to understand movie"" the story does have a few silly remarks but its moving for me, i never really understood people who do, do the things that Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher do in this movie but it doesn't matter it shows us the true meaning of friends and love!yes this movie has some eh moments of funny,sex, and dialogue. does that matter? not really! its a well made movie, it touched my heart!Its a great date movie, and might settle to be a good buddy comedy.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"A weak, weak light comedy with a wasted Portman in the lead role","No Strings Attached (2011)You expect more than you're going to get here. There are two strong leads, Natalie Portman at her finest relaxed self (seeming) and Ashton Kutcher in a slightly amusing, self-deprecating mode that is a little dulling but fits his part. But there isn't the necessary conflict here to make their attraction take on fire. They drift together, they push apart, they find each other again, and so on, all mildly engaging and a bit sleepy.And don't expect much from Kevin Kline, either, mostly because his part is small and a bit canned, a caricature dad with too much to prove. The rest of the cast is frankly just functional, and you start to look harder at why the movie fizzles with so much apparent talent, especially Portman. And the only real answer is the director, who is more a producer at heart, Ivan Reitman. You can't fault the success of some of his movies, but it's an uneven bunch, from ""Ghostbusters"" to ""Kindergarden Cop."" Something lacks energy and imagination here, and the writing stretched a bit.Enjoyable? Somewhat. Be warned, it's not funny, romantic, or energized enough to quite make it on any score.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Lacklustre,"This film is about two sex friends who, slowly but surely, develop feelings for each other.Considering the cast and the big budget, ""No Strings Attached"" is very disappointing. The two leads are very attractive, but they have little chemistry with each other. Maybe it's to do with the nature of their initial relationship, they do not have any sparks with each other, and hence their subsequent feelings seem so forced and unrealistic. There is little comedy either, the whole plot is plainly delivered. With nothing much to laugh about, no romance to savour, ""No Strings Attached"" becomes a lacklustre bore.",,Anonymous,Romance
No Strings Attached Review,"This movie is far more better than you might think! It's not just sex, sex, sex! It's actually fairly good! The is mostly about two friends; two sex friends. Ashton Kutcher's character is a down to earth guy, and Nataile Portman's character is basically a crazy chick. He wants to start a relationship with her, but she put's out that she is two busy to have one and she's not good at having relationships. So they basically become sex friends.It's not a typical Hollywood romantic/comedy! It goes a little off ""Formula"", if you know what I mean. Some of the plot is a little awkward and dumb, but overall a ""Ok"" movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Better than you might think,"I saw this film in a theater while on vacation. I think we saw another movie after this one, so there was a choice. Now, I love Natalie Portman but I don't love every movie she ever made. I hate Ashton Kutcher, but I don't hate every movie he ever made. That said, I thought this movie was watchable and somewhat amusing. I saw it later on TV and nothing changed my mind. There are some really good comedy moments, some really goofy moments, and some really cringe-worthy dialog. No spoilers there. The cast is terrific, even Kutcher did a decent job; Lake Bell can be hilarious. I believe any short-comings (and there are a few) are the result of the script and not the cast. So if you're not someone who absolutely hates rom-coms (and if you are you have no business watching this move or reviewing it - you've been warned) than there is a good chance you will find some things to like. That's about the best you or the movie can hope for.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
No acting attached,"The American Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences should give their awards conditionally. If you receive an Academy Award for best actor/actress, and then demean it by acting poorly in a subsequent film, you should forfeit the award. This is akin to behaving in a manner unbecoming a professional. Now, I wasn't a big fan of Black Swan, but I did think Natalie Portman deserved the Best Actress award. After watching No Strings Attached, I wonder if I, and others, had been fooled. Admittedly, she didn't have much of a script to work with here in No Strings. At best, her character was two dimensional. But then, she was one of the producers. You'd think she would have been able to tell a flawed script when she saw one.Like most romantic comedies, you know the ending from the first scene in the movie. This, however, does not mean the film or script is necessarily bad. After all, you know the salesman will die before you even watch Death of a Salesman. It's how you get to that ending that has to be interesting. And in No Strings Attached, that journey is tedious.Ashton Kutcher, rapidly evolving into the Hugh Grant of American romcoms, plays his usual sensitive, cute but naughty puppy dog role. He basically serves as the eye candy for the female viewers. This is too bad because, as we saw in The Butterfly Effect, he does have talent. Both he and Portman's character lack depth and we can't help but wonder what he sees in her that's so special. No chemistry exists between them or any of the other actors in this film. So there is no romance in this romantic comedy and, what comedy there is, is sophomoric. I am sure that a few 13-year-olds were rolling in the aisles, but that might just be from eating a bad hot dog, which would certainly have been more enjoyable.I heard that Portman wanted this movie to be the female answer to The Hangover. Personally, I'd prefer a five alarm hangover to watching this movie again.",3.0,Anonymous,Romance
How RomComs should be done!,"Let me start by saying that I wanted to watch this movie again immediately after it ended.Not only is there a plethora of one-liners that we will relive with our friends for years to come (think of the timeless quips from Super Troopers, Anchorman, and The Hangover), but also a deep story line. Normally, that would turn me off, I like my comedies to be funny and I don't wanna think about too much. But the characters are so entrancing and relatable that you want to know the back stories, you care about these people and their relationship, you live their feelings and don't mind. The story was different than I had expected from seeing previews and at first I was apprehensive. Apart from a couple intimate scenes, I did not revisit this feeling after getting pulled in.The Soundtrack completely rocked, including an awesome rendition of ""99 Problems"" by Hugo, and old school favorites, like ""Bleeding Love"" which get's a great scene with Natalie Portman that will have you crying through your laughter and feeling right along with her. On that note, ALL of the characters are really engaging, you want to be friends with all of these people, and the parts are played SO well! Even the bits.Overall, this was just an amazing experience. I love this movie, will own it, and buy it again of I lose it.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Very predictable, reasonably enjoyable","It is what it is. No Strings Attached is another formulaic romantic comedy. OK, there's a bit of a twist in this one in that the couple doesn't actually want any romance. They skip the love and go straight to the sex, no strings attached indeed. There will be no feelings involved. Wham bam thank you ma'am. Same time tomorrow? But golly gee, these two just might start developing feelings for one another after all. Who ever could have foreseen that? There's a sense of inevitability about this movie from the very first minute. You know where it's headed. The movie may be on a journey to an obvious destination but at least it does a reasonably decent job of entertaining you along the way.Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman play the couple in question, Adam and Emma. Kutcher is never likely to win any major acting awards but he is serviceable in fare such as this. He's just a big lug, endearing enough. And it's important here that he be endearing because in this movie it's obvious from the start that it's his Adam, not Portman's Emma, who is more open to the idea of love. You need to feel for Adam as he goes through the movie's tried and true romantic comedy formula ups and downs. Kutcher pulls off what is required of him. Portman meanwhile shows off a different side. After the dark, ultra-serious Black Swan it's nice to see her able to just cut loose and have some fun. This movie is certainly not uproariously hilarious but it has its funny moments and Portman plays her part, showing some comic chops. And of course she shows her vulnerability too because the rom-com formula demands it.The arc of their respective careers has shown Portman to be clearly the more talented of the two leads in this movie. But Kutcher holds his own, he and Portman make a good match. The chemistry isn't perfect, the sparks never really fly. The movie tries to be raunchy at times but never really commits to it, ultimately the whole thing is a bit tame. No cinematic masterpiece to be sure but there are enough good moments to carry the film to respectability. All in all it's pretty good fun. The very simple story is spiced up a bit by some interesting supporting characters. Kevin Kline is a hoot as Adam's dad, a total cad. Lake Bell draws some laughs as an incredibly socially awkward woman who pines for Adam. Greta Gerwig, Mindy Kaling and Chris Bridges (yes, 'Ludacris') are among the others who wander in and out of the movie to provide a laugh or two. There's also a largely unrecognizable Cary Elwes who sadly gets absolutely nothing to do, a bit of a waste his casting was. Of course, as with all movies of this genre, the whole thing really rests on the shoulders of the lead couple. It's their movie. And Kutcher and Portman do enough to both entertain you and actually make you care about their characters. No Strings Attached is not a movie that rises above its genre, it doesn't stand out in any meaningful way. But for what it is it's not half bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Decent Flick....,"Ivan Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' is a decent romantic-comedy, laced with charming performances by it's lead cast. Even the freshness attached to it, comes up as a sorta relief.'No Strings Attached' stars Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher, as two friends who end up having sex one morning and begin to worry about their friendship being ruined. They then make a pact to have a 'No Strings Attached' relationship, that, to have casual sex without falling in love with each other.The idea is fresh, and the writing in the first hour, especially, is interesting & enjoyable. But, like every other romantic-comedy, the second hour suffers from the usual clichés. However, the freshness in the first-hour doesn't let it's impact go a miss completely. Ivan Reitman's direction is fine. Cinematography is good. Editing is fair.Performance-Wise: Portman & Kutcher, both, are equally charming. Portman gets it right from the very beginning, and doesn't fail to impress, yet again. Kutcher, like always, gets his timing spot-on. In the supporting cast, Kevin Kline gets very limited scope. He deserved more footage. Greta Gerwig is alright. Lake Bell is extremely natural. Cary Elwes is hardly there.On the whole, 'No Strings Attached' is a decent watch.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing Attached!,"""No Strings Attached"" poses the question: Is it possible to have sex with someone without risking that you could fall in love with them? The answer is YES. It also poses the question: Is it possible to make a clichéd and hackneyed film that smells like ass? The answer is YES.A bland and dated mainstream romantic comedy, which attempts to give itself an edge through raunchy humor and language and situational comedy right from the 80's. Kutcher and Portman have no chemistry. That lack of understanding of how people interact with each other and this carries over to all of the relationships in the film. None of these actors feel like they enjoy each other. You get the sense that Natalie Portman hates everyone she is working with and it's this kind of energy that dominates the film and makes it so painful to watch. The audience sat there like statues for the film hoping they would maybe get a string You know we walk into the movie theater with open minds and goodwill and get hit by this and it's just an affront. It is incoherent, maddening and UN-funny. They had what? 25 million dollars to work out some kind of movie... How about 10 reasonably real moments? That would have been acceptable. They delivered zero. Excuse me? Hello?! I'm sorry Natalie, maybe you had the Oscar deal already dialed in but nonetheless, they're shooting real film here that people watch – Kutcher? You there? Was anybody there? Was Reitman around? What the hell is going on here? C'Mon folks! Let's step up to the plate. You're all getting a nice stack of cash – Can't you put just a little bit of work into it? Let's go! C'Mon Reitman! Snap snap. Wake the hell up kids! Time to pull the star out of your ass!

Portman is an absolute  joy,"It is interesting, to this reviewer, how the IMDb membership tends to sometimes voice concerns that the mainstream reviewers miss or overlook.The mainstream critics (which you check for yourself, link on the title for this film) either felt that the script worked and produced an entertaining movie -- or that the script failed, and the movie lacked punch.Almost universally, however, Ms. Portman's performance was praised. Some felt, in fact, that it carried the entire movie (Kutcher's career, like that former romantic lead Freddie Prinze, tends to veer more toward ""straight man"" ie, as merely the ""sparkplug"" for whomever he is playing against.) Here on IMDb however I find reviews that go further than the mainstream critics, and actually seemed annoyed at Ms. Portman for taking the role in the first place...? As if the role (or the movie, or the script) was beneath her? In the opinion of this reviewer, Ms. Portman 'is' the movie. The script is OK -- perhaps with some excellent moments here and there, both verbal and slapstick -- and the co-stars are also merely OK.But it is the comic timing and willingness of Ms. Portman to throw herself 100% into such an initially weak character ... and the make that character stronger and more interesting than the scriptwriter ever imagined. This is what carries the film, and this is what holds it together and makes it work.I will add to this review the same remark I penned recently in another review of a so-called ""High Concept"" Hollywood comedy -- Ghost Town 2008 --- namely that, at the end of the day, when this film goes into the great digital archive and becomes available to viewers of the future (as in, two generations from now or more), the sneers from today's viewers will fade away and be replaced by the observation that, like Tea Leoni, Ms. Portman simply did not do enough films to satisfy her fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Truly awful,"I saw maybe 20 minutes before I had to turn it off. I like Ashton Kutcher OK and I really like Natalie Portman, but both of them are completely wooden. The writing is horrid. Sometimes it seems like the characters are having two different conversations at the same time. It is so formulaic I think it may have been written on graph paper. The sex is completely lacking in passion. The friendships are baseless and without affection or any semblance of reality. I don't know how they were able to make two such physically attractive people so repulsive. I didn't remotely care about any of the characters. Nor did like any of them. It was so bad I was unwilling to watch another minute, even with the possibility of Natalie Portman nudity. I challenge you to try watching further than 20 minutes.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance

A Nutshell Review: No Strings Attached,"Trending is powerful. When an idea seemed viable, a series of films will get made, from end of the world stuff, to vampires and alien invasions, and it's even applicable to the romantic comedy genre. I wonder who came up with the recent thought about designing a film exploring the friends with benefits concept, and here we're faced with at least three of such films having Hollywood starlets in various stages of undress, from Love with Other Drugs, No Strings Attached milking the Valentine's Day weekend here, and soon Friends with Benefits starring Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis. Seems like f*ck buddies are getting mainstream acceptance with everyone jumping onto the same bandwagon in Tinseltown.But more powerful than that, is the shift toward the alpha-female type of character, even if just for a while, laying the ground rules and setting the parameters in which a courtship, friendship and relationship should be based upon. Gone out the window are the demure and needy types, and in come female characters who know what they want, are high fliers, doing charitable causes and the likes, and just having the guys strung around their finger. Rudyard Kipling's ""... the female of the species is more deadly than the male..."" is steadfast here, where the only time the male characters are needed, is for that recreational purpose. They do not want commitment, nor settle down or want to be in a long term relationship, skipping past chances to get emotionally hurt, and prefer to keep things status quo in their singledom.Ashton Kutcher goes against type since he's always the stud of any film and stars as Adam, an aspiring television screenwriter who has absolutely no luck with women, even having to suffer some loss of face with his ex-girlfriends preferring a relationships with his television star dad (Kevin Kline). Who is way older. But richer of course. Throughout his 15 years we see how he has this magnetic attraction for Emma (Natalie Portman) and vice versa, only that both of them fail to want to admit it, with Emma preferring a no-frills sexual relationship in lieu of a proper one that involves feelings. For a guy, I suppose this is something quite agreeable, so Adam goes for it.While Love and Other Drugs got an M18 rating for its gratuitous nudity, this one was rated the same but had none of the showing of that much skin, only because it featured a pair of lesbians going at it while clothed. Both Adam and Emma only go at it like crazy jackrabbits in a montage, and other than that the narrative treaded on perfect rom-com ground, without quite the intelligent and interesting story that Love and Other Drugs had. Still, with Ivan Reitman (who makes a cameo too) at the helm, one would have thought that it may have offered at least something out of the ordinary, but no such luck as the film had it pat down right to the expected finale on how things would turn out in Hollywood.If you think you've seen enough of Natalie Portman lately, think again. The current It girl who has been sweeping up awards for her Black Swan portrayal, she's having a busy 2011 as well with the upcoming Marvel summer blockbuster Thor and other films such as Your Highness and Cloud Atlas. While she and Kutcher share some delightful chemistry, being first of all good lookers is almost the requisite in any romantic film, the casting of the two who have such a difference in height also made it as passing jibes in the film, while you can't help but to notice some distracting camera angles being employed to make the difference none too jarring so that they can share the same frame, or perhaps Portman could have been standing on a soapbox.Like one character said, we don't choose who we fall in love with, and we just do. That perhaps came out as one of the rare few times that you'll be nodding at some enlightenment, otherwise you'll be basking in some of the groaning bad innuendos and jokes, and wondering why the need for such a large supporting cast such as Cary Elwes, Ludicrous, Jake M.Johnson, Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell and Mindy Kaling all coming on as very rote caricatures. Sure it's good enough for that Valentine's Day lineup, but it's none too memorable once the lights come on, without the benefit of a strong story running parallel to the romance.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
I remember this movie when it was called Garden State.,"What's Ludicrous doing in this movie. I think maybe it's because this movie has to have that one token black guy who hangs around yuppies all day. What were the producers thinking. Ya, throw Luda in there. That'll make it believable. I have yet to see something where he shows at least a shred of acting ability. If you thought he was bad in this, you should have seen him host SNL. Plus I don't know what's up with Natalie Portman. She is actually an alright actor but she doesn't seem believable at all. I don't know about her breaking out a tennis racket on those bitches or what about the part where she's screaming or jumping on Ashton when she's upset at him. This chick just can't do comedy. She's safe doing dramas. I didn't laugh once at this film. SO PREDICTABLE. Even the one-liners. The lil wayne references, the whole ""this is your fault that I'm pregnant!"" The first girlfriend was too dumb to even be alive. I've noticed that there where a lot of F bombs in this movie. I think that's the new recipe. Throw some F bombs in there, it'll make the jokes a little more funny. This movie was crap. I'm just glad I didn't have to pay to see this since it's on Netflix.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
Unfairly Criticized,"I'm a huge fan of the Mila Kunis/Justin Timberlake lead 'Friends With Benefits' which is probably the reason why I held off for so many years with 'No Strings Attached', released the very same year. Both plots are eerily similar but just like every other genre, if you succeed in using a similar formula, then what does it really matter? And technically this film came before 'Friends With Benefits'. Natalie Portman, who has truly become one of the greatest actors of this generation (and she's still under 40!), has great chemistry with fellow lead Ashton Kutcher, who expectedly begin to fall for each other after years of friendship. Much like the previously mentioned 'Friends With Benefits', the film is rounded out with a great cast of supporting actors, Greta Gerwig, Jake Johnson, Lake Bell, Ludacris, Mindy Kaling, and Kevin Kline.

Dreadful.,"As a man, I'll complain to an expected level every time about having to watch romantic comedies with my wife, but I can admit that I find most of them fairly enjoyable in the end.Not so much with this one.This movie brought to mind two movies from the late '80s, not because of any similarity in content.The first was ""Funny Farm."" When Chevy Chase's wife reads the first chapter of his manuscript, it's so bad that she actually cries before ripping it to shreds in an honest critique.I don't know how this wasn't everyone's reaction to this script. It was just all over the place. The connection between Portman and Kutcher's characters is never close to believable, and the rest of the characters add nothing. Add in a ton of crudity presented with all the subtlety of ""Beavis and Butt-Head"" (and I say this as a big fan of that show, but I think this movie fancies itself as better than that), and it just left me scratching my head. I'm not an expert on the process of making films, but it seems like there are plenty of places along the way to recognize a real stinker. How was this movie ever made?The other movie that came to mind was ""Steel Dawn,"" with Patrick Swayze. What the heck was Swayze doing in that movie, after ""Dirty Dancing""? The same goes with all the big names in this one. I noticed that Natalie Portman was an executive producer, so she had to, I guess, but what is everyone else's excuse? What were Kutcher, Kline, and Cary Elwes (in a non-existent role in which he was practically unrecognizable) thinking? Even Ludicrous (I know how his name is really spelled, but it's fixing it for me), who is still working to establish himself as an actor, was too good for this one.There just wasn't a thing endearing about this film. I was shocked to come here and see that so many people liked it. Maybe I just don't get it.The worst part? My wife keeps forgetting to take the disc back to Red Box, so we're still paying a buck a day to have it in our home. I need to call her right now.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Great!,I love this movie so much! Such good plot & acting!,10.0,Anonymous,Romance
Very cute if ultimately formulaic,"I thought this was pretty good. Sure, the ending was formulaic. What did you expect? The direction was unobtrusive, the photography good. Ashton Kutcher, who I had never seen in anything but a camera commercial, was okay. Not a de Niro, but doesn't claim to be, and didn't need to be. Some good good work from supporting cast members Ludicrous, Greta Gerwig, and Mindy Kaling. Lake Bell and Kevin Kline chewed just a bit too much scenery. I'm sure the director called for it, so it isn't a criticism of the acting. Natalie Portman was achingly pretty, and has decent comedic timing, something not all primarily dramatic actors have. A nice change for her after the swan thing.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
the slightly more classier version of Friends with Benefits,"I love Natalie Portman. I love Natalie Portman. I love Natalie Portman. Ever since Closer (for quite obvious reasons) she has had my attention, but she is one of these actors that captivate anyones attention, without ever having to say a word. She truly is one of the most beautiful women on the planet.Now let me stop obsessing over her, and talk about the film No Strings Attached. Adam (played by Ashton Kutcher) has just suffered the humiliation of finding out that his ex girlfriend has dumped him for his own father, and ends up contacting every girl in his phonebook until one of them agrees to have sex with him. This leads him back to an old school friend Emma (Natalie Portman). Although too drunk to go through with his intention in the evening, the morning after he and Emma decide to get it on as there is an instant connection. As Emma is a resident at a nearby hospital so therefore has no time for any kind of relationship, and has a history of not being able to let people get close to her, she decides that a friends with benefits situation is best for her. Adam obviously agrees to this (ermmmm who wouldn't?) and the story leads from there.Obviously if you have watched any Rom-Com in the last 20 years you will know exactly what happens at the end of this film, but i have to say this film definitely has a freshness to it. The supporting cast (including Kevin Kline, Jake M Johnson (New Girl), and the very funny Lake Bell) help to boost the Com part of Rom-Com, which i always feel helps when the Rom part doesn't have anything majorly unique included in the storyline.All in all, a very decent Rom-Com acted by two very attractive actors (yes, even though i am a man, i am confident in myself enough to admit that Ashton Kutcher is annoyingly attractive) If it was a choice between this or Friends with Benefits, i would watch both even though they are pretty much the exact same film. Then again, if you take away the characters and look at the story lines of most Rom-Coms, aren't they all the same story???Thank you for reading :)P.S I love Natalie Portman.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Kelso won the heart of my golden girl,"First of all, I have to say that this movie is sexy and funny. But these are not the main reasons why you should see this. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are the reason. Especially the latter. For me, Natalie Portman is the best actress around. I absolutely love her. Ashton Kutcher is one the best comedian and charismatic actors around. He is confident, good-looking and -talking, so it's a near perfect match. Although the subject in the movie is very much about sex, we actually see few scenes of actual sex on screen. But it doesn't decrease the value of the movie. What can I say is that, if there would be any other two stars on the screen, the movie would get a lower rating from me, but as I said, they have picked the best bits.Ashton Kutcher will almost certainly be remembered as Michael Kelso from the famous TV-series. A great character. And it's nice to see that he has an excellent taste for women.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Can't believe Portman is in this,"I always considered Natalie Portman as an outstanding actress and was surprised to see her name linked to Ashton Kutcher, notoriously a lot less outstanding. However, hoping for some light entertainment I decided to watch this movie. Regrettably, it turned out even worse than I expected. Portman plays a doctor who thinks she is tough, but in reality is just a hamster (the only funny joke of the movie). Kutcher plays a mild mannered guy, who has the misfortune of being weighted down by a questionable ex-girlfriend and by a vain, silly father. They both are supported by the usual cohort of unbearable friends who are a fixed showcase of all such comedies. The whole cast is equally intolerable and predictable to the utmost. If I ever saw a paint-by-number movie it has to be this one. Absolutely no way of spoiling it, as it is crystal clear from the start how it will end. I am still recovering from the shock of seeing Portman in this piece of unbearable s**t. But I learned my lesson and from now on I will try my best to avoid all movies with Kutcher in it.",1.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Strings Attached provide good turns from Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman in this rom-com,"Just watched this romantic comedy starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher with my movie theatre-working friend at the place where he works. Their characters first meet at a summer camp as teenagers where the one who grows up to be Kutcher is experiencing his parents' divorce and the one who becomes Ms. Portman admits she's not good at consoling people. After another meeting at a frat party, it's several more years before the two meet and eventually decide to have a physical relationship with what the title above implies. I'll just say this was a funny and touching rom-com with plenty of good scenes and lines from the two leads and many of the supporting players like that of Kevin Kline as Kutcher's dad, Lake Bell (who I initially thought was Amanda Peet) as Ashton's production associate, and ""The Office""s Mindy Kaling as one of Ms. Portman's roommates, among others. All of the above was directed by Ivan Reitman who's long provided many entertaining movies these past 30 or so years (of which one of his earliest, Meatballs, is represented by a poster shown in a couple scenes). By the way, he also cameos as a director here.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance

Decent enough.,"Not bad. No Strings Attached gets off to a rocky start with a string of unfunny jokes and a forced premise. But thankfully, the movie eventually falls into an entertaining, if entirely conventional, groove.Kutcher plays his usual heart of gold, sensitive, funny guy, which I can take or leave. But Portman kills it with a sense of humor and beauty that reminds me a lot of Mila Kunis.Don't get too excited at that R rating, this isn't a raunchy sex comedy, despite the premise. It's most assuredly a romantic comedy.I doubt No Strings Attached will be anyone's movie of the year, but it's certainly not as bad as the first 15 minutes had me worried that it would be.

Pointless,"Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) have known each other since childhood, but not to damage their friendship, Emma offers a no strings attached relationship which means they can boink anyone they want and each other too and falling in love is out of the question.This is a Friends with Benefits movie. The first half is raunchy, unfunny sex talk and full of boinking here, there, and everywhere. Got old real fast. Not funny, clever, entertaining, or erotic. Oh, you don't see anything - just them running here and there like they were in some sort of sex marathon. Again, not funny. And, why are we watching?However, in the 2nd half Emma and Adam took a break and thus a somewhat normal movie broke out. Problem was that one of them was falling in love with the other so a stop had to be called.Two classy actors and this is all they can come up with? The title should have been Friends With Benefits for a clearer notion of what was inside. When one doesn't care about the characters, what is the point?Violence: No. Sex: Yes.

Sex and more sex! A nice treat of eye candy it proves that thru this love might just be possible.,"As with most romantic comedies they are typically funny and predictable and most teach that love, and life is complex and unexpected. This film ""No Strings Attached"" stays true to it's title it shows love and life is complex and it's made enjoyable by plenty of eye candy scenes of hot steamy sex between the two lead characters! Can just sex lead to love the film leaves you the viewer hoping and maybe guessing still the film's main theme of sex shows that romance of the physical kind is to be enjoyed.Directed by Ivan Reitman(""Ghostbusters"")this film shows that a romantic commitment is tough to obtain, but the naughty sex is very fun baiting and enjoyable. It involves Emma(Natalie Portman in a very sexy role)who after leaving Michigan for the lands of sunny California to do her medical interns as a doctor meets a boy named Adam(Ashton Kutcher) she knew him in college and now he's a young hotshot who wants to be a sitcom director/ producer. And right away the two agree to have a relationship of bed adventures and just good old fashioned sex.And this film has plenty of enjoyable eye candy scenes of bed hopping as with each encounter the sex with Emma and Adam becomes more and more steamy and hot. Nice were seeing scenes of Natalie in those sexy light flowered blue and purple colored bras! Anyway as many may know and have experienced sex may lead to love as especially Adam feels emotional attachment, as little lady Emma feels she is to much of a traditional girl to go without a string, so the passions cool off.Only after both want love especially more so Emma the film's supporting female characters shine more as love proves it finds people unexpectedly and at the least expected times. As Emma's female friends find love. Well what about her and Adam as the film proves and shows starting over is okay as even after all of the hot sex a chance of love still is possible even though it will be complex. Overall pretty good comedy it's a real treat of eye candy as it's theme of sex and bed hopping will have most viewers enjoying and seeing Natalie Portman was a real treat. It's title rings true more and more relationships are for only sex joy with no strings attached as love is only a complex hope.",8.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not bad,"I like it. I gave it 6/10 because it all came down to another cliché ending. Boy meets girl and they fall in love, like that hasn't happened a million times before. Aside from those few downfalls it was a good flick. Funny enough and pretty entrancing if you just relax and get into the story.The funny in this movie wasn't to difficult, so to speak. It was just stupid humor that was easy to understand. One thing I thought gave this movie something ""meat-on-the- bones"" was the fact that it was ""guy"" funny. Most people could relate to at least one character in the story making it a win for everyone. To be perfectly honest there was no deeper meaning to the characters or the plot it ran on. It was a light-hearted and easy going film made to entertain on a long Sunday afternoon. Then again maybe I'm just to picky. I would recommend just checking it out if you have the time.

It won't be wrong to see that Natalie Portman's entry in RomCom makes it worthy of giving a shot in first time. I think if it had a regular romcom actress it would have been a dead e.g Katherine Heigl. Ashton Kutcher is not annoying like most of his movies, he was sweet and not self-absorbed otherwise his last offering ""Spread"" left a bad taste in my mouth.

In short a relationship with no strings attached.Of course Kutcher realises that he is actually falling for Portman and wants something more in their relationship.The film wants to be a raunchy, ribald black comedy. It is rather conservative instead wanting to go for the formulaic falling in love route. Its actually not very sexy or hilariously funny.It wastes its supporting cast who are in effect cyphers.

A few strings are still tied to deliver the expected,"Natalie Portman and Nicholas Cage are two actors that have won an Oscar and continue to do films, some in below average quality, and some just completely awful compared to the one they won for. Portman has done No Strings Attached and Your Highness aside from her amazing drama Black Swan. Cage has done pretty much anything else since Leaving Las Vegas, most of it being bland and goofy films that showcase his oddball sense of direction and hairstyles.No Strings Attached is a romantic comedy, that at first seems like a different film making the characters shy away from romance and love, when ultimately we know what will happen. It doesn't take a genius to find out that Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman wind up together at the end of the film. Did you expect anything different? Movies like this are nice to watch, and most of the time keep a positive feel. But they are ruined by the inevitable outcome all of these movies have. The plot revolves around a medical student named Emma (Portman) and a TV executive named Adam (Kutcher). Both were the teenagers that knew each other, but never spoke in school and now they are starting to hang out more and talk with each other.Emma is a workaholic and Adam just says ""yes"" to everything. When Emma says their relationship will be a sort of FWB style bond, Adam agrees and they have random sex on on/off occasions. Then they start feeling things for each other, we get a bunch of lovey-dovey between the two, and so on.There are little perks to this movie. Jennifer Irwin has a minor role as one of the Television directors. I appreciated Irwin's work as Aunt Linda on the sitcom Still Standing, and she still doesn't seem like she changed her personality in this. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman play a likable and cute couple side by side. Kutcher cleans up his act a little, and Portman has some fun with her character being a little foul-mouthed and outspoken. And we do get some cute dialog between them as well.The R rating isn't as R as I would've thought. It's a questionable, high-maintenance PG-13 movie with a few dirty words. The sex scenes are extremely clean and are only suggestive. No Strings Attached is bumped up by a few smiles brought on by the cast and the dialog, but the plot and overall execution is just another, we-know-it-before-we-see-it sort of turnout. I expected a bit more daring acts from Kutcher and Portman together. Kutcher is a good actor in good movies, and Portman is on the rise to be an A list star. They only give their very early performance like skills in this film when they are so much more.Starring: Ashton Kutcher, Natalie Portman, Greta Gerwig, Jake M.

Don't be put off by the prudes - it is funny!,"I was nearly put off this movie completely by a couple of the over the top comments here about the crudeness in it, but I've been an Ashton Kutcher fan since his days in That 70's Show, and other reviewers said it was funny - so I thought I'd take a look.After a fairly awkward start, it has some laugh out loud funny bits, some sweet ones, and some where you can't help really feeling for Asthon Kutcher's character, Adam.I would describe No Strings Attached as a modern romantic comedy about dysfunctional people having some pretty dysfunctional relationships.Not too schmaltzy that a guy couldn't enjoy most of it I think, and as others have said, I think it would make a good date movie.I gave it 7 out of 10 as a romantic comedy - a genre that I am not a big fan of - as they are not usually actually funny at all.That being said, I've seen every romantic comedy that Ashton Kutcher has been in - although after Killers I vowed never again.

Not very sexy. Not very funny.

Well, No Strings Attached definitely falls in to the 'take your brain out' category. The trailer sells it as a sexy and witty rom-com when in fact it is neither of those things. It is a dull, plodding experience with an obvious outcome and little inbetween. Sure it's stars are beautiful but do we care for these people, do they deserve or earn our respect and well wishes over the course of the film? Are we desperate for them to get together at the end? A world of no. Ashton Kutcher is no movie star, he is pretty and every inch the MTV presenter, but he cannot carry a film and such is his real life status, is virtually impossible to sympathise with. Natalie Portman on the other hand is a proved quality actress yet she can't help lift this out of the doldrums. Neither sexy or funny.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Bland Screenplay but Good Lead Performances,"No Strings Attached (2011)** 1/2 (out of 4)Friends Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) decide to try to be lovers with no emotional connection and while the non-stop sex works at first soon Adam begins to have feelings, which pushes Emma away. NO STRING ATTACHED isn't going to be mistaken for a Bergman film nor is it going to win any awards at the Oscars but considering what the film is it works fairly well even though you know where it's going and what route it's going to take to get there. It was kind of refreshing seeing an R-rated romantic comedy again since the majority of them over the past twenty-years have been aimed at the PG-13 market. You know, those romantic comedies where even the adults act like dumb teenagers. Either way, this film here isn't perfect and has a lot of issues but on the whole it was a pretty fun film. It should go without saying but what will make or break a film like this are the two leads because if there's not any chemistry then there's no where for the story to go. Portman and Kutcher really do seem like they'd be an odd pair to put together in a film like this but it actually makes the story work. You really can look at these two characters, see how different they are and believe that they'd be in a sex only relationship. Kutcher is basically playing himself but there's no question that he can have a charming side and it's on full display here. He can deliver the sly lines without any problem and he comes across as a good-hearted guy, which is exactly what his character is. Portman delivers a fine performance as well as she has no problem playing this workaholic character with a few personal issues of her own. I'm sure many people might feel that a role like this is below her but she turns in a memorable performance and handles the raunchy humor quite well. Portman and Kutcher have no problems coming off like a real couple as they work well off one another and that's pretty much all you can ask. Kevin Kline gets a few good spots as Kutcher's famous father who has a few drug problems of his own. It was really fun seeing Kline again and he delivers a fun performance. An almost unrecognizable Cary Elwes is in good form as are Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell and Ludicrous who play the friends. The biggest problem with the film is the screenplay, which is your typical romantic comedy stuff meaning you know where the film is going to go and there aren't any surprises along the way. Even before the movie starts you know how it's going to end and sadly the final twenty-minutes really go out of control because what you know is going to happen just keeps getting pushed back to the point where the movie overstays its welcome. The start of the picture also suffers from some pacing problems but the middle section contains some good raunchy humor, funny sex scenes and the two stars certainly make it cute and charming.",,Anonymous,Romance

"If you've weathered through some Adam Sandler classics, you should be able to handle this.","No Strings Attached is a 2011 romantic comedy starring Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. It explores the dynamics of two consenting adults who are just friends who have sex, but later on find themselves at a crossroads: do they want to exchange the simplicity of their arrangement for something more complicated i.e. Be in a relationship?Being a Natalie Portman stan way before the term was invented, it took a decade for me to come up with the courage to watch this movie simply because it was too different from what we are used to seeing her in, like Beautiful Girls, Closer and Black Swan where she won an Oscar for Best Actress just a year before this was released. I'm so used to sexy actresses making the transition to being serious that it seemed off-key for someone to do it the other way around. Much less with Ashton Kutcher who I remember from 'Dude Where's my Car?' (whether that's a good or bad thing is still up for debate, I mean I could just say Demi Moore's ex-husband you know.)Here's the thing though, it wasn't as disastrous as I thought it was going to be. Kutcher cleans up nicely, Portman has comic timing, Mindy Kaling and Greta Gerwig were great as supporting characters and the movie has its funny moments. And not just your typical blue comedy but some actual good writing in between if you'll just be patient enough. While this is not Portman's strongest performance (Cameron Diaz would've been better a choice,) she does somehow make the character her own if you can just stop picturing her as Queen Amidala for one minute.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Formulaic, but a decent romantic comedy...Just a bit overrated","The trailer of this movie didn't hype me up at all to see it immediately, but overall it's a decent romantic comedy. It's formulaic in some aspects and goes in a direction where Ashton constantly brags about his features without proof to the audience. Which might be a good thing for guys but it kinda shows why he wanted to be in this movie, because of the dialogue that hypes him up. The plot is about a guy who is looking for a relationship with the girl he likes, but the girl just wants a sex friend. Also some guy audiences might be disappointed cause it shows Ashton being more revealing than Natalie Portman, in fact there is no nude scenes for her because she is under a contract or something. Overall it's a decent comedy, not all that funny and is overrated a bit by some reviewers in my opinion, but still a decent romantic comedy...Nothing all that special. The flaw of this movie is the formulaic and very predictable direction and parts and dialogue that is just not believable at all. Also the pacing of the movie slows down after the first hour. The main positive thing about this movie is that the two characters are relateable in some aspects.6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Predictable enough but still the kind of story of a romantic comedy that will keep you entertained.The acting was perfectly good and Kutcher and Portman have good chemistry, joined by some other cast members who do a good job.The humour was pretty well timed and there are some good parts that should give you a laugh if you're feeling up for it.Overall, 6/10 for some odd humour that I got a kick out of and the the charming dynamic between the two leads.

Scooby Doo is Deeper  Portman redefines flat,"Whoa!!!! Wow! This was TRITE nonsense -- If you get the chance to see it for free and you have two hours to kill -- GO DO SOMETHING ELSE! This was stinky bad. Just inane. Brain dead. Not even for teens -- too insipid for them. Whoa!!! Portman is even worse in this and how that is possible I don't know -- Worse then she did in those other 5 films she jammed in before she knew she'd be taking time off for new human unit. This was just pure crap! Scooby Doo is deeper -- Portman needs to be on a sit com. She evokes a sort of shallow attitude on the screen but that's it... It's like her inner monologue in whatever character she's playing is ""My trailer is too small. When will my vegan lunch arrive?! I want a knew dog walker. I've been sitting here for an hour and they are not doing my scene. I want to leave. I am pretty and special. I am angry. Please don't pass on your gross air germs to me."" ...And she will toss in a nice mechanical smile, but it's still not enough to fill a role in a movie.

Snuggles and pancakes not included,"What if your friends step in and say you might be a hopeless fool to pass up what you have despite how unconventional it appears? Yet, those tingling little jitters aren't there, that is unless you're afraid to confront them or are purposely pushing them away.Fifteen years ago Adam (Kutcher) tried to get a little somethin' somethin' at summer camp with an emotional ruse about his parents getting divorced but was deflected from the unaffectionate Emma (Portman). Adam and Emma by chance catch each other five years ago at a frat party and she invites him to her father's funeral as if it's just some ""stupid thing."" He shares that he likes her but she's again upfront that they probably won't ever see each other. Now, one year ago they stumble into each other for the third time and he gets her phone number. From a drunken stupor about finding out that his dad is with someone he knows, he ends up at her place naked, thus starting their physical, get-in-get-out, wham-bam-thank-you-mam entanglement that comes with no strings attached, rules and boundaries included to make sure of it.This is a comedy first and foremost, though it begins a little too headstrong and in the audience's face as there's no build up to the point-blank jokes. It's incredibly self-aware of its own ridiculousness and it becomes forced at times. Though after meeting more characters and getting an outline, this handles the unabashed and crude humor a little better as it turns over to the relationship angle. Despite the R rating--which is more for drug use and cursing--this takes a PG-13-like route about the physical side and doesn't exploit the angle such as provocative pictures like ""9 1/2 Weeks"" or the more extreme ""9 Songs"" as it's a little more fun and goofy than seductive. ""No Strings Attached"" also transitions between phases of growth as they continue to see each other more frequently to the point of appreciating one another and liking the stability--yet still don't use those no, no words like ""girlfriend"" and ""boyfriend.""This starts wild and crazy and then lessens down to a mildly serious simmer that leaves the characters both torn between regretful decisions and emotional tangles. If it's not obvious enough this is going to get a little sappy for the hopefully romantic and everybody's going to end up some kind of winner no matter if it's how they planned it or even if it is who they thought it would be with. But that should have been expected from the humorous angle, as there's nothing dark or racy about this. Sometimes even coming with hip and trendy music and playing on the immature angle despite everyone's age.""No Strings Attached"" on its surface is an easy movie that's made to be briefly rewarding and give a momentary good feeling when the credits roll. It comes with some challenges for the skeptics, such as how it deals with that coincidental thing called ""Fate"" that relationship movies abuse too often with all too convenient scenarios. Yes, this definitely has them--stumbling into each other at the coffee shop and all--but they're a little more buried than the normal formula as some complications arise and time is spread out. This borrows some conventions, as well as goes against a few, such as the guy being the fonder one despite growing up with an absent mother but instead a playboy, celebrity dad who chases tail.The co-stars range from token black and gay guy, to socially awkward for the sake of quirkiness if we cinema goers haven't seen enough of it. The sister adds the element of marriage and the alpha male co-worker poses a threat by attempting to step in. Despite the clichés, some of the specific scenarios promote easy beguilement to the storyline even if they don't tally up enough to make this a classic down the road. Natalie Portman plays Emma by going through a few different phases from emotionless and direct to sentimental and confused. Her character development feels a little up and down as she attempts to transition back and forth till she's an adapted person, which makes the tone of the picture go from dealing with a risqué subject, to a rom-com, to reevaluating herself by searching for answers. There's not much to anticipate from Ashton Kutcher's role as he plays Adam with a big heart, which makes him spontaneous, giving and sometimes a little slow on the upkeep and spaced out, which gives him that teddy bear persona that he consistently carries from movie to movie.",,Anonymous,Romance
"""Love and Other Drugs"", all ""Spread"" around.","Ivan Reitman, the director known for his long collaboration with Bill Murray, gave me enough reasons to worry about this flick only by the look of the trailer. No Strings Attached looked just like another cheap and average romantic comedy full of glam scenes and clichés. Is it the case here? Yes, it probably is. But something changed my judgment on this movie right after I left the theater. I said to myself: ""wait a minute, this movie ain't that bad so I need to write about it as soon as I could"". Well, here I am.The film starts horrifying and amateurish. Nothing connects me with the characters, nothing impresses me, the jokes are so lame that even a true ""blond"" won't laugh at them, the pacing is incredibly boring and the clichés are falling like the ""bieber-tears"". I was obviously panicked. However, there was a point were things started to get better. The movie started to awake itself from the coma. Everything started to make sense again. I was breathing because the air was fresh. The film actually started to get entertaining. Well, thank god because that's what I was expecting from this. I expected a simple combo between ""Love and Other Drugs"" and Kutcher's other ""playboy"" film ""Spread"". This mixture is the perfect description this movie could have: ""Love and Other Drugs, All Spread Around"".Basically the film is more than simple. Two friends, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) become sex-buddies. Of course you know the twist here... C'mon guys... they fall in love. But that doesn't ruin anything because this is a great dating movie. There are a lot of goofy situations because you have Kutcher's same character, there are a lot of romantic moments which may seem to be similar or even identical to any other one thousand romantic moments which you all seen in other movies but that won't bother you because the execution is not wrong this time. So, you have the formula, you got the execution, what's next? The acting... While Kutcher does what he knows to do best, goofing around and run after girls, talk to the phone or eat a stake, Natalie Portman is too good for a movie like this. She gives a great performance even though it was not necessarily required. The emotions, the different emotional states, the delivery is better than I expected. That made me feel good and acknowledge that at least I could find interest in a character.The technical execution is not something to be worry about so I won't talk about it since it's nothing special but I will admit though that the chosen songs were pretty good and they fitted the movie's identity. Excepting the first 20 minutes were everything was a complete chaos, a utterly mess, No Strings Attached starts horrifying but ends up more than satisfying. It's definitely a date film that I recommend. It's funny, cheesy, sweet to look at and strangely enough, innocent. Just don't hate on it.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
How long can you have 'just' sex?,"This is a story about a guys dreams coming true. No I mean it. How many of you guys would like to have a hot lady friend just for sex and don't have to really worry about keeping up a relationship. It sounds simple, carefree and dead wrong!! But for Emma and Adam even how simple it sounds, couldn't' do it for long. They fell in love with each other. And now that's what I call true LOVE MAKING.Adam is a guy who is a little shy and fits for a relationship. Emma on the other hand is a totally independent girl who thinks relationships sucks but doesn't mind going the physical way if there is nothing emotional involved. They hook up and come to an agreement. It's just sex and nothing else. And they decides to keep their relationship strictly physical. But soon Adam realizes that Emma is the girl of his dreams but Emma backs off giving them a break. And that break brings in wisdom.'No Strings Attached' is not the typical love story but not a very extraordinary love story as well. Theme wise a bit similar to many romantic movies but more closer to 'love and other drugs'. Proves again that relationships don't work only for sex. The movie is not boring. And it's not extra interesting. You may just sit back and watch the love story roll out with quite a lot of talk about sex and its related in the first half. As it goes it becomes a little serious and dramatic in a point or two. And brings in humor as well time to time. That's it!Having the Oscar winning Natalie Portman kicks off well. She is petite and sweet and better looking than her 'Black Swan', obviously with some pound of flesh. Ashton kutcher fits the role of Adam. He looks confused, act confused but knows what he really wants after all.more of my reviews as flickshout.blogspot.com",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ashton Kutcher's character taking her back at the end was not romantic, it was ridiculous and in real life relationships like this fail!

A sweet romantic comedy,"No Strings Attached was a hit for me. Young, fresh, modern, and cute; this movie resonates with a younger generation. Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are brilliant actors and great comedians at that. The quirky humor and jokes never seem to get old. They fit their characters and work together with ease. Nothing seems forced or contrived, and it just flows. The movie works with topics that concern our generation and looks at how life really is for many people. Many of us find that we can relate to these characters and the situations that they are going through, and we see that we're normal and get a laugh out of it. No Strings Attached was witty and fun, and definitely a must-see for a good laugh.",9.0,Anonymous,Romance

Ho Hum,"I was very impressed by Mr. Reitman's yeoman effort to make a four hour romantic comedy, but the tired premise, the routine scene changes and lack of empathy with the characters made this a dismal effort. Okay, it wasn't really a four hour film, but it sure seemed like it. I began yawning twenty minutes into the picture and when I was wondering just how much longer this could drag out I noted that only 37 minutes has passed. But being with my wife who loves anything mushy, I had to sit there and tough it out. The actors are all personable and I've always had respect for Mr. Reitman's work.

Its not one of those terribly made films , that everything in it is plain wrong.No , this one has some fairly good parts. There are the flaws here and there , some lack of originality in the style of making the movie and all that , but the whole package can stand straight. Not a bad way to relax for 2 hours.And one last info. Its more of a romance with a comedic atmosphere here and there , than a comedy with some romance. What i am trying to say is , the romance is more present here than the comedy. Thanks for reading, bye.",,Anonymous,Romance

A chuckle here and there...,"Sometimes its nice to go see a light-hearted comedy which allows you to appreciate the finer things in life, such as a chance sexual encounter with a stranger. Especially when these strangers are as attractive as our leads. This obviously isn't a film for the kids and it was vulgar to the point where some scenes came across as tacky, but either way it earned laughs and that was the point in the end. Kutcher redeemed himself with this one, he's never really been an A actor, his performances are all pretty boy with no real flare, but in this one we can actually see some depth as he deals with the ups and downs of Portman. Portman on the other hand was hysterical to say the least, she was cute and bubbly and more importantly she had fun with her role. It was challenging for me as an audience member to walk out of Black Swan with awe and such respect for this woman, and then soon after witness her talk about a period mixed cd. There wasn't anything special about the directing or the soundtrack. It's your average cookie cutter romance, they just upped the sex. I recommend it, if you want a film to pass the time, which will make you smile. Just know, that you won't leave, move or touched. You just might have a smirk on your face.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Feels like a very long trailer,"Due to its pacing and sudden change of scenes, this one is not a Woody Allen movie. However it is still quite enjoyable. I have great fun watching it, but not with great expectation. Do not go if you do have great expectation after seeing the trailer. This one feels like a very long trailer.The score is terrible. Although I can understand the lyrics of the music is to emphasize the movie's premise. It does not add to the scene at all. And it is quite a shame that happened. And this one feels like it needed a laugh track somewhere, maybe from the extra characters. Since I watch it with people that has no preference of the jokes based on pop culture. It is lost in translation with the subtitles.The extras was great actors and actresses, somehow has bad script. OK, not all of them are good. But the sister, the waitress, the doctor's friends are good. With better script, I do think it will be better.It is a fun movie. The ending is not surprising.

"No romance, comedy or even friendship - what kind of romantic comedy is that?","""No Strings Attached"", friends with benefits, and as they described it to their friends and family, they're friends who have sex. First there are the obvious jokes, ""Nope. That's not possible!"" But my problem with that set-up is that these characters—if they are even characters—are definitely not friends. ""Acquaintances who have sex."" Really takes away some of the potential, doesn't it?We're already told that they're taking the romance out of a romantic comedy, but minus the amiability that comes with friendship, then they're also taking the comedy out of a romantic comedy. So what are we left with? A juvenile story, best friends who have a meaningless sub-plot, and sex. That's it. I like romantic comedies but they took out everything that I like about them and left me with everything that I don't like about them.It's vulgar as they promised but with no greater purpose and for no higher comedy. If you're going to give me sex humour, there has to be more to it. Not one-dimensional characters who have no resemblances to actual human beings. For as charming and attractive as Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman are, if there are no feelings attached, then why should I care?

No small parts,"The cast in this film was spot on. It was particularly refreshing to find even the smallest of roles, uttering what could be the most innocuous of lines, laugh-out-loud funny. The Kutcher- Portman relationship rang true, outstripping any buzz about stripping, and one had the feeling the actors cared both about the script and each other. Kevin Kline is, of course, a national treasure. First time I've seen Greta Gerwig, Lake Bell, Ophelia Lovibond, Jennifer Irwin, or Olivia Thirlby (or noticed them) and they were all fantastic. And though I'd seen Mindy Kaling, Talia, Balsam, Jake M. Johnson, Ludicrous, and Abby Elliot before, they made the often-bandied belief that ""In America there are no ensemble actors"" seem like an outright lie. Cary Elwes was phenomenal with less than a half-dozen lines (and nobody does ""lame"" like him).

Yes, even Ashton Kutcher actually acts in this film. Well, perhaps not all the way through - his performance improves throughout and he ends the film well. Olivier he's not, but he is better here than in all of his other films (combined).Well written and very well directed. Even given the free wheeling sexual nature of the film, there is nary a skin shot, except for Kutcher's butt early in the film; yet, somehow the passion and sexual trysts are totally believable.This is not an award winning piece for Portman (unlike Black Swan); still, she does bring a level of class to the film.Well worth a trip to the theater for a couple of hours of fun and laughter.",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
This was not a good movie.,"Elizabeth Meriwether I love you and New Girl is a gd masterpiece, but this movie fell flat probably for reasons largely outside of the writing.

Perfectly crafted rom-com with a horrendous title,"Directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Elizabeth Meriwether (New Girl), this is perfectly crafted rom-com.

That's not this.The biggest part of the formula is the two leads. Natalie Portman is one of the cutest and engaging actress around. Ashton Kutcher is the most beautiful man candy there is. Together they make a compelling pair.The story isn't much more than boy meets girl over and over again until they finally give in to their attraction. That's when emotionally unavailable Emma (Portman) wants sex with no strings attached. There isn't any real obstacles in their relationship.

I wish this was a problem I had....,"Really good watch, would watch again, and can recommend.Having just watch ""Friends with Benefits"" this feels like a drastically different movie: mostly on the basis that this is more about a neurotic woman's control issues extending into the fear of rejection and emotional pain. Not that it's wrong to be guarded in her manner, it's just that is what you call that.Now, I've basically been in love with Natalie Portman since ""Leon: The Professional"", and have only liked Ashton Kutcher in ""Butterfly Effect"" (wildly polarized opinions on the movie) and ""A Lot Like Love"" (I hate baseball, and only seem to really like Amanda Peet in baseball themed video), so I had to ignore just being angry at him most of the movie.The other significant difference between ""Friends with Benefits"" is that this has an amazing supporting cast, and a story past ""my crazy dad"". And in that support cast, there are examples of different types of women (and men) archetypes. Greta Gerwig was basically (eventually) the perfect woman, very appreciated, where Lake Bell was appreciative, but with ""quirks"", and either would have fine women / options if the world actually worked like that so reciprocate that appreciation if you have it.But, of course, the story focuses on emotionally elusive control freak, and I'll admit a certain appeal to that. And the independent part of that is the appealing part, but how that character became an (almost) doctor and has it together is by avoiding the problems that she's having with Adam, and that only works so far when it's already there, which is what most of the movie is about: a woman being emotionally brave (there is no bravery without fear), and even thought it seems to be told from Adam's perspective (mostly), he doesn't have much going on other than sexing Emma in terms of adversity. The one thing that happens is quickly resolved because someone else wants to sex him, where as she is in a continuous state of confrontation.While both movies have this light hearted air to them about the complexities of relationships ""Friends with Benefits"" almost seems cute compared to the adventures of this movie. Not everyone is going to deep dive on a movie like I will though, so I can't say this is a wildly great movie: it's still about pretty people having sex and complaining about it, so it loses some of the steam there.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Sorry...,"I gave this movie a 2 cause it's surely not for a 6.2. It's not as low as 2 of course but what is this with that arrogant humour of a lot of movies the last couple of years? It gives me the sense of a really arrogant film industry that says: ""we can sell tones of movies per month and we will launch any crap we want as jokes, and you will pay and say thank you"". 2 dimensioned characters with no depth at all, random dialogues that sound rather like indecipherable writing and provocative impression just for impression... nothing more.And always some Jewish propaganda. I'm really OK with any Jewish person but why isn't there a single movie that doesn't note that the main characters are Jewish? OK we got the message, cool people are Jewish, they don't have to add a scene with the Jewish hat or a bar mitzva in EVERY movie, or is it in the contract? like McDonald's advertisements?It wasn't totally bad, comparing to others of this kind but I would call it a bad hamburger.. I eat it, though I know it's junk, and regret it the moment I'm done.Of course some moments were fun but some other moments I really felt sorry for Portman (is she proud of this?), and if by any chance, this film's reality is actually representing America's reality and everyday life, well... I'm also sorry. It feels like people need to make a revolution about something but they don't know about what so they just act like crazy, but not surrealistic- funny - crazy (as they think it comes out), but actually crazy and kind of scary sometimes, as if everyone is on speed or peels or anytihing I don't know.

My 404th Review: Pretty cute date movie,"This has spark and wit and good performances, and was all in all, a good grown-up romantic comedy. The leads show good chemistry with Natalie Portman playing the more male traits against Ashton Kutcher's ready to commit male.The plot of two adults who think they're only in it for the physical and then discover more is fin and feisty, with a solid supporting cast including Kevin Kline playing Aston's father.All in all if you like your romantic comedies with a little bit more bite, but not too blatant, then this is not a bad choice. It's fun to see both leads using their good comic abilities and all in all this is a fun night out.",7.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not watchable,"As soon as I started watching this trash, I came upon a scene where at a funeral, a girl says to her bereaving mother that ""that's a guy I had one night stand with when I was 14"". That right there is enough to see that someone immature, unrefined and clueless wrote the script. Having still some goodwill left in me, I skip over more stupid scenes and dialogues hoping for something better.
While skipping I come upon so many mindlessly boring dialogues that it didn't take too long to hit the ""stop"" button. The culmination was introduction of our protagonist's dad played by Kevin Klein. Wonderful actor, horrible role. Comes out he slept with his son's ex-girlfriend. In a typical immature, clueless filmmaker fashion, it's all delivered in a matter-of-fact manner.
The story, dialogues, scenes and characters are so dumb, the film is unwatchable.
Just when I thought that I have learned how low the Hollywood had sunk, I was proven wrong,
Oh, well, you learn something new every day.

Now that I've seen it I can say she was delightful and fit quite well.The story isn't new but the storytelling is compelling and generally excellent.The movie is pretty long, which for me was a good point, it goes on at a pleasant pace.

Its an OK Love Story,"This movie stars Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher in a modern day love story. Yes 2011 is here and now its time to share a love story again about having sex with no strings attached. Yea like anyone can ever not fall in love after sex. Sex is to powerful not have intimate feelings for one another. But as this movie plays with the idea that a woman who has not never found true love and seems to have given up on herself. She decides to live her life and feels she doesn't deserves true happiness with a man. Then here comes the sensitive man who just is looking for true love. Waiting for that woman that will treat him well and not screw him over... or his dad.This movie does a descent job of making an attempt of the modern love story. I'm a huge Michigan Wolverine fan, so as the movie goes into the second scene with the lead male character at a Michigan frat party, It intrigued me to stay with the movie. Then of course with its crude humor and the awkward character that Ashton plays, this is a movie that showed promise. The love story was written well, and even though you know the outcome going into the movie, it was worth it. There are a few great lines from the movie, at times the movie slows down and it feels like it should end sooner. The one liners and the humor makes up for it.In my B.S.

And They Come In Twos,"Ever noticed how the box office always seems to release films in two? Confusing cinema goers making them rack their brains trying to decide on a film!Here are a few examples to prove my point:Killers vs. Knight & Day (2010)Dante's Peak vs. Volcano (1997)The Prestige vs. the Illusionist (2006)A Bugs Life vs. Antz (1998)Deep Impact vs. Armageddon (1998)Coincidence? I think not! But from looking at those titles, there's always one that's better quality than the other. And if you're trying to decide which one is worth your time. Let me help you make that decision.Both 'No Strings Attached' & 'Friends With Benefits' are typical and predictable, definitely something for the ladies. Both portray a modern female character who are empowering and career focused & don't want a serious relationship. But we can all guess what happens at the end, women hormones and emotions take over.But if we're going to compare the pair, 'No Strings attached' takes the cake hands down. The film's script takes on a much wittier approach and gave me a few chuckles and giggles. At the same time there were scenes that got me a little choked up. It was a good mix of comedy and romance like the genre suggests.Not to mention Kutcher and Portman who were portraying these typical characters, seem to have more chemistry and didn't make my skin crawl. Even the older wiser character in both films, played by Kline (Adam's Father) had more of a distinct characteristic and was flawed and funny as oppose to the 'Friends with Benefits' counterpart played by Clarkson (Jamie's mother) who's character failed to even resonate in my memory.'Friends with Benefits' is a Justin Timberlake fans only film. Mila and Justin made a good effort, but if you're looking for a film with a typical plot that would make you laugh and cry. You'd be better off checking out Reitman's 'No Strings Attached' attempt.Even though the 'No Strings attached' tag line appears to be directly ripping off 'Friends with Benefits'. How I see it is, if you're going to do something that's been overdone and clichéd. Then do it well. And 'No Strings Attached' did just that",6.0,Anonymous,Romance

But i have watched the latter earlier. Even though i didn't felt bore watching this movie, thanks to the screen presence of Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher and also pretty good direction by Ivan Reitman. The story could have been better and some of the scenes mainly during their break-up was not even convincing and more lot of scenes were not convincing, felt like they made those scenes just to increase time..Natalie delivered overall good performance, she was pretty good in her romantic expressions and also in emotional scenes. Ashton Kutcher was also good but was overshadowed by Natalie. Kevin Kline who played Ashton's Father who is a womanizer was very funny.The background score and especially the songs were also good.Wholly, the movie is not a messy one, but not a masterpiece / great film. but is a time pass watch for NPMy rating 6.0 on 10",6.0,Anonymous,Romance
Dear Ms. Portman,"Dear Ms. Portman,I just wanted to say congratulations on your pregnancy, engagement and you awards for your brilliant performance in Black Swan. So to be leading up to an Oscar nomination and probable win no doubt. Your life really seems to be on a upswing professionally and personally. So not that I am anyone at all but as a big movie fan I'm here with some movie advice. I recently just saw your newest film No Strings Attached which hit no. one this weekend, another congrats. Unfortunately I must tell you it was pretty bad and I'm shocked that you stooped to such confused, sordid material and with a half assed performance that was without a doubt the worst of your career. And that is truly saying something because your performance was okay, pretty generic because you've had such an accomplished career thus far. My advice would be stay away from such cinematic turkeys as this. Yes your role was completely underwritten and your character had little to no reasoning of why she acted the way she did but despite that the humor came across as crude and vulgar and the movie felt so unnecessarily long and not long enough at the same time as it came to it's ridiculous and confusing unending. In fact I would like to say in fact that the best part of the movie was surprisingly Ashton Kutcher that found a way to show some actual range with his performance. Maybe there is hope for him yet if he could just escape the horrible type casting. Sure the film had moments and you certainly elevated that dinner scene with Kevin Kline but only momentarily. Now I'm not saying you were the worst part of the film at all that was the actual film and running a close second was a supporting role by Ludicrous. And I'm certainly not trying to be insulting but as an avid fan I'm just suggesting you stick with better material and make the films you've always made respectably and no pander down to such trite, nonsensical, unmemorable and excuse if this is harsh dumb garbage. Not saying this the worst film I've ever seen in fact it's far from it but that's precisely the category it lands in and everyone associated with this should know better. For now a slap on the hand but next time I will start to loose faith. I'm crossing my fingers for Thor.**/5Sincerely,Richard Cavellero",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
Not even close,"I should probably have seen it coming. Considering that neither Natalie Portman nor Ashton Kutcher have done anything remotely funny, and Ivan Reitman hasn't directed anything great since Kindergarden Cop, I wonder what it is that gave me hope that No Strings Attached could be any good. It's a bland experience, with bad acting, too much contrivance for comfort, and questionable focus. The vast bulk of the jokes fall flat, and the few that don't aren't very original.Even from the get go, you have the feeling that this movie is doing something wrong. In the first few minutes it jumps from ten years, to five years to the present day, and asks us to accept the fact that two people who met at a party and haven't spoken since would remember each other after several years. It's hard to say whether laughter was the intended reaction, but it feels far more awkward to the viewers than it does to the characters.It might have helped if anyone in the cast was trying, but nobody is. Ashton Kutcher, is potentially forgivable when considering that the role is way beyond him, but Natalie Portman, is not so easy to forgive. Her performance reeks of personality swings between girlish and womanish, she fails to sell emotion, and also she plays drunk like she's had no acting experience. Kevin Kline and Ludicrous are painfully underused in their supporting roles. This brings me to another problem with No Strings attached; too much of the plotting feels unnecessary. I would have liked it if the move spend more time with the lead couple. Instead, we have to ensure a time passing montage of sexual encounters, which rob us of the comedy and the credibility.Whatever it is that may sound appealing about No Strings attached is probably misleading. It's far too lazy and incompetent to be worth anyone's time.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
This Romantic Comedy hits the spot.,"I expected No Strings Attached to be a raunchy/romantic comedy and it was really good as that.

As a matter of fact, I didn't really think they had much chemistry.FINAL VERDICT: I guess this was supposed to fall in the generic romantic comedy genre, even though it's not really funny.

No Strings Attached (2011) - Natalie Portman Turns Me On...Sort of!,"A lot of people may know that the raunchy ""friends having sex"" comedy, ""Friends with Benefits"", with Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis, is actually a lot similar to a movie released months before called ""No Strings Attached"", with Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher. But trust me, you would rather see ""Friends with Benefits"". Yes, it's touching at times, and there are few funny chuckles. But this movie just defines the phrase ""romantic comedy"" in a very ""not so good"" way. Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher star as Emma and Adam, two ""friends with benefits"" who have a sexual relationship, and they make sure to not crush on each other. Portman is lovely, but she makes me lose my last nerve with all of her complaining and all of her crankiness. I don't care if she's scared of commitment, so I just wish that she would just accept the commitment, and stop complaining about it already. Kutcher wasn't really that funny in this movie, and he only delivers a few chuckles. But he's still a pretty cool guy in this movie. It takes forever to get through this entire relationship. The sex scenes both start and end too quickly, and we are left with a boring remaining piece of the movie filled with cheesy clichés and loss of laughter. A fine actor that looks embarrassed to be in this mess is Kevin Kline, who plays Kutcher's father 'slash' former T.V. actor, a weed-smoking, body-building idiot who ends up hooking up with young, 20-year-old women. Oh, that's hilarious...not! This is a slow and cheesy romantic comedy without the heart, and without the laugh-out-loud laughs, when all we get are chuckles. When the movie tries to be heartwarming, it just leaves to be too predictable. Director Ivan Reitman should have known that this was not the right movie for him to be directing. Why should he waste his time on a useless sex comedy? I really thought that this movie was going to be okay, so I'm kind of disappointed. But everything from the useless sex scenes to the cheesy romance, I see this more as a drama, more than a romantic comedy. This movie has a great premise, but it's done in a weird point of view. Portman and Kutcher make good chemistry, but they mostly struggle during the sex scenes and emotional scenes. This movie really tried it's best to be a fun and entertaining film, but even if this movie didn't make me want to kill myself, or I wasn't thinking that I wanted to hate this movie with so much fury, it instead just made me say ""no"" to myself, and then I forgot about this movie in the next minute.

"No ""When Harry Met Sally""","In 1989, the classic rom-com ""When Harry Met Sally"" posed the question of whether a guy and a gal could just be friends without sex getting in the way. A little over two decades later, ""No Strings Attached"" asks whether they can just have sex without love taking over. Of course, we are now in the age when so many rom-coms are much more sexually explicit and here we have an excessive number of references to body parts and sexual activity. Yet there is very little visual explicitness and the only naked body on show is male.Diminutive (5' 3"") Natalie Portman is obviously trying to do something totally different from her intense role in ""Black Swan"" as Emma, a doctor with commitment issues, and, pretty though she is, this is not a natural role for her. Tall (6' 2"") Ashton Kutcher is more at home as Adam, an aspiring television writer who is originally willing to go along with the sex-only partnership. Like ""When Harry Met Sally"", ""No Strings Attached"" is written by a woman (Elizabeth Meriwether) and directed by a veteran of comedy films (Ivan Reitman) but it is not in the same class, while still being moderately funny and engaging.",,Anonymous,Romance

"It's cute, it's just not cute enough.","In the film, Ashton Kutcher plays Adam, a stand by assistant for a TV show who, after finding out his dad is dating his ex-girlfriend, calls up all the women on his phone until someone agrees to sleep with him. The next day, he passes out naked on the couch in a home of his once Summer camp friend Emma (Played by Natalie Portman). She's a medical resident in L.A. who's overly frightened of the concept of a real relationship. Together, the two of them create a system for themselves to use each other for sex at any time, until one of them falls for each other.I wanted to like No Strings Attached more than I actually did. It's not terrible, but I really think there was so much untapped potential. First problem with the film is the script and tone. The film can't decide whether it wants to be a serious romance, or a silly, sometimes raunchy Rom-Com. The serious bits are probably the more interesting, but the film just flip flops from charming to dull too often.The only real glimmer of hope is Natalie Portman. Emma is not that well written a character, but someone as energetic and charismatic as Portman brings full enjoyability out of it. It's hard to keep your eyes off of her in any scene she's in. However, despite moments of sentimental chemistry between her and Kutcher, the romance feels contrived, and not much of the other cast are that great. Even talents like Kevin Kline and Olivia Thirlby can't bring much out of their inconsistently written characters.Overall, No Strings Attached is not that great, but as a date night popcorn flick... you're still probably better off choosing something else.I give it ** out of ****",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

No Strings Attached: Another Ashton Kutcher film.  That may be all you need to know.,"Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland""No Strings Attached"" is about as good as any Ashton Kutcher movie could be. Surprisingly directed by Ivan Reitman (Up in the Air, Ghostbusters) and starring the aforementioned Ashton Kutcher (Dude, Where's My Car?, That 70s Show) and Natalie Portman (seriously, what is she doing in this movie?! She was the lead in ""Black Swan"" for god sakes!) as two twenty-something's who make an arrangement , as an alternative to dating, to simply use each other for sex with, you guessed it, ""no strings attached"". And as a result, this played out premise leaves audiences with; you guessed it, ""much to be desired"". This film also costars Kevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda, The Ice Storm) in the worst role of his career (yes, worst than ""Wild Wild West""), but I will talk more about him later in this review.Side Note: Another startling revelation about ""No Strings Attached"" is that Elizabeth Meriwether (a writer whom I have been hearing was the next great female screenplay writer in Hollywood) was responsible for writing this amateurish (at best) script. Here is all you need to know. This is a romantic comedy, with very little comedy and almost no romanticism at all. Have you ever seen a romantic comedy where you don't want to two main characters to get together in the end? No? Well, this might be the first.Dear Natalie Portman, I know you probably had tons of fun making ""No Strings Attached"", much more fun than the audience did watching it, but please go back to making serious dramas. This was not a good career move and you have a child to worry about now. So throw Ashton and Demi's phone number away and sign on for ""Black Swan 2"" before it's too late.Signed, The dwindling number of fans you have left.Natalie Portman, is a really great actress and makes the most out of this poorly written character (one of the only reasons to see this movie), but if the movie is not very good then who cares how well she did, really. In fact many of the female performances in this movie are not bad, but the male performances from Kutcher and Kline are so whiny and pathetic (Meriwether's fault) that this film is borderline offensive to men (or anyone with eyes or ears for that matter).Back to Kevin Kline. What Kline has done here is literally taken his career out back and shot it in the head. His character is working with the most distracting dialogue; spewing non sequiturs as if the audience is supposed to think he is quirky or something when all it is, is confusing. It gets to the point where, every time he is on screen, it is literally the most awkward point in movie history.Final Thought: By this point, you know if ""No Strings Attached"" is a movie for you or not. If all you need in a movie experience is to see Ashton Kutcher's butt, then by all means this is the movie for you. Again, I don't blame Kutcher for this movie, because by now it is clear that he is only capable of playing the same role over and over again.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

"Portman is great, the rest not so much","In this comedy, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) are life-long friends who almost ruin everything by having sex one morning. In order to protect their friendship, they make a pact to keep their relationship strictly ""no strings attached."" ""No strings"" means no jealousy, no expectations, no fighting, no flowers, no baby voices. It means they can do whatever they want, whenever they want, in whatever public place they want, as long as they don't fall in love. The questions become - Can you have sex without love getting in the way? And can their friendship survive?Now, let me start this by saying that I'm a huge fan of Natalie Portman. She's, in my opinion, the best actress out there, by a long shot. Every film she's in is that much better because of her and she has given some amazing performances throughout her career. Suffice to say I have seen everything she has done so far and felt obliged to watch No Strings Attached as well. However, I had really low expectations for this film. Let's be honest, comedies usually suck, let alone romantic comedies starring Ashton Kutcher. Honestly, I was entertained by the film but it's your run of the mill rom-com. The plot is extremely predictable, the jokes for the most part are silly, childish and not clever at all, and the film uses the same formula of every comedy that has come from Hollywood in the last decade. There's even the goofy sidekick to provide comic relief.Regarding the acting I thought Kutcher did an OK job but he never truly gives himself into the character. In short he was a bit wooden. Portman on the other hand, can do no wrong. I think the reason why I was able to somewhat enjoy the film was definitely her presence and with any other actress this film would have been much worse. All in all, it's a formulaic rom-com that benefits from one of its lead actors but it's still a very weak effort.6.5/10",,Anonymous,Romance

The Vidiot Reviews...,"No Strings AttachedIf there is no string attached, you must seek immediate medical attention, or you could suffer toxic shock.Oops! Apparently, this is a romantic-comedy about two acquaintances deciding to engage in a sexual relationship sans emotions, and not a how-to on proper tampon remove.After discovering his father is dating his ex, Adam (Ashton Kutcher) goes into a spiral.While corkscrewing his way to the bottom, he's reintroduced to a childhood crush, Emma (Natalie Portman).Unwilling to date, Emma does agree to become his bed buddy – insisting that they call it off once one of them develops feelings for the other.Needles to say, it's not long until one reneges on their promise.What might have been a sardonic statement on a seedy sexual scenario is instead a flatlinning facsimile of every other cliché-ridden rom-com.Besides, there is more to relationships than just sex - there are also the loud arguments.

No!! Why'd I watch it??!!,"For starters, the answer for that question is because I expected a funny, light, sit-down-and-laugh comedy. But what'd I get? A boring, slow, and simply very bad teaching-movie-wannabe.I think the fact that I wanted to stop watching even after about 20 minutes kind of describes my image of this film. It was very hard to not do so, because the movie was full of boring, bad cut scenes which are often awkward, too. I could not laugh at all.I suspect the main problem here is that it wanted to be too serious. It certainly shouldn't have. The theme just doesn't allow that, at least not for a this kind of movie without a really surprising twist in the story. This is why the movie was so slow, instead of funny. This atmosphere spoiled the jokes. The creators must've felt it, and that's why they made a pathetic attempt after the actual ending (which, of course, is a predictable one).It also lacks a lot when it comes to the characters. They're very unnatural and badly depicted. The best example for that is Adam'coworker. I absolutely could not understand her part in the movie. The acting was also bad, but it hardly could've been better with other actors.Overall, I found this movie to be very artificial and empty. I advise you don't watch especially if you want a comedy. A better choice'd be Friends with Benefits of this kind.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance

It's bad.,"I am a huge Natalie Portman fan although,Attempting to review this as enjoyable or to treat it as if there was any dignity from anyone involved is impossible for me. My hesitation kept me away for long, now I have watched it for the first time just recently... I don't like to troll websites but this movie, screenplay, script, the writing or whatever, is so bad I made an account on IMDb just to voice my utter disgust (first and most likely last).No Strings Attached was embarrassing to watch as well as it was the first ""wow can I have the last 2 hours of my life back"" movie I have watched in a long time (I watch tons of movies). It was not a feel good date movie, it was actually painful.My advice to the stars is save B grade movies for the B grade actors. Should have casted Kevin Sorbo and Lucy Lawless. Would have been much more suitable, as well there would not have been any expectations.In short, watch it, but know that a 31 year old male from Canada didn't like it.P.S.

Awful. Just awful.,"If you can't make an individual movie, if you have no new ideas, if you are going to totally set bases on previous love-comedies and make a very bad, very improvised film, then just don't try it at the first place: ""No strings attached"" is the case for all things mentioned above. Very predictable plot, total absence of humor, bad dialogues. This is a very, very handy movie.You may want to see this film because it's new, and the female face of the year -Natalie Portman- is the star alongside Ashton Kutcher (who, incidentally, probably was the only decent thing around). But it is guaranteed that you will just throw away about two hours of yours. I strongly advise you not to do it. This is a bad movie, hoping to gain profit from the star names and the copy-paste of the script from previous films, almost copy-paste of the previous lines. Vwry predictable film, painly not funny, a waste of time. Awful.P.S.You just need to see two scenes to realise how terrible this movie is, and how lucks any sense of humor: the scene where Natalie Portman wears the 3-D glasses on, and the other where one of her colleagues shouts ""we are sluts, Emma! We are sluts!"". Are you serious people? Things like these may would have been funny if they were not that ground-breaking (if someone watches this, surely they'll understand what I mean by saying that)! Nevertheless, it was much more than clear that the film authors just wanted to introduce some things like these, no matter if they fit or what. What the hell? Some people will find it amusing anyway, it's sure. But whether people generally like it or not, many of them surely will pay the price for the ticket, by the time they see the names of the cast.

Ashton Kutcher still can't act,"One of the most hum drum movies ever produced No Strings Attached is a lackluster comedy that plods along to its very predictable ending.The story revolves around the friendship with benefits between Adam(Ashton Kutcher) and Emma(Natalie Portman). They try to keep up this purely physical relationship but it is not long before the emotional attachment kicks in. The rest is predictable.For a romantic comedy there are very few laughs in this film and Ashton Kutcher is one of the most one dimensional non actors to ever become a star, every film he plays the same slacker trying to find love.

"Close, but no cigar","** out of (****)Ivan Reitman's latest Hollywood cash cow, ""No Strings Attached"", looks like a humorous, offbeat comedy that'll make you chuckle here and there, and maybe tug on some heart strings (pun intended). You do get that here, but that's pretty much it. Don't get me wrong, this is a pretty decent film that just so happens to rise above the average rom-com, but given its potential, it could use a few tweaks. The film starts out as a slick comedy with some clever one-liners and an awkward tone, but as it progresses, it gets a little formulaic and then you think to yourself, didn't I see this before? See, this a tough film to review because I did enjoy the movie, and I understand Reitman's intentions, but I don't think he fully pulled off what he set out to do. I suppose you should venture out to see this movie if you have a date. It seems like any romantic comedy coming out in February will just be very dopey and syrupy.No Strings Attached revolves around Adam (Kutcher) who's father is cheating on his ex- girlfriend. Meanwhile, Adam runs into the girl at a party that he met at camp when he was younger. Emma (Portman) decides to solve the problem with one key element: sex. So, Emma and Adam promise to have a physical relationship, but to limit themselves to friends. Kind of like friends with benefits. But, can they stay just friends? What if one is attracted to the other?First off, the script is sharp. That's what makes this movie shine. The jokes are witty, to-the- point, and very funny. I laughed out loud here and there. It's definitely one of the funnier movies out there. Furthermore, the performers were solid. Portman can be sexy, hysterical, and charming all at the same time. Kutcher was surprisingly fun and just went along with the ride. The supporting characters also shined. The cast was just great.Now the bad. While I loved Kutcher and Portman, I didn't really see any chemistry between the two. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't buy into it. Furthermore, the second half plays exactly like an American soap opera, just with a few funny gags thrown in there for good measure. Also, I thought the movie dragged a little toward the end. But I would prefer the film to run a little long than way too short.All in all, ""No strings attached"" could've been worse. Thank God the characters this time around were charismatic, the script was well-written, and the gags packed a punch. However, given the talents behind the camera, the outcome should've been stronger. Nevertheless, this year doesn't stick out like a sore thumb. First, we had ""The Green Hornet"" which was a refresher in the action/comedy department. Now we have ""No strings attached"" which is a refresher (the first half anyway) in the rom-com department. I'd stick with a matinée or a rental on this one. It is worth seeing at least once.Note: Also, couldn't this film been a PG-13? The sex was minimal, and even then, it was just quick cut-aways with no nudity, except for Kutcher's behind. Had some f bombs been excised, I can swear on it this film could've been a PG-13. It doesn't matter, just wanted to point that out.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

"Bland, tasteless, predictable","Two friends, Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher), decide to have a pact where they would have casual sex whenever they needed it, and not bring in emotional baggage and work that goes into building an actual relationship; i.e., sex with 'no strings attached'.This is one of three prominent movies around casual sex and 'friends with benefits' that popped up in 2011. 'Friends with Benefits' starring Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake follows a similar thread. 'Love and Other Drugs' starring Jake Gyllenhall and Anne Hathaway also apparently started out in the same vein, but developed into something between a drama around Parkinsons and a Viagara drug biopic.

There was something missing...,"This is basically your typical run-of-the-mill romantic comedies. There is nothing innovating or new to be seen or experienced throughout the course of this movie, and that makes the movie experience less than adequate.The story in ""No Strings Attached"" is as oh-so-many other romantic comedies; a guy and a girl from two very different aspects of life come together and find love. But of course, the budding love is not to be had that easily, they have to overcome the obstacle between them and true bliss. Sounds familiar? Yeah, it does, doesn't it?As for the acting in the movie, then they had managed to put together a good enough ensemble of people. However, there wasn't really much working chemistry between Natalie Portman and Ashton Kutcher on the screen, and it didn't work all that well in favor of the movie. It was a shame that Cary Elwes only had such a small role in the movie, and I would have liked to seen more of Kevin Kline.This movie may be well worth your time if you are a big fan of these ""off the assembly line"" romantic comedies.

No much feeling attached after watching it,"""No strings attached"" is the typical easy romantic comedy in which not much happens throughout the film, not in the plot nor in the emotions given.So Emma and Adam are two extravagant teenagers that meet at a summer camp, they share a weird conversation and then meet again throughout the years. They like each other, but Emma keeps on running away, as she doesn't want to get involved. Then one night, when Adam finds out that his ex-girlfriend is now dating his dad, he gets drunk and goes to Emma's apartment, gets undressed and passes out. The day after they have sex for the first time, they like it so much (you wouldn't say though) that they decide to be sex friends, thinking that they won't get involved.I seriously can't find much I liked about this film. First of all the main characters: Emma is cold and detached, she has some clear issues which are never really clarified (apart from her mum saying ""sweetie, you don't have to worry about me anymore...""). Adam is attractive and that's it; he seemed to suffer for the situation, especially considering his father going through a ""Peter Pan"" crisis, but I could not feel for him much.The plot is supposed to be easy, of course, but the things that happen go beyond, they are just ridiculous. At the end the entire film is a continuous swing from absurd to sappy situations. One watch is more than enough...",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""No Strings Attached"" is silly and you can't even be surprised by this cliché result. At least is not offensive like others of the genre and may fun the audience sometimes","Anyone who has ever been in a turbulent relationship or even had a closer relationship with people who weren't very lucky in love must have caught themselves idealizing a relationship without commitments. Each one on their own, just a date, a dinner, a ballad whenever they feel like it. Casual sex. Natalie Portman's character in ""No Strings Attached"" is one of those people. His partner in the film, Asthon Kutcher, is the romantic type, but agrees, even if he is wary, to live in a relationship without attachment. A friendship with benefits. Just having sex, without expectations or demands. For the adventurous couple, it looks like it will be easy, but not even they know how long it will last. A man who passes by them on the street already uses common sense: it's impossible to succeed.This is probably the film's biggest problem: it surrounds the concept of non-relationship with impossibilities all the time. It's the couple's friends who start a traditional courtship, it's her sister who's sincerely happy because she's getting married, it's her father who jumps from branch to branch, but who doesn't give up on having a partner. Thus, the film is content with just proving a theory. If everyone, except the protagonists, knows that it is difficult not to get involved, not to fall in love in a situation like the one the main couple lives in, why make the film? ""No Strings Attached"" doesn't offer a discussion and loses points for it. However, there are attractions. The jokes are good, the soundtrack works (it has Phoenix!) and the direction is much more solid than one can expect from a director like Ivan Reitman, whose last film that can be considered good is ""Ghostbusters 2"", 1989. And he seems to have a personal motivation for making the film, as he makes a rare cameo as the director of the TV series that satirizes ""High School Musical,"" which Kutcher's character works on.Directed by veteran Ivan Reitman (who appears in one part as director of a ""High School Musical""-style television show) after five years without directing a feature (the last one was the average ""My Super Ex-Girlfriend""), the film introduces the couple of protagonists still in their teens, taking the chance to draw the fragile and one-dimensional personality lines that would come to define the characters for the rest of the narrative - unless, of course, when sudden and sudden changes are required. Jumping back in time to college, when they meet again at a party and reconnect with absurd speed, the film hints at the line of humor it intends to adopt when Emma (Natalie Portman, from ""Black Swan"") invites Adam (Ashton Kutcher , from ""New Year's Eve"") to join her on ""a boring family thing"" - but it's not until the next scene that we realize that the invitation's sole purpose was to create an awkward (and supposedly funny) situation at a wake that it would only be possible if the two characters were tremendously stupid, since it wouldn't take much effort to think of several ways to prevent or dodge that embarrassment. To make matters worse, before jumping once again in time to the present day, Emma turns to the boy and says: ""Adam, you're a great person. If you're lucky, you'll never find me again"", revealing that conventions more rooted rom-coms won't be ignored either. All this in less than ten minutes of projection.Stuck with a character who is said to be averse to serious relationships, but who is periodically contradicted by her own actions (preparing the ground for a predictable third act), Natalie Portman tries to give Emma some weight, but is constantly sabotaged by the script. Ashton Kutcher, dull and without charisma, ends up stuck with a type already exploited to exhaustion: the son of a financially successful man who needs to strive to prove his worth, disconnect from his father's image and achieve success through his own merit. - and it goes without saying that the relationship with the father (Kevin Kline) goes from bad to worse (only until the scene where the patriarch ends up in the hospital - yes, it exists here too). Thus, when the central couple has sex for the first time, and repeatedly, the situation is intensified not only because we do not know the characters well, but also because we judge that they would act differently, even for the little we know about them (in adolescence, Emma doesn't even allow Adam to touch her, and at the college Slumber Party, she is criticized by her friend for wearing pajamas while all the other women wear lingerie).However, the protagonist couple's conflicts are treated sparingly in the film based on the direct presentation, in which the actors assert the words of the script that describe a needy man and a proud woman. And from that comes the comedy, in how the being of each of the characters is gradually revealed in this longing for sex as a direct escape from the also explicit difference between them, and even though the spectator knows that there will be dating, he also knows that there is something that will classically stop them. But what impresses, in addition to how the actors naturalize the script, is how director Ivan Reitman still manages to use this romantic comedy dynamic to his advantage, directing which emphasizes the interpretive capacity of the two actors. If Natalie Portman manages to transform herself more intensely into her character, the comedy emerges in how she lives the incongruity of establishing sex without commitment to have time at work the longer she wants to take time in bed. Ashton Kutcher is the one who submits himself to non-commitment with expectation precisely for acting in similar tones. Because the characters never really date, it's always an attempt to disguise each one's personality with gestures of commitment and disengagement, like the scene in the soundtrack about menstruation and the visit to take satisfaction from betrayal. What really makes these scenes funny are the performances, where Natalie Portman uses all of her voice performance and physical improvisation skills for comedy, while Ashton uses her pretty face to quip or uses physical humor to punch walls and bang her head. Head on the table. And since both characters are grounded in reality, these actions really shatter expectations.If the protagonists even do well, we have a gallery of predominantly bad secondary characters. The highlight ends up being the clumsy Lucy (Lake Bell), Adam's co-worker who demonstrates unconditional admiration for the boy and active dedication to his work, without leaving aside a certain shyness and innocence (note, for example, how she briefly hints at intention of hugging Adam right after breaking the news that he was hired as a screenwriter) - and it is a pity, therefore, that she is used as a device to prolong the couple's second crisis (yes, there are two of them: one sexual and one a sentimental one). In addition, the film is also flawed in most attempts at humor - and, thus, we are forced to see absolutely irrelevant or even inexplicable scenes created just to try to generate laughter and extend our suffering, as when Adam presents Emma with a balloon with ""congratulations"" written or when she hits all the holes in a game of minigolf, even if she's a beginner. And, concerned about sounding funny, a montage showing Emma and Adam's various sexual encounters ends up violating basic logic by showing a conversation about ""emergency contacts"" happening continuously on two different dates.In the midst of all these distractions, the few traces of a dramatic arc are always fragile, mainly due to Emma's apathy for relationships, which sounds incoherent and without foundation. If at one moment she describes her symptoms at the mere mention of a relationship as being the same as those of a peanut allergy, at another she looks enchanted at a couple of lovers or emphatically praises Adam, as when he tells one of his ex-girlfriends that ""if I had to choose (between Adam and other men), I would always choose him."" Without presenting reasons or even valid arguments that prevent her from actually starting a relationship with anyone (at a certain point, it is suggested that her father's death has made her a more closed person, even though she has already demonstrated the behavior in adolescence, years before the event), the only artifice in the script to make us believe this is to have Portman repeating the observation, which, in fact, is just a contradictory line in the description of her character. And when Emma, after an unsatisfactory phone call with Adam, receives permission from her sister to run after him only to catch him with someone else, we see that the film is already lost for good.Ending with a pathetic lesson on ""how to behave in a relationship"" and with funny scenes during the end credits (which have become practically a law in films of the genre), this film is perhaps similar to the teen production in which Adam works: it may even have entertained the crew during production, but the end result is embarrassing.It's hard to be so merciless with a film that has always been announced to be unsatisfactory.Expecting anything from ""No Strings Attached"" is silly and you can't even be surprised by this apathetic result. It's another one of those unsatisfactory romantic comedies that don't get to offend anyone, but neither have any reason to be remembered or even recommended. Now, it's up to you to choose: is it better to watch this feature carefree, already knowing that it is nothing, or to watch it taking the trouble to notice any and all flaws?",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Great Scott!!!,Just finished watching friends with benefits the other day and it was quite entertaining.. so thinking of watching another similar plot movie... no strings attached was the recommended movie which was release the same year 2011Let's get back to the review to be honest I find this rather boring.. no doubt about that Natalie Portman and Aston Kutcher put on stellar performance but still the plot is thin and the chemistry just wasn't that goodThe first 15 minutes intro and the last 15 minutes of the movie is fun to watch but the middle part was mediocreHence the rating is lower than friends with benefit on IMDb but still deserve a one time viewing.. the other things I like is Kevin Kline who is hilarious and deserves a praise for his performance.,5.0,Anonymous,Romance
No Strings Attached,"5/10 - they were able to assemble such a terrific cast for this promising rom-com, but the script needed some serious doctoring",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Boring and unbelievable,"This is a good idea for a film, but this attempt to do such a story is a pathetic failure. It's not as bad as Friends with Benefits, which has the same storyline, but it's still awful.None of the characters are likable - and there's no chemistry between the two leads. They're a boring pair with little in the way of personalities.This film tries to be a romcom which turns into a serious drama. However, it fails to be any good at either.It's very disappointing to see Natalie Portman act so badly in this - putting in so little effort - just after her brilliant performance in Black Swan.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
Nothing Special,"There's nothing special or different in this film. If anything Natalie Portman plays the ""guy"" in the relationship. As Portman and Kutcher, who are barely friends, decide to have a causal sex relationship only... There's nothing very funny in it to become a comedy. There's no real story line other then the relationship between the two. The only enjoyable thing about the movie are the two leads - great actors.

Detachment,"Sometimes a bit of attachment isn't that bad. And while I love Natalie Portman and she tries her best with her role, too many stock characters seem to fill the movie.

You either like him or you loathe him. I wouldn't say he's bad, but there's nothing special in his performance here either. Kevin Kline seems to be wasted also (another one of those stock characters).Still you get light fun, romance and comedy mixed together. So not bad, but nothing special either.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance

Really freaking horrible.,"There might've been one or two things that were actually funny in the movie, but for real this is one of the worst movies I have sat through in a long long time. Willingly sharing sexual affairs with one's parents is just disgusting, not funny at all. Natalie Portman played a pretty terrible character and normally I like her in many movies, but she acted obnoxiously on screen! The acting in general from everybody else was inexcusably bad too, and all it was was a shallow cliche story with side plots that felt like a nuisance, yet I'm also happy that it distracted from the main plot since not even that was worth watching! I kind of hate myself for putting this on my watchlist.",2.0,Anonymous,Romance
"""Love & Other Drugs"" void of real content","If you like Ashton's kind of humor, then you might find this movie appealing. But if you don't like it, then don't let the presence of Kevin Kline and Nathalie Portman fool you. This is a bad movie!I just recently watched ""Love & Other Drugs"" and my first thoughts were that it was a porno flick with a plot, but then it progressed to a representation of someone's struggle with relationships due to her health condition. So there was a very nice psychological content for me to play with and get my mind off the sexual content. So ""No Strings Attached"" kind of follows the same premise, but it never develops into a grown up subject because it keeps its very dumb sense of humor as the biggest priority.Yet again, if drunkenness - badly played, by the way - and references to ones genitals are your idea of a good laugh, then it's fine. If you favor other things, then stay away.",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Almost a good Kutcher film, but no cigar.","Mitch Hansch/ movieswithmitch.comNow close your eyes. Imagine planning the perfect romantic night at home for your love. They come home to a spic and span house/apartment that you've meticulously cleaned all day. Those pecan scented candles they love are everywhere even though you have a minor allergy. A sensual CD mix of Neil Diamond and Lil' Wayne nobody thought would ever work but does plays as he or she follows the trail of rose petals leading to the kitchen where a seven course meal of everything they desire the most is waiting for them, finishing with that Warm Chocolate Chip Lava Cookie Maple Butter Blondie they had at that fancy restaurant that one time that blew their friggen mind! You can't believe how perfect the night has gone. They've got that look in their eye like they're going to do that thing to your ear that you've only read about in books but first your loved one requests a romantic movie to clinch the night before you retire to the bedroom. You reply, ""one step ahead of you my love. I bought ""Just Married"" for us to watch"" (she or he shakes their head no). No worries I also got ""My Boss's Daughter"" just in case. No? O.K., what about ""What Happens in Vegas"", or ""Valentine's Day"", or ""Killers"" (all angry no's as your mate grabs the car keys and says they and the kids will be staying with their mother for a while.You blew it! That's what you get for shopping in the bargain bin.Sorry I had to paint such a long illustration but it's important to know how the most perfect of efforts can be spoiled by one big mistake. In this case, the Kutcher mistake. Fair to say I'm not a big fan of his screen efforts. I'd rather be Scott Bakula's Dr. Sam Beckett from a ""Quantum Leap"" episode stuck as a roadie at the Lilith Fair than watch his movie marathon. Oh boy. But each effort deserves a fresh slate of honest criticism and alas, Kutcher does rise...as much as he can rise in ""No Strings Attached."" His performance here is the most sweet and effective I've seen him, really making you feel for the bugger. Don't want to give a back handed compliment but you play better when you have better to play with and he's never had as good as Natalie Portman to play with (pun intended) (no disrespect Katherine Heigl...o.k. a little disrespect).Kutcher plays the overly sweet Adam who's an assistant for a High School Musical/ Glee type show but is really an aspiring writer and Portman plays Emma the self-professed emotional peanut-like allergic to relationships who's a doctor that works 80-hour weeks. Adam and Emma have been running into each other off and on for the past 15 years and when attraction erupts they agree to be nothing more than friends with benefits, if you know what I mean, and I think you do. Will they amount to more than just sex friends? Of course they will because Elizabeth Meriwether's first time screenplay is as formulaic as it gets. You know how it's going to play out from the beginning. ""No Strings Attached"" is a film that tries to go outside of the box with its crass dialog but it doesn't hold a dirty erotic dripping on the chest melting candle a la ""Body of Evidence"" to a Judd Apatow script which it desperately wants to be. Meriwether's script also suffers from overstaying its welcome on a honest, funny, or touching moment; not trusting the audience's intelligence. At the helm here is famed Ghostbusters's and Dave's director Ivan Reitman, who is just as much to blame for this. Rietman, who has more blunders than triumphs as the director, fails to take the opportunity to give this generation a relevant twist on the rom-com.Supporting characters do go along way. Kevin Kline, Greta Gerwig, Jake M. Johnson, and Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges add a lot of comedic touches. I especially liked Lake Bell's nerdy timid performance as Adam's boss a great deal. But the real praise goes to Natalie Portman. Coming off of her Golden Globe win and probable Oscar win for ""Black Swan"", Portman takes to raunchy comedy in a way that we've rarely see her. Portman lights up the screen in a hilarious and sexy way, extending her incredible range as one of the most bankable actresses in the business.With that said, I still can't recommend a film laden with all its obvious contrivances and missteps. Add ""No Strings Attached"" to the bargain bin of romantic night don't's.Add ""this"" to the bargain bin of romantic night don't's. Proverbs 5:17-23",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
"Okay for what it is, but incredibly blimpish","Of course I didn't expect a subversive movie, when I started watching ""No Strings Attached"", but parts of it seemed unintentionally blimpish considering how hard the movie strives to be the exact opposite. With the working title ""F*** Buddies"" later changed to ""Friends With Benefits"" then changed to the final title, ""No Strings Attached"" obviously sells itself as a liberal kind of romantic comedy, one that acknowledges the lifestyle of modern, young people. Boy does it miss its mark.Firstly, it's so incredibly old, boring and simply unbelievable to have characters in a movie who fit together perfectly and are happy with each other, BUT for some reason are afraid of relationships and the three words ""I love you"". I don't buy it, and I don't wanna see it anymore. It's the biggest RomCom cliché ever and I don't people have ever enjoyed seeing it. So can we please stop having it in romantic movies?Secondly, the way the movie promotes equal rights is just phony. For instance, there is a gay character, who just serves one purpose: to show how the movie is okay with gay people. It's the definition of token. That character plays no role in the movie whatsoever, and still there's a couple of scenes where the joke is on him, not least the first time we get to see him and are to assume for a second that Ashton Kutcher had a drunken one night stand with him. The reaction the movie wants from us in that moment is to go: ""Oh my gosh! Kutcher had sex with that ugly fairy!"" And frankly, that's just insulting. I'm going a bit off topic now, but it's kind of like that moment in ""Paul"" where the alien makes vulgar gestures that reference anal sex between two men first, and then ""redeems"" itself by saying: ""It's okay, I don't mind gay people."" It is still disrespectful, goddammit!Thirdly, the movie thinks it's progressive, because Kutcher is the emotional guy in the relationship, whereas Portman is distanced, concentrates on her career and then in the end turns out to be the one who has to fight to get the guy back. You know, the classic pattern, but with the genders switched. Only problem: It's AT LEAST 10 years too late for that! This is nothing new, dear makers of this movie! If anything, it's a pretty sad testimonial to how long it took for Hollywood to realize that people can think outside the box of what is the expected behavior of men and women.Well, having said all that, I have to admit that the movie is not incredibly bad. In fact, if you like Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman, you're probably going to get a couple of laughs out of this. Kevin Kline is wasted, Ivan Reitman is nowhere near the top of his game, the script has a thousand flat characters and some cringe-worthy scenes (the period-mix tape, anyone?) but yeah, ""No Strings Attached"" has its amusing moments, too. It's just a bit hard to enjoy them, when the movie's general mindset leaves such a bad taste in your mouth.",5.0,Anonymous,Romance
Seen this film a hundred times before.,"Guy falls for girl. Girl just wants to have sex. Girl falls for guy but doesn't realize it and screws it up. Girl tries to fix things. Girl and guy fall in love at the end. This plot can be used for 85% of the romantic comedy films that are out there today. Just switch the who falls for who part first and you have your movie. You need one aspect of the film that makes it different and gives the viewer a reason for wanting to see it. This film's reason? Two attractive people using each other for sex. Let the fun begin.No Strings Attached has the benefit of coming out before the carbon copy that is Friends With Benefits. The exact same plot line about people using each other for sex, which causes problems. The dueling films have a bit of irony to them. Natalie Portman stars in No Strings Attached and Mila Kunis stars in Friends With Benefits. So it looks like the duel for the spotlight from Black Swan isn't over and these two films make round 2.No Strings Attached is Ivan Reitman's first R rated comedy since Stripes. The reason the film is rated R is because they use the F-Word a dozen times. Did that make the film funnier? Not really. If a film is rated R for the language, than I think it should use that to the film's advantage, this film didn't do that. The only bits of comedy that I enjoyed were the scenes with Kevin Kline, who plays Ashton Kutcher's father. He's a famous guy who had one successful show and catchphrase. His success draws the attention of one hot young lady, who coincidentally is Kutcher's ex-girlfriend. This revelation sends Kutcher on a drunken spree where he finds himself waking up naked on Portman's couch. They then decide to have sex and use each other for sex whenever, wherever.There is a bit of conflict with this one guy who claims to be the type of guy that Portman would marry, while Kutcher is only the type of guy she has sex with in secret. This drama is never explored, it sets itself up to be nothing in the end. There have been quite a bit of films as of late that follow the trend of the female wanting to use the male for sex while he yearns for something more. Love & Other Drugs did the exact same thing, the problem with that film was that it couldn't balance comedy and drama very well. No Strings Attached has problems finding comedy to balance.Portman is cute, as always. Kutcher is goofy, as always. The supporting cast outshines the main cast, as always. I didn't care if they ended up together in the end. I didn't care about their fights and I didn't care about the hot sex they would have. I simply did not care for this movie. It's clichéd, generic, cookie-cutter, whatever you want to call it. It's a film that you have seen a dozen times before. The question you need to ask yourself is does the prospect of Kutcher and Portman having nonstop sex interest you?",4.0,Anonymous,Romance
A one-time watch show,"I did not find this movie the way I thought I would (or you could say ""expected to be""). The title cover is beautiful and implies soft romantic emotions between the characters but all I found was that the lead woman was pushing the man away, all the time. Romance was not up to the mark. I felt like the man was being treated unfair. He was sweet all the time and goofy, too. But I did not like the way he was being treated (as the actor, of course ;) )Instead of Emma, I liked her friend, Patrice. She was real pretty.

However, as most movies such as this, I figured I'd get a few laughs in and perhaps a feeling of giddiness. Well, that didn't happen. The movie started off raunchy, and awkward and for the most part it continued this way. Toward the middle of the movie I was just completely disgusted by the jokes and was just waiting for it to end. The movie was just all wrong.

You FELL When No Strings Attached,"There are only two reasons you go to watch thiz movie. First bcoz of ""Black Swan"" (2010), you want to see Natalie Portman! Or you're one of those who think Ashton Kutcher is cute! The story follows Adam (Kutcher) and Emma (Portman) who are friends since childhood. Somehow they promise to use each other for physical reason which is sex! It's exactly what Anne Hathaway did with Jake Gyllenhaal recently in ""Love and Other Drugs"" (2010). They want sex, but in the process to that they find something more special. Kutcher has fun and easy-going character (where he did just well most of the time). On the other hand, Portman gives a balancing to their interaction. It's good, not bad at all for sure, but it's like using big Bazooka to kill a little bird, completely waste of talent. The movie comes from the Director who is the father of ""Ghostbusters"" (1984) and Arnie's ""Kindergarten Cop"" (1990). The fun factor is still on the air for about half hour of the beginning, we could still feel the excitement and freshness, afterwards the movie becomes a never-ending boredom. In my note, what happened to modern Rom-Coms nowadays, it's almost impossible, making movie without raising Gay Issues. For example in thiz movie, one of Portman's best friends is gay, and so with one of Kutcher's best friends also has gay parents. Another factor that occurs to most of modern Rom-Coms lately is the use of vulgar words and irreverent dialogue, it's totally unbearable, including thiz one. By the way, if you came to see Portman being naked in the first place. Well, instead of that, you get Kutcher being naked! It's pretty ugly for the one who expects more.

No Zing Attached,"Yeah, while watching, I really felt very disappointed, what a bummer this one is. You expect so much, much more from Natalie Portman. But then, some time after the halfway mark, there is a marked improvement fueled by that restaurant scene, let's call it the Burning Man conversation, with Emma telling Vanessa the score exactly as it is, and swaying me over towards her for the first time.But prior to that (and remember what I often mention in my reviews: First Impressions Count, they define the experience you're gonna have of the movie - very few pictures improve as they go along, so judgment is made very early on), this movie, this big star-driven effort, plods along like there's A Lot Of Chains Attached.Besides Young Emma, whom I soon began thinking should rather grace the screen again, the only really cute thing during the first half is the impressions done by that Saturday Night Live girl - Nemo and Drew Barrymore. What a scene-stealer. Then, the hilarious girl-girl scene.With somebody like Ivan Reitman at the helm, you would certainly not expect that such a drab performance by the female lead would persist all through the first half. I mean, any director watching the inflow should have noticed the under-performance. ESPECIALLY if she's NATALIE PORTMAN.But do note that unlike the other reviewers here, I am pointing out that there is an improvement as the flick progresses. I was actually mentally preparing myself for the scything comments I was gonna make about this big production that fails to deliver, but Natalie (and the script) does better further on. Too late though.Truth remains, it needed, at the very least, a partial remake.And I remember only too well that decades ago I predicted such big things for Natalie after first seeing THE PROFESSIONAL. At her best in NO STRINGS ATTACHED, she is just run-of-the- mill.

Ghostbuster plus Natalie Portman does not equal When Harry met Sally plus Sophie Marceau,"Natalie Portman is an A-list actress and she definitively avoided this film to slip into the B-category. Nice job, well done. And his colleague was better than expected. But who is the target audience? When I was a teen I watched Driver's License and ""I knew"" that film was for me. When I began to enter adulthood I watched When Harry met Sally and ""I knew"" that was adulthood. Yeap, you say tomaito and I say tomahto and after twelve years, you know, that cake but with the ""on the side"" condition, etc.. And then was this 1988 French film with Sophie Marceau where she plays a grad student going on dates and looking at his watch at all times because she needs to wake up early in the morning because grown ups need to wake up early in the morning or the world stops. Yes, I love you, but I need my thesis done so don't ask me to choose between you and my career. But Emma wants sex and not love because of what? How many doctors do you know that are not married? And his sex toy wants to be his boyfriend because of what? Oh, because he fell in love from the first time! Really? And does not him understand that he has been dumped by cute Natalie Portman after the key second sex encounter? (Remember Tulips, 1981?). This is a film I loved to watch, but is not a film my PG-13 will understand nor I want her to believe that that's adulthood. Bill Murray's macho hunting plus Sigourney Weaver's feminist ""you silly boy"" smile was much more unforgettable. It became a classic.

A middle of the road Rom Com,"We meet the young friends at a party when everyone is pairing off, Emma (Portman) and Adam (Kutcher) are not together, just friends despite the ill judged, both story and script wise, vulgar comment from Adam.We spiral through a few years with the pair meeting again and then again and so forth. At no point does the relationship change until, well it does. Friends no more and now, if not lovers, then ""Friends With Benefits"" (not to be confused with film of the same name) or ""Bed Buddies"".The crux of the story is, can you have a sexual relationship with regular meetings, whenever the mood strikes, without that pesky love thing and petty jealousies getting in the way. In real life this may be more complicated to answer but in the movies, the answer to provide a three act story, is that you cannot.Adam is an assistant on what appears to be a ""Glee"" wannabe TV show. He is desperate to write but with little opportunity to do so, whilst he remains in the long shadow of his father ""Alvin"" (Kline), a much loved TV show character with his own annoying catchphrase. Dad is aging disgracefully and when he starts recycling, not paper but his sons girlfriends, their relationship understandably takes a hit.Meanwhile Emma, so buttoned up she actually does not have any buttons just in case, is the emotionally barren daughter of a equally frosty mother. Emma is a rather improbable busy hospital doctor with the obligatory movie gay friend mixing it up with her two girl flatmates, the four providing great comedic possibilities that are not really explored.There is little chemistry between the main pairing, neither are terrible but Portman is not on top form and Kutcher seemingly plays a facsimile of the real Ashton Kutcher yet again. Lake Bell as ""Lucy"", admiring Adam from not so far, is more amusing. Striking a note just a restraining order's width away from stalker and with the awkwardness to match when presented with her prey.Kline looks like he is enjoying himself but this is very lightweight film that still manages to strike the odd bum note in tone. Whatever happened to chaste comedies like ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Youv'e got Mail"", do we really need to know someone is putting on a condom?Perhaps a comedy where both parents are not rich, with expensive weddings and lives might strike more of a note with cinema-goers.It remains to be seen if the more recent ""Friends with Benefits"" strikes a better balance in tone. Certainly in this film you may find your female partner shouting, ""just what do you want lady?"", as the film draws to a close.SummaryNot without some merit but overall, a middle of the road Rom Com with the emphasis on comedy rather providing any insight on the subject matter or any real life situations.http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,Romance
it works!!,I loved it. The combination between Ashton Kutcher and Natalie Portman is full of chemistry! Put that in with a high tempo of funny events and original jokes and you got yourself a winner! Right from the start it is funny as hell. The situation grabs you and won't let you go. Personally I found it refreshing that it is a comedy based on a situation many of us can relate to (speaking of a man his perspective). Everybody wants a Friend with benefits and everybody knows the complications that comes with it. Sooner ore later you got yourself a situation like Aston got.Now the funny parts works every time in this movie. Even the supporting acts are working like a charm. Kevin Kline puts up a good character as a Father you really don't want to have.At the end the drama begins and that works for me.

Why you should and shouldn't see No Strings Attached,"The Story Emma (Portman) is afraid of relationships, so after she impulsively gets into bed with Adam (Kutcher), she suggests that they ""use each other for sex"" on an ongoing basis, on the condition that no romantic feelings are allowed. If one of them falls in love, they are to end it.The premise is nothing new, of course: Jerry and Elaine acted it out (complete with similar ""ground rules"") on Seinfeld just under twenty years ago in an episode entitled, ""The Deal,"" and it's been used many times since, on Grey's Anatomy, for example. However it's as though everyone involved took the weak premise as a challenge, and turned it into something, if not great, certainly good. The jokes are clever (some even made me laugh out loud), the two leads are charming, and it all works.Something odd Portman's friend and costar in Black Swan, Mila Kunis (who presumably also remembers Kutcher from That 70's Show) has a movie called Friends with Benefits in post-production. She and Justin Timberlake star as friends who decide to have sex without romantic entanglement. The trailer includes a premise-establishing conversation that's pretty much lifted from the script of the aforementioned ""The Deal"" episode of Seinfeld. But let's call it homage.Something eerie... Both Portman and her friend Kunis are, according to IMDb, 5'3""(1.60 m.). Kutcher is seventeen feet taller.In any case, the ""sex buddies"" storyline is now officially its own romantic comedy sub-genre.Why you should see it You like funny dialog and good acting, and are willing to look past an overused premise.Why you should avoid it You hate romantic comedies. You hate Ashton Kutcher. You hate Natalie Portman. No, scratch that last one. Not possible.--from my review at www.1man365movies.com",,Anonymous,Romance
Blaargh.,"Natalie Portman's name in the credits will lure me into any film, and when paired with the ever- so-underused Ashton Kutcher I was quite intrigued as of what was to come. My excitement, let me tell you, was all in vain. Even by romantic comedy standards, ""No Strings Attached"" is an abomination. The basic idea, two people having sex without a relationship, isn't nearly as scandalous as it hopes to be. In fact, I've seen more controversy evoked by an episode of the Teletubbies. The clichés are so over the top it becomes impossible for the viewer to let them slide. And most importantly, it lacks the most essential ingredient of a decent romantic comedy - character chemistry. I would've rather watched siblings making out.How Portman went from making Black Swan to this shall remain one of the great mysteries of mankind. Obvious Jew-jokes aside, I know this is a blockbuster movie that must have come with a big, fat paycheck. However, for an A-list actor that can hardly be the main motivator so we can only keep guessing. Perhaps the appeal was Kutcher, but as it seems like, judging by the on-screen action, she would rather have intercourse with a syphilis-ridden slug this seems quite unlikely.",,Anonymous,Romance
