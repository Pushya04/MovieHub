Hard to Watch; Hard to Look Away,"Jake Gyllenhaal is the nightcrawler. A nightcrawler is a worm. Bloom, the character played here, is a sociopath. His ambitions and fixations far outweigh common morality. Let's face it, his cohorts in the business aren't much better than he is, but they have a kind of code, and they don't participate in enhancing the crime. When Bloom moves an accident victim for the first time in order to get a better shot, he crosses the line and stays on the other side. He is willing to do anything to get his way and he is a master at monotonous monologue when he is confronted. It's as if he is reading from a book. I heard an interview recently with Gyllenhaal and he recited some of this stuff from memory with almost no emotion. This is a terrific performance by one of our really good actors. The way he is able to slide into every situation unscathed and maintain that sardonic grin is really nonpareil. This is about the voyeurism of the audience which demands this hateful kind of portrayal.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Gyllenhaal at his Best,"Nightcrawler from the very beginning is not a traditional Hollywood film. It certainly does not follow the narrative of one and even though it has the three-act structure we are all familiar with, it spins them around. This is particularly evident in the third act, incredibly suspenseful with a brilliant, almost anti-climax. Suspense is the main key to this film's success, it build and builds to the point where the last twenty minutes of the film are completely unpredictable. Dan Gilroy in his directorial debut here has shown a real understanding of how to keep an audience engaged and following a character who isn't an easy man to spend a great deal of time with. Gilroy's screenplay is fast paced and one of the finest this year. The script focuses the audience on the characters, Louis Bloom particularly yet the supporting characters are just as impressive by Bill Paxton and Rene Russo alike. It doesn't follow the rules of a typical script, we are introduced instantly to a criminal and this man is supposed to be our protagonist. Yet what becomes clear is that there is not a protagonist in Nightcrawler, Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is the antagonist. He can be described as nothing less than a psychopath and his portrayal by Gyllenhaal is one of his greatest performances. He is very gaunt here, losing a lot of weight for the role, however that is not the main reason for his impressive performance. Gyllenhaal is an actor who continues to impress me; his work in Enemy from earlier this year was just as brilliant. He has chosen excellent roles in films such as Zodiac, Prisoners and End of Watch. The cinematography is also fantastic, night-time LA has not looked this good since 2011's Drive. All these elements come together to make a captivating piece of filmmaking, a film I expect will be discussed more as time goes on.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Character study of a manipulative sociopath.,"Once Jake Gyllenhaal signed on to do Nightcrawler I knew it would be a special film. The man has been producing nothing but gold lately and this is no different. Nightcrawler is an experience - it takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of seemingly charming slimeball reporter Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal).Nightcrawler works on so many levels. The writing and direction is fantastic, which is especially impressive as it's the directorial debut by Dan Gilroy who takes on both duties. He had a clear vision of how he wanted to portray LA and the sleek, brooding yet slightly lackadaisical tone transfers perfectly onto the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance that's the polar opposite from his character in Prisoners and he was on point for every second. He was the perfect casting choice to carry the movie.The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. It's a message that has been told a million times before, but never quite like this. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou, who starts freelancing as a videographer of crime scenes and selling his footage to a news channel for money. We go along this journey with Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle, and told with enough elegance and wit to keep you on board the whole way.There's a dark comedic tone present throughout. Lou's persistence and crass remarks to basically anyone he encounters provide some good laughs. He doesn't sugarcoat anything, he'll talk to anyone in order to get his way, and he has a sleazy smirk that never fails to get a reaction. Also Gyllenhaal's chemistry with Rene Russo (the news director) is palatable and their work dynamic becomes more of a gripping co-dependency as the movie progresses.Nightcrawler is a must-watch for fans of cinema. It's a work of art from a directorial and writing standpoint, from an acting standpoint, and from a basic human nature standpoint. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world to the point where you don't want to get out. It's intense, it's funny, it's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it's real. Nightcrawler is simply sensational.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
He has no conscience...so he's a natural!,"""Nightcrawler"" is an incredibly graphic and adult film...so think twice before you watch it. The language, the violence and content is NOT something everybody will want to see...to think twice (I am saying it again just to emphasize this strongly).When the film begins, Louis (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a cheap little crook stealing and doing what he can to get by. In the process of doing this, he happens upon a film crew covering a crime scene...and Louis has found his purpose. He soon gets himself a cheap camcorder and police scanner and soon begins spending his evenings driving about LA--looking for mayhem in order to make a buck off it. As the film progresses, Louis' complete lack of ethics and conscience is shocking...especially when he begins manipulating things to make news stories and withholding police evidence in order to get the BIG story!This film is incredibly cynical in the way it shows the news. It shows the newsfolk as mostly a lot of soulless bottom-feeders--and Louis is the king of them all. And, as his videos become more and more horrific, Louis seems to be enjoying it with an almost orgiastic pleasure. I really appreciated in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. His wide-eyed almost insane look really helped his character...as did his weird, gaunt look. And, it helped that the more awful the things were that he was covering, the happier he appeared. Some excellent acting by him. Overall, a cynical, intense and difficult film that is not for everyone...and it's a logical 21st century extension of the sort of exploitative news that thrilled audiences with ""Network"".",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
A razor sharp satire with Gyllenhaal in top form,"If you take the slick look of Drive and the satirical wit of Network, you get Nightcrawler. This film is a genius first film for director Dan Gilroy, it is darkly comedic, surprisingly disturbing and is brilliantly acted. The film tells the story of Lou Bloom, a freelance videographer who covers the crime world in LA for a local news station and ruthless editor played by Rene Russo. It isn't before long until Bloom's demented job overtakes his life, making him colder and colder the deeper he goes. The film plays like a twisted bloody version of Network and has the satirical wit to back it up. Jake Gyllenhaal is utterly fantastic in this film. Lou Bloom is a role that he is completely submerged in and it oozes through every frame as our dislike for Bloom intensifies throughout the film. But what this film does best is not make us particularly like Bloom but it makes us wonder what he is willing to do next. And trust me, his actions get as sick and as shocking as they come. Bloom is a depraved individual and Jake Gyllenhaal deserves a hell of a lot acknowledgment for this role because he pulls off the tricky task of making the audience care about a character that is truly unlikeable and does so with not one false note. It is truly mesmerizing to see. The supporting cast including Rene Russo and Bill Paxton are absolutely great in this film and deliver career bests here. The cinematography also is top notch here, blending the awesome pallets of Drive with a bitter cold makes for an engaging view and makes it hard for you to peel your eyes from the screen. Writer/Director Dan Gilroy is someone to watch, especially coming out of the gates with a film filled with sheer and raw velocity like this one. It is not only an impressive first film but a brilliant film all around. I highly recommend it.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Stylishly Scary Tour de Force,"From Welles to De Niro to Hanks to Bale, Hollywood has a history of actors going through extreme body transformations. While Gyllenhaal's intense weight loss will easily fit this trend, to only focus on that part of his commitment to Nightcrawler would be overlooking how impressively gone he is as Louis Bloom, the focus of this intense character study about an overlooked and disturbed individual. It's not a particularly ""pleasant"" film, and the pacing is far from quick, but the tension between Louis and his world progresses so beautifully as to pin you right to your seat. Nightcrawler is an effectively scary, uncomfortably funny, and stylishly gritty tour de force. The premise, plot and protagonist are truly unique: a sociopath becomes a freelance news-cameraman, stopping at nothing to succeed. Though his arc seems implausible, Gilroy crafts it smoothly, and Gyllenhaal's disturbed perfection make it hard NOT to believe. His unsettling bug-eyed expression and breathtakingly inappropriate smile are magnetic. Much like Scorsese's Rupert Pupkin, Bloom seems to believe he is the star of his own story: delusional, bull-headed, and respectably determined. Luckily, there is more here than just Gyllenhaal; powerful set-pieces resound, and the beautifully cool ambient guitar score is among the best of the year, complimenting Gyllenahaal's uneasy intensity. Even the camera consistently reminds us where Bloom stands in the deeply LA locale. At the heart, it's smartly calling out our propensity for praising characters for their desires, reminding us that compassionless ambition is extremely dangerous. For our fame-starved culture, Nightcrawler is a good message within a great movie with an even greater lead performance. A true don't-miss!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Gyllenhaal does it again,"I'd like to emphasize one thing that gets me with every movie this guy is in. The acting. Jake Gyllenhaal's acting never fails to impress me. He had the crazy eyes in this movie, and to be honest, it made me look away a few times. Very eerie addition to the character, love this guy. His demeanor reminded me of his role in The Guilty. The movie itself was pretty good. I hate an open ending, but I think it fits well with the theme and meaning of the actual film. It leaves u to interpret the ending and its connection to the real world. Overall, I recommend, especially if u love a mentally unstable and uncanny Gyllenhaal role.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jake G's Blinks in Prisoners are Only Rivaled by the Weaslely Grin In Nightcrawler,"This movie was both fun and terrifying. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Lou Bloom will certainly frighten you. He is brilliant when paired with the amazing monologue style rants written for him.Lou Bloom is a driven man reminiscent of a sociopath who finds he has a talent as ""nightcrawling"" in that he takes videos of true crimes as they are happening to be broadcast on the news. His motivation and seeming lack of empathy allow him to break through and take the controversial images, and sell them with a strong aptitude for negotiation.As a character, he grows more and more ""motivated"" and seems to learn his business in such a way to bring him amazing success, but to the determinant, perhaps, of his assistant and the victims of these crimes.The writer/ director of this movie (making his directorial debut) certainly understands fear and comedy. The simplest scene was made into a laugh by the angles and cuts.It's funny, and enjoyable, but still terrifying enough to feel like a real horror thriller.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The only thing worse than a nightcrawler is the coroner in the eyes of a victim,"""Nightcrawler"" is the kind of film that will catch audiences by surprise with its painstaking thoughtfulness, and features the kind of lead character that will be discussed in film circles who don't detest American cinema and actually give it the benefit of the doubt. The film plunges us into the dark, seedy world of a nightcrawler, somebody who, often working freelance with his or her own equipment and schedule, patrols the streets of crowded cities with multiple police scanners searching for recently-committed crimes in the neighborhood, like rape, shootings, murders, car accidents, and so forth. The object of a nightcrawler is to get candid and intimate shots of the ugliness that plagues these scenarios as quickly and as neatly as possible and sell them to news stations or eyewitness programs to turn quick profit. Job requirements include possible insomniac, lack of emotional connection or any immediate empathy to tragedy or horror, exceptional navigational/driving skills, and a load of free time.Jake Gyllenhaal plays Lou Bloom, a man at rock-bottom living in Los Angeles, selling scrap metal to get money before eventually turning to the nightcrawling business. He teams up with Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man desperate to make money to keep a roof over his head, who helps navigate Lou's routes as a nightcrawler and learns of numerous police codes to help Lou decipher the police scanner jargon. Together, the two make for an amateur nightcrawling team, turning profit by selling the footage – expertly shot, analyzed, and even occasionally manipulated by Lou – to Nina (Rene Russo), the station manager of a severely failing news station that is in dire need to regain viewership.Ultimately, ""Nightcrawler"" juggles two tricky but immersing features with its material, simultaneously giving us a look into a grimy and often dirty gig as somebody who is essentially a voyeur into the most vulnerable time of the people he meets and posing frightening commentary on contemporary news. The nightcrawler is not looking to help or to provide encouragement; he's there to get his shots and move on, hoping to turn as large of a profit as he can. We see Los Angeles in the light of what could be classifiable as a contemporary film noir, in dark, sometimes shadowy-photography and dingy environments that reveal an ugliness to a city that is normally captured as very beautiful and ideal in terms of climate. Director Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit (a frequent collaborator of Paul Thomas Anderson) do everything in their power to subvert our ideas of Los Angeles and focus on transitory locations that show the ugliest of human events in such a way that is beautiful and captivating thanks to crystal-clear photography.The other feature ""Nightcrawler"" toys with is the contemporary exploration of journalistic ethics and how, with local cable news competing with so many twenty-four hour news stations, who, in turn, are also battling more rapidly-updated social media websites, the manipulation of news is ever-present on Television. News programs, like sitcoms, reality shows, and sports events, are a game of numbers and those numbers are ratings – something that ""Nightcrawler"" makes depressingly clear to us. A crucial scene to this message comes into play when Lou has shot and sold the defining tape of his career and has worked to manipulate it for personal gain. He watches as Nina plays the tape on the air, directing the news anchors in such a specific way in terms of language and mannerisms that we see the fear-mongering happen right before our eyes.On top of all the social commentary, we see amazingly realistic crime scenes and car accidents to boot. Perhaps it's the lack of intimacy many directors lend to these situations, often showing a car accident, and characters limping and trudging along with little bloodshed, but ""Nightcrawler"" details these scenes with an incredible eye for attention and realism. Gilroy makes us the voyeur and gives the window into these car accidents that we glance over to see but not entirely anticipate or really want to see. The attention to detail in these seems is simply exquisite and uncommonly believable.""Nightcrawler,"" in addition, features a wonderful performance by Gyllenhaal who, like his co-star Paul Dano in last year's ""Prisoners,"" plays detached and empty with such conviction, and channels something of an inner-Philip Seymour Hoffman in ""Owning Mahowny,"" showing his character's complete fulfillment when obsessing over his job and his work. Even Riz Ahmed shouldn't be overlooked here, playing the overworked and under-appreciated assistant to Gyllenhaal's Lou in a role that could've been an empty, and even distracting, side role. The entire project is rich in commentary, performances, and environmental beauty that it could easily be one of the most complete films of the year.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Disappointingly pedestrian, nowhere near delivers on potential","Its an intriguing concept, and I love a good urban-night thriller (Collateral, Drive etc), but this was hugely disappointing. Here's what was wrong: - Rene Russo (as well as other actors) make it feel like a bargain basement DVD movie. I can't help but feel like she was shoe-horned into this by her husband, the writer/director. She seems just as ill-placed as she was in his other written movie, Two For The Money. The handling of her character felt awkward and unbelievable. A TV studio director being manipulated by this young, cocky loser? Its absolutely ridiculous, and it feels like Rene knows this whilst she's trying to act it out. - Jake Gyllenhaal tries his best but the character just isn't deep, nuanced or credible enough to be properly fleshed out. It all feels written, showy and trying to be clever - but annoying. The script aims for Norman Bates but comes across more like Macauley Culkin trying to buy a toothbrush in Home Alone. The character could have been played equally well (if not better) by Jared Leto, Michael Cera, or someone more up-and-coming. This is a step backward for Jake after Zodiac and Prisoners. - The story is hugely underdeveloped. Too much time is spent showing him discovering and getting into the job, as we need an ""origin"" story. Why? Did we need to see Gosling become a stunt driver in Drive, or Cruise become a hit-man in Collateral? Its really boring to watch, and by the time he's fully fledged and trying to sell his videos, there's little time left to do anything interesting. There's a home invasion/shooting scene he gets to before the police, which is supposed to be some big dramatic centrepiece - except it falls flat. It could have opened with that scene, then developed into the aftermath of it in far more interesting ways than it actually does. There's no actual story here - nothing to engage with properly. - The metaphors and subtexts about voyeurism, media responsibility, moral decline etc just feel heavy handed and redundant. - The soundtrack was dull and not memorable, which is unforgivable in a film like this. Its crying out for a decent atmospheric soundtrack, but we get this David Cronenberg-esque blandness that makes it feel like a misguided sequel to Crash. - Writing and direction are absolutely pedestrian - there is nothing memorable or remarkable about it at all. The writing in particular is flat and underdeveloped, especially with regards to character, story development and subtext.Its watchable in a late-night obscure eighties throwaway kind of way, but unengaging. It certainly doesn't deserve the hype that its marketing and buzz is creating - its a sheep in wolves clothing.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
All in a Night's Work,"Nightcrawler seems like a satire to modern television news about how they choose their leads or often seek for more ratings by entertaining their viewers rather than aim straightly to the facts. But there is a much interesting story beneath here and that is the main character, Louis Bloom. The guy that easily manipulates people with his sinister tricks of persuasion. Everything else may just be the natural world of crime and accidents, but in the eyes of this character, the experience is made far stranger and oddly fascinating. This provides a compellingly menacing and provoking piece of commentary which results to such engrossing film.What the plot mostly does is to fully absorb the viewers into the character of Bloom by studying his sociopathic behavior and the words coming out from his mouth. He is a charming young man with a dark intention hidden behind his grins. He pushes the limits of the law and his own safety, only to accomplish on what he must do in the job, even if it risks many people's lives. The actions of this antihero is ought to feel terrifying on how it affects to both the business he's working on and the society he is watching. The media's side however is more of a picture of cynicism on how they broadcast the scariest stories of the city, giving the people fear so they could earn more viewers out of the concern. It just breaks down on how the evil of their success is disguised as their own ethics.The filmmaking perfectly captures their night's work. You couldn't clearly see the scenario they shoot unless you watch them on a video footage. The violence and peril they witness are shown without any hint of sympathy, since they only use them for the news show. The horror of these gritty scenes once again belongs to the nightcrawler. Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the biggest highlights here. His character obviously has the personality of a psychotic villain; he is mostly bluffing, and by the dashing enthusiasm he shows to the people around him, you probably may not know when his inner total madness will burst out from his frightening eyeballs, and that provides more tension than you expect. This is one of the Gyllenhaal performances that will be remembered for his career.Out of common sense, this story may lead its main character to a moral about how much he is taking this job too far, probably destroying his humanity. But no, this guy is relentless, almost inhumane, and his style in fact helps his career grow bigger, which turns out we are actually rooting for a villain. And that probably pictures to some oppressive ambitious beings out there behind some system. This is where things go in the end, bringing an outcome to a social satire. You can spot a lot of relevance even when some of the situations get a little out of hand. Nightcrawler is something else than a sentiment, what we must focus here is Lou Bloom: a new, possibly iconic, movie vigilante, except the only skin he is purposely saving is himself and his career.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Crossing the Line Through Sheer Ambition,"Whereas Gone Girl explored the wild misconceptions and dangerous influence of the media, Nightcrawler explores another even more corrupted facet of the entity's nature: shamelessly capitalizing on the popularity of crime television—violence, murder, blood, gunshots. The program's ratings continue heightening along with the network's desire for even more thrilling footage. Nightcrawler follows Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) as he climbs up the ladder of success and builds a career through rash ambition. Lacking a formal education and adequate work experience, he's truly a victim of the unfair modern job market/unemployment. So, he says ""screw it"" and takes matters into his own hands, acting with sheer desperation and eagerness to reach that level of power and affluence America so often glorifies.After personally witnessing a car accident on the freeway as snooping reporters close in, the scene lights a fire inside Louis and inspires him to give the job a try. Soon afterwards, he purchases a camcorder and a radio scanner, persistently discovering new crime scenes to capture on tape as intimately as he possibly can. Thus, his extensive coverage grabs the attention of a morning news channel, and a special relationship forms therein: a consistent supply of new gruesome/entertaining crime footage for an increasing sum of money. As we see the frightening lengths Louis is willing to strive towards in order to prove himself as a proficient workingman and elevate his value above and beyond, this grave thriller intermittently surprises us with effectively mocking twisted humor, but the incredibly deranged human psychology on display keeps us startled and tense throughout regardless.Gyllenhaal arguably gives the absolute best performance of his career in a role that substantially differentiates from his earlier work. His creepy, relaxed composure hides the true inner scariness and ferocity. Publicly, Louis is a professional, polite, and upstanding citizen who's just looking to work hard. Privately, he violently yells in front of a mirror until he shatters it, as well as blackmails a TV news director to further his career. Rene Russo also impresses as the morning news director—almost as daring in her lust for more provocative violent imagery—who's beguiled by this eccentric and only (mistakenly) fuels Louis' psychotic drive. In addition, Riz Ahmed's Rick serves as Louis' gullible, clueless ""employee"" who just wants to escape the dispiriting state of homelessness and finally earn a living, completely unaware of the perilous and unethical situations he'll be cast in along his employer's selfishly ruthless path.This isn't the kind of film whose quality solely relies on a central performance because the narrative is just as cruelly gripping. Unfortunately, the film industry is stocked with so many safe crowdpleasers and compromising thrillers that it's wholly refreshing to see these uncompromisingly grim, chilling psychological character studies occasionally pop up. The film becomes more morally repulsive and disturbing as it proceeds while the satire on the American Dream and merciless ambition becomes that much more brutal. Nightcrawler is deeply unsettling as well as it is honest in its portrayal—Los Angeles is actually the perfect setting, beautifully shot in its alluring and deceptive nighttime scenery. After all, it is probably the #1 destination for the unrelentingly audacious and reckless individuals of the nation in search of a prosperous career.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Media propaganda meets psycho in this fascinating film,"This film essentially tells the story of an ambitious and somewhat psychotic news video freelancer (played by Jake Gyllenhall) who will do anything, literally, to make his way in the world and be successful and a media editor (played by Rene Russo) who,in her own world of news casting, also has few if any scruples when it comes to her career and reputation. Put the two together and you get an escalating set of events in which the video freelancer goes to greater and greater extremes to film shocking scenes of crime, encouraged along by the media editor who is paying for his results.What makes the film more interesting than just another action drama is the social commentary and the character studies. The main characters are very well crafted, believable, explained through back drop and excellently acted out. The parallels between them are also interesting to observe. Both pretty much without any care for the people around them and focused solely on personal gain. What the video guy will do to get his paycheck is shocking, but what the media editor will do to get her news reel is just as distasteful.The social commentary is also sharp. The media is portrayed essentially as caring about nothing but a good story, even in fact if that story happens to be untrue. What matters is the narrative and the narrative has to fit the agenda of the media agency. By this measure all news is little more than propaganda. The video guy, despite his barbaric methods and behaviour, is also tolerated by those around him and the message, at least from the media editor and her team (acknowledging one dissenting voice in the film), is that it is OK to be cruel and to hurt others if it is in the pursuit of personal ambition. Both are valid observations and comments on today's society, whether we, the viewers, happen to agree with them or not.The film also has a touch of originality which isn't easy to do these days when so many movies have already been made. Yes there are studies out there of psychos, yes there are films that vilify the media and there are films about morbid voyeurism and about the exploitation of victims of crime for personal gain. The originality comes from putting them all together. I couldn't really think of a parallel, although others might.This is well worth watching. You may not ultimately enjoy the film, after all it isn't pleasant, but I am fairly sure you will remember it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

The storyline, script, filming and acting combine into the perfect storm of a brilliant film. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a character, on what I can only describe as at the higher end of the autistic spectrum and deserves an Oscar nomination for this role. His character is perfectly matched by Rene Russo playing the role of her career as the success seeking ageing news editor. And a shout too for Riz Ahmed as Rick, Gyllenhaal's assistant.

Doesn't Pause Enough To Examine The Really Great Material,"On the surface, ""Nightcrawler"" is a very well-made film. The production value is high, the visuals are great, acting is solid, and it delves into a number of very relevant themes regarding journalism and TV news. The problem, however, is that director Dan Gilroy doesn't pause nearly enough to examine the really interesting parts of the film. Instead, everything in the movie is kind of viewed in the abstract...with very little (and thus I would argue not nearly enough) context given in order to make it a truly great piece of film-making.For a basic plot summary, ""Nightcrawler"" sees Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) trying desperately to find a job in a rough economy. One night, he stumbles upon a crime scene and meets Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), an independent TV news cameraman who impresses Louis with his ability to ""do the dirty work"" and get paid handsomely for it. So, Louis decides to get into the TV journalism business himself, even doing well enough to hire a partner in Rick (Riz Ahmed). Along the way, Louis also develops a relationship (that some might consider inappropriate) with head news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo). Things seem to be going great for Louis and his thriving business...until the night he arrives at a burglary scene before the police, making a number of choices leading him down a shady ethical path that he may or may not recover from.Easily the two most interesting parts of this film are Gyllenhaal's Louis and the movie's examination of the TV news business. Both of those subjects carry very weighty, relevant themes in today's society and are worthy of examination. Unfortunately, both are also just kind of glossed over in favor of ""the spectacle"" in this case.Louis is one of the strangest characters I've ever seen on the big screen (done to perfection, as usual, by the underrated Gyllenhaal). On one hand, you can kind of feel sorry for him, as he never seems to catch a break early on. On the other hand, he is such a smarmy individual that he is far from like-able. Usually I like this kind of ambiguity in my film characters, but in this case it comes off more as confusing than interesting. At the end of flick, I didn't feel like I cared any more about Louis than I did, oh, 20 or so minutes in.As for the many themes regarding televised news, I really wish the pace of the film would have allowed even more examination of them. There is a character in the newsroom (played by Kevin Rahm) who always bring up the ethical issues of what is transpiring, but he is quickly pushed aside each and every time. Perhaps that is a statement being made in and of itself, but I still feel like the movie wanted us (as viewers) to take a few too many things at face value. I wanted to see the principals struggle a bit regarding their decisions. There just didn't seem to be any conflict in what was happening.Overall, though, ""Nightcrawler"" isn't a bad movie by any stretch of the imagination. In my mind, it is the complete and utter personification of a ""three star effort"", as it easily did enough to hold my interest, yet didn't do anything more to really make me care in the end. To me, this was very much a ""take it or leave it"" experience. Had some closer examination of themes/characters taken place, I think it could have been much, much more interesting.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Advantages of Psychopathology in a Laissez Faire Capitalist System,"Lou is a sociopath. Its established at the beginning of the film. Lou will beat you senseless for 100 feet of chain link fence and a fake Rolex.That he has the drive and audacity to thwart the conventions of decent behaviour without regard to human cost marks him as a sure winner in our dog eat dog world ( unregulated or laissez faire capitalism).And win he does as he exploits any and every vulnerability his avaricious instincts detect. Whether it be the vulnerability of a news director depending on ratings to keep her job or a down and out young homeless man who will do anything to improve his circumstances.He's found inspiration, valediction and encouragement in his discovery of 'deep' business platitudes masquerading as acumen on the internet.Sought, found and, proudly, digested and regurgitated context free, at every opportunity he exhorts and extorts and threatens with the naive impunity of the sociopathic internet autodidact that he is. He is proof that knowledge is power and that a little knowledge is a very dangerous thing indeedAll vulnerabilities must be seen as opportunities and exploited immediately without any regard or the well being of the people involved. They have been deigned by fate to further his cause.

"Crime, glamour and apathy.","Dan Gilroy's Nightcrawler is a disturbing look at media news coverage and the desensitisation of tragedy.Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a sociopathic, calculating and opportunistic ""news stringer"", who is allured by this new found profession and will propel him into the demoralised view of human depravity and enriching his apathetic view on crime; relishing in his identity of being a cutthroat journalist on the prowl.Like a vulture scavenging for fresh cadavers.You will hate him but you can't help to admire his charisma and adapting nature in various situations. You know he's a slime ball, but you can't help to see where he goes next.You are along for the ride as much as he is the driver.As a feature debut, Gilroy has a lot of talent riding in this film.The presentation is great, well shot, and Neo-Noir setting is genius and was perfect for the narrative; Stylistic visuals, the emphasis on voyeurism and great pacing, make this standout as a film that understands its tone and design.Nightcrawler will get under your skin and effectively make you see the worst side of the media, morality and human indifference.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""That's my job, that's what I do, I'd like to think if you're seeing me, you're having the worst day of your life""","Nightcrawler, directed by Dan Gilroy, is a chilling exploration of ambition, ethics, and the darker sides of human nature. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a mesmerizing performance as Lou Bloom, a man whose desire for success drives him into the morally ambiguous world of freelance crime journalism in Los Angeles.From the moment the film begins, we're sucked into Lou's character-a driven, yet disturbingly sociopathic individual who will stop at nothing to capture the most sensational footage. Gyllenhaal's portrayal is both captivating and unsettling, as he embodies Lou's relentless pursuit of fame and recognition, blurring the lines between observer and participant in the chaos he documents.The cinematography is striking, elegantly capturing the neon-lit nights of L. A. while juxtaposing the grim realities of crime. The film's pacing is masterful, building tension as Lou navigates a landscape filled with opportunism and ethical decay. It forces viewers to confront the uncomfortable question: to what lengths are we willing to go to achieve our dreams?Rene Russo shines as Nina Romina, a news director equally hungry for ratings and willing to exploit Lou's footage to advance her own career. Their relationship is a twisted reflection of ambition, where both characters are ensnared in a perilous dance of manipulation and moral compromise.Nightcrawler is not just a film about crime journalism; it's a mirror held up to our own media consumption. It critiques the sensationalism that permeates news and questions the societal hunger for violence and spectacle. Through Lou's lens, we see how easily morality can be sacrificed at the altar of success.*Nightcrawler* is a gripping, thought-provoking narrative that lingers long after the credits roll. With its stellar performances, sharp commentary, and haunting visuals, it serves as a haunting reminder of the fine line between ambition and moral bankruptcy. It is a must-watch for anyone seeking a thrilling yet profound cinematic experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Characterstudy of a psychopath... brilliant,"Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a mesmerizing performance that sends chills down your spine and leaves you speechless. His portrayal of Lou Bloom, a driven and morally ambiguous character, is nothing short of genius.

One of the best thrillers of the year and one of the best performances.,"""If it bleeds, it leads."" TV news adageThere's plenty of blood to be filmed and sold to a TV station by enterprising photographers in Nightcrawlers. If they can get to the scene of the crime or accident earlier than other photojournalists, aka ""nightcrawlers,"" so much the better. Driven Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) learns how to get there early and how to sell the footage to a station.Nightcrawlers is an expert thriller about footage jockeys and the ethics of manipulating news. Lou bloom is inordinately ambitious, with prestige and money driving him further and further down the amoral rabbit hole. When he arrives early at a scene and moves the bloody body for better light, it's clear he's on his way to more and better crime as he ingratiates himself with TV news director Nina Romina (Rene Russo) and becomes a part of her station's leading bloody news stories.What little I have experienced on the TV news set of a local station is accurately depicted: the fast pace, quick decisions (what to leave out, what to leave in), and the integrity of the news itself. No question Lou's footage is what the station needs to rise in the ratings, no question Nina needs to decide if she can pay his price, no question the ethical boundaries are uncertain. In all cases, the OCD Lou has figured the angles enough ahead of time to win the contract and evade the law. He already has answered his partner, Rick's (Riz Ahmed), question, ""Why aren't we at the rape in Vincent Park like everyone else?"" (See the opening quote). Probably not enough blood.The issue of ratings' influence hangs about this movie with decisions about buying and showing controversial footage always present at sweep times. Add the legal ramifications and it's quite a moral-ethical stew.When Lou says, ""I have to go home and do some accounting,"" he is rejecting an offer from a rival firm and confirming numbers and no people are his world. Although he can be a charmer, his vacant, unblinking stare and humorless speeches on business practices, learned from the Internet, are an early sign that he can be affectless and dangerous.Gyllenhaal gives the performance of a lifetime, and Nightcrawler is one of the year's best thrillers.",,Anonymous,Crime
Good but Cringy...,"Jake did an good job with his character but it seemed as if he was working too hard to make the characters seem autistic. I think it was his best role since 'Brokeback....' . But this was very cringy to me. Especially in relation to Rene Russo's character- he was really sexually harassing her in many scenes and I felt quite uncomfortable watching it. She was excellent as usual. Bill Paxton was Bill Paxton as usual, God rest him. (In every role he ever played, he just played the same character, and not that good at it either.) I think the movie portrayed the life of an independent news photographer quiet realistically, which is sad on its own merits. The lengths some of them will go to for a story that's more hurtful than helpful is quite disgusting. But overall well worth watching.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"a neo-noir on the surface - underneath, it's about... America, and Capitalism","Let's start with Jake Gyllenhaal here. In a way, his performance can be criticized in the sense that it's one-dimensional. In almost every scene of the film (when he's not putting on a big, s***-eating grin, or yelling at a mirror), he comes wide-eyed, talking a SUPER game, and that game is how to get an opportunity and run with it, how to make the big deal. He has the same determined, crazed but leaning-on-'nice' fervor. And yet it's an actor giving it his all and it works. He finds the... is 'humanity' the word?He's not even really a person, is he - he's less like your common garden variety sociopath. He's relentless, he tries on emotions for what he needs, and can barely sleep. If the movie suddenly revealed itself as an alien or a serial killer, you might believe it. And there's never a moment where Lou Bloom doesn't show that. Gyllenhaal, with his gaunt (he lost weight) appearance, his stream-lined word-a-second performance, is on fire here. He makes this guy completely terrifying, yet recognizable at times, too. Could we see this guy in our everyday life? Or maybe leading a self-help/money-managing seminar?One of the wonderful things about Nightcrawler is how it appears as one thing, but it's about something else, or on top of it. When I mention that he's a sociopath, that's putting it lightly. He may talk in platitudes, in ways that, if you met this person in person you might wonder 'Is this for real? Is this guy just totally nuts?' But it's a metaphor - what would happen if the American Dream, the Horatio Alger situation, went completely to pot? We were told by the Supreme Court in America a few years back, in a matter of speaking, that a Corporation is a person, and that a Corporation should have the rights that any person has in the American process.What Gilroy is trying out here (perhaps akin to a documentary from years back called The Corporation): what happens when a person IS a corporation, that they are always climbing the ladder, always finding the way to make a deal, to make a profit, to get up to the Next Level (in caps)? Everything is seen as status, and damn it all if Lou is going to see his profit margin go down, or a loss to happen, whether it's with his news footage that he's selling to the local station, or if he spots a security guard with his ""fake"" uniform. And, more to the point, when other, actual corporations (like, say, a news network) face such a being.Nightcrawler has a main character as a villain - or, as I've called it (ala Walter White) an anti-villain. He's diabolical, you don't like this guy, he actually may make you sick to your stomach. But he's the ""hero"" still. And like a sort of ""arch"" villain he's got all his information together on so many things - thanks, Internet - and other people around him, like Rene Russo's news director, or his assistant, who is desperate and has to take this man with his slick-back hair at his word. Indeed the scenes with Russo, for me, almost verge on becoming incredulous; how much will she, who seems to be a more sane person, can take with this guy? But he throws his challenges at her, there's rebuffs, and... she needs him.Gilroy's script is sharp and intense, finding a strong plot to hang it on (it's still a neo-noir ultimately, with crimes on going on at LA at night, shot with a strong eye by Robert Elswit), and yet, for me, it works best as a character study. By the very end it almost becomes TOO much. Can we believe this? Maybe it's the point - he's gone to this point because... he can. Or people let him, or don't catch him, or whatever. There are holes you can try to find here. It's not about that. Like Gone Girl, it's a satire that looks at media with the sickening perspective it possibly deserves. It's a movie that challenges the viewer to go where this character does, to squirm, to recognize what is in this person as being something in the real world.Nightcrawler takes a risk to show this character - a cross perhaps between Daniel Plainview and Rupert Pupkin - and explore what happens when Capitalistic ambitions (and on a more we've-seen-this-before level 'if it bleeds it leads' critical pieces) go to/past their limits. It's incisive, it's stimulating, and self-conscious. 9.5/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Real Opportunity,"Greetings again from the darkness. Many of us still catch ourselves asking ""Why is this news?"" while watching the local newscasts. We ask this despite knowing sensationalist journalism is the way of the world, and writer/director Dan Gilroy reminds us ... if it bleeds, it leads.Jake Gyllenhaal continues his progression as one of the most fascinating actors working today. Here he plays Lou Bloom, a fast-talking, self-help studying, ultra-charming sociopath, with creepy bug eyes (thanks to a 20-25 lb weight loss) and an even creepier grin. Mr Gyllenhaal nails the role in a way that reminds of Travis Bickle of Taxi Driver (Robert DeNiro was 33 at the time - the same age as Jake now).Three other movies came to mind while watching this: Network (the lack of a conscience approach to ratings), Drive (the stylistic camera work and loner lead character), and Body Double (a fascinating Brian DePalma film from years ago). Rene Russo is the veteran news woman who encourages and enables the Bloom character to use his ""good eye"" to pursue the money shots ... defined as anything that strikes fear into the suburban world.Gyllenhaal is all in for his role as Bloom. Nightcrawling is the label given to stringers (private cameramen) who compete for the video that will lead the newscasts. Bloom's google-based training has turned him into a Tony Robbins type who blows through dialogue at a speed every bit as fast as he drives his red Dodge Challenger to the next tragedy. Bloom is the epitome of charm in the wrong hands. Think Ted Bundy with a camera. While Bundy actually committed the murders, Bloom blurs the line between recorder of history and influencing the criminal action. He also delivers one of the first on screen 'chasing a car chase' scenes.This is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut, though he has written over films, including The Bourne Legacy, which was directed by his brother Tony. Dan also wrote my of my favorite rarely seen films entitled The Fall (2006). Dan Gilroy is married to Rene Russo, and her calm, yet equally sleazy, presence works well with the quirky, in-your-face Gyllenhaal character. Cinematographer Robert Elswit (known for his work with Paul Thomas Anderson) beautifully captures the nighttime energy of Los Angeles, as well as the brutal and savage crime scenes.Gyllenhaal is the real deal here, and somehow makes this frightening monster believable as a guy who could walk amongst us every day (or night). Early on in the film, his character is asking for a job and spouts off a line that includes a bit about being ""raised in the self-esteem movement so popular in schools"". It's our first glimpse of his psychosis which is also grounded in reality.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Solid script, solid performances, but for some reason it felt empty.","I came into this expecting a performance of a lifetime with a very creepy story. Jake Gyllanhal does a great job, (even if he's not as creepy as I thought he'd be) and the script is smooth and solid, but the film tries the whole time to be terrifyingly creepy, but is just kind of so so.It does do a good job of grounding you in reality on the bloody crime of Los Angelos, and the nightcrawling TV reporters that go out of their way to get good shots for the news. It explores the fine line between doing your job and disrespecting and exploiting the dead for your own personal gain, but in the end it didn't leave as much of an impact.All this talk about how Jake should have been nominated, I disagree. He was really good, not as creepy as I thought. He's smart talking and clever, but he doesn't leave enough of an impact to get you thinking.A lot of the movie was me waiting for something to happen. It sets up the character and motivation well, it sets you in the right mood, but a lot of it was just me waiting for it to change. In the end with a few crazy twists here and there, I for some reason was not very intrigued. I guess the film is trying so hard to be creepy based on it's strong contrast in lighting, with a really dark toned film, but in the end it's not that creepy of a film. This kind of story could almost be a comedy or drama, not a dark thriller.I give it props for its clever screenplay and decent performances, but I was hoping for something a tad bit more.

"Great movie, mixed ending","Nightcrawler is a good movie that might be a hit-and-miss for some people. A great premise, which great characters expose through outstanding acting.If you are looking for a flick to spin your mind, you've found it.But it ain't pretty.And I can't do this movie true justice without going over major spoiler, so, be advised. **From here on, spoilers, spoilers!**Lou Bloom is desperate to find a job. A skilled light-hand, Bloom is trying to get a life, but seems like life is just unfair. Until he discovers nightcrawling, the act of pursuing fresh crime scenes to sell recordings to News.Well, and would you guess, Bloom seems to have the charm for such a duty. My, oh, my.But there is a catch, of course: Bloom is a sociopath.At first, we get it fast that he is intelligent and apparently brilliant, but things escalates quickly into a twisted dimension. Bloom just wants to succeed, at any cost. When he sees that he can improve his recordings by manipulating crime scenes, he goes all in.This story works out great, keeps you hooked until the very end, where it all fails. The story tricks us.Bloom's arc is negative, his change raising to the point where he is actively causing serious harm. What payoff do we expect? He can't get away with all this.But he does.The ending even makes it quite comical.This was a heavy blow to what could have been a great movie. Maybe others will enjoy the ""happy"" tone at the end, but I'd prefer an ending that would expose his darker self, explore his condition, perhaps end with Bloom in a psychiatric hospital or something.I guess this ending is to send a message, a message about blood and News.

Jake Gyllenhaal and the final sequence make the film!,"By the theme and the opinion of the public, I thought this movie would probably be one of the best movies of 2014. However, I think this movie is just 'good', what is a surprise. No doubt the criticism of the media is something memorable and that will make most people who attended think otherwise in relation to journalism and the media.Surprisingly, the movie didn't captivate me. About Jake's job, it was really a great performance, snubbed by the Academy. I could make a link between his performance with Cumberbatch's in the Imitation Game, because both worked very well in a unusual personality, not just in the lines, but also with the gestures, the way they move, among other things (I am not being very successful in explaining what I mean). I would say that Jake's performance is better than the Michael Keaton's one in Birdman and it is probably better than Bradley Cooper in American Sniper (I still haven't watched the movie, but I don't take a lot of faith in Bradley Cooper in this movie). The performance of Rene Russo is also really good, even though I think that her character isn't very good. I also like very much the performance of the Lou's partner.Till just before the end of the movie, I would give six stars. But I really think that the final sequence, where the character Lou stalks the murderers, is EXCELLENT.

The picture is well shot, most of it takes place at night in Los Angles, but the lighting and cinematography used make sure everything is perfectly clear. The entire film is shot from the point of view of our protagonist I'd say, a twisted yet enthralling character exploring the darker aspects of news reporting where it seems nothing comes in the way of a getting a good story. I cannot think of a scene without Jake Gyllenhaal which adds to extremity of his character's personality, we're never given a break from him or shown him doing something mundane or innocent, even his dinner date is full of suggestions of menace.

Cinematic approach and Gyllenhaal's performance not enough to save this debacle,"Although visually gripping at times, Nightcrawler lacks any real depth in story, character development, tone, and believability. Gyllenhaal's portrayal of a sociopath, Lou Bloom, is pleasantly eerie, and worthy of recognition by audiences. However, Lou is not your typical anti-hero, in that he has no redeeming qualities, and therefore, we cannot root for him or feel any empathy. Lou is somewhat destitute in Act 1, a petty thief who scrapes by. His ""big break"" comes when he is able to steal a bike and barter it for a ""video"" camera. Soon, he discovers a hidden talent: the ability to successfully arrive at accident scenes before other ""nightcrawlers"" and film gory footage. He sells his footage the only way he knows how; by bombarding a local news station and convincing Nina, the news director during the graveyard shift, played by Rene Russo, that his work is truly ""art"" and worth air time. And this is one sloppy metaphor and/or commentary on current broadcast journalism that Nightcrawler tries to hammer into your head. We have lost any semblance of decency as a TV viewing nation, that capturing video of accident victims bleeding or dying is fascinating and seen as art rather than tragedy. From here, Lou's business expands and he hires Rick, an unemployed, uninteresting guy with zero skills, to be his intern. This is all we need to know about Rick. To push the story along, the filmmakers decide to use an 80s style montage during which Lou and Rick buy fancier equipment, a new car, and develop an increased passion in nightcrawling. Though their business is expanding, Lou continues to freelance and sell his footage to Nina, and only Nina by directly handing her his videos in person. Feels like this was written to be made in the late 1980s. The film aims to be tense and story driven. Instead they interject comedy at inopportune moments, and lose a real chance to delve deeper into a potentially fascinating character study. The writing is sloppy and the characters are one dimensional. Lou's ability to interfere with active crime scenes, google search license plates, and cut the brakes of a rival's van (a tired and lazy movie trope)are all too convenient and without any conflict. Not stylistically aesthetic enough to be strictly a visual movie, such as the Ryan Gosling film, Drive, Nightcrawler just fails to deliver any story or message of substance.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime

One of the most timely and culturally relevant films ever!,"Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is an out of work, eccentric young man trying to make it in LA. While he's clearly optimistic and driven, he just can't seem to find the right opportunity. He spends his time trying just about anything to make a buck.

While his initial forays into the business are unsuccessful, he eventually gets a break when he meets Nina (Rene Russo), a well-seasoned TV newswoman who is always in the market for compelling footage. Every late night tragedy now becomes a new opportunity; and Lou doesn't hesitate to capitalize on them. But the more successful he becomes and the further he rises in the business, the more clear it is that Lou is more than a just a savvy business man.Gynlenhal is memorizing as Lou Bloom! Lou undergoes a kind of metamorphosis; at first he exudes the determination and drive you can't help but cheer for (and see a bit of yourself in). Then he slowly develops and learns to wield his intellect and cunning to his advantage. But eventually his zeal and tenacity become something else entirely. You don't really realize what's happened until it's obvious; Lou is a monster. And he's the kind of monster you don't see coming. It's brilliant work really and the effectiveness of Gynlenhal's performance is hard to deny. This is the best Gynlenhal performance I've ever seen! Russo is also excellent as the hardened, ""do whatever it takes to get the ratings"" Producer Nina. She's clearly underrated here as her vile, slimy character goes unnoticed for most of the film. It's not until near the end that you realize that she's really not that much different than Lou.There's a great scene where Nina is confronted by another member of the news team about airing footage that goes against virtually every rule of responsible journalism. Nina dismisses him in such a swift and ruthless manner it's amazing to watch; his reaction so succinctly captures the horror of it all and it's nothing short of brilliant. Russo's award worthy turn as this repulsive figure is what makes that scene one of the best of the year; she had to deliver a strong performance here to rival Jake's and she succeeds in doing so. For his directorial debut I don't think Gilory could've chosen a more fitting location than LA. The backdrop of the LA night only seems to heighten the horror of it all, the sliminess and the treachery. The city were so many go to extraordinary lengths to achieve fame and notoriety is the perfect breeding ground for this kind of business.The rags to riches element of Lou's rise kept me engaged as I always find those kinds of stories compelling, but the parallels to the current media were immediate. This film is a critique of the culture of our news media; which seems these days to focus more on entertainment, ratings and driving narrative, instead of providing information and educating viewers. Nina mirrors this precisely in her pursuit of a great story and it's chilling how clear the similarities are. Think about it? How often do you find yourself wandering why the news is covering celebrities as opposed to real news? Another element portrayed here is the TMZ effect in the media. To desire to get the salacious footage or the private phone call at any cost, with no consideration whatsoever for the people involved or how this will affect them. Lou stops at nothing to not only get the story first, but to create a particular narrative to feed into the viewer's already preconceived notions and fears. I found myself looking inward and asking is this the kind of behaviour we're rewarding when we watch the latest TMZ video? Is this what we're craving when we revel is the fall on a public figure because of a private conversation or their personal beliefs? The answer seems to be yes, and that's alarming. The fact is the news and entertainment media has fused together to become what I call edutainment. And we're the proverbial pigs that constantly feed at this trough.Nightcrawler is also very much about corporate greed. Lou does everything in his power to use, manipulate and discard an employee when necessary in is this film solely to keep the majority share of his enterprise; with no sincerity, remorse or consideration. When we watch these characters on film we cringe and believe they are horrible, despicable people. Yet in business, we call these people successful. Why is that? To answer this answer, I had to recall a documentary I watched a while back called The Corporation where they studied the behaviours of various corporations and attempted to equate their behaviour to that of a real person. And what kind of person did their research find most resembled a corporation? A psychopath. What The Corporation mused about in theory, Nightcrawler illustrates perfectly on screen. Gyllenhaal fully embodies the process of becoming a monster and it's chilling to watch unfold.So does Nightcrawler have a ""happy ending""? If Lou were a corporation we'd say it's reached a new summit of success and would call it a successful, profitable company. Is this what it takes to succeed in today's world? It's unsettling to even consider, but I believe people like this are ""succeeding"" in life. They may very well be at the helm of many powerful companies and organizations. But these kinds of psychopaths won't bludgeon you to death with a knife, but with a smile while wearing an exquisitely tailored suit. And this is why Nightcrawer is one of the most important film you'll see this year.Blog: www.themoviesnob.caFacebook: www.facebook.com/TheMovieSnob247Twitter: @TheMovieSnob247",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Driving A Taxi In The City Of Angels,Louis Bloom is an unemployed oddball loner who cruises the dark streets of Los Angeles watching - and sometimes partaking - crime unfold . Hitting upon the idea of becoming a TV journalist he hires an unpaid assistant and a camcorder with the idea of selling footage to the local TV stationThis film written and directed by Dan Gilroy owes more than a bit to Scorsese's TAXI DRIVER and THE KING OF COMEDY . Now for some of us anyone who wants to emulate Martin Scorsese is okay in our book since he's the master of American cinema who has made some genuinely great films . Also Gilroy acknowledges he's not executing an original concept and there's a scene early in the film where Bloom changes his hairstyle which is no doubt semiotic code similar to what Travis Bickle does towards the end of TAXI DRIVER . I can also recognise that while on the surface being a TV journalist isn't necessarily someone who may become a folk hero but as someone who has spent far too much time on youtube laughing hysterically at episodes of TO CATCH A PREDATOR I've got to admit Chris Hansen had the best job in the worldThe difference between TAXI DRIVER and this movie is that while many men if they were honest they would confess to recognising an element of Travis Bickle in themselves or at the very least recognise the motives of Travis wanting to become a gun toting vigilante . Louis Bloom works less successfully as character recognition to the audience . Played by Jake Gyllenhaal as a wide eyed loon he's a little bit too creepy and weird to be entirely sympathetic as an anti-hero . He's also written as a little too broad . You can instantly see he's pursuing the all American dream but in doing so his pedantic speech mannerisms and his motives mirror all too much the problems of corporate capitalism . In short NIGHTCRAWLER is an interesting and engaging black comedy without being the great film Gilroy had hoped it might have been,7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Failed in the end,"There's no doubt about the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal in the movie, he's without a doubt adjusted the Matthew Mcconaughey system of losing weight and improving his character's appeal to the audience, I even think that he might also have a shot in the big boys league again (after Brokeback mountain) HOWEVER- it seems to me that there was a nice build up to the story and a promising start for the characters BUT (stay calm-- NO SPOILERS) it has no message in the end of it. There's no ""aw"" inspiring moment you should have when you see a finished masterpiece, it lacked the moral of the story! To me it seemed like the end of Rocky minus the part where Rocky actually takes the risk of making something big with himself and moving from being a so called loser to the guy who took a shot and inspired everybody to get ""the eye of the tiger"" out of us all by getting what he deserved, it's like the Felina episode of BreakingBad minus the actual ending --no higher meaning...

Great Gyllenhaal Performance,"Gyllenhaal's best work to date. He's scary, sleazy, and pathetic all at once, but thanks to the actor's natural likability and charisma, you can't take your eyes off of him.

I once wrote a review saying Prisoners was the pinnacle of Gyllenhaal's career...

It didn't top my watch list though, as I couldn't help but wonder to myself, 'how good can a movie about the media be'???Flippin' awesome is how good it can be...I once wrote a review on IMDB saying that prisoners was the pinnacle of Gyllenhaal's career, but I hadn't seen Nightcrawler. The acting was superb, bringing to life a script that may not have otherwise been so magical. Gyllenhaal anchored this movie with an oh so haunting portrayal of a man willing to stab anyone in the back for the perfect shot, and thanks to him, I can easily say that this is an instant classic in my head.I got only two words for those who haven't feasted their eyes on this spectacle: SEE IT...",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

From documenting scenes to eventually facilitating them, it takes you through the thought process of a monster and it gets so thrilling to see what will happen, will he get caught, will he die, it's why I really like this movie. It's also moving so fast that you don't get to process the moments that have weight but they hit you later and it's like a sinking feeling.

probably among my top 10 best movies I have seen,"Now this movie probably isn't for everybody. Most of the bad reviews claim, this movie wasn't an ""experience"". Truth be told, no this isn't like infinity wars or mission impossible. This movie is not at all aiming to entertain very pleasently so one can enjoy their popcorn.This movie tells the story of a person I would consider to be a clinical psychopath that talks like he just read a book called "" how to build a company and be a winner"" and treats humans around him unspeakably bad to a degree where you feel pain seeing it.The reason this movie is so great is how we can see the plot of a movie through the eyes of the villain who also happens to be our protagonist. Jake Gyllenhaal is acting his best here. Probably his best performance so far. I would say that without him this movie might just have ended up as a mediocre film, a 5-6 / 10 but his insane performance makes this freakshow so thrilling that you can literally not distinguish between the actor and the finctional lunatic anymore.I don't wanna get too much into detail though. The ending of the movie is absolutely phenomenal and all in all it's almost flawless til then.The only reason I am struggling to give it 10/10 is that the part about him being sexually attracted to the elderly woman, which just completely disgusted me and I found it unecessary but maybe someone else finds especially this obscure part extremely good and therefore likes it even better. Maybe it deserves the 10/10 couldn't say.Make sure you don't have to pause when watching and you can see it in one go for the maximum experience.My 0,00$",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Lou Bloom, one of the most compelling on-screen manipulators I've seen in a long time.","Nightcrawler is a Schraderesque character study of a man far more dangerous than Travis Bickle. Like Bickle, Lou Bloom doesn't like people, however Taxi Driver saw Bickle feel compassion for at least one person, Lou seems to have contempt for absolutely everyone. Lou's interactions with other people have only one purpose - control. He is very opportunistic and has an unshakable confidence that isn't hindered by the human inconveniences of nervousness and guilt.Jake Gyllenhaal commands the long monologues of Dan Gilroy's script, stealing every scene he's in as the unnervingly brazen and enthusiastic Lou Bloom. Gyllenhaal lost 20 pounds for the role and it really worked, his gaunt face and glaring eyes do quite a lot of the acting for him. The performance carries the film and this will no doubt be recognised by the Academy next February.In the film's opening moments, Lou is a vagrant who is shown committing crimes both petty and, it's suggested, not very petty at all. He's in the desperate pursuit of a job, and when he meets someone who could be of benefit, Lou initiates his charm offensive and inundates them with a relentless barrage of articulate yet platitudinous language as if he's reciting the effusive CV of a quixotic student.Although his self-promotion is overbearing in the first few instances, Lou soon proves his skill in accruing large amounts of information and repeating it with the utmost conviction and credibility. Gyllenhaal must have relished delivering director Gilroy's excellent script; his manner of speech reminded me of Patrick Bateman's highly detailed monologues on everything from his morning routine to Huey Lewis and the News in Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho. Despite both men's articulacy, their diction feels recycled, and this is because it is - their cynical sociopathy means they cannot form true, sincere relationships, but they are able to counterfeit them through their adroit ability of learning and imitating the necessary behaviour.Quick wits and amorality are key skills for any successful paparazzo, so it is unsurprising that Lou Bloom thrives in the field. His first forays into professional prying are very funny. Inspired by a chance encounter with venerable camera man Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), Lou buys a rudimentary camcorder and scours the myriad streets of Los Angeles. Abruptly stopping next to the scene of a car accident and poking his camera right in people's faces. When he's challenged he proclaims with an uncommon doubtfulness -'I'm fairly certain I'm allowed to do this!' You soon see Bloom gain confidence as he pushes the boundaries further and further, making for tense and unpredictable viewing.His audacity proves successful, snatching footage that's nice and gory, impressing Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the blonde, brassy director of a local news channel. Despite an appearance and demeanour that suggests seasoned business acumen, Nina spends much of the film under the thumb of Lou.After proving his worth, enjoying his growing control over Nina and soon realising how vital he is in maintaining the news agency's spiking ratings, Lou proves that his manipulation can work, albeit it very unattractively, in courtship. Gilroy's best monologue occurs when, over dinner with a reluctant Nina, Lou blackmails her into establishing a longstanding sexual agreement, using a business-like vernacular bereft of anything remotely romantic, erotic or sexual.Like Gone Girl, Night Crawler is a satire of the yellow journalism peddled by television news, content that's perhaps interesting for the public but not in the public interest, a distinction that is gleefully ignored in favour of lucrative scare-mongering and countless other immoralities. As the majority of the characters are under this satirical gaze, I found it hard to care when they fell victim to Lou's vicious conniving, my apathy even extending to his long suffering accomplice Rick (Riz Ahmed), who is too darn wet and spineless to get that emotionally invested in. None of this, I hasten to add, is a significant detriment, if a detriment at all.The film is attractively shot by Robert Elswit, much of whose striking work can be found in the films of Paul Thomas Anderson including There Will Be Blood (2007), Punch Drunk Love (2002) and Boogie Nights (1997), the latter's sun-kissed, neon-lit aesthetic being most similar to Nightcrawler's. Elswit's work here is also likely to draw comparisons with Newton Thomas Sigel's photography in the beautifully slick Drive (2011).With a tense, unpredictable narrative that's laced with strong satire and anchored by a great character and great performance, Nightcrawler is one the best films of 2014.",,Anonymous,Crime
On the news,"Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) stars in this startling and satirical look at freelance video journalists stalking the streets of Los Angeles searching for disaster footage that he can sell to news stations.Bloom may not have educational qualifications but he is a quick learner, a sociopath with his own code of business and moral ethics. When he observes veteran cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is first on the scene to shoot footage of a car wreck he decides to become a nightcrawler himself.Buying a police scanner and a camcorder, Bloom learns fast and soon hires Rick (Riz Ahmed) a homeless man in need of money to be his driver.Bloom and Rick quickly find footage of accidents and murders, Bloom even cynically manipulates crime scenes and television news producer Nina Romina (Rene Russo) laps the footage up with no questions asked.Gyllenhaal gives an intense performance as Bloom, a plausible personality but really a cynical liar to enrich himself. Ahmed matches him as the nervous Rick, the more humane one knowing he is being manipulated by Bloom.There is some wonderful night photography, the director Dan Gilroy delivers a cynical take on the news media but it really is a character piece than a movie. The storyline leading to the climax was hard to take and felt tagged on to give the film a conclusion.All that speeding about the streets of LA and no police are present are a big much to take as well as disturbing the crime scene and the police take no action.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The beast inside all of us,"This is a brilliant if chilling movie, and Gyllenhaal is sufficiently capable in his role as a totally self-interested opportunist that he is able to recruit his fellow actors and engage them at his level. The film is chock-full of insights into how the media world works in the background --- for example, even ""news"" is not about news, but ratings, and bottom dogs may bend or trample the rules in order to gun their ratings. Gyllenhaal is so calculating in the role that he clearly crosses the line into psychopathy, so this is also an opportunity to gain insight into how an antisocial personality might accomplish his objectives while simultaneously pursuing a career path. I was most struck by how Gyllenhaal never once lapsed even slightly or momentarily from his ""reptilian"" character. While psychopaths can often be charming, Gyllenhaal's character is probably better described as smooth, quick, unflappable and calculating, as he uses intimidation much more readily than say, flattery or charm (which are also common tools in the psychopath's armamentarium). However, the film is much more than a character study of the psychopathic personality, as it also has much to say about the media business, and about human nature generally. Special credit to Rene Russo for matching Gyllenhaal beat by beat as he escalates into increasingly unsavoury tactics and behaviour.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"""Remember, use yours zoom, steady hands""","Louis Bloom is something of a loner, a true sociopath, lacking any kind of empathy for anyone. In fact the only living thing he seems to show care for is his house plant that has pride of place next to the TV. He lives out of stealing and then reselling copper wire, fencing and most anything else he can get his hands on. One day he witnesses an accident and while the medics helps the driver, some men show up and record the whole thing. He learns that they intend to sell the footage to a TV news program, he thinks he may have found something he would be good at. He steals a bike to afford an video camera and a police radio and is soon spending his nights racing to accidents and crime scenes.The film follows him on this journey and for each story he films he push the boundaries of legality and morality that little bit further, until he's trespassing, moving dead bodies, and even sabotaging rivals. Here you can see he's lack of empathy, he doesn't care victims at all. As long as he can get the best shot of them to earn him the most money.Straight up, Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing. It's his best performance to date maybe even in his career he's been putting up some great performances before (Donnie darko, Prisoners, Enemy etc). Just all the details he puts in as his creepy grin and weird finger pointing and how he almost never blinks. Lou is one of the least likable character you seen in a long time thanks to him. I do hope he gets Academy award for this one, something he deserved for a long time.What a directorial debut of Dan Gilroy. The directing was amazing, how each scene gave emotion. This is everything but a normal Hollywood film and constantly will surprise you (in a good way). The story is very well written and very original, the script is thrilling and intense, but funny at the same time. The humor is subtle and dark and everyone won't will get it. My theater had about 7-10 people. Only three people including me who laughed. Something a thought about was how good the cinematography is. The cinematographer really captured this mood of this underground LA with some amazing shots.So to round this of, this film was the best I seen in a long time. I rate it 9.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Blooming marvellous!,"I avoided Nightcrawler when it was initially stirring around because I thought it was some sort of X-Men spin off. Of course, once the positive reviews came flooding in and I realised that it wasn't about a flexible mutant, but about a man who becomes obsessed with filming violent street crimes for the news, I became interested.Nightcrawler is a brilliant film and manages to do everything right. At the centre of it all is Jake Gyllenhaal's sensational performance as Lou Bloom. He's surely the most ruthless businessman since Daniel Plainview in There Will Be Blood, although his autistic characteristics make him far less charming and compelling. Nonetheless, Jake completely morphs into the character and delivers a performance well worthy of an Oscar. His slimy grin is enough to make anyone's skin crawl and he's totally devoid of any moral compass, however you can't help but admire his knowledge and ambition.The film clocks in at almost two hours but not even a second of a scene is wasted. After a fast-paced first half where we witness Lou's rise into the crime filming industry the film takes a slower, yet stronger approach in the second half where we focus on one particular case which is sure to shock. There are some wonderfully tense scenes towards the end of the film where I could not take my eyes off the screen. It's almost as if you're there in the street with the characters.I loved how the media was so cynically portrayed here and the underlying themes of how voyeuristic society has become are relevant and dealt with well. The media is a ruthless business and it's great how the news values of having white, middle-class people under attack is put on display.There's very little to fault with Nightcrawler. Not only is it intelligent, but it is also thoroughly entertaining with an engaging story and captivating main character who is sure to become a cult icon.

But flick between a few American news channels afterwards and one will see its truth.Gyllenhaal is the star, the sociopathic cameraman, but this is not to negate the fine supporting roles played by particularly Bill Paxton and Riz Ahmed.The film is refreshing and original and it doesn't resort to clichés or tropes. There's some unforgettable moments In the film, such as Bill Paxton's final scene, which are genius. (I won't mention what it is, so as not to spoil the plot.)

A Chilling Story From Dan Gilroy,"""Compassion is the basis of morality."" ― Arthur SchopenhauerThat above quote, by philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer is one that barely reflects on Nightcrawler; a film less so about sociopathic tendencies and more so about moral ambiguity; the film is an extreme example of one who is beyond a moral compass, and thrives off the pain of others. Another recent film which echoed, to a lesser degree, a number of the same thematic principles that Nightcrawler touches upon was Damian Chazelle's astounding picture Whiplash, which also addressed the human's desire to achieve and position themselves. Nightcrawler takes the characters, their motivations and their will and ups the ante by a hundred, giving us two 'protagonists' who test the viewer's boundaries on what they perceive as entertaining, and what they perceive as flat- out disturbing.The film centres around Lou (Jake Gyllenhaal); an incredibly diligent, hardworking man, who also happens to be a petty thief. After spotting a car wreck and investigating the damage, Lou spots two men shooting footage of the scene, and they inform him of their intent to sell it on to a news agency so that the agency can broadcast the images on television. Lou believes this a good way to make some money, and goes out, buys a camera and a police scanner, and begins to shoot crime scenes of his own, whilst forming a professional relationship with a news director (Rene Russo) who appreciates Lou's commitment, drive and work ethic.Nightcrawler is at once both an immediately horrifying film, but one that is hard to look away from, just like the scenes that Lou and his assistant Rick are shooting to sell off to news agencies. Despite our knowledge that what we're seeing goes against our own ingrained decency, we can't help but stare in awe of the vulgar and brutal sights before us. Director Dan Gilroy takes us into the shady and highly unpleasant Los Angeles underground, and takes us on an unsettling journey with a man who is obviously deranged, but highly likable. He is addictive. His monologues are gorgeous, rivaling that of Jordan Belfort's from last years brilliant The Wolf of Wall Street. He has a charisma that we don't often see from other characters on screen. Part of this is due to Jake Gyllenhaal's performance, which is transformative, smart and entirely horrid (in the best way possible), and part of this is down the sensational writing, also provided by Gilroy, who provides a voice for this insane individual.To maintain a semblance of normality, Lou adopts a fake smile; a persona that carries through the entirety of the film. Even at his most raw, or at his most personal, Lou still maintains that carefree, homely, almost loving smile, inviting you to join him in his car as he does unspeakable deeds. Intervening in crime scenes before the cops arrive, or even planting his own information to provide a better story; there is no ground which Lou will not cover. It's at once astonishing and yet still riveting and entertaining; the viewer cannot help but stare in admiration for this character who is doing such things. But it's not these unspeakable deeds that harrow the most vividly; as aforementioned, it's the calculated and never-failing persona that he projects to everyone around him that unsettles us the most. The first scene of the film helps to establish the real Lou, who is a man who is willing to do anything, and this allows us to see him for who he really is as the movie plods on and somewhat, in its own way, tries to convince you that Lou is an OK guy. Which you may almost believe by the end of this adrenaline rush of a film.Despite Lou's obvious sociopathic nature, we still root for him as he rides around the streets of Los Angeles, intent on getting to a crime scene first and grabbing the best angles achievable. These scenes are exhilarating and heart-pumping primarily due to quick editing and fantastic cinematography, provided by John Gilroy and Robert Elswit respectively, who add drama and mayhem to this already fast-paced escapade. Their work is undoubtable. In terms of the cinematography, the film is absolutely outstanding; Elswit captures the gritty and dark nature of the urban Los Angeles, and embraces hand held. A vast majority of the shots seem utterly simplistic, but they add to the realism of the picture; positioned flat, focusing on the characters alone. There are few high or low angles, only when it serves a highly dramatic purpose, and so we are brought into this tale of deception, madness and drive with supposed simplicity.The score, by James Newton Howard further engrosses, reflecting the evil and darkness that actually lies within news journalism and television news broadcasting. As the morning news is turned on by Lou at the beginning of the picture, the chirpy main themes of the programs contrast with Howard's undercurrent of low ambiance and danger. It resembles something that we do not perceive the news to generally be, and it is immediately noticeable and riveting. As a contrast, when Lou is performing heinous acts, the music is heroic, almost applauding his efforts. That's what Nightcrawler is; a film which applauds strive and drive, despite its consequences. It's entertaining, oddly funny, brilliantly acted (Russo and Gyllenhaal providing career-defining performances) and directed with pace and furious intentions. The themes are vibrant and highly interesting. This is brilliant film-making, however morally ambiguous. I can not wait to return to the shady underlyings of this version of Los Angeles.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not surprisingly good but very good,"Nightcrawler is a film that shows an industry not covered in movies or television and that is the news and aspects of it.With what it is about you'd expect it to be repetitive and tedious, and despite it getting tedious halfway it is an experience nethertheless (a good one)To see out protagonist bloom in success (once you've seen the film you will get my cheesy joke) is good despite us, the audience, not being able to relate to him.

The ending leaves the audience questioning the constant bloodlust that drives viewership & ratings. Surely mass media can't be THAT bad, right?And Lou Bloom is far from our hero. His manipulative, arrogance, and sociopathic mind will make any audience feeling uncomfortable. He's not someone you want to turn your back on.4/5. If it bleeds, it leads.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Creeps and Morality,"This movie is incredible. It works as a creepy thriller but it also works as a larger piece about the world - about how humans can all behave like nightcrawlers, wanting to see people fall from grace or suffer and consume it as news/media/entertainment. Disturbing and effective.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Waste of time,"I found this movie very boring. I will not spoil the movie, however I would say that I would not see this movie again. I found this movie very slow and very boring. I think this movie lacks direction and ending. Within the first couple minutes you easily figure out that Lou is a psycho but other than that, there are no real plot twists. I found the ending very disappointing and lacking closure. There are several good television shows that I would like to recommend if you enjoy the psychotic crime drama, Dexter and Blacklist being two of them. Both shows are very good and are a much better use of your time than this movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very Nice,"Haven't watched many Jake Gyllenhaal movies, but the way he construes his face and eyes (as if he staring directly behind your eyes) unsettles you throughout the entire movie. When Bloom isn't trying to drain all the expertise from those around him, he effortlessly slips into to this almost movie character-esque bravado whereby he he manipulates those around with sociopathic severity. Genuinely a talented actor. Without spoiling too much, the movie does asks the audience to questions their own moral boundaries through the side characters lives and interactions with the main character. To what extent can we, or should we turn a blind eye? Is it possible to be wholly ethical in an ethically grey and morbid profession?.Brilliant movie, would recommend to anyone with an ounce of interest in film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Feel like it's set in Joaquin Phoenix's JOKER univers.,"Nightcrawler is a film that doesn't try to tell you what's right or wrong. It simply shows a character doing what he believes is right from his own perspective. The movie doesn't judge or preach because, as intelligent humans, we already know what is right and what is wrong. Instead, it focuses on the story and lets us decide how we feel about it. Watching this film just as a movie, I found it really good. It gave me the same intense and unsettling vibe as Joker and Taxi Driver. The film never feels boring, thanks to its solid direction, impressive camera work, sharp editing, and powerful background score. Every element works together to keep you engaged from start to finish. The biggest highlight is Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. He doesn't just play the role-he completely becomes the character. His transformation is so eerie and convincing that it keeps you hooked throughout the film. It's easily one of his best performances. Overall, Nightcrawler is a gripping and well-made film with nothing to complain about. It pulls you into its dark world and doesn't let go. I'd rate it 7 out of 10 and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys intense and thought-provoking movies.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Terrific story, terrific lead performance","This is, by any measure, a terrific movie, at once thought-provoking and hugely entertaining, offering viewers a twisted wholly credible skewed perspective on the world of broadcast news and self-advancement. Driven by a mesmerising performance from Jake Gyllenhaal's as a jargon-babbling media business fantasist who nevertheless has a real skill for analysing and learning what matters in the world of television news. Nightcrawler is both creepy (geddit? creepy crawler?) and jaw-droppingly comic in the same inappropriate way that Joachim Phoenix's Joker is. Don't read anything about the plot (which is tight, simple and compulsively involving). Just go with the palaver, the schmooze and the get-rich-quick salesman patter of Gyllenhaal's lost-puppy yet jarringly overconfident anti-hero, even as the story turns down one after another morally underexposed backstreets. Hints of both Network and Dog Day Afternoon, among other classics, take nothing from a movie that will undoubtedly be seen as a classic in its own right in due course, one that is as fresh, surprising and troubling as anything in recent years. Highly, highly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nightcrawler Works,"Nightcrawler is directed and written by Dan Gilroy, it's a take on a modern Los Angeles nighttime film. That incorporates all the best elements about Drive (2011), the color, cars, and thrilling intensity. This is one of the best thrillers of the decade a lot of hard-work and dedication by Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom paid off (he lost twenty pounds for the roll). With his future appearance as Mysterio it seems his past acting is even better. Riz Ahmed is great as always and Jake had some really great chemistry with him, Riz makes Rick a really relatable and believable character. You have to be patient with this movie as you work your way through a story of news dramatizing everything, only reporting on rich white neighborhoods etc. Our protagonists are freelance photographers and overtime Lou Bloom expands his business and rakes in profit. However his lack of care about others and the morals of his recordings makes this film heat up in the third act. This makes the long and interesting wait, trying to establish each of the movie's characters in the first and second acts worth it.

Fascinating. Unexpected. A Great Film.,"This is a unique story with an unexpectedly powerful performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. A serial killing tabloid reporter that talks like a self-help guru goes on adventures in Los Angeles.You always remember the first time you see a really good movie.The first time I saw this film was in a hotel room in Flagstaff, Arizona in May of 2016. I watched late at night while my gf and my dog slept beside me. I played with all of the toys that I have accumulated on the trip, and watched this movie, and took a break in the middle to go outside to the jacuzzi gazebo and smoke a bowl in the snow flurries. While the steam rose off the heated water and the snowflakes glowed in the lights of the hotel, I thought about how happy I was at that moment, and how thankful I was for that girl, and that dog, and the little family we had created. Then, I went back inside to finish the movie. On my way back to the room, I took a photo of the geometric shapes in the hotel hallway. I posted the photo to Instagram. We left Flagstaff the next day, and continued on our journey.I'm so glad that I watched this film while on that trip, and got to re-live those memories while I watched it again for this review. Because, people change, and pets pass away, and relationships end, and the years go by... but, I'll never stop missing that girl, and that dog, and that little family.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:Acting: 1/1;Casting: 1/1;Directing: 1/1;Story: 1/1;Writing/Screenplay: 1/1;Total Base Score = 5Modifiers (+ or -):Originality: +1Standout Performances: +1 ( Jake Gyllenhaal );Total RealReview Rating: 7.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Deserves an 8,"Nightcrawler is essentially a movie about business. It is told from the perspective, in a Taxi Driver fashion, of a lonely man trying to get his piece of the American Dream. He's not trying to fit in or becoming the greatest. He just wants to fight to get somewhere. And commendably.Nightcrawler is about a man who randomly turns to news reporting as a hobby, and it eventually becomes a full time job. He ends up reporting various crimes and murders around LA, and hands the footage and information in to local broadcasters. When he gets some great footage of a murder as it's happening, he decides to mix his story with the murder story to get the perfect footage he could sell.It's not as complicated as I've wrote it to be. My favorite aspect of the movie is that it's about a cool loser in Los Angeles, living on the other side of the fence. He doesn't want to work a normal job, and instead takes up this weird hobby. The hobby ends up being pretty cool, and he becomes pretty successful at it. It gives people hope that one day they'll finally discover something that makes them who they are.Jake Gyllenhall does excellent in this movie. The lighting is perfect and eerie. And the story goes right along without getting boring for a second.I would highly highly recommend seeing it. Probably one of my top 25 favorites.7 stars",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"If it bleeds, it leads.","Nightcrawler follows the story of Louis Bloom, a desperate and unemployed young man who stumbles upon the world of crime journalism while scavenging for scrap metal in Los Angeles. Intrigued by the fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping nature of the job, Bloom starts to immerse himself in the seedy underworld of crime reporting, chasing after violent crime scenes and recording footage to sell to news stations. As he becomes more and more obsessed with his newfound career, Bloom's moral compass starts to blur, and he becomes willing to do whatever it takes to capture the most sensational footage, including manipulating crime scenes and crossing ethical boundaries. Along the way, Bloom forms a relationship with Nina, played by Rene Russo, a veteran news producer who is also willing to push the boundaries of journalism to boost ratings.One of the standout elements of Nightcrawler is Jake Gyllenhaal's mesmerizing performance as Louis Bloom. Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Bloom is chilling and captivating, as he fully embodies the character's desperation, cunning, and relentless ambition. Gyllenhaal's physical transformation for the role, as he lost weight and gauntly portrays Bloom's manic energy, is also noteworthy and adds to the overall sense of unease in the film.The film's screenplay, also written by Dan Gilroy, is a dark and satirical commentary on the world of sensationalist media and the blurred lines between journalism and exploitation. Nightcrawler raises thought-provoking questions about the ethics of journalism, the pursuit of success at any cost, and the impact of sensationalism on the public's appetite for news. The film's sharp critique of the media industry and its portrayal of the dark underbelly of crime journalism are disturbing and thought-provoking.The direction by Dan Gilroy is skillful, as he creates a tense and eerie atmosphere throughout the film. The night-time setting of Los Angeles adds to the film's noir-like aesthetic, with its neon lights and gritty streets serving as a backdrop to the unfolding story. The use of tight close-ups and intense editing adds to the tension, creating a sense of urgency and unease that keeps viewers on the edge of their seats.Nightcrawler is not without its flaws, as some viewers may find the film's dark and morally ambiguous themes unsettling. The depiction of violence and exploitation in the pursuit of sensational footage may be disturbing to some, and the film's bleak and cynical view of the media industry may leave audiences feeling uncomfortable. However, these elements are intentional and serve to drive home the film's thought-provoking messages.In conclusion, Nightcrawler is a gripping and thought-provoking film that offers a dark and satirical take on crime journalism and the pursuit of success at any cost. With a standout performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, skillful direction by Dan Gilroy, and a sharp screenplay, Nightcrawler is a compelling and unsettling exploration of ambition, morality, and the dark side of the media industry. If you are a fan of intense thrillers that challenge societal norms, Nightcrawler is a must-watch film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Friend Is A Gift You Give Yourself,"Louis Bloom (Gyllenhaal), the main character of 'Nightcrawler' truly reveals himself in the dinner-date scene with Nina Romina (Russo). That scene about halfway through best sums up what this dark character-driven film is really getting at.The overall plot follows an intelligent yet ruthless sociopath who lies, steals and at times brutalizes his way through life. While trying to make a quick and easy buck, Louis learns he can film car accidents and crime scenes then sell the footage to local news stations. He partners up with the lowest rated news broadcaster in Los Angeles and uses his unscrupulous talents to leverage his position with the news director who herself has more need for ratings than ethics.We're drawn into a microcosm where empathy means ruin and this gives an insight into the sorts of people and mentality that's prevalent in the media of not only Los Angeles but American media culture as a whole.This film was brilliantly filmed, acted and edited. The night-time setting and use of locations throughout create a noir-like atmosphere that really heighten Gyllenhaal's sleazy and often disturbing mood swings and complete lack of human empathy. The writing fell short a little bit when it comes to Louis' potential legal violations but this isn't a crime drama; instead we're given an inside look into a despicable human being who manages to avoid being held accountable for his misdeeds which probably happens far too often.The music was at times highly inappropriate like when Louis is tampering with a car crash so he can get a better shot of the accident while lighthearted and heroic music plays over top of it. But overall the shortcomings of this film didn't detract from the final results and we're given a completely unique experience and very gritty look at Los Angeles that you only see on rare occasion.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A good, dramatic film, even if not entirely enjoyable to watch","'Nightcrawler' is unfortunately not a standalone film of the X-Men's cheeky elf character, but rather a dark exposition of modern news and the public's (apparent) bloodlust. The film has a simple premise - Bloom (Gyllenhaal) and his partner, Rick (Ahmed) listen to the police scanner and try to show up at accidents to film the gory aftermath before the cops can stop them or before they're beaten to the scene by other competitors. They're literally trawling the night for news-worthy footage. That this 'needs' to be ""bloody"", as Bloom clarifies with Nina (Russo) at the news station is either an indictment on TV news stations/shows, or the public in general - or possibly a bit of both.Gyllenhaal is very captivating as the main star, being in basically every scene and using his huge eyes - and gross mini-ponytail - to creep you out. You don't hate him, but start to fully comprehend what a psychopath he is as the film progresses. Sure, he doesn't kill anyone himself, but he certainly does some despicable things and has no remorse and you start to truly despise him - which proves how good he's acting!Ahmed, Russo & Paxton are good in small, but significant roles. The soundtrack is solid and the cinematography of Los Angeles make sit actually look hospitable and attractive for a change - not as gritty as I would've expected in a movie of this tone. Good ending to the film, if a disappointing one to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Anything that comes my way crawls down the alley,"What worked:lead actor; Jake Gyllenhal brings one of his finest performances in this engaging movie. His portrayal is layered, sharp and captivating, making the character come alive in a threatening and troubled way. We might question the ethical dilemmas that the character has but we cannot question the class of acting that is done to bring us a character who is narcissistic and sociopath, showing no remorse, emotions and regards for anyone but himself.-it's a well executed movie with a beautiful screenplay, beautiful in a sense that the writing is smooth, raw at times, real and gory, making it as real as it gets. The direction is praiseworthy and so does the entire team of the movie.
What did not work:
-maybe I would have wanted some scenes from the television set to be cut down if it was possible , not that they hindered the narrative but at times they were given some more importance. Again, it's considerable considering the nature of the movie.minor loopholes; I would have liked the movie more if a scene was added where he tries to exhibit his innocence in the shootout at the end of the movie.

But that is the exactly key point to make the story and character more believable and understandable.I don't know that these kinds of jobs are real in South Korea where I live, but it shows great point of view in media industry. From the start, movie keeps talking about money. Maybe that is the thing movie wants to say. As long as media needs money it will bring you the news that can make money not the truthful and worthy. And there are big differences between money and truth. They only match each other by chance.This movie took great long take shots that reminds me of 'Drive'.

It covers the subject of vigilante journalism, and how some people might be willing to go to some terrible extremes to get the big story.It's very entertaining, and really held my attention, even though I didn't care much for the social commentary, or hetero love obsession aspect.

I've seen American Dream movies like Pain & Gain and American Made, but Nightcrawler is by far the darkest.

Dark ambitions...,"Dan Gilroy's provocative directorial debut is a psychological thriller set in an unfamiliarly gritty Los Angeles. The film follows Lou Bloom (an emaciated Jake Gyllenhaal), an anti-social and driven man desperate for work who stumbles upon the world of ""nightcrawlers"" – freelance camera crews who film footages of car accidents, fires, shootings and all sorts of mayhem to sell to the local TV news. The lives of everyone around Lou is put in danger as he falls deeper into this rabbit hole of madness and immorality.What is captivating about Nightcrawler is that it does not judge its characters. The film tells a story that delves into the seedy and unnerving realms of the human psyche and it us up to the audience to ponder and reflect on what unfolds before them. Gilroy skilfully balances the dark comedy, thriller and satirical elements in the film, giving us a thematically-rich and suspenseful dive into the abyss that will surely stay with you long after the credits have rolled.There is an abundance of unsympathetic characters in the film, from Rene Russo's twisted TV producer to the fellow nightcrawlers Lou crosses paths with who will stop at nothing to exploit tragedy in hopes of making ends meet and surviving in a cutthroat society. The moral compass of the film is Riz Ahmed's Rick, a young man Lou recruits as an assistant who is unwillingly made an accomplice as a determined Lou commits one illegal act after another, trying to make his way up the top of the game. It's not just about being the first to reach the scene of the crime, it's about creating a story so shocking it would be impossible for people to turn away from.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a mesmerizing and disturbing career-best performance as one of the most memorable characters of the year. He is physically and mentally committed in embodying an eccentric and fascinating human unlike anything we've seen before. From his distinct mannerisms to his impeccable monologue deliveries, Gyllenhaal makes sure the audiences can't look away no matter how uncomfortable the situations become (a particular scene involving a broken mirror will surely be an image that will be seared into your memory). What's even more unsettling is that we see bits and pieces of ourselves in Lou. From the first frame, the film is given an eerie and ominous atmosphere, thanks to cinematographer Robert Elswit (Paul Thomas Anderson's frequent collaborator) and James Newton Howard's minimalistic but effective score.Part satirical view of media sensationalism, part success story, Nightcrawler is one of those rare films that is not only superbly entertaining, but sophisticated and thought-provoking in equal measure.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

""Taxi Driver"" was a sensational movie about a LONELY, PSYCHOTIC, NIGHT-OWL DRIVER where the female lead is of different age level. Although Taxi Driver was a far better movie, miles ahead of Night Crawler, yet Night Crawler aside from the thrilling story and the performance tries to convey a message about inhumanity in the media sector, how immoral this sector is evolving. Jake was THE Oscars biggest snub of the year. His weight loss is a dedication, his performance is CREEPY and that's the least description of that performance. The script helped Jake to reach the summit of brilliance. The movie was a thrilling adventure, The movie was smart, explored the life of a free lancer for the first time -I suppose-. The movie was good but Jake stole the show with his Jordan Belfort's quotes and Travis' insanity. Louis Bloom is the off-spring of Travis and Jordan.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Why Lou Bloom ignored the rules to film a crime scene.,"In ""Nightcrawler,"" the protagonist, Lou Bloom, breaks all the rules to get crime scene footage for a variety of reasons that stem from his obsessive ambition, lack of morality, and distorted worldview.Ambition and Success: Lou Bloom is driven by an intense desire for success and recognition. He sees the world of crime journalism as a potential avenue to achieve the wealth and status he craves. To him, breaking the rules is justified if it leads to capturing more shocking and exclusive footage, which in turn increases his chances of selling his footage to news outlets.Unscrupulous Morality: Lou lacks a strong moral compass and exhibits sociopathic tendencies. He views people as tools to further his own goals rather than as individuals deserving of empathy. This lack of empathy allows him to exploit tragic situations without guilt, capturing graphic images that he believes will bring him financial gain.Sensation Sells: Lou recognizes that the media industry thrives on sensationalism. He understands that graphic and shocking footage of accidents, crimes, and tragedies fetch higher prices from news stations. By intentionally breaking rules and pushing boundaries, he aims to provide the most sensational footage possible, feeding into society's morbid fascination with violence and tragedy.Competition and Pressure: The competitive nature of the freelance crime journalism market places immense pressure on Lou to outdo his rivals. In order to stay ahead, he resorts to increasingly unethical and dangerous tactics to capture footage that no one else can. This includes trespassing, manipulating crime scenes, and even endangering his own safety and the safety of others.Manipulative Relationships: Lou develops a manipulative relationship with Nina Romina, a news producer played by Rene Russo. He recognizes her desperation for high ratings and capitalizes on it. He feeds her appetite for sensational content by providing exclusive, gruesome footage, solidifying his position as a key supplier while also exerting influence over her decisions.Delusions of Grandeur: Lou exhibits delusions of grandeur and narcissism. He believes that he is not just a journalist but a visionary who is reshaping the media landscape. This self-aggrandizing view fuels his willingness to break rules and disregard ethics, as he believes he is operating on a different plane than ordinary individuals.In summary, Lou Bloom's decision to break all the rules to obtain crime scene footage in ""Nightcrawler"" is a result of his unquenchable thirst for success, his absence of moral boundaries, his understanding of media sensationalism, the competitive nature of the industry, his manipulative relationships, and his skewed perception of his own importance. These factors combine to drive him to increasingly extreme and unethical actions as he seeks to achieve his ambitions at any cost.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Dan Gilroy's directorial debut is a sleek predator of a movie, one that slinks through the night with the grace of a panther and the bite of a viper.Lou Bloom, played with a haunting intensity by Jake Gyllenhaal, is our guide through this shadowy world. Bloom is a man of unsettling ambition, a self-taught videographer who seeks out the carnage of car wrecks and crime scenes with the zeal of a gold prospector. Gyllenhaal's performance is a high-wire act, balancing on the edge where charm turns into sleaze and assertiveness becomes aggression. His Lou Bloom is a creature of the night, a reflection of the city's dark heart.The film's visual language is as sharp as its protagonist's mind. Robert Elswit's cinematography paints LA in hues of danger and opportunity, every frame dripping with the promise of something more, something darker. The camera work is a character in itself, invasive and unapologetic, mirroring Bloom's own intrusive gaze.Rene Russo's Nina Romina is a perfect foil to Bloom, a news director whose ethical compass has been demagnetized by the cutthroat nature of television ratings. Russo brings a weary gravitas to the role, embodying the compromises and desperation of a career hanging by a thread. Together, Bloom and Romina dance a macabre tango, each using the other for their own ends, their relationship a microcosm of the film's central theme: the exploitation inherent in the news cycle.""Nightcrawler"" is also a scathing critique of the media landscape, where the line between reporting and sensationalism is not just blurred but obliterated. The film asks uncomfortable questions about our appetite for the lurid and the gruesome, and the lengths to which we'll go to feed it. It's a modern-day ""Network,"" with its finger on the pulse of a society that consumes tragedy as entertainment.Yet, for all its brilliance, ""Nightcrawler"" is not without its flaws. The film's pacing, relentless as it is, sometimes feels like it's chasing its own tail, circling around a point it has already made with gusto. And while the supporting cast is competent, characters like Rick, Bloom's hapless assistant, are underdeveloped, mere satellites in Bloom's orbit.Furthermore, the film's climax, though thrilling, borders on the implausible, a slight detour into the sensational that the rest of the narrative has artfully avoided. It's a minor misstep in a film that otherwise walks the tightrope of tension with the utmost confidence.""Nightcrawler"" is a film that lingers in the mind long after the credits roll. It's a nocturne for the lost and the ambitious, a symphony of ethical quandaries and captivating performances. It's a film that doesn't just depict a world; it holds up a mirror to our own, reflecting the uncomfortable truths we'd rather not see. And that is the mark of truly compelling cinema.",,Anonymous,Crime
"A bit overrated, but it's watchable because of Jake Gyllenhaal","I can tell why this movie has been getting praise by critics. The acting and dark direction with nor morality can be deemed as cool to some viewers. And I even heard some reviewers claiming the main character to be someone you could root for. I will have to disagree, there is just about no character in this with any redeeming qualities. And that especially includes the main character. So the plot is about this guy who is psychologically disturbed and thinks he is smarter than everyone else. The guy has some mental issues, where he has poor interpersonal skills but thinks he knows exactly what to say to get what he wants. In another words, he is calculative, methodical and highly manipulative when it comes to getting what he wants. Even by doing things that are highly illegal. And you really get to see the darker side of this character when he feels desperate to reach his goal. Which can apply to a lot of people, but Jake Gyllenhaal really knows how to sell this character with his outstanding acting chops. As this really strange and weird character Louis Bloom who most audience could tell as the film progresses that their is something off about this guy. More than the direction of the movie which is about a Lois Bloom going around capturing accidents or harm to other people on camera in order to elevate his status with his naive partner. It's the character's sociopathic behavior and hidden agenda that drives this film in my opinion. Overall it's a watchable film that didn't really entertain me all that much nor did it really grab my attention with it's intensity like I expected. Good character development though.6.8/10",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nightcrawler,"Every boss wants to hire a hard worker, that dedicates much of his life to his work, but I'm not sure someone would hire Lou if half of what he does was known. He doesn't like people, however he puts a good face whenever he needs to be listened to or respected. He can manipulate people easily to achieve his goals and has to achieve them. He's dangerous but people don't know that.A very good movie that shows us how corrupted can someone become when we're talking money or success. Also showing the state of our beloved (not) journalism. It slowly builds up to a fast movie with a lot of good scenes and a lot of Jake Gyllenhaal on screen, and oh my, what a good performance it was, perhaps his best one yet. I'm sure it will be nominated in some categories in the Oscars.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Gyllenhaal makes it, the ending breaks it","What a performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. He is terrifying yet friendly, and his character's progression is superb. He goes from small time criminal, who is just trying to get out of crime and into legitimate work, into a bona fide psychopath. Gyllenhaal's voice and expressions make him legitimately scary, but it could have been so much more. His character faces no repercussions, even though there was plenty of opportunities to give us something. I'm all for the bad guy getting away, but this seemed a bit underwhelming. It almost felt as they they were planning something bad to happen, but in the end ran out of time and decided to leave him to get away with it. Fantastic directorial debut though.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Creepy As Hell,"I had to give this film a five because who gives a ten to a film that leaves you feeling creepy. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job and I wouldn't be shocked if the right people thought he was Oscar worthy, but this film made me want to back away from the theater slowly.Louis Bloom is the person smart people cross the street to get away from. His sociopathic moves throughout the movie made me wonder why I ever thought he might be portrayed as an under dog at some major turning point in the story. Boy was I wrong. I would say this movie was good because it left you feeling something and because Gyllenhaal will, without doubt, make you believe he is this character.If you're looking for a feel good movie, don't see this. I would even recommend Gone Girl before this film. I literally feel sexually violated by the film. Now excuse me while I sit in a shower for the next hour, washing the memory of Night Crawler out of my brain.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Brilliant filmmaking with masterful Gyllenhaal,"One of the best film's of 2014 comes from writer Dan Gilroy, who makes his debut in the director's chair with this hard-hitting and unpolished story about a young drifter and petty thief who finds new purpose in life working as a freelance nightcrawler - roaming the streets of Los Angeles armed with a police radio and a camera, waiting for the next controversial and/or bloody crime to photograph - and then hopefully sell the pictures to one of the local news stations.On one level, this is a scrutinising and understated character study; an intimate, unrelenting examination of a man who does everything he can to keep up an appearance of professionalism and control, and who only through small glimpses of letting his guard down and his control falter discloses his true self. What's most remarkable about this character and Jake Gyllenhaal masterful portrait of him, is not how his sociopathic traits become apparent, subtly but surely, but rather how one of the reasons he never lets his guard down is because he fears what will be revealed underneath it, not for the sake of others, but for the sake of himself. It's as if he's never really gotten to know his own identity, perhaps because he's never successfully created it for himself, or perhaps because he doesn't dare to deal with him. Lou is a harrowing character with a psychological profile and depth reminiscent of iconic characters such as Travis Bickle (Taxi Driver) or Patrick Bateman (American Psycho). And Gyllenhaal's performance is up there with those of De Niro and Bale, respectively.On another level, Nightcrawler is stark, clever and thought-provoking social criticism, with a deft touch of black comedy sprinkled here and there. The interplay between our Lou and his news director Nina embodies the media criticism perfectly: Like the public and the entire media industry, Nina craves Lou's product like a drug. While she at first seems to be wanting the footage simply in order to succeed professionally, it soon becomes evident that her needs are far more deeply anchored: She's emotionally and physically drawn to the best (ie. The most extreme) news stories and shots like a moth to the flame, going as far as sacrificing her own personal life for the sake of it. She's not Lou's peer, in fact she's put off by his manipulative modus operandi, but they share the same goal, and she's a prisoner of the same industry (or way of life, if you like) - an industry which she of course brought him into in the first place.Gilroy's direction is piercingly sharp. He lets us do all the thinking of our own, but he never lets us escape. He invites us in and presents this wicked, dark world with all of its lure and attraction, all of the highs and, ultimately, the lows. He's not letting us doubt the attraction it all has on Lou, and although Lou is loner and a misfit, he's also very much a man looking for his place in society, just like any of us. Gyllenhaal makes him empathetic, but yet completely inaccessible, which makes him a fascinating mystery. And the film ends the way it always does in the news business, with another night and another story. Nothing learned, nothing remembered. Just brilliant filmmaking.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Like a nightmare, but one that you want to analyse the next day","Nightcrawler dips its creepily long fingers into the underground world of freelance journalism and the ethical breaches that one is willing to make.Director Dan Gilroy is reminiscent of a young Martin Scorsese in his creation of Nightcrawler's tone. Every shot is perfectly done, the editing is sharp, the score nails the tone of the movie at every opportunity, and the film has just the right lighting to create an aura of creepiness that you still want to pursue.But it is the performance of Jake Gyllenhaal that makes Nightcrawler a discussion for the water-cooler. Just as Gilroy is reminiscent of Scorsese, Gyllenhaal is reminiscent of DeNiro's Travis Bickle. Gaunt and hungry, Lou Bloom is a full blown psychopath who the audience can appreciate (but certainly not understand!) just by watching the minute subtleties in Gyllenhaal's face. It is clear that Bloom has no idea how to interact with others, and self- teaches himself how to laugh and show emotion, when in reality he approaches humans in the same way that a fly batts at a window.Nightmarish and creepy, Nightcrawler combines a fine directorial performance from Dan Gilroy with one of the finest and most disturbing male performances of the year. One of 2014's finest films.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very memorable and a film which leaves an impression,"Better film than I expected given the premise of the film and in the end I thought it was great. This film is very much character driven with Jake Gyllenhaal excellent. So more character than the story and in his role as Lou Bloom, Gyllenhaal created one of the most memorable obsessive manipulative morally reprehensive characters and one which does not look for or get audience sympathy or backing. For me this film was all about this character though there are excellent points made on the way the news media work, how people like quick fix horror stories than any news of real substance and Lou Bloom(Gyllenhaal) is only feeding this beast. This is set at night, through moral free glasses with a reprehensive obsessive character who the audience will look to see fall. But the larger message is the way our media works in this modern world and an excellent critique.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the best movies ever made.,"For me this is one of the best movies that have ever been made, with the best performance I have ever seen from Jake Gyllenhaal. He becomes this character in a way I've never really seen any other other become a character. You don't see Gyllenhaal in this, you see Loius Bloom. Bloom is a fascinating antihero and this whole script is just insanely written. Can't wait to see Gyllenaal and Dan Gilroy going at it again, filming for that starts in March and it should come out Hallowen 2018 - I'm incredible hyped for that film.",,Anonymous,Crime
"Dark, edgy and reasonably satisfying - although I still think it's unworthy of all the hype that surrounds it","Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) plays Louis Bloom, a desperate young man living in LA who is looking for work of any description. After a couple of unsuccessful attempts at gaining employment (one reason being that he is a known thief), Louis cruises the streets and stumbles across an accident on the freeway. His inquisitive nature leads him to ask questions to the camera crew about the industry that they're in and he then asks for a job which is quickly declined. Seeing a potential earner for himself, Louis equips himself with a camera and a police scanner and sets to work becoming a freelance reporter who sells his work to TV News Director Nina Romina (Rene Russo).Dark & Edgy - those are two words that first sprang to my mind when describing this film. Dark refers to the plot and Edgy refers to Gyllenhaal's character and the general narrative. In essence, it's actually quite a thin plot that sees Gyllenhaal and his apprentice Rick (Riz Ahmed) racing to various crime scenes in an attempt to cover the story before other news crews and law enforcement agencies attend the scene so that they have exclusive coverage. All these scenes are edgy and quite thrilling and there is also a bit of humour thrown in (notably when Rick causes Louis to overshoot a turn by 5 blocks because he was unable to follow the Sat Nav). The first half for me was much stronger than the second half; Gyllenhaal's character does suck you in right from the start; he's quirky, weird and a bit different, but it's a bit of a gimmick and it does start to wear thin.There were a couple of problems with this film; firstly I felt that the final act was a little too drawn out (although the exciting car chase does make up for this rather long final act). Considering, it's billed as a Thriller I wouldn't actually say it was consistently thrilling (although it certainly had many exciting moments).Ending on a positive note I thought Gyllenhaal was fantastic and I do believe he did a really good job at portraying a quirky and multi-layered character. The directing and editing were also superb and the whole film was very well put together. It's worth watching as it does offer the viewer something different, but I just didn't think it was a masterpiece or even close to being a masterpiece.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
I never realised this happened - disturbing,"Jake Gyllenhaal plays a disturbing individual who is struggling to get a job. One day he stumbles across a road accident and his odd personality drives him to stop, get out of his car and look, only to meet a guy with a camera filming the incident. He learns that this footage can be sold to the TV networks and realises this might be the career for him. The film follows his path as he learns the ropes and becomes a success using somewhat nefarious techniques.This was an interesting film and has tension, a slick dialogue and good pace. Jake delivers a solid performance in a character that makes you pretty uncomfortable throughout the film. It was great to see Rene Russo again who plays a failing TV exec willing to do what it takes to keep her job.Not a film I would normally visit the cinema for but I am glad I did.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Built Up for a Huge Ending and then....,"Nice cinematography and action shots (fantastic car/street shots), unique character roles (Gyllenhall was outstandingly creepy and tense in his opportunistic role; also his first role as a Producer), great score/sound-track throughout the film, an unexpected twist toward the end, an outraged/righteous detective hot on the trail (Michael Hyatt's acting in this role felt shallow which was aggravated by the in-your-face film-character), great special-effects with captivating sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat stunts, which all built up to an ending that was...very anti-climatic. Another 15 minutes could have structured a more fulfilling ending. Left the viewer with the feeling the film ran over-budget and cuts had to be made, or producers simply lost focus, as the puzzle-pieces of the film were not properly channeled to what should have been an outstanding ending. When the film comes out on Blu- Ray, certainly hope to find out there was an alternative ending that was mistakenly left on the cutting floor, rediscovered, and included with the disc.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

I won't list everything however.I found myself sweating during this film, (and no my heating wasn't on full whack) it was just that engaging and emotive, filled with suspense and creepy moments of Jake Gyllenhaal pressuring and manipulating other characters to do whatever he wanted them to.The film is kept in one direction and doesn't deviate from that direction, not even to show sex scenes for example.

And it shows the dark underbelly of LA, which like NY in Taxi Driver, is just another character in this movie.As Lou Bloom, Gyllenhaal is mesmerizing to watch. It will be hard for you to take your eyes off of him. As the creepy Nightcrawler, he gives an amazingly controlled performance. Rene Russo and Riz Ahmad provide great support.

"See It, You Will Thank Me","I've said it before and I'll say it again, Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the most talented and reliable actors alive today. He's blown me away in more movies than I can name (some of my favorites being ""Donnie Darko"", ""Prisoners"", and ""Enemy"") and his latest role as the sleazy crime reporter Lou Bloom even further proves his genius. He manages to up his first-class standard of acting and single-handedly carry this thrill ride of a film. ""Nightcrawler"" is one of those movies that comes out of nowhere and astonishes you, proving that Hollywood can still widely release great films. It's a game-changer, and an entertaining one at that.The film centers around Bloom, a driven young guy living in Los Angeles that never quite operates on everyone's level. Desperate for work and looking for something to occupy his time, he comes across the fast paced world of crime journalism. Quickly forcing his way into the business and filming anything the news stations will buy, he begins to tow the line between observer and participant, all for his own favor. The more dangerous it is to capture, the more money he receives. And as you can expect, things get out of hand (much to the pleasure of the audience).It moves at an insanely rapid pace from one incident to the next and is one of the most captivating films I've seen in a long time. I never stopped to check the time once, which certainly says something, and was mesmerized by the mannerisms and dialogue coming from this peculiar character. Everything about this movie enchanted me: the darkly comic moments, dedicated performances, and dynamite writing. Add all that up and you have one of my favorite films of the year.

Unapologetic Representation of Ruthless Manipulation,"If you have wondered who are those people that bring the gruesome crime images to our current affairs then Nightcrawler goes a step ahead in explaining how? This movie encapsulates the modern definition and make of management and success. The interesting characterization of the main lead i.e., Lou Bloom, portrayed artistically by Jake Gyllenhaal leaves you fascinated. He becomes the character in a manner that there is no presence of who Gyllenhaal is and no shadow of his past work. Knowledge hungry, curious, fast learner and ruthless character of Lou Bloom leaves the audience so flabbergasted that by the time we realize his psychopathic tendencies, we are no longer certain what to feel. Until we realize two important factors highlighted in the movie, which are: 1. Gyllenhaal is the modern day characterization of many successful managers and executives. 2. News isn't about the truth but about the perception and ideals of those who broadcast it. Lou Bloom's sentence structure and tone is what is often found in management books and training. To a degree Bloom's behavior and language makes clear the elimination of the human or emotional factor when confronted by Riz Ahmed's character (Rick Garcia) that Bloom doesn't understand people. Was anybody surprised at the unapologetic nature of Bloom? The writing, directing and acting of this movie concentrated on perfecting the characters especially Bloom and Nina (the news director played by Rene Russo) while keeping the ambiance and use of graphics neutral. Many might look at the story revolving around Lou Bloom but to support the growth of this character requires Nina. They share a partnership that is dysfunctional but just the right combination to nurture the path to success portrayed by the movie. The movie never derails from its initial concept and every single piece used in the movie is done aptly to support its theme, its message while maintaining the thrill the audience is seeking. In conclusion, the movie feels like a sarcastic representation of success harnessed by capitalism but one thing for sure, you will leave with a personal awakening. Therefore, it's absolutely worth the watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Stylish and creepy, Nightcrawler will keep you at the edge of your seat","Finally an original story. Nightcrawler takes the audience into the world of a business that few of us know very much about. The world of nightcrawling, aka recording brutal and terrifying scenes of accidents and crimes in order to sell the footage to news stations. That is the premise of the film, which doesn't sound that appealing when you first hear it, but there is a twist to the story. The twist is our main character, Lou Bloom, played flawlessly by Jake Gyllenhaal.Lou is what makes the story interesting. He is a very stubborn, focused and hardworking young man who is trying to discover what he is good at in life and make money off of it. After witnessing a camera crew shoot the scene of a horrific car wreck, Lou decides to take a crack at the business himself. In a business that already borders on the line of what is ethical and what isn't, Lou takes it a step further. Without spoiling the film too much, I will just say he manipulates everything and everyone around him in order to get an edge on the competition and get to the top.Jake is superb in this role. In my opinion, it is his finest work to date. I always find myself awestruck when actors are able to transform themselves for a role. Frail and gaunt is how Jake pictured Lou when he read over his character, so he decided to drop 20 pounds by working out 8 hours a day and eating very little. I think it worked because Lou's appearance very much fits his character. And what is even more astounding about Jake is that for his next film, Southpaw, where he plays a boxer, he transformed himself again by gaining 15 pounds of muscle making him virtually unrecognizable. I find that amazing and I sincerely hope to see a Best Actor nomination go to him this awards season.Dan Gilroy really caught my attention in his directorial debut. The scenes are stylish and creepy, just how I imagine the seedy underbelly of Los Angeles looks at 2 AM. He also filmed one of the best car chases I have seen in a movie in years. Very impressive work and I look forward to seeing what he does next.Nightcrawler is easily one of the best films of 2014.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
One of the Best Films of 2014,"When Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a driven man desperate for work, muscles into the world of Los Angeles crime journalism, he blurs the line between observer and participant to become the star of his own story. Aiding him in his effort is Nina (Rene Russo), a TV-news veteran.Despite what the Academy decides, this was among the best pictures of 2014. And, at the very least, this was the best performance of Gyllenhaal's career and he may likely never match it again. Bill Paxton was a bit odd, and whoever scripted the word ""brah"" made a serious error, but Gyllenhaal is unstoppable.And the film doubles as an action film (with impressive car chases and fire fights), or triples as a satire of the news industry... pointing out the well-known phrase ""it bleeds, it leads"" is even more true on television.

I've never been a fan of the news and media for twisting the truth, this movie accurately describes the seedy underworld of the evening news and the lengths at which these people will go to ensure there own success. You can spend the first half of this movie trying to figure out who is the antagonist of the movie, similar to Breaking Bads Walter White you will find yourself rooting for a man with clear moral issues.The dialog's so well written that it will grip you and capture your attention for the entirety of the movie.

Appalled not entertained,"I'll keep it short, because there's not much to say about this movie really, at least from where I'm standing.It starts off as something that could really be an interesting movie, young man trying to make a living in a big city without many options. First 40 minutes I found promising, but after that Nightcrawler turns into a disaster when it just tries to endlessly exploit its mentally disturbed main character by leeching out every sick and twisted idea out for a viewer to see. Everything JG says in the movie, no matter how hard it tries to make him seem sophisticated or smart, is all actually basic logic with a lot of excess words mixed with total lack of moral boundaries. Psychopaths are charming, which is a quality Louis doesn't posses, he is just being a blatant douche throughout the movie.. One more thing, Jake's acting is really something I'm not a fan of, it just seems so forced and fake, I never get the opportunity to empathize with his character(s), especially here where he plays a major anti hero..I can't say it's a total waste of 2 hours, the only half redeeming quality of Nightcrawler is its unique story. If you can put your emotions aside, then maybe you will like this more than I did, but for me, the disgust for main character was just overwhelming.By my standards,this movie should not have a rating of more than 6, but since it has an unrealistically high rating, I give it a 3.",,Anonymous,Crime

The plot was interesting enough, I hadn't really seen anything like it before. However, the movie is not as good as I was expecting after reading the comments of everyone praising it. It's good enough that I recommend a watch, however, don't go in expecting too much, or you will likely be let down. It's a whole two hours long, with some scenes seeming to be drawn out longer than they should, but in no way is it a bad movie.

What I enjoyed most was that at times I didn't feel like I was watching a movie at all because Bloom's character is too real; there are people like him who really do exist, which scary as hell! There were moments where a scene or two seemed to last forever, but that adds to what makes this film so real.The acting was superb, the plot nearly perfect, and almost every action that took place leading to the jaw-dropping ending kept me on the edge of my seat.

"Dark thriller of paparazzi, murder & ethics that excites instead of horrifies.","Nightcrawler is a disturbing thriller that entertains as much as it unnerves, and I'm not sure that's necessarily a good thing.The directorial debut of screenwriter Dan Gillroy (The Bourne Legacy), Nightcrawler does for paparazzi what One Hour Photo did for shop assistants and, indeed, Jake Gyllenhaal is on similar, sinister territory to Robin William's award-winning turn.Lou Bloom (Gyllenhaal) is an unemployed petty criminal searching for work and a quick income. As driven as he is desperate, he chances upon an emergency situation and observes the underbelly of journalism at work: The nightcrawlers, an unsavoury breed of TV news camera operators who monitor the police radio channels and scour the streets to capture lucrative, graphic 'real life' footage of accidents, murder and mayhem for the early morning news. The greater the tragedy and the more gratuitous the footage, the bigger the cheque.A self-professed quick learner, Bloom buys a cheap camera and shoots his first footage. An astounded news veteran, Nina (Rene Russo), snaps up the footage, gives him a quick lesson in shooting for the news and sends him on his way, unaware how ambitious Bloom is, or that he just might be a psychopath.Nightcrawler is a film of blurred lines. Is Bloom obsessed or unhinged? Does the news provide a service or macabre entertainment? When a cameraman shoots bedlam, is he a courageous professional opening a door onto another world for us, or just a voyeur twitching back the curtain for us to gawp? And are we any less guilty for watching? Gillroy has also ensured the relationship are as blurred as the themes, creating an ambiguity around that of Bloom and Nina. The scales of control waver and quite how much one party is coerced or a willing participant becomes hazy as Nightcrawler progresses, and it is all the better for it.The dynamic between Gyllenhall and Russo is exciting to watch, with the actors sparring beautifully. There is a crackle in the air when they share the screen due in part to the actors' possession of it, more so to the balance of fragility and confidence of their characters as the see-saw of power teeters on its fulcrum. While Bloom and Nina might claim to be newshounds offering a public service, when we get down to it he is little more than a grubby paparazzo and she his pimp.For those who recall the night and the aftermath of the paparazzi hounding that resulted in Princess Diana's death, Nightcrawler highlights the apparent good intentions of the responsible press and their overtures of self-governance and accountability by pointing at their abject failure to actually change. But it doesn't go far enough.Nightcrawler gives the impression of being really edgy but it doesn't quite hit those heights. Certainly it is unpleasant at times, occasionally it is downright distasteful, but it needs more. It scratches the filmy surface when it desperately needs to penetrate and sink to the murky depths of the mire beneath.Its strengths are in the idea and the characters, both the two principals and the supporting characters: Joe Loder (Bill Paxton as a rival nightcrawler who regards Bloom as a dangerous threat) and Rick (Riz Ahmed as Bloom's put-upon assistant troubled by both scruples and fear). But while both characters add a layer of depth and understanding to the human mess that is Bloom, in Joe's case, at least, I couldn't help feeling there was more that should have made the cut.Gillroy has packed Nightcrawler with darkness, brutality and the kind of horrific shots that make it onto the worst news shows on TV, but here they make the viewer want to see more, not to squirm and look away as we should. His film, though a fine debut, doesn't shock or horrify in the way it feels as though it should, and in the end Bloom doesn't come across as a sinister man, just an unpleasant geek with dark methods.Nightcrawler is exciting in a gratuitous way and I'm not entirely convinced that was the intention or that I am any better than Bloom for having sat there and enjoyed the experience. But I can handle that. Rather more concerning is that it peters out with a whimper instead of a stinging finale.I don't care about the morals of the film, I wanted to emerge either enraged or whooping it up in celebration. Instead I departed with a sigh akin to eating a fine cake, saving the cherry until last only to discover it is a wax decoration.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Jyllenhaal is a good actor but not good enough to make this movie worth watching,"Granted I was distracted during parts of the movie but never the less, I didn't think this movie lived up the reviews. To sum the movie up, A weird creepy guy doesn't have a job and goes around town asking to work for literally anyone, even a car repo place, for free!One day this weird creepy dude (whom some critics claim has high functioning autism but I think he is just a regular sociopath) comes across an accident where news reporters are filming it and decides, ""Oh, this is how I could make money!"" He then goes and buys a crappy camera and starts recording a much footage as he can. Somehow he manages to get footage ahead of the rest by listening to police scanners 24/7 (which literally all News stations do but I digress.) He even films a crime scene before police arrive.somehow. So basically out of all reporters, cops, and detectives, he uses a police scanner accessible to the public and manages to get there first.The movie is SO slow. I kept waiting for a plot twist but nope. Just the creepy guy filming more scenes in a loosely strung together plot. The main character is able to interfere with crime scenes, google search license plates with ease (in the 90's!!), and cut the breaks of a rival van without conflict. In fact, there really isn't any conflict. I've seen Disney films with conflict that was more solemn. Seriously, it's 1 + long movie of a weird sociopath shooting films leaving the audience on edge just waiting for the twist that never comes. This movie is like a roller coaster with no loopsso I guess more akin to a traina slow morning freight train. So if you want to watch a slow movie freight trainyou may enjoy this film.",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
High-Octane Entertainment and Thought Provoking; Fantastic Movie,"I was lucky enough to see an early screening of this movie in Boston that Jake Gyllenhaal made a brief appearance at to introduce it. I got some pictures with Jake (he's a really cool guy in person) and then sat back for what I expected to be a simple, entertaining movie and was very pleasantly surprised by a film that delivered so much more.Simply based on entertainment value, the movie is fantastic. The acting across the board is fantastic. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is like Jack Nicholson's in ""The Shining""--so terrifying that it puts a grin on your face. The tension is built masterfully and it explodes onto screen in the form of car-chases, shootouts, and heart-pounding, breath-holding scenes of lurking danger. And visually it's pleasing as well. The city streets of LA look fantastic at night, especially when they're scattered with fiery wrecks, and the eerie glow that comes from the protagonist's camera-mounted light makes some of the more gruesome scenes really shine.All of this I expected. What surprised me was its ability as a satire. GYllenhaal's character basically embodies the sociopathic tendencies of modern news production, so as the movie delves more and more into his disturbingly twisted mind it also establishes a very interesting social commentary. It's highly entertaining and thought-provoking at the same time and isn't that what we go to the movies to see? When this film hits wide release, I hope it gets the success that it deserves.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Best Film of 2014!,"Lou Bloom is a creepy sociopath! That is the lead in this freaky L.A. noir about a thief who becomes a leech who shoots grisly crime scenes for quick money. Gyllenhaal is fully committed to this part, completely throwing himself into it.But, the real star is ace cinematographer Robert Elswit, who very deservedly won an Oscar for ""There Will Be Blood."" He captures L.A. at night and the seedy goings-on so beautifully, there are so many shots that come across as paintings. Very impressive, and easily the best cinematography of 2014!Renee Russo is the powerful local TV producer whose lust for death and destruction might be even more frightening than Gyllenhaal's! She does cold very well.This is the kind of film that is so visceral and exciting that it gives you chills just watching it! Even James Newton Howard's score is good! And, he's a guy I think sleepwalks through a great many of the films he provides music for.You know that you are watching something deeply and gruesomely satiric when you are laughing out loud at the deeply cutting lines being delivered by people like Gyllenhaal and Russo!Great stuff, and now, THIS is my favorite film of 2014!

A Seriously Awesome Film; Gyllenhaal is Amazing,"Seriously, Jake Gyllenhaal has become an acting powerhouse in recent years. He's always been a talented guy but he's really taken over the spotlight with some amazing work lately. For example, his work with Denis Villeneuve (especially ENEMY) was fantastic, if you haven't already checked it out. Now he's come along and blown away both of those with NIGHTCRAWLER, from writer/director Dan Gilroy. For what it's worth, I'm ranking this as my favorite movie from 2014. Robert Elswit's cinematography is gorgeous, the three key cast nail it, and the story puts the network news system on blast for shady practices. Gyllenhaal is Lou Bloom, a local Los Angeles loser whom we meet as he's stealing metal from constructions sites to see for scrap. When he stumbles across a late night accident on the freeway, he's amazed to find a freelance camera team breeze in, grab some footage, and gun out for the next piece of news carnage. Bloom buys a set of cameras, hires a desperate assistant, and starts his own team. His disregard for procedure and human decency allows him to get the real bloody footage that other news crews can't and he becomes a hit with a local network news outfit. As time progresses, Bloom's footage becomes more and more risqué and he develops a stranglehold on the station's desperation for ratings. Bloom means business and the lengths he'll go for hit news become frighteningly apparent, and he refuses to let anyone stand between him and his success.This is Gyllenhaal's show and Lou Bloom is his best character to date. Bloom is a full- blown psychopath. We're given a glimpse in the opening when he's caught stealing the scrap metal; when he realizes it's an independent security outfit and not a police officer, he has no problem going on the assault. He's a fast-talker and incredibly intelligent. It makes you wonder how a man of his skill was down on his luck to begin with (unless that whole psychopath thing has closed a lot of career opportunities to him). When it comes down to it, Bloom is a terrifying individual. He holds no value for human life and he only values personal success, frequently at the expense of others. From what we learn, he's perfectly suited for the job as a nightcrawler or stringer (freelance camera teams who roam the city in search of footage to sell to local news). He has no qualms with getting right into the middle of the action, forgoing good taste in exchange for video other crews can't, or won't, obtain. He becomes an instant hit with news manager Nina (Rene Russo). He's her ratings guarantee, a chance to rise to the top of the local competition. She's just as unscrupulous as Bloom and she's willing to go towellgreat lengths to retain their business partnership. Russo and Riz Ahmed (as Bloom's assistant Rick) are really the only other two main characters in the movie and they all deserve accolades for their work here.As much as NIGHTCRAWLER is the tale of one psycho's rise to the top of his game, it's also a commentary on local news and the lengths to which they'll go to keep people tuning in. Bloom is only able to become a success because fear sells. Murders, carjackings, fatal accidentsthis is what grabs the peoples' attention and the news outlets know this. Constructing faux crime sprees out of isolated incidents and flashing pixilated corpses on the screen is enough to terrify the populace and keep them tuning in for more. The local news, as portrayed in NIGHTCRAWLER (and most assuredly true to life), is just as shady as the 24-hour cable news networks and their fear-monger campaigns (as satirized in David Fincher's GONE GIRL, also in 2014). Bloom violates the law and human decency because it's what the audience wants to see, and his disgusting nature is rewarded. NIGHTCRAWLER is definitely a dark movie and it's seriously an awesome watch. It's a gritty rags-to-riches story where the one person who displays an ounce of morality, Rick, eventually caves to the lure of extra cash. The end of NIGHTCRAWLER is one that leaves you feeling a little morose because we expect justice, but instead it plays against our expectations as a reminder that, in the real world, the good guys don't always triumph. This is a 100% recommendation on my part; NIGHTCRAWLER is a fantastic.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

A fun and nasty demented comedy,"A satire of sorts on local TV news and the bottom feeders they hire to film human suffering and death, Nightcrawler is a vicious and deranged black comedy. Jake Gyllenhaal does a fantastic job as an amoral sociopath who is far too committed to his work as a freelance videographer who films whatever graphic carnage he can and sells it to the local scuzzy news program who's ratings depend on this garbage. Rene Russo runs the late shift and her character and Gyllenhaal's develop an unhealthy dependency on each other, until it tilts in Gyllenhaal's favor to icky results. Russo, who has been absent from screens for the better part of this decade, turns in a sharp performance that she modulates almost perfectly as a past her prime news director just trying to stay in the cesspool of early morning news. These characters have no redeeming value and the film mines comedy from them reducing the worst, most horrific crime to a hefty payday or ratings. Cinematographer Robert Elswit films LA in a sickly, almost diseased way and director Dan Gilroy keeps the tone demented throughout as we watch Louis Bloom - who seems to be channeling some shades of Travis Bickle from Taxi Driver - plummet down to some truly grievous depths. Nightcrawler is a cynical film that has the guts to never cop out on its repugnant subject matter.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

The Early Bird Catches The Worm When He Eliminates The Competition.,"I'm giving this film a 7 out of 10, because of the originality of plot. I've never seen a film quite like it. Although I have given the film a generous rating, the film is not without its flaws.This film is the most controversial film of 2014. The film portrays an egocentric, compulsive and soul-less character Lou Bloom(played by Jake Gyllenhaal), who will stop at nothing to get what he wants and by whatever means necessary.Plot: Lou Bloom is a thief who sells his wares at a scrap yard, Bloom asks for a job, but the yard manager tells him he will not employ a thief. Undaunted, Lou looks for better prospects and he finds this opportunity while watching a freelance film crew he sees working the scene of a car crash.Lou steals a racing bicycle and trades it for a camcorder and radio scanner. He shoots the aftermath of a carjacking and offers the footage to a local TV station. The morning news director, Nina (Rene Russo), buys the footage and encourages Lou to continue his work. Thus Lou finds that by shooting raw footage of crime scenes and accidents as they happen, he could make a lot of fast money. Lou hires an assistant, Rick (Riz Ahmed), a young man just out of high school and desperate for money.See the film and find out what happens next...The acting, photography, background sound-effects are professionally handled. Dan Gilroy makes a superb debut as director and this film makes a solid starting point in his career as a director. While watching this film, you'd never expect that this was made by an inexperienced newcomer(remember Spielberg's Duel 1971 film).The best actor in the film is Jake Gyllenhaal. He is complemented well by veteran actors Bill Paxton and Rene Russo. I hadn't seen Bill Paxton for a long time. I think the last film I saw of his was Twister(1996).You may also like - Jake Gyllenhaal films: Zodiac (2007), Source Code(2011), End Of Watch(2012), Brokeback Mountain (2005).Rene Russo films: Lethal Weapon 3 (1992), In the Line of Fire (1993), Outbreak, Get Shorty (1995), Tin Cup (1996), Ransom (1996), Lethal Weapon 4 (1998).Bill Paxton films: Aliens(1986), True Lies (1994), Predator 2 (1990), Near Dark (1987), Monolith (1993).",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
visually appealing...acting and script kill it dead,"I'll admit this film has the kind of grandiose cinematic feel to it that money alone probably cant buy, but holy bananas the acting in this is nothing short of dire. Every supporting actor seemed to stiltedly barf their lines out like they were auditioning for a new soap opera that will be shown bi-monthly on a youtube channel with 37 subscribers, everyone was that bad. As for the lead character, who on earth talks like that? Although his bizarrely precise stream-of-consciousness rambling was presumably supposed to come off as...something (quirky?), I never got the impression that Jake Gillinghall (or however you spell it) was doing anything other than trying to remember his lines from the script as he spoke. This got annoying fast and I didn't buy any of it.As for the plot, what could've been potentially thought provoking soon became monotonous and increasingly obvious as it went along. Why do so many films these days feel the need to repeatedly smash you over the head with the 'point' they're trying to prove? Subtlety is dead. Before long it all got sappy, and anodyne generic guitar-based backing music started playing over scenes for no reason. At this point I quit, and I'm not even bothered if Nightcrawler miraculously got better towards the end, my boredom threshold had maxed out. Another critically acclaimed flop.",3.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Instant Classic Film and Character,"""Nightcrawler"" may very well be the best film of the year.Many times with a directorial debut feature, we're seeing a long-time-coming original work. This flick is no exception.We're given insight into a unique corner of the world that has never been highlighted to my knowledge in film before. I'm not even sure if the concept of a ""nightcrawler"" is real, but what it means to go ""nightcrawling"" is to give television stations (or their competitors) the chance to give their viewers front-row seats to breaking stories.The footage they capture can be seen as raw and unprofessional, but our title character gets so in-depth he starts his own business where ""in order to gain job security you must make yourself an indispensable employee""...at any cost. The film plays like a behind-the-scenes look into the world of television news, and could be seen as insightful as why our news is so dark. While the ""news"" is not at all the subject of this flick, the heart of the whole thing may just be how to get your own business running, but the plot itself plays perfectly in the background of a mad character study. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom, a conniving manipulator who is more character than personality, both smart (even though he doesn't come from a ""proper education"") and psychotic (he'll do whatever he needs to get ahead), in a performance so precise we always know what's going on in his head and his motivation (business, capitalism) so haunting he almost disappears as an actor. The film itself almost makes you forget you're watching a movie from cinematography mixed with shaky-cam (""steady hands"") so purposefully and editing that builds into an edge-of-your-seat climax culminating itself with a car chase of the like I haven't seen in years (even if it is still overly-edited).If this flick were made in the '80s, we would get sequel after sequel with new actors playing the main nightcrawler, but as the genesis film surely warrants a dozen rip-offs of an idea this great, this one will stay fresh in our minds for a long time.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime

Disturbing ? Yep ! But we're all a bit like Lou !,"""My motto is if you want to win the lottery you've got to make money to get a ticket.""What a brilliant performance by Gyllenhaal in this rather morbid and exciting thriller. At times I was wondering whether it was meant to be amusing and jokingly or that it was intended to be presented as a serious and shocking story. Judging from my own chuckling at times and disbelief about what was being shown, I could only conclude that ultimately it was a mix of both. And it's masterly portrayed by Gyllenhaal, the chameleon of Hollywood and someone I do appreciate very much as an actor. After his appearance in ""Prisoners"" (which was an exceptionally exciting film) and the arty movie ""Enemy"" (as a story it was not my cup of tea, but in terms of performances it was again a success) just like Matthew McConaughey in ""Dallas Buyers Club"" he transformed physically into a gaunt, pale-looking good-for-nothing. Initially, he looks like a marginal person with a mental disability, but as you get to know him better, you come to the conclusion that he's extremely intellectual and has a kind of photographic memory. The way he quotes chunks of information that he has read on the Internet is pretty impressive. Louis Bloom is not exactly a simple figure but rather a cunning and manipulative character.The whole story starts with Lou in the process of cutting a fence. He's initially no more than an insignificant criminal who earns his money by stealing copper and the like. Until he witnesses an accident one night on one of the highways around Los Angeles and he sees a freelance reporter (Bill Paxton) capturing the whole thing on film and after wards selling it to the highest possible price so that it can be used for the morning news. Lou doesn't waste any time and purchases a simple camcorder and police scanner. Immediately an assistant (Riz Ahmed) is being contracted and he hits the streets every night to film police interventions. His unconstrained personality and unscrupulous approach, ensure that he can capture pretty sensational images, allowing him to conquer a permanent position at the local station KWLA6. Here it's Nina Romina (Rene Russo) who rules as news editor. The straightforward film style of Lou appeals to her. As a sensation channel the presented footages can't be bloody enough. As she clearly stated : ""The best and clearest way that I can phrase it for you, to capture the spirit of what we air, is think of our news cast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut"".As the title ""Nightcrawler"" partially reveals it, most of the scenes are made during the night in the city of Los Angeles. This provides some beautiful nighttime shots with Lou speeding around in his shabby car (which subsequently will be replaced by a flashy sports car) through the streets on his way to a variety of calamities he has overheard by using the scanner. He's a ""disaster tourist"" equipped with a camera. The film is an indictment against the growing sensationalism in contemporary reporting. The look and shocking effect takes precedence over content and objectivity. You can compare it with the bread and circuses in the Roman Empire. Lou is the personification of this somewhat repulsive attitude. On the one hand he's quite insane and frightening. On the other hand he's a real goal getter who misuses the Achilles heel of the media world in a shrewd way to benefit from. One man's loss in this case is Lou's gain.That the masterful rendition by Gyllenhaal, as the extremely manipulative and creepy Lou, takes on the lion's share of this exciting and simultaneously satirical film, is beyond dispute. But the supporting characters contributions are as important,convincing and certainly successful. First there is Riz Ahmed as the pitiful Rick, the assistant Lou has chosen in between, after a rather absurd interview. Rick is the prime example of someone who can use the money and who's offered the job because he has a smart phone with GPS function. He's overwhelmed by the silver-tongued Lou and him being a dogsbody after wards was also predictable. No wonder you instantly think he's likable. It was also a pleasant surprise to see Rene Russo acting again as Nina Romina, the unyielding editor without a conscience. I haven't seen her after ""Lethal Weapon 3"". The fact Dan Gilroy is her husband, probably made sure that the selection criteria were flexible. Yet this wasn't a bad interpretation and you witnessed the way Lou gradually took control over this seemingly fragile little personality.It was clear how it would end eventually. Although there was a choice between two possible denouements (two logical endings that arose to me spontaneously), the end was still intense and surprising. A disgusting example of self-centeredness and self-preservation. An example of which way our society is going and how people disregard ethics. The moral of the story is that there is a lack of morality in the media landscape and society today. Does this sound pretty cynical, nasty or downright morbid to you ? I'd suggest to take a look at yourself in an honest way and think whether or not you would slow down when passing a traffic accident in order to catch a glimpse of a victim? Or you'd return home quickly to zap to a news channel just because you have heard a disaster happened somewhere ? You come to the conclusion after wards that we are all a little bit like Lou.

His unblinking eyes create an eerie atmosphere, effectively conveying the intense dedication of a man consumed by ambition. Through his performance, one is truly convinced that this character is a psychopath who cares little for the well-being of others. The unwavering gaze serves as a visual representation of his relentless drive, a constant reminder that his professional success takes precedence over any semblance of ethics.It is rare to witness such an immersive portrayal of a morally bankrupt character. Jake's ability to convincingly embody this complex individual showcases his exceptional talent as an actor. His dedication to the role is evident in every scene, as he fearlessly delves into the dark depths of his character's psyche.While the movie itself may lack intricacy, Jake's performance elevates it to a memorable experience. His portrayal of a relentless careerist, willing to trample over others to achieve success, is both captivating and disturbing.

An uplifting tale of a hardworking man,"You see, the title is a joke. This film is the total opposite of the word 'optimism'. I don't know if the whole film is itself a metaphor or something, but you don't get anything to learn from it.The film redefines the pattern of thriller films. There's an abnormality in the lead character that makes you question the existence of such people in real life. Generally, in thriller films, you'll be forced to connect with the lead character (usually female) who gets stuck up in a really complex situation and we'll all be expecting a 'close enough' escape but in this film, the lead character shows no signs of humanity and as he says in the film it becomes, 'our choice' to watch the film or not.What amuses me is this way that they've written a script that would perfectly fit into a short film into a feature film because the entire film is in the format of a short film explaining the life of the lead, in a suspenseful way. The climax too was not a shock or something, anyone could've guessed it. Thus, I've reviewed this film successfully as optimistic as it's tone. 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Not all stories need to contain twists, but if this film was an onion, you'd get to see the heart section after only peeling a couple of layers. The characters are two-dimensional and the story unfolds somewhat predictably - even though it attempts to create a subtle atmosphere of mystique to make you think something unexpected is coming. For an almost two-hour long film, this feels very ponderous and stiff.It's the directorial debut for Dan Gilroy, and the lack of experience shows. The soundtrack is perfunctory and the cinematography... well, it's like an experienced influencer with a fancy camera in their hands. The camera work doesn't add on to our understanding of the ambience nor heighten the portrayal of the inner feelings of the characters. In fact, it often feels claustrophobic. The director is so eager to center us on one thing at a time sometimes we desperately need a breather from it. Think of a photo with a person in it, but photo after photo, he stands right at the center of it. Even worse, sometimes there are 'mistakes' - for example, a clean frontal view of something but other objects bleep in from the sides or people/faces are awkwardly cut off at the sides of the frame.It has a few nice shots of L.

"Original, engaging and gritty film making.","I must say Gyllenhaal is doing really decent films that can show an actor's ability to portray dark characters that delve deep into the mind of the audience and engage us from start to finish. Nightcrawler is one such film. With engaging performances from the main characters and an original and interesting plot that keeps us captivated, it's a must see.The pace of the movie flows smoothly by the plot's design and there is never a dull moment. What makes this movie great is the performances by the cast in relation to the script. I do believe that Gyllenhaal might be nominated for his performance come awards season.The suspense of this film is quite chilling because for a moment you get so absolved in the movie, you watch with baited breath as it unfolds quite unforgivably.Superb performances, original story and a lot of suspense.

Sadistically Fantastic!,"OK what I just said may seem like a bit of an oxymoron but wow is this movie good. It is so dark and edgy! I was extremely upset that it wasn't nominated for more academy awards.Lou Bloom is a sociopath who is looking for a job. He comes across the profession of nightcrawling, which is filming news stories and selling them to news broadcasters. He takes on an employee and together they nightcrawl all over Los Angeles.The writing in this is just fantastic. It is so well scripted and works well with all the characters. Almost all of the dialogue is quick and witty and works well with the tone.Jake Gyllenhaal, in my opinion, is one of the most versatile actors of our generation, he is just so good and so believable in this role. It reminded me a bit of his Donnie Darko role. He is just amazing and it was a huge snub that he didn't get an Oscar nomination.

There is nothing quite as satisfactory as watching a film portray people in society as the pigs they truly are.,"If you're looking for a film that will do just that, Nightcrawler is the one to see. This movie exposes the perverse nature of human entertainment and competition right in front of us, and while you might think it's something that won't affect you, this movie makes it apparent that no one is truly safe from the hands of those determined to get what they want.Set in the dumpy outskirts of Los Angeles, the main character, Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), is a lone man who is tight on funds and looking for a job. One night he stumbles upon the scene of an accident, where he witnesses a news crew getting in and filming raw footage to sell to TV stations around the city. He is instantly intrigued. After purchasing a camcorder and police scanner and hiring a broke assistant, he sets out to get his own footage that he hopes he'll be able to profit from as well. Soon he learns that the news filming business is more competitive than it appears. The news stations want more and more dramatic footage for their morning broadcasts, and he will do whatever it takes to get higher and higher towards achieving that.But here's the catch; Lou is no ordinary man just looking to make his way in the world. It quickly becomes apparent that there's something off about this character. He may act friendly, but behind the mask of that creepy smile lies a person severely lacking in empathy and emotion. The perverse plotting and ultimatums he lays out towards anyone who stands in his way of success shines light into the disturbed mind of a very evident sociopath. The story spins further out of control as Lou demands more and more drama and action to report on, stopping at nothing to be the best in the business, even when it comes to breaking the law. He figures out that if he can beat the police to an area, he can modify the scene to make it look even better on film. Gyllenhaal does a remarkable job at showing the character of a cold blooded villain trying to convince himself and others that he's a normal part of society. The movie really excels at realistically portraying all of the different people and motives that make up modern society, even the less desirable ones.The downward spiral of this film not only shows the perversity of a sociopath, but of TV viewers themselves. We constantly crave more and more violence and on the scene drama, and the television stations will bring it to us as long as there's a demand. All sorts of ethical boundaries are overstepped for the sake of viewers' entertainment. While Nightcrawler's sociopathic character may be individually responsible for certain events on screen, this movie also showcases the more subtle problem that is society's fault at large. Just how far are we willing to go to see what we want to see?Nightcrawler is one of those films that's unsettling simply because it's so realistic. Everything on screen could and probably does happen in real life. News crews spinning out stories just to gain ratings, journalists overstepping ethical boundaries to build attention for themselves, all of these things are something that we as society are only fueling with our desire for entertainment. And apparently it takes a true sociopath to bring it all to the table for us.Overall, I'd give this movie 9 out of 10 stars. The whole plot was totally intriguing, but the end doesn't leave with much closure. Maybe that was the director's intent due to the nature of the disturbing storyline. It just left me wanting to see more. Nightcrawler ended up being a delightfully creepy film to watch, and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good mindboggling thriller.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A superbly unnerving experience let down by an abysmal score.,"The atmosphere and tension that engulfs every scene in this movie makes this is a fantastic commentary on the questionable morality of broadcast news.Gyllenhal doesn't have to stretch too much to hit his forte as an unpredictable sociopath; you really don't know what he's going to do next, which makes for a appropriately-uncomfortable watching.Unfortunately, the score not only fails to reflect what's happening on screen, it seems to be from some other scene from another movie. For example, when Lou (Gyllenhal) is filming a pretty grotesque accident, the music swells triumphantly, like something off a sporting underdog story. It really is quite bizarre, and spoils what is otherwise a very immersive story.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

An Oscar nominee for Jack,"After doing some pretty naive and adventurous roles such as sweet baby face Prince o f Percia in which I would for surely want to date him, marry him and put on a show for him every day when he comes from work, Jack Gyllehaal has made a fascinating transformation in Nightcrawler which reminded me of what Jack Nicholson succeeded to achieve in ˝The Shining˝and or what sir. Anthony Hopkins succeeded in ˝The silence of the lambs˝. Mr. Gyllenhaal captures the viewer and pulls him into the world of a psychopath- where there are no emotions, no rules and no restrains and refrains except the ones that the individual makes for himself and everything is the other way around- the world should obey your set of rules and the opposite. It is, for most people, a strange and unknown world which is hard to demonstrate to a normal person. Mr. Gyllenhaal has achieved to make this world more near and familiar to us and what is frightening is that those kind of flawed personalities exist in our world and moreover they are successful individuals or at least some of them are. In contrast to the sweet prince of Persia I wouldn't date the nightcrawler, his physical appearance and facial expressions, mimic and gesticulation gave me the chills. Very good movie which confirms that film still is the seventh art and not just bland form of entertainment for wider public.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Desperation and moral depravity,","Gyllenhaal either made this character his own, or it was written for him. He is perfect as the deranged ""nightcrawler"", and I'm sure the movie would not have worked as well without him.This movie deals with situations of a graphic nature - however nothing worse than what you can see on certain crime shows or other movies. However, by showing it indirectly - as a news broadcast, or through a camera, it feels more real, and you feel guilty for watching it. The attraction of sex and violence.I am not American, and not used to American-style news, so for me this felt all a bit exaggerated (and it very well may be). The media situation portrayed in the movie is one spiraling downwards, and hopefully reality is not that bleak.In addition to the graphic content mentioned earlier, the movie is also interesting in what it does not show. There is talk of blood on a character's shirt, but it is never shown. The same with sexual encounters that are mentioned, but not shown. This fits well into the above mentioned theme of the movie.In the focus of this movie is interplay between desperation and moral depravity. Lou's character is not brave, his sense of moral is missing. Through him, the desperate (the two other main characters) try to solve their own problems. Doing this, allowing Lou to continue his work, corrupts them morally - but it helps solving their problems.My main objection I guess would be that it's hard to how Lou ended up where he is in the beginning of the movie. Some hints are dropped at how he spent his time, but he ""learns so quickly"" that it's hard to believe he would be at the point the movie opens on.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Quite Impressive philosophy, which is not a cup of tea for everyone!","Initially I was just thinking what the hell is going on with the screenplay? What's the motive of the writer? Why the hell the main character is acting like this? Is he an anti-hero or what?Soon these questions in our mind just faded away when the actual storyline came in front of us around after 25/30mins. The acting performances, facial expressions, motives and especially the risk taking decisions of the protagonist simply amazed us. But in the final act we just couldn't able to decide whether to support him or Not? That's totally on your Mental ability and it's the actual kick on your brain and the real philosophy of the writer will be tested according to your brain.Overall a good movie with lots of Bloody Graphical Violence so better to watch it if you are at least 15+.

"Excellent piece of acting, but pretty standard stuff","There's not much to say about the story of Nightcrawler. If it rises to the category of satire, as many of the reviewers here think, it's hardly original in attacking TV news for featuring crime and blood as a way to boost their ratings. That's been done a hundred times, and often much better than this. Most of the action consists of a guy rushing up to a n accident or crime scene and pushing his way into the chaos to get video footage. Not much of that sticks in your memory.The movie's one saving grace is the driven, manipulative insanity of the main character. Gyllenhaal has a gleam in his eye that, even in the quietest moments, makes it clear that this guy, for all his attempts to charm people, is crazy and dangerous.There are plenty of time-wasters worse than this.The writers deserve special credit for one scene. The main character's attempt over dinner in a Mexican restaurant to seduce the woman who's in charge of buying his videos is so wacky, so remote from any normal relationship, that it's humorous at the same time that it's appalling. There the dialogue carries the scene on its own, and Gyllenhaal doesn't have much to do beyond speaking the lines.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
Interesting But Not Enough,"Every once in a while, a movie will come along that people will glow over...and if you don't, they consider you an idiot. I feel this is that movie. It's a snob's movie.It's an interesting idea, but the main character is so despicable and so removed from being an empathetic character, you really just want to strangle him rather than understand.It's a simple idea, that goes against the norm. Why? Not because the story is that interesting, it's because the script requires it to. Let me give you an example... If I were to tell you that in every movie a man will start up his car, drive down the street and pull into work, my solution to making it mundane is to make the guy an assassin. The anticipation of his drive becomes different. Does it make it a little more interesting? Yes. Does it make it a good movie. No.What I do like were the supporting characters. It's frustratingly easy to play them mental case, as Jake G. does. It's a slow burn, but a constant one. He isn't right for this role. He's got a dull look. And losing weight to look gaunt doesn't improve the interior storm. He becomes a bargain basement Tobey Maguire when they needed someone that could balance the dark and funny. Gyllenhall is just too bland.To the movie though, there are just too many open ended moments. What really irritates me abut this, is that ratings are so high that a pedestrian movie watcher is going to feel really driven to watch it. Most should be warned, it's not typical ""entertainment."" Most will be confused as to what they just watched. It's unfair for intellectuals to not realize that a guy from a factory coming home for a weekend is going to take your suggestions and think it's really great. It's not. It's so interior with its ideas most people outside of L.A. may be disappointed. It's the culture that doesn't exist outside of oddball self-involved jerks.",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
Makes a nice tight package ... suspenseful and entertaining,"An awful lot to like in NIGHTCRAWLER.Gilroy, known for his edgy scripts, remarkably finds an area of Real Life that Hollywood has not already done 300 times --- the guys who get the news for the TV stations -- and builds a nice tight film around it.Nice supporting performances by the ever-reliable Bill Paxton (one of the most distinctive speech patterns in the biz) and Rene Russo (of Lethal Weapon fame).But the star turn is from Jake Gyllenhaal who makes you forget that he USUALLY plays heroes and good guys (remember SOURCE CODE) and instead delivers a performance which is equal parts Rain Man and Hannibal Lector by way of early de Niro.He is nothing short of brilliant.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
You can't simply go wrong with Jake Gyllenhaal movies.,"Jake's roles are similar because each role has a problematic self. And this isn't out of those examples. He hates people too much, wants lots of money, and has some kind of madness while he has talent (which I think he would succeed in any ""legal"" job if he wanted) such as being good at convincing people, learning fast, or not caring about other people's opinions (this led to his dominant tendency btw).This was a pretty wild ride because I had never seen tv thinking how this was captured. To me, tv was such a reliable, honest source of information since when I was even younger.Now I don't trust anything.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Really good movie, Gyllenhaal is so creepy","Nightcrawler is an intense thriller set in the nocturnal of Los Angeles. Jake Gyllenhaal lead this movie with a tremendous solo effort, to create, to be honest the quite creepy character of Lou Bloom. Bloom, is rock bottom but is driven and will do anything to break into the world of high speed crime journalism. Bloom approaches Nina (Rene Russo) who is a station manager of one of the lowest rated stations and has a similar desire to Bloom. In this motion picture we see the cut throat and ruthless world of night crawling and what is stake to these freelance cameramen.Nightcrawlers capture intimate and exposed shots of crime and accidents, they race to capture this before the emergency services can move the scene away from the incident. Jake Gyllenhaal is brilliant, Bloom is genuinely one of the most manipulative characters i've seen in a while, he knows what he wants and he will do anything to get it. Gyllenhaal captures this so well, with a cold detached ruthlessness which fits the job so well. Gyllenhaal is top class.Dan Gilroy and cinematographer Robert Elswit create a unique way of seeing some truly ugly human events in such a clear and and astounding way, the cinematography and production is really something. This a tough watch, the movie contains morally challenging content as we see the inner workings of journalism and how they can potential manipulate or hold information to bring an angle or anticipation to a story. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat with some some great scenes to look out for, people question the ending of it but i think that the ending finishes in a fitting way to relate to the movie, a great movie.Check out the rest of my reviews on http://russellviews.blogspot.co.uk",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Jake is beyond creepy here,"The most suspenseful film of the year to date. It was mesmerizing to watch writer/director Dan Gilroy's shocking portrayal of a psychopath calmly doing the very dangerous and criminal things that exited him no end but would leave a normal person senseless and useless. The story and format of the film has been discussed so I will concentrate on the very engrossing way the story told about Louis Bloom(Jake Gyllenhaal) and the very scary way he lived his new-found dream(nighcrawling TV sensationalist ""news"")and why he was so successful at it when we are all told that psychopathy is a severe mental disease with no cure and no hope of a normal life. In this film story it was so well shown to be the opposite in this story, as the psychopath Louis Bloom not only did well, he prospered greatly by living his crazy but carefully calculated life without the personal care, caution and integrity that most of of us try to live by. Nothing mattered to him but his work, and big success from it, as all people were mere pawns used for his game, even if it killed them. His all-engrossing intensity during ""the chase"" and accompanying car chase of each story was mesmerizing to watch. You will not forget Louis easily after seeing this film. Nightmares may result. Watch your neighbor carefully.The denouement suspense was without equal, the car chases were wonderfully shot in nighttime L.A., especially the last one that ended in tragedy(but not to Louis, of course, he loved it). And, the final, nearly sexual climax conversational interplay between Louis and the TV station news director, so well played by Rene Russo, gave us real insight into the distorted emotions and greed that drives these deranged types to want to show such gruesomely graphic and sensationalist stories as the lead-in stories for their ""newscasts"". Winning at any cost, of course, was their only goal. Nothing else mattered, certainly not truth, facts, obeying the law, or even human decency.The film was hard to watch at times, and it will leave you creeped out at the end but also entirely satisfied that you just saw a great and original film story with great acting. Don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
it almost seems like there should be more,"The movie keeps you wondering what is going to happen next. Even though the dialog sometimes seems wordy and goes nowhere, eventually the action heats up again and your thrown into the mess of the night crawler world.The writer and director, Dan Gilroy, obviously had no one to do a little snipping on the dialog. Gilroy's is probably also responsible for slow parts of Real Steel and The Bourne Legacy, but he can do action scenes better then most.Despite the name of the movie sounding like a b rated horror flick, it is not bloody or horrific at all, but it is suspenseful in the extreme.The premise is the cherry picking of violent events to increase viewer-ship, which leads to the rights of the fourth estate vs police needs.However, the ending seems like a cop out to the whole premise of the movie. I'd like to see a night crawler II where Lou, the character of Gyllenhaal, gets tangled up in his web of deceit, but have someone edit the dialog.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A Perfect Representation of The American Dream,"Nightcrawler is without doubt one of the best films I had seen from 2014, if not my favourite. Personally stealing the limelight from any other films released in that year, Nightcrawler is a film that when you see on the shelves at a store you get that exciting tingle through your body to buy it before realising you already have a pristine copy locked away in your Holy Grail of films cabinet. Honestly... it's that good.On first viewing of the trailer, I was intrigued, but only enough to keep the film in the back of my mind knowing that one day I remember to eventually go to see it. Upon hearing mixed reviews from friends, I decided I wouldn't waste my money. I let a few months pass before seeing the film appear online. I had an evening free and decided to watch it on my laptop with headphones which I would later come to regret not seeing on the big screen.To put it into simple terms:I WAS BLOWN AWAY.I really struggled to find any flaws and seriously doubted the reviews I had heard from friends. This was a film that made me experience something I haven't felt as a kid. That power to completely draw me into a film and leave you forgetting the reality of which you're actually in.I personally believe this is down to a number of different things:1. A truly original and gripping story.Who would think that a simple story about a freelance video-journalist would make a great film; Dan Gilroy, thats who. This script is an absolute Gem of the film world that tangles in with so many different representations; the anti-hero and the American dream.2. CastJake Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom is just phenomenal that I forgot that Gyllenhaal was a real person outside of this film. Gyllenhaal provides exceptional acting for character with an unbelievable strange character arc.3. CompositionThere are many shots in this film which upon pausing any frame could make a gorgeous photo. A lot of care and time has obviously gone into getting each of these shots perfect for the screen. Beautiful lighting throughout.4. ScoreA score that never takes from the movie but always, always adds infinite amount of tension. I can be very picky about scores in films, in particular I believe sometimes it shouldn't have one fro example Dallas Buyers Club. This was an amazing exception and a lovely soundtrack to listen to.Overall for these qualities and generally on how much i enjoyed the film, I have rated the film a 10. I hope you find my review helpful and I have only recently started writing these reviews as a student still in education. Nonetheless - GO WATCH THIS FILM NOW!",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Interesting Thriller,"This is definitely an unpredictable, edge of your seat thriller. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role of Louis Bloom, a man trying to survive in L.A. After witnessing a nightcrawler (Bill Paxton) in action, he soon realizes this is the occupation he wants to pursue. He starts out inexperienced, but soon his opportunistic behavior puts him ahead of the game. He gains allies, like his partner(Riz Ahmed) and KWLA news director(Rene Russo) , he also gains enemies like rival nightcrawler( Bill Paxton). I feel that the character of Louis Bloom is robotic, that he doesn't express very much emotion besides the do-or-die behavior he has while working and the anger for his rival nighcrawler, who occasionally beats him to the punch. This movie, again is unpredictable, mainly because of situations Louis gets himself into. His job drives him to do evil things, which gives the audience many great, memorable scenes in the film. The stunts Louis pulls in this movie will leave you on the edge of your seat. This is a superb thriller that is original and well- acted.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Otherwise, watching paint dry is a better use of your time.I do like Jake Gyllenhaal, he's done some fine work -- and am sure his talent will redeem him some time in the future. But this movie is just a one-tone poem of depravity, so it has nowhere else to go.Before watching this film, I saw a piece on TCM about Frances Marion, an early screenwriter who wrote such classics as ""The Champ"" and ""Dinner at Eight."" In the piece, one of the interviewees quotes Frances from the 1970's saying, ""...it's what people 20 to 30 years from now will think of these films."" The only conclusion one could make about this film is what a sick society we are.Movies like these are designed (obviously) to make money, but they also beat the drum about how helpless we all are to do anything about the sea of depravity in which we swim. But that is true only so long as we believe it.

"Nightcrawler- an honest, in depth review","Nightcrawler is a beautiful movie that has a tremendous amount to offer. Starting with the opening shots, we can see that the color grading makes the movie captivating. I was expecting a boring color palette of blues, reds, and blacks. However, they used a wide variety of colors to bring the night of California to life which was very important to the tone of the movie. The characters were very well written, but it was hard to be relatable to them. The characters we can relate to were too static with not enough development to care about them, but either way the acting was outstanding. Gyllenhaal portrayed a side of genuine acting that he carries with him, and in Nightcrawler, its above his other performances. His acting is used as a tool to cary suspense throughout the movie and it was highly effective. Even if the character wasn't relatable, it was made very easy to be stressed, and anxious for him. Shot composition was great, and the director of photography clearly knew what he was doing. Some parts of the movie felt cliche (like most of the driving scenes), and there was a lot that just would not actually happen if this situation was real, but it still felt real. The director made the character's desires extremely focused and I really appreciated that. What makes this movie so amazing are the characters, and the acting performance.

Gyllenhaal is Strong in this Dark Drama.,"Jake Gyllenhaal, as Lou Bloom, creates a memorable character in ""Nightcrawler"", reminiscent of the intensity of Deniro's role in ""Taxi Driver"". He is a young man who is anxious to establish a pathway through life. He struggles to find employment beyond the illegal odd jobs he creates for himself. When he asks the owner of a junkyard for a job, we find out why he can't find employment--he cannot see himself from the viewpoint of others. If he could, he would probably want to hide some of his traits. As the story plays out, we find that Lou has deeper problems, but he manages to create a job that he ""likes"" and he achieves some success.But ""Nightcrawler"" is really about the television news industry. With a nod to ""Network"", it forces the viewer to consider the possible consequences of sensationalism in news. The film's narrative also invokes comparisons with ""Blow-Up"" and ""The Conversation"", as Lou's desire to succeed takes him deeper into the news stories to the point of personal involvement.Renee Russo (wife of director Dan Gilroy) plays Nina, the news director of a local television station. Because of her insecurity about her job, she follows Lou down his frightful path to ""success"".This is a dark film that asks serious questions of viewers, including what role they might play in influencing media news coverage.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Cautionary Tale about Sociopaths as leaders,"Jake Gyllenhaal stars as an amateur nightcrawler (videographer) Lou covering crime scenes in nighttime LA. The film displays the development of Lou as he becomes a professional nightcrawler. While his equipment improves, his character hardly changes remaining even more determined and agreeable to risky behaviour. The business is tough and Lou takes no prisoners in his approach. The film knows how to keep tension high at the right moment and shows the extent how Lou has become a poisonous influence to himself and the network, perhaps never to be kept in check.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

I love Jake gyllenhaal more with every film that I watch with him in it. This is no exception.,"This is a mood film and can be what you want it to be, its a social commentary about the media giving into ratings and how it forces you to pivot if you want to be in the business. Its a character study of something that can only be characterized as a Entrepreneurial psychopath, if patrick Bateman wasn't in advertising.Lou Bloom, a desperate man ends up as sort of a journalist essentially selling video footage of news around the city the more sensational the better. Its a story about the spiral he gets into going deeper in the rabbit hole and you discover the character as he changes or rather brings out himself in this misadventure.I imagine productivity guru's or self help book writers whose only success is motivational speaking being something like this. Its like someones narrating a marketing, motivational bible and its brilliant.The silence in the film is beautiful and powerful its not a haunting feeling but you get time to absorb it in and just at the right time, the character would break into a beautiful monologue and every monologue levels up the character for you. Think of it as reaching a level boss in a video game and every time its a bigger and cooler looking boss.Its also about relationships and how he Lou Bloom deals with different people in different capacities how compartmentalized he is.From the trailer I imagined it to be much darker but it turned out just brilliant, it goes right in my must see list in the American psycho category.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nightcrawler Review,"Nightcrawler is a dramatic, crime thriller directed by Dan Gilroy. The film follows Lou Bloom (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), a man desperate for work, as he enters into the business of filming crime scenes for money.Nightcrawler's director Dan Gilroy does a fantastic job at both creating a unique character, Lou Bloom, and then showing this character off to the audience. It becomes abundantly clear in the first 20 minutes of the film what kind of person Lou Bloom is and how he's going to carry himself throughout the rest of the film. The film strongly emphasizes the manipulative, sociopathic qualities of Lou Bloom. This clear characterization of Lou Bloom is what makes Nightcrawler so entertaining to watch.Transparency is a clear theme to this film. Dan Gilroy wants the audience to see the characters, setting, and mood of his film for what the really are. There is no confusion about the character's motives or personality, the setting, and mood of the film. A lot of the characters themselves reinforce this theme. Lou Bloom is clear about his objective and will not sugarcoat anything.The story captures and holds the attention of the audience from the very start of the film to the ending credits sequence. Two of the most apparent ways that Gilroy has created this interesting story have been through action. There is both a mixture of physical and psychological action. There is a duality of action throughout Nightcrawler. The physical action scenes compliment Lou Bloom's psychological changes. Bloom progressively does more and more risky things to get more money. Through his physical actions it can be seen that he is also changing psychologically.Dan Gilroy also employs suspense to maintain the maintain the audience's interest in the film. The story portrays Lou Bloom as a risk taker. What separates this story's risk taker from other risk takers is how quickly Bloom's risks escalate. His risks exponentially become even riskier to the point where a viewer is wondering ""What will he do next?"" This risk taking nature of the film adds a ton of suspense as Bloom arrives at each crime. ""What will he do this time to make more money?"" are the questions that come across a viewer's mind throughout the whole film. His risks reflect his apparent lack of morality, which allow him to not care about his well-being or the well-being of others.The film has a clear structure which makes for a more enjoyable viewing experience. The film follows a linear approach to telling a story. The three acts which are: exposition, complication, and climax, are very apparent in the film. The first act, exposition, introduces Lou, the main character, and the people he works with. Their characters personalities and motives are clear. The film does great job of putting these characters, along with their traits, in positions that make sense to the audience. The next act, complication, introduces a conflict and grows that conflict. The conflict is clear and so is its importance to the story. The final act, climax, is the highest point of emotional action in the film. At this point, the story's tension, mainly regarding the conflict, are so high that the audience can feel it. The viewers know that something big is going to happen, but they don't know what. This brings suspense back into the film.Overall Nightcrawler does a great job at holding the attention of the viewer and it provides an very interesting and unique story. Jake Gyllenhaal did an amazing job at becoming a character that is almost villainous but like-able at the same time. This movie is a much watch for those who are into films that are suspenseful and dramatic.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hilarious Satire,"As someone who has both worked in the local news media and on many low budget guerrilla film sets, I found this movie markedly funnier than most comedies. For the most part, it gets the universe pretty correctly in that the media is not concerned with the facts so much as it is in painting a narrative. In the movie, it's to promote an agenda that may come off as a little old fashioned by today's commonly seen sensibilities. The news director many times tells him to bring only stories that further their agenda so he adjusts and ignores a lot of real news to focus on what makes the most money.I've always sort-of liked Jake Gyllenhaal but this movie cemented him as the De Niro of our time. He's the best anti-hero since Travis Bickle as an ice-cold fake-smiling sociopath who finally finds his calling when he gets a stolen camera in his hands. Everything about the artificiality and unscrupulous nature of his character along with his gaunt, hungry appearance encapsulate the soullessness of the media. We never find out anything about his backstory so he remains something of an enigmatic specter, but at the same time very human. We have all encountered many personalities like him in the media and entertainment industry as it acts as a flame which draws in the lost soul moths who will do anything to feel important. I particularly loved his negotiating speech at the critical moment of the film where he rants for about 3 minutes straight about what he wants the studio to provide him without relenting or blinking. It's a spellbinding combination of acting and writing that reminds me of why I love cinema.On top of all that, I really love the look and tone to the film. It's set largely in the streets of LA at night reminiscent of such other one-word titles as DRIVE, COLLATERAL, and HEAT, but shot in a very clean, saturated style. There's no obvious attempts at comedy, but the biting satire and ways in which absurdity play a part of the proceedings make the film tremendously entertaining with what could be called subtle dark humor. It's a shame that the film ends when it does as I could have loved to watch another 2 hours of it. It leaves you hungry for a sequel though I'm sure it would never live up to the promise and tarnish this film's status as something of a minor miracle. Even the stuff that usually gets goofy in movies like this (changing and hiding the names of brands and editing software, etc.) never gets in the way of things here. I really wish there were more movies like this. This may be the best film of its (albeit, sad) decade, up there with SICARIO.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
How further you can push your boundaries to satisfy your personal and professional goals?,"Jake Gyllenhaal portrays Louis Bloom, an unemployed guy that is up to everything in order to survive, even if this means to be unethical and despicable. The film immediately picture him committing minor thefts, but then he escalates quickly, becoming crazy and dangerous, when he discovers that he can make tons of money by filming real crime scenes, and building a career out of this. The more you watch him, the more you hate him.But this is not a movie just about a socially awkward sociopath, but also against the media manipulation, how news broadcast can twist facts and create a story from scratch, panicking people. In particular Nina, the KWLA director, has no morale at all and always pushes Louis one step forward, so she can obtain the latest scoop, to have bloodier and more graphic contents airing on the network. She just wants to save her career, and be the best on the field. These two are not only completely unprofessional, but also horrible human beings. The acting from Mr. Gyllenhaal is on point and managed to perfectly portray the descent into madness of the main character.The movie is very tense, and there a few scenes, especially in the middle and final sections, that kept me glued to the screen. The few action-packed sequences are very well directed and perfectly choregraphed. There are very explicit moments, but these are never all over the place, or unjustified. ""Nightcrawler"" is not scared to push boundaries and it takes quite a few risks, but it delivers. The result is an entertaining and intriguing movie that lasts two hours. It is not for everyone and if you are particularly sensitive to violence, this might be a hard one to watch, or even a pass. I highly recommend it and I wish that we can have more productions like this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nightcrawler.,"""Nightcrawler"" is a charming film about a man who forces his way into the life of freelance crime journalism and who will almost stop at nothing to be the best. It's a nicely written film that will keep you interested from the beginning to the end. The acting in this film from Jake Gyllenhaal was great. The calm demeanor of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) was one of the things that made this film interesting. He used this calm demeanor to get what he needed out of people, even if he was arguing with them he remained calm and I think that's one of the things that made this film, also his deceptive and cunning ways and his drive to take him to the top and to be the best at what he does played a big part in it too. The action sequences were just right. It wasn't way too much, it was just enough to give the film that edge and excitement. When I first saw the trailer for this film I was kind of hesitant in seeing it but I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did. I think you would enjoy it too.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Los Angeles Plays Itself,"A bizarre young man, jobless in LA, drifts towards 'nightcrawling', chasing after true crime with a camera that he can sell footage of to news stations; there's lots of frantic driving through neon night in search of suffering, life where it's broken by dumb accident, fires, carwrecks, home invasion; along the way we have those evocative moods around LA, up and down canyons, that I love.But this isn't about the pursuit of truth in that suffering; he progressively intrudes upon reality, moves a body to where it will photograph against a LA horizon, rearranges life to yield a more horrifying truth until of course the sardonic conclusion. So it's not about confronting horrible reality out there; a murder of Latinos is worth nothing the man is told, it happens everyday, no one wants to hear. It's about using life as fiction, something people can talk about in the morning around the water-cooler.The satire is that doing even this ruthlessly enough lets you climb the ladder, buy the fancy car etc. Okay.So the first-time maker acquits himself well, the observation cuts at the modern void with regards to how we're swallowed up by images: ""news"" isn't news unless it spells out disaster. I'm with this so long as it shows a desensitized modern world drifting in the night towards images; but only their outer form. His footage (merely form, bloodied bodies) mirrors the protagonist's mind, a sociopath only concerned with the outer form life can take, about success. Suggesting meanwhile the broader malaise that makes viewers tune in; people are addicted to dwell in suffering, misery, apparent meaninglessness around us.I can never muster much excitement about satire though, not Network, not Firemen's Ball or Fight Club, so I leave that part to be enjoyed by others. I can like this only up to a point, up to when it expects of me to be appalled at being secretly titillated at how much the protagonist can get away with; the same carwreck fascination that is behind Fight Club (thankfully without the twist). Past that point I find it feeds the same void and lack of center, making me wonder if unfurling stylized swathes of LA night isn't much the same thing as moving that dead body to where it will photograph better. Is it?",,Anonymous,Crime
Starts Well But Becomes Predictable,"Nightcrawler follows the career-rise of crime journalist, Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal), a man as slimy as the creatures under the rocks, as he moves from being an observer to a participant in the crimes he records. Aiding and abetting him is Nina Romina (Rene Russo),a TV-news veteran at a local station, who shares the same (lack of) values as Bloom.The movie has a lot going for it. A thriller could not have asked for a better setup; there are the crimes being filmed on the one hand and on the other, there are the actions of the protagonist himself as he hunts those crime stories. And there is additional horror for the audience in that the news they watch on a daily basis is the result of such depravity.The movie has a subject matter that has never been dealt with by mainstream cinema and a great cast with the lead actors sharing a particularly good (and foul) chemistry. In spite of all this the film only comes out as mediocre. It has a strong first-half; the characters are introduced well and it easily captures our attention. However the second-half comes across as stale; some of the scenarios feel repetitive, the ending is predictable and the characters too start to feel flat. The film also does some the mistakes other thrillers (I am looking at you Gone Girl) do; give unrealistic liberties to the bad guys and makes all the other characters, particularly cops, way too dumb and/or incompetent.The movie tries to be a thriller-cum-commentary on some of the journalistic practices but ends being a slightly below-average, pop-corn flick.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
You find that you simply can't stop watching,"Lou(Gyllenhaal, charismatic and intense) is driven, has no morals, and he needs to make money. So when he realises that getting footage of violence, when the police respond to crimes, is a good way to do that, he jumps at the chance.This really makes you ask questions, such as, ""when it comes to brutal images in the news, where does the line go?"". It would be easy to point the finger, and say that it's all on ""journalists"" who blindly follow ""if it bleeds, it leads"". But this goes beyond the surface, pointing out that, if viewers at home didn't tune in for this footage, then they would stop favouring it(even if they might not stop showing it all together). Perhaps we as human beings are to some extent drawn to grisly images, and that's something we need to own up to, and figure out how how to not let it go too far. This is a movie willing to be completely, terrifyingly honest about how far some will go to feed it. Some of the characters do take issue with this exploitation. This typically gets shut down by those who do not. Which is something that could very easily be preachy. But it doesn't get to be like that, due to the deft hand of first-time director Dan Gilroy. This is 1 hour and 49 minutes not counting the end credits, or 53 if you do include them.In addition to what I've already mentioned, this also contains strong language. I recommend this to anyone who has the stomach for it. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Exceptional acting, great dialogues","The main character in this movie is no human. That's right, he just looks like a cyborg on a mission to excel in life and that is our Hero. OMG Jake Gyllenhaal is a great find, he can act like crazy. From the way he talks, where he lives, his work style everything has been throughly thought out.The second most important point in this movie is dialogues, it was mind blowing, although sometimes you get the feel he is just talking like google, but that's the way people such as him talk. His rationale in everything his does is factual and you go along with it. If you are extremely career driven, this is how you will be. It will be great for your career but will make look and sound like a asshole The movie does not take much time in settling in, no back story or any of that to waste our time. It starts off with the thinnest of premise and just works way around it. This just shows anything that if you dream of, no matter how small it is, if you put complete hard work and be a crazy minded freak it will get you phenomenal results.Also i liked the fact the focus on movie was clearly confined and you will not have to make your own premonition of things. He wants to excel and he will do whatever it takes to do it. And when i say whatever, i literally mean whatever. You will get really uncomfortable with the character half way into the movie and would just don't want to root for him, but at the same time intrigued to find out how it turns out. That is how thick the character development is in this film.Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed have done their part really well. Again the dialogues were a selling point to their characters. In every frame they are in they contribute the right amount in the screenplay, they could have easily turned out to be extras in the movie who slow the screenplay, but thankfully they are not, they were absolutely perfect.Yes, it was great acting, wonderful dialogues, a simple and effective story line, but still i wouldn't want to watch the movie again, may be because am human and i still believe death is end of life and not just another scene to be shot. I agree people such as him would come to think of it that way, but some sentiments wouldn't have been bad. People such as him would but really successful in life, but will not have anyone to share with and that to me a total waste of your efforts. So, in many levels the movie was good, it lacked the basic human instincts, rather than just framing your speeches based on numbers from internet and data from your computer human beings are still in charge of machines only because we bring the emotion part into the mix. It may not be right at all times, but i still believe it is needed and this movie did not have anything at all.All in all, you will love the movie for what it is, but will not have one stand-out moment or would not recommend watching this movie to be a annual thing to do with your friends.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"""I would never ask you do to anything that I wouldn't do myself"" ...","... is Jake's last line in the film. But the issue is that there is nothing he wouldn't do to get what he wants. It sums up the main character perfectly.Lou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a petty thief and worker of odd jobs. Actually, I never see him working a job because he is well known as a thief and nobody will hire him. Then one night he pulls off the road to see the aftermath of a car accident. He notices the ""nighcrawlers"" - freelance cameramen who sell their footage to the news shows. He sees opportunity here, so he steals a bike and trades it to a pawn shop for a camcorder and police scanner. He sells a little footage to a local TV station and then decides to hire an intern - Rick, a young homeless guy. Together they go out, night after night, in search of the most sensational and violent accident and crime scenes. And Lou is not averse to moving bodies or otherwise rearranging a scene if the police aren't there yet so that his videos are more compelling. Complications ensue.I don't think I've ever seen anyone quite like Lou Bloom portrayed in film before. He's like a cross between Charles Manson and Dale Carnegie. He's a psychopath who always knows how to greet people with a smile and strong handshake and constantly talks about good entrepreneurial practice. Someone else said he'd do anything for a buck. But it's not just about a buck. It's about anything that he might happen to want - money, recognition, sex - and beware if you are in his way of getting those things.Gyllenhaal said that his inspiration was the coyotes that live and scavenge around the city.

"An interesting, and thought provoking movie","""Nightcrawler"" deserves the high praise its getting from critics. I really did like the movie. But couldn't help but feel a bit let-down by the eventual outcome of this dark tail.Flick sees a creepy loner (Jake Gyllenhaal) searching for something he's good at. When sneaky stealing proves to be the wrong thing. He discovers filming crashes, and destructive news events and selling them to news stations is more up his street. Showing us a disturbing underground career that probably exists somewhere in the shadows of real life. With Gyllenhaal playing a kind of self serving creep that is probably more likely to exist.""Nightcrawler"" is an interesting, and thought provoking movie that is probably better with the awesome Gyllenhaal at the helm. Giving it everything he's got. Reminding us why he's the king of these dark, unique movies. This one is a very original one, unfortunately cut off short by an abrupt ending, when it could of gotten epic. I was sitting there thinking ""Aw this is going to be one of those 3 hour long movies isn't it?"" But not in a bad way. I wanted to see where it went.

"Relentless and mesmerizing, with a feverish and ferocious Gyllenhaal","Maybe not totally what i expected. I expected something more abstract, less accessible. Not saying this in a bad way at all, but it definitely surprised me. I think it's one of the most purely entertaining films of the year, mostly because it does such a great job at setting up the main character. For those who've seen it, what did you think of them showing us that Lou is a murderer from the opening scene? I'm still not sure. It sets him up well, but maybe the lengths he goes to to get what he wants throughout the film would've made more impact had we never seen what he was capable of from the start? It would've made the fact that he's a psycho more unique to the situation he finds himself in as the film goes on? Either way, Gyllenhaal is absolutely amazing. He's sort of shown he was capable of this sort of thing in Donnie Darko, although obviously not to this extent. Here, he's mesmerizing, simultaneously terrifying and funny, that sort of feverish can't-look-away work only achieved very rarely in an actor's career. I've been a big fan of Jake for a while now even if I had never thought he was absolutely flat-out brilliant, he had just always been really great and dependable. Here, he gets a role that gives him more to work with and does wonders with it. The film is really great, completely relentless in its pacing with a really manic style, even if it's not afraid to linger in the moments that count. I had never seen Riz Ahmed before this, and he's a natural. He provides the film with so many awkward laughs along with Jake that really do highlight its satirical quality more, and both make such a great pair. If there's one complaint, it's that the film doesn't seem to know where to end. The final scene is great, but the few minutes before that sort of seem to wander aimlessly, only working as ways to show us how loose ends were tied up.I'd seen many comparisons to Drive, but outside of some beautiful LA shots, I think that this is more accessible and it relies a lot more on the script, as well as making its themes more obvious, whereas Drive was a film entirely dependent on its aesthetic and direction.",,Anonymous,Crime

"Well made film, but not for everyone!","This is not an ideal movie for escapism and certainly not a family movie. It plunges you into the deep end of the world of peril and tragedy - without being violent or brutal. The film is so realistically done that some scenes are difficult to watch due to the tragic (realistic) nature of them.This is an interesting insight into how footage for newscasts is obtained - sometimes so easily overlooked. It's also a sad fact that a price tag is determined by the level and scale of a tragedy. Jake Gyllenhaal is fantastic. He has a constant eeriness about him. There's such a strong resemblance here to Joaquin Phoenix' performance in 'Joker'. The film is creepy and disturbing in so many ways, and in many instances it has nothing to do with what is directly displayed on screen.The film has a stunning, nail biting climax.

An intense yet awkwardly layered film,"The best way to describe Nightcrawler would be to call it a decent Grand Theft Auto V expansion pack.Nightcrawler is shot fantastically well, Robert Elswit gives it a flawless digital sheen that particularly brings out the nocturnal Los Angeles urban jungle.

It does have a few genuinely tense and thrilling moments.In spite of that Nightcrawler doesn't really have to dexterity to manage it's themes, tone or narrative in a complementary way. It attempts to deal with issues in a way that's somewhat familiar and worn to a degree the result is palette that doesn't quite work. Upon the culmination of the second act you can't help but feel that Gilroy had written himself into a corner. What is produced is a second attempt at a third act. It's result had not been established in any formal way. What's left is something seemingly ludicrous and somewhat ill fitting. At the core of this issue is a script that's a small bit too self satisfied and an inability to layer it's elements together in a satisfying way.Overall, a decent effort from first time director Dan Gilroy but I can't help but feel that it could have had been something really captivating with more skill and strength of conviction.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Now rather than say anything more and risk ruining this film for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a very well-made movie which seeks to draw a moral line in the sand when it comes to how far a news camera crew is willing to go to get a shot on tape. Needless to say, Louis shows no hesitation in crossing it. At any rate, although there are some scenes which seem to be a bit slow the ending more than makes up for it and because of that I rate this movie as above average.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

A for cinematography  A for acting.  D for everything else,"That pretty much sums it up. It looked good and Jake was really good in it. But the order of operations was all messed up. I really don't know how people were terrified or creep-ed out by this movie? As others have said, it has a good concept, but the ending should have been the beginning of the movie, because that is the only moment it gets interesting. It was so boring for at least an hour I had a hard time staying awake. The same scene just seemed to keep repeating itself without going anywhere. This might have been a good short film, maybe 15 minutes long. I'm not joking.People seem to be saying that this was some sort of huge statement on the media, and I can hardly understand that either. Is it a surprise that the news outlets will put in gory material? There was no explanation as to why Renne Russo's character was so adamant about putting explicit footage on television while her boss had reservations about it, other than they needed more ratings. Sooooo.....? They need more ratings? That's the big scandal? And somehow the guy who is apparently a sociopath is willing to get the grisly footage for her? I don't really understand what that proves? That sociopaths can have a lucrative career in covering news stories?",4.0,Anonymous,Crime
Hard to rate,"I've struggled to rate this one as I try to separate my own experiences from what was portrayed in the movie.By way of background, I have over 16 years with the emergency services and have seen my share of Stringers. Most are really good to deal with and know what their limitations are, respect our job and don't cause issues or get in the way.This relationship ends up being a win-win as we often allowed them better access to scenes and at times allowed them to record extra stuff for our benefit knowing that they wouldn't use the footage (more so because the networks wouldn't or couldn't anyway due to the graphic nature of the footage).However, on the other hand you have the occasional Stringer who would do anything to be the shot, would disregard instructions and get in the way constantly, which in turn distracted people from doing their job. The good thing though was this was rare.When I watched this movie, I was taken back to a few of my own experiences in dealing with Stringers and it got my blood boiling as I though of how they conducted themselves.Thus my dilemma in rating this movie.I've tried to put aside my bias towards the minority and rate this purely as a movie- on that, I've got to give it a good rating as I thought it was well done, it was realistic, it was confronting.It also made me wonder how many Stringers would actually go as far as he did to get the perfect shot? Would the shot take precedence over everything else? Hope not, but don't know.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very good film.,"It's scary in a very real sense, it's about boundaries, crossing the line, like when did news become entertainment. How often do we see news reports that are nothing more than opinions because they don't have enough or any facts to report. It has moments of humour, our anti hero is trying to live the American dream based on some online business course. Problem being he treats life & everyone as a business deal, some of which is very funny. But then it raises the question have we forgotten morality and decency in a pursuit of wealth.

What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people but that I don't like them.,"It's hard to define 'Nightcrawler' in one word. Borderline funny or creepy, borderline smart or stupid, just right there in between where it can bring most of both sides and where it's so hard to manage the balance. I loved this one because it is not simple and because it is hard to define. Gyllenhaal's acting brings more layers to a good script. He acts exceptionally in 'Nightcrawler'. It's another level because his face does not show any emotion except for emptiness, but the audience can still feel his loneliness, detachment, and psychopathy. His performance was earlier than Joker (2019) and more subtle and detailed than Joker, just better overall. One of the best performances I've watched.Writing is marvelous, directing even better.

A very different and very satisfying movie,"It's a delight to see a film with a different topic and a different style from so much Hollywood fare. The eponymous nightcrawler drives around Los Angeles at night listening in to police communications, waiting for a car smash up or even a murder, and racing to get to the scene before the cops and other nightcrawlers to obtain graphic images on a camcorder that can be sold to a TV news channel desperate for ratings.Lou Bloom is a newcomer to the role but learns quick and knows no physical or moral limitations. The role is totally inhabited by Jake Gyllenhaal in a brilliant performance in which he has slimmed down his body, slicked back his long hair, and adopted a speaking style that is invariably calm yet robotic and utterly chilling. And it's good to see 60 year old Rene Russo (the director's wife) back with a decent role as an avaricious, yet vulnerable, television editor.Great credit goes to screenwriter turned director Dan Gilroy who has crafted a sharp script and an almost documentary-style debut direction that draws in the viewer remorselessly with never a weak scene in a story that simply races along. The gritty urban landscape and thumping soundtrack add to the atmospherics. This is a biting satire both of ""if it bleeds it leads"" television news and of senseless and insensitive management speak that hits the mark time and time again in a narrative that would be funny if it was not so callous and cruel.",,Anonymous,Crime

The story presented the personality of someone who would go to any stretch in pursuit of his goals or tasks. Although the story conclusion was kind of a miss unlike Fight Club, the whole movie gives off this creepy & horrifying look into the media & how the NEWS sometimes go too far without the hurdle of human emotions or moral code. The motivation & almost robotic actions of the protagonist shows how far a human can go if the societal codes & restrictions are lifted. The story even though continued, still ends up as being great contenders with Fight Club, Driver & more.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

This is exactly what the filmmakers intended, and they achieved their goal without question. What results is one of the interesting

"Terrible acting, good concept","***SPOILERS*** This could have been truly great because the plot is interesting and sufficiently dark, but Jake G. simply can't pull off the character. (despite the many other reviewers who differ in opinion) This character comes off as clueless, bored, detached. His charming mode is OK, his crazy side is just not credible. (unlike Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook or Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest or even Batman) And one cannot even imagine why he wants a love relationship with Rene Russo. It's not business, he has that already. Altogether Jake G doesn't convince me of anything except that he was miscast. And while I normally love Rene Russo's acting, in this case she played tough well, but not vulnerable and desperate. She can--it's in her range, she just didn't carry it in this movie.

Nightcrawler - Why you pursue something is as important as what you pursue - 2.75 stars,"This film plays on the reasoning behind why we slow down to see a car accident. The macabre draws us into the tragedy of someone else's life.Walking into the cinema... The only draw for this film was Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. He is an under-appreciated actor who adds value to most of his films. Nightcrawler looks like a new dimension for his acting and for cinema.Overall rating: 2.75 stars Cinematic value: 4.25 stars Family value: 1.5 star""What if my problem wasn't that I don't understand people but that I don't like them?"" Lou BloomLou Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the product of a generation that has been fed a regular diet of self-help psychology and motivational speeches. In his tragic life these empty words are the basis for how he expresses his life. His relative morals change based on how they effect the achievement of his goals. Nightcrawler is set in the dark recesses of contemporary Los Angeles and it's journalistic news world. Specifically in the competitive industry of freelance video journalism. Where people strive to get the best video footage by being the first on the scene of the latest crash, fire, or crime scene. The old adage, ""If it bleeds, it leads,"" is taken to new depths in Dan Gilroy's (Real Steal) nocturnal adventure. Bloom stumbles upon an opportunity to become a nightcrawler, which is the term for a night-time, freelance cameraman. He begins to see the potential of achieving financial reward, personal recognition and fame from behind the camera. Lou quickly learns the tricks of the trade and how to thrive in this ultra-competitive industry. After varied success, he begins to see the value of reaching into the tragic scenes and manipulating the scenes for the sake of money, influence and recognition. His insatiable need for attention is fuelled by Nina, a veteran news director who has as much to gain by Lou's video footage, who is played skilfully by Rene Russo. Nightcrawler contains action and high speed thrills, but the real story is found in the incremental glimpses into the mind of Lou Bloom. How far will he go to get the best video footage?Jake Gyllenhaal and Dan Gilroy have outdone themselves with Nightcrawler. This film was eerily brilliant. In this world of moral relativism, the story blurs the lines of right and wrong. Gilroy takes the story back and forth across this line of morality so many times that the line is worn away and leaves nothing but an uneasy entertainment experience. It does beg the question of where the characters find their ethics and morals? Lou Bloom is at the centre of this journey into the realm of morality or lack of it. Gyllenhaal gives the performance of a lifetime. Lou seems likable, but a dark narcissism is hidden behind his winsome smile. Like the response most have toward the scenes that he films, Lou's character initially causes revulsion, but pulls you back to the bloody scene that is left in his wake. The comparison of his the scenes he films and his actual life includes the different individuals that are introduced throughout the film. These people come into Lou's orbit and have to determine if they will circumnavigate around his world or be destroyed by his gravitational pull. Their lives are a metaphor of his manipulated video footage and Rick Garcia, Rene Russo and Bill Paxton add depth to this sorted tale. Like the many flawed characters, Gilroy manages to utilise the night of the city to be an extension of Bloom and the murky side of his life which is a psychological thrill ride.For all the brilliance of this film, there is an insatiable need to take a shower after leaving the theatre. The last thing you would want is the residue of Lou Bloom. He is masterfully crafted by Gyllenhaal, but in the end Lou does not have any redeeming qualities. The 'motivational speak' comes from his mouth like rapid firing bullets which inevitably find their victims. The brilliance of the writing and the acting manages to find the line of comfort and forces the audience to walk across it with Bloom. Each scene is directed effectively by Gilroy, who pulls back the curtain and reveals our voyeuristic need forU up to the minute news. The ethical lines of the news business and life get blurred throughout the film and the characters seem quite satisfied to stay in the ambiguous side of life. Especially if they benefit from the result of their actions. Nightcrawler is like a spectacular accident scene on the highway, exciting to watch, but in the end you might wish you had looked away.Rating: The film is filled with mature themes, language and images that should consider discernment.Leaving the cinema... This was Gyllenhaal and Gilroy at their best. Nightcrawler was creepy, but brilliant film making that did not make me want to see it again. Lou Bloom is one of the best written characters in film today, but there is a problem. There is nothing in Lou Bloom's life to cheer about and you do not want him to come out on top. The sheer reality of the film is what caused this bi-polar response. How little would it take for us all to be like Lou. That is what makes this film more disturbing than any horror film. Ask yourself, if you want anything bad enough, how long would it be until you were like Lou, too? I need a shower.Reel Dialogue: What are the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What does the Bible say about ethics? (Isaiah 1:17-19, Luke 16:15, Romans 12:1) 2. Who can you trust? (Numbers 23:19, Psalm 89:34, Romans 8:28) 3. Do we have to like people?

"""If You Want To Win The Lottery, You Have To Make The Money To Buy A Ticket""","A thrilling masterwork of precision craftsmanship, an immensely fascinating vignette of the pursuit of American dream & a thought-provoking exposition of the dark side of TV news business, Nightcrawler is a firmly crafted, neatly structured, viciously executed & intensely entertaining thriller that presents its interesting premise in a very polished manner but what single-handedly elevates it to a whole new level is Jake Gyllenhaal's manic performance.Set in the nocturnal underbelly of contemporary Los Angeles, Nightcrawler tells the story of Louis Bloom; a driven young man desperate for work who muscles into the cut-throat profession of L.A. crime journalism by filming murders, mayhem & accidents taking place throughout the city during nighttime and with the help of a local TV news veteran eventually succeeds in blurring the thin line between observer & participant to become the star of his own story.Brilliantly written & fabulously directed by Dan Gilroy, Nightcrawler is a blazing work of originality that marks a sensational directional debut for Gilroy & is presented in a very polished manner. Cinematography crisply captures the silent, almost deserted look of Los Angeles during nighttime & seamlessly encapsulates the whole picture with a quiet sense of foreboding tension. Editing is carried out in a concise, calculated manner while James Newton Howard's score simply fits.Coming to the acting department, this is Jake Gyllenhaal's show all the way as his work here effortlessly overshadows every other input from the rest of its cast n crew. From the gaunt appearance to those unblinking eyes & creepy smirk, Gyllenhaal completely gets under the skin of Louis ""Lou"" Bloom and plays the sociopath with riveting finesse to carve out a jaw-dropping performance that's easily his career-best work. Supporting him are Rene Russo, Bill Paxton & Riz Ahmed who all chip in with vital contributions.On an overall scale, Nightcrawler can be seen as a stinging satire of TV news business, a biting criticism of modern capitalist society & a contrary interpretation of American dream yet above all, it remains a deeply unsettling yet immensely fascinating character study of a fanatical sociopath. Ingeniously shifting its tones by blending subtle moments of humour into its dark ambiance and bolstered by Jake Gyllenhaal's coyote-like presence & bone-chilling performance, Nightcrawler is one of the best films of the year that comes highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Crime

It fails to really keep you that interested, an ambulance chaser with a video camera selling the content to a news channel doesn't have the interest value when there's no real storyline.
Jake Gyllenhaal however is excellent as the sociopath who decides to make a business out of filming grisly crimes and accidents to sell to TV news. Its worth watching just to see his performance but the movie itself is rather unremarkable and overlong.
There are also too many holes in the plot, he would never get away with half of the antics.

Louie Louie is unemployed and looking for work until he stumbles into a roadside accident and notices independent freelance videographers who shoot tape of nocturnal news events and sell them to the local television stations; otherwise known as nightcrawling. Bloom then blooms into a more disturbed individual when he runs with this concept and decides to become a nightcrawler himself. Gilroy shoots ""Nightcrawler"" with a subjective eye prioritizing on Bloom's narcissistic demeanor. Gyllenhaal does some of his finest work in his career as Bloom.

It's a cold world,"I found this movie adressing me in an unexpected way. For me it was not only about the dark and immoral side of human mind, but also about where that side often surfaces, in work. I hope I'm not alone with my interpretation.The story is about Lou Bloom, a smart and charismatic psychopath, who, despite of his obvious talents, is a small time crook. One night he crashes into freelance news cameramen who are covering crimes and accidents and makes a career choice at once.And it seems he does well for himself. He has exactly the right set of skills for the work. No consciousness, moral or sense of empathy and a talent to manipulate people. From there on, we can follow Lou's morally grotesque way to the top of the business.Everything he does is as succesfull as it is morally wrong. The things he does to his assistant, competitor and also to his boss, who by the way doesn't deserve any more sympathy either, are really beyond disgusting. It showcases the freelancer news shooter scene as very cold world where victims are seens as dollars and cents and the misfortune of others is the fortune of nightcrawler. People are really not people at all, just expendable assets.What brings the added extra intensity to Lou's character is phenomenal performance of Jake Gyllenhaal. He actually lost a lot of weight for this role, and his dedication to become Lou Bloom can be seen on the screen. This is definitely one of the strongest performances of his career, and that's a lot said when we are talking about actor like Jake Gyllenhaal. Rene Russo also delivers a solid performance in supporting role.What all the people surely get out of this movie is the painting of the mind of a utterly cold sociopath and the coldness and corruption of the sort of news business presented here. However, I'd like to add third aspect here, namely how people lose themselves in their jobs. Been reading lately Deadly Medicines And Organized Crime book by Peter C. Götschze, that introduces the immorality of pharma industry. There the author mentions once that he knows some of the people in industry, and they would never do the stuff they do at job in their pivate lifes. Somehow it seems that when they enter the work, their morale changes completely. And it is quite often, than people who have what you could called green set of values, end up doing job that is harmfull to the environment and against their values, just to state an example.I mean, in this movie, Lou of course doesn't do his legal job very legally. But the point is, that when he goes from the world of crime to the world of legal business, he doesn't go more ethical, but a long way to unethical direction.So, the bad news is not that there're psychopaths among us, but that they are really succesfull in this world. It's not just few individuals that're corrupted, but more like the entire system, that drives people to be even more corrupted, what obviously is presented in this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
The Nobody who became a Somebody,"There's so much of New Hollywood in this picture, and that's no small compliment. Firstly you've got the white male loner who believes he's destined for greatness - Taxi Driver (1976) - who channels his energy into supplying graphic content for the local news station to buck up its ratings - Network (1976), with Rene Russo doing a pretty decent Faye Dunaway from the same film.Nightcrawler takes as it's inspiration the real life Arthur 'weejee' Felig, a Jewish photojournalist whose premeditated talent for arriving at crime scenes often before even the emergency services arrived gave him his nickname (as in Ouija board). Portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, Louis is an intense portrait of wannabe celebrity in a world already drowning in pretenders. His skills are opportunism and a keen lack of morality: the subjects he films are often dead or dying, all the better for the graphic desire for content by Russo's controller of a TV station currently mired in a collective struggle for viewers in a city where death and violence are valid currency. As Louis' keen eye for a headline story garners him both notoriety and success, so does his increasing need for control of his content and a desperate need to belong which echoes Travis Bickle's lone avenger in Taxi Driver. This even extends to manipulating Russo into a would be sexual arrangement to go alongside his increased embellishment into the station's hierarchy. The film's set pieces - and particularly where Louis and his hapless employee (Riz Ahmed) stake out the perpetrators of a previous home invasion that Louis 'broke' - are masterpieces in tension and execution. The moral of the story is that if you want something enough, and you're willing to do anything to get it, then being a sociopath in modern America isn't exactly a career requirement, but it certainly won't harm you in the absence of hard work, dedication and scruples. Louis is a modern day Peeping Tom, but one whose obsession with the image is monetised into a career seemingly going from strength to strength from the closing frames. Nightcrawler may take a moral stance that Louis is neither willing nor capable of adopting, but the cold hard truth is that grabbing somebody's attention in the multichannel media landscape requires neither morals nor accountability. Just a decent camera, a fast car and full access to the emergency service radio bands.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

Nightcrawler: Film Review,"Nightcrawler captures the viewers' attention and does not let it go easily. Playing the main character of this film is Jake Gyllenhaal, who gives the audience a powerful performance of an individual who will stop at nothing to get what he wants. This film follows an individual who pursues a career in freelance journalism to deliver footage from the actual scene of the accident. Armed with pure motivation and knowledge of business practices, the main character moves up the ladder and learns very quickly the trade of journalism. We see the main character start from humble beginnings, see him face his competitors, and teach others around him ideal business practices. There is just one problem with the main character, he comes off as insanely creepy and socially awkward. Don't get me wrong, the main character is brilliant at times, but maybe not a person you would want to be ""on the wrong side of"".I believe that you can determine whether a film is going to be good or bad within at least five minutes (depending on the film itself). The average film doesn't usually achieve this, and the few films that can achieve this are the films that stand out the most. It is very easy to see the intensity in Jake Gyllenhaal's face in almost every single scene of this film (literally, his face does not let up at any time). The intensity is also channeled into his voice as he portrays a creepy, and at times, violent character. You can see his character is trying to both accomplish his goals and control the people around him. All the main character wants are to let other people see his efforts and follow his careful directions. However, people don't always follow his strict directions and that is when the ""creepy Jake Gyllenhaal"" comes out.Other than the main characters' spectacular performance, the rest of the film was very well done. There is not too many special effects used in this film, except for the car crashes and murder scenes. Which in my opinion is a good thing because that lets the audience focus on the intense emotions in the actors' voices and the story line instead of the effects. Even the other actors and actress kept up with Jake Gyllenhaal's performance. However, in the end it is all Jake Gyllenhaal in this film. Other thrillers, even horror films, should take notes from this film. Some scenes, in particular, where the main character is trying not to be mad at an individual, has to be some of Jake Gyllenhaal's best acting ever. Even if this film doesn't have a happy ending, I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good scare.In summary, if you are a fan of thriller films and/or Jake Gyllenhaal, you have to see this film.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
A lifetime too late.,"Jake Gyllenhaal, perhaps known most for his role as Donnie Darko, the troubled teen with futuristic visions of destiny, may never truly escape that pigeon-hole. As Louis Bloom, he siphons similar traits of Donnie to bring us a character with the same intensity and psychological uneasiness. The main difference is that Donnie becomes a symbol of sympathetic teen angst amidst a growing world of discontentment and detachment. Louis' motive is purely out of survival, a man driven to succeed at any cost by his instinctive desire for rising above the average and middling.It has been reported that Gyllenhaal lost 20 lbs and did extensive daily workouts to perfect the gaunt, eerie gaze he utilizes, drawing our eyes to his as we watch him survey his surroundings and react. This is an opportunist who seemingly has no conscience as to his actions, which is obviously the message of the movie; a message that is, regrettably, nothing new to this most cynical and knowledgeable of ages.Writer/director Dan Gilroy seems to have attempted to stay loyal to the family modus operandi, that is to build quickly and quietly to an effective climax intended to challenge preconceived notions and foster thorough questioning of our understanding. His brother, Tony, did this to great effect in Michael Clayton, a similar story about a man driven to fight for survival, only in this case it was out a sense of moral righteousness. Louis' determination to succeed seems to stem from a desire to cement himself not only as a winner and accomplished businessman but also for fame and recognition from the larger community. This makes it rather apparent why Gilroy set the story in Los Angeles; not only for its endless supply of criminal activity but also its cult of narcissism and self-promotion.Alas, Gilroy never seems to drive to the heart of this matter, or at least drive into an area which we haven't already been exposed. There is a great deal of time devoted to Louis' interaction with the ruthless and desperate TV producer (Rene Russo) who lives by the ratings, which means she wants more graphic violence and less journalistic emphasis. She is, however, a pale imitation of Faye Dunaway's great performance in Network, who was far more ambitious and had more of an impact on the men in her life than Russo does.Additionally weak is the handling of violent crimes and accident scenes. Sequence after sequence point out how newscasters and news outlets want the story which sells above all else, which in this case consists of more violent and upsetting information. Even for a huge metropolis like LA, the amount of serious crimes within this narrative is very unsettling (although Louis uses the falling crime rate as a bargaining chip for his increasingly intense coverage of these scenarios). Yet, Gilroy sweeps all this aside in order to emphasize his righteous message. Instead, we get a gratuitously extended violent sequence that stretches plausibility and simply confirms our beliefs about these characters instead of evolving them.There is a great deal of dark comedy attempted in this story. Indeed, the audience seems to laugh right along with Gyllenhaal's bizarre and creepy intensity which also happens to be border-line parodist acting. Yet, how much does Gilroy intend to be comedic and how much is intended to be dogmatic? Whichever the case, the end result remains the same. How terrible it is that television news praises ratings and showmanship over honest and straightforward reporting? David Simon gave us this same message in a much more effective manner in The Wire (ironically, the weakest of all five seasons). Couldn't Gilroy, with the expansive potential of cinema, have at least delved into slightly darker, more provocative territory? As it stands, Nightcrawler remains a less-than-powerful expose on a subject with much more potentiality in this digital era, an angle Gilroy mysteriously neglects.",,Anonymous,Crime
More Than A Character Study: A Job Study,"Jake Gyllenhaal is the GOAT in this movie, such a shame that Oscars didn't nominate him. Other performances are good but nothing which stands out. Other than that the screenplay and the directing are really great. Last 25 minutes is full of suspense and quite unpredictable. This movie is not only a character study of Gyllenhaal's character but also a study of journalism. While watching the news have you ever asked yourself, ""How did they film this?"" you will love this film. You probably know the answer and don't want to believe it. Yes, the movie is extreme and unrealistic at times but Gyllenhaal's acting makes the character so likable that you become the man next to his seat and question his decisions and sometimes even believe what he is doing is right. A solid movie overall, but the first 20 minutes is a bit slow and also in the first 20 minutes Gyllenhaal's acting might seem irritating but when you get used to it then you realize that he is no longer Gyllenhaal, he is a different person.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
You wanna make a buck? Go buy a camcorder.,"Some movies are good, some are not good. This movie rates in the latter category. Lou Bloom is no Travis Bickle and Nina is no Betsy and Los Angeles is no New York City circa 1976, and this story in no way even remotely approaches Taxi Driver in terms of sheer terror or its sinister portrayal of a dysfunctional society. In short, the story is flat and stale. This is because the theme of seedy people in the seedy underside of society has been done so often that it's now a cliché. One need only to watch Chinatown or Crash to get a glimpse of the underbelly of Los Angeles. Indeed, even Pretty Woman (1990) deals with that subject. The 1949 movie The Third Man is set in a city that's not only seedy, but divided into sectors as well. The relationship between Lou and Nina is stretching the limits of plausibility. Lou is not that maladjusted and Nina is not that desperate. Lou hits on a way to make a living and he's good at what he does. There's nothing wrong with that. He likes being self-employed and being his own boss. It satisfies him emotionally. Good for him.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Americana,""" . . .

A testament of the unholy union of vultures and media,"I enjoyed this movie on so many levels. Jake is a bad man. An evil man who is unbridled by decency or dignity or honor or compassion or humanity. A man who is prepared to do whatever, in order to get ahead. In some ways, Jake is the snake in the garden.Rene Russo is a tv news producer, in some ways Eve, who is offered the forbidden fruit by Jake. News stories (video) with imagery that crosses the line. And she can be great if she is willing to take this apple. And take it she does.It's a great story about people who are great, but absolutely not good. And what happens when these two critical masses are united in unholy matrimony.It can be fascinating watching two people walk right into hell with their eyes wide open.This movie is all that and more.Enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"A relentless, resonant arc; a searing satire","Unique and specific as this film is, it has strong echoes of a number of others. The character's warped ambition and unapologetic viciousness is reminiscent of Travis Bickle; his relentlessness and the efficiency of his violence of Gosling's character in ""Drive""; his slightly robotic, homicidal clarity of Cruise's in ""Collateral"". Other echoes are more literary and will be less familiar to the standard film- goer. He is in many ways very close to the perfume- obsessed psychopath in ""Perfume"", Süskind's unique novel set in eighteenth century France; substitute video production for perfume and you have a similar cold purity of inhuman intent. As it happens, a movie WAS made in 2012 of Maupassant's novel ""Bel Ami"", an expert portrait of an amoral arriviste in nineteenth century Paris. For the rare person who knows the novel or film, a strong argument could be made that this is a stream-lined, modern retelling of that Machiavellian tale of how to advance in the media of one's time. Which, as shown in both works, is already amoral enough. One strong theme here is how readily the low-life outsider using unscrupulous methods readily finds allies in more established, ""reputable"" media. (The film is at its least subtle when we are told that crime really doesn't matter if it affects minorities and the underprivileged; the ""good"" stories are about their problems seeping into the lives of the more privileged). Here the film's resonances include ""Network"" and other works which satirize or dissect how far people are willing to go to get good ratings. (While I doubt Harvey Levin's arc was anything like this one, it would have been fun to watch his reactions to what is largely a portrayal of TMZ's style of journalism.) As for the acting, Gyllenhaal has been compelling since ""Donnie Darko"" and just gets more so, especially with his under- weight look here, drawing the bones out in his face. Russo readily makes you forget she was once one of the world's top models and shows a combination of predatory ambition and resigned awareness of being an older (and over-made-up) woman that adds a surprisingly erotic tone to scenes which on the surface are about anything but sex. (With one notable and fleetingly crude exception.) Riz Ahmed brings multiple unspoken layers to a deceptively simple character. Overall, a strong, pure and uncompromising film and, almost incidentally, a searing satire of today's media.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Fails to make the whole case,"In Nightcrawler (what a silly name) there are two interesting ideas. The first one is the concept of violent, brutal archive footages and a curious urge to see them: In the age of technology, chances are every graphic accident or fight is recorded somewhere on a camera, and because it's not fake, a lot of people are well drawn into this sort of stuff.The second intriguing concept is to analyze humans with strong anti-social personality traits, the so-called sociopaths and their role in modern societies. There are theories supporting that these individuals can shortcut their way into their respective work environments, obtaining rapid progress.Nightcrawler well establishes both of these concepts in the course of its plot, but ultimately it fails (or doesn't want to) delve deeper to make the whole case. It just settles in scratching the surface and when the curtains fall, it leaves us scratching our head.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime
It contains such a unique and well written screenplay,"Nightcrawler written and directed by Dan Gilroy, contains such a unique and well written screenplay. This film is based around Jake Gyllenhaal's character who takes it upon himself to film public tragedies in order to sell it to news channels. This then becomes an intense obsession for him, leading to acts of crime, just to get the perfect shot. This film really allows the audience to think twice while viewing news stories. It represents the emotional manipulation as well as exaggeration enforced behind the scenes, in order to gain a reaction from the public. The performance by Jake Gyllenhaal in this film is beyond Oscar worthy, and is widely considered to be his best acting performance ever...Although he didn't receive a golden globe or an Oscar nomination... Anyways this film contains highly suspenseful and exciting moments which at times can be truly horrifying. This movie is extremely memorable, with such insane and uneasy moments. It's a film which blurs the lines of morality and makes you question aspects of humanity. My one flaw surrounds the cinematography during car chases. I've seen it been done a lot better in films like Drive and The Place Beyond The Pines. I feel like if the camera work and direction was more exciting in those moments, it could've really elevated the intensity of the action scenes. All in all, everything else in this film is flawless.

Jake Gyllenhaal's great acting spoiled by a poorly executed production.,"Upon first glance, this film had a lot of potential; however, I found myself quickly let down by re- occurring, pointless add-ons to the plot. Credit where credit is due, regarding Gyllenhaal's performance. He did a great job playing an intriguing character who develops as the film unfortunately barely scrapes along. The plot as a whole leads you to believe you're watching a gritty L.A. crime thriller, which it essentially is; however, the whole thing was executed poorly and I felt like it wasn't even taking itself seriously at times. It kind of revives itself a few times but then leaves you thinking the writers could have done a better job. On a lighter note, the film was shot really well with some gripping scenes. I would have liked to have seen a more insightful look on the life and past of Gyllenhaal's character. It would have been interesting to have fully understood his motives rather than saying ""oh, he just needs a job"". As for the events in the film, it's difficult to get a grasp on when everything is happening. As you're watching, it seems all these horrendous crimes are being committed night after night. If this wasn't intended by the writers, they should have added more scenes of the demise of Louis Bloom's mind. The news broadcast scenes, i felt, were over-exaggerated and tacky which (considering the whole premise of the film) is a major let-down, in my opinion.Well shot, well acted (for the most part).

How far would you go for success?,"Jake Gyllenhaal (yee-lehn-hail-uh) goes for it full throttle in Nightcrawler, and boy, is he something to marvel at! His bulging, leery, obsessed eyes glare sickeningly from their sockets, framed with his cadaverous visage. The unnerving, inhuman character he inhabits is simply impeccable. It's hard to take your eyes off his face when he's on screen, which is really saying something. You just don't want to miss a split-second of him sporting a maniacal stare, smile or grin. His sidekick (Riz Ahmed) also delivers as far as acting goes, though there could have been more chemistry between the two of them. This may well have been the intention of the director (Dan Gilroy), however, to underscore the discord of their radically disparate personalities.The opening score is mesmerizing; it does a beautiful job transporting the viewer to the place where Nightcrawlers thrive. The story seems unrealistic some times, but frighteningly real at others. The legendary Queen lyrics come to mind, ""Is this the real life; is this just fantasy?"" The direction is solid. There are several original ideas, which come off excellently.Witness how someone with a GPS, a video camera, and no morals can work his way to big bucks in the tabloid news casting world, willing to make any sacrifice along the way.

Kept me on the edge of my seat. 7/10,"Review: I quite enjoyed this twisted movie about a down and out, weird fellow who struggles to find employment and over hears a news reporter selling footage of a car wreck for quite a bit of money. He then steals a bike a buys some filming equipment so he can set out and get his own footage which he can sell to a news network. After a while he employs another cameraman to help him take his exclusive shots, and they turn up to a crime scene before the police arrive, which shows the brutal murder of 3 individuals. The movie had a original storyline which shows how far the paparazzi will go for an exclusive. In this case, Gyllenhaal does have a bit of a twisted mind and he was willing to go really far for his business but when you see the other people in the same career, they all seem the same frame of mind. He sleeps in the day and works at night and his hunger for exclusive footage, really does go to far. Anyway, it's an interesting movie which keeps you on the edge of your seat, but there are some sketchy parts of the storyline that wasn't well explained, like why he didn't get shot. Watchable!Round-Up: Its good to finally see Gyllenhaal play a role that's completely out of his comfort zone. His whole approach to this, very much troubled, character was convincingly brilliant and his expressions and mannerisms really did work. I also liked his friendly companion, played by the English Riz Ahmed, because he seemed to be the only person with any brains. I did think that the film was going to change into a psycho killer type of concept, which made it unpredictable and quite fresh throughout. Its also a very moody film, because it's mostly set in the dark, so you do have to be in the right frame of mind to actually enjoy it. After such a long time away from the big screen, Rene Russo played her role well and at the age of 61, she still looks like she did in the Lethal Weapon movies. Anyway, this is quite a good film with loads of material to keep you glued to the screen.Budget: $8.5million Worldwide Gross: $39millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their drama/thrillers about a lonely, unemployed man who buys a camera to film exclusive footage to sell to a news channel. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not worth watching at its current price tag,"I just finished watching the movie, and the first thing I said was ""I should've seen that Keanu Reeves movie tonight instead."" Honestly, I'm being generous with a five. The movie itself seems... worthless. There is no message, there is no reason to watch it. No extra thinking or discussion, all you get is an unsettled stomach. Here's what's good though: fantastic performance from Jake Gyllenhaal (who nailed his character to the wall, amazing); very good filming; a suspenseful climax. Now, why is the score so low then, you may ask? It is because of the fact that they make us try to relate to the main character who is completely unrelatable, and unlikeable. The humor can be good at times but it also makes light of some very serious events, which some critics praise but I disagree with. Overall it was just a waste of time, I could've seen another movie that's better for the same price or stayed home and played video games till 1 AM, either would've been a better use of my time.Now, the plot itself is boring and you sit around waiting for something interesting to happen, and when something finally does happen you realize the movie is now almost over. There's also a minor sub-plot that is opened involving some detectives (that I won't get into, no spoilers) but I feel like it isn't even resolved in the end and sort of just disappears.

Unique Thriller - One of the Year's Best,"Lou Bloom is a loner in L.A. who is searching for a career opportunity. One day that opportunity arrives in the form of a burning car and a badly injured woman on the side of the highway. Taken in by the scene, Lou feels compelled to observe the incident and pulls over. This is when he notices a freelance TV crew attempting to get a shot of the tangled mess. Lou is intrigued by the notion that you can make a living filming the atrocities across L.A. Shortly after Lou takes up the career of investigative journalism, but starts to blur the line between filming crimes and starting them.Lou is a sociopath, unable to make a genuine human connection. Jake Gyllenhaal does a more than convincing job of playing the character with a dark, twisted view on reality. Lou sits in his house all day reading teach-yourself courses on his computer and ironing his various shirts. He is detached from the world around him and instead absorbs as much information he can find from self-help programs on the internet. Once he takes up the role of investigative journalism Lou will do anything to get a shot, including home invasion and evading ethical morals. Gyllenhaal is fantastic in showing that Lou is out to help only one person, and that is Lou. He does some of the most despicable things to further his career including manipulating a young homeless man, played by Riz Ahmed, as his new employee. Yet at the end of the day Gyllenhaal gives Lou so much charisma and passion that we still find the character likable.The story uses the despicable acts of Lou to take stabs at the decaying genre that is crime-investigative journalism. It shows the dark and twisted mentality that news rooms are only can concerned about two things: how violent the act is, and how well the neighborhood is that it took place in. As aging producer Nina (played perfectly by Rene Russo) tells Lou, the more suburban and bloodier the footage, the better. Lou is consumed by the need to excel in the field. He starts to do anything in his power to get the most gruesome footage and will stop at nothing to make sure it gets tacked onto the six o'clock news.Director Dan Gilroy, who is also the writer here, paints a bleak and gritty take on after-hours L.A. The cinematography is striking, moving from twisted bodies in car wrecks to grisly triple homicides. He presents the film as a character study on the surreal world of Louis Bloom. While the film draws heavily from different inspirations, most notably the parallels between Travis Bickle in Taxi Driver, Gilroy draws on enough creative differences that he creates an original film to stand apart from his predecessors. Nightcrawler offers the viewer a look into the shallow and messed up world of investigative journalism, and is one of the year's best films thanks to Gyllenhaal's twisted performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

(which does not happen often - this usually isn't my genre, but this film is just SUBLIME in storytelling!)The writing and direction is brilliant. There is a clear vision of how to portray LA and the sleek, brooding and dark tone that plays out perfectly the big screen. The acting is phenomenal - Gyllenhaal gives a performance... on point. I didn't know these tones he brought out from him... they fit so well with the character.Nightcrawler takes you on this journey through the grimy streets of LA, through the corrupt minds of media moguls, and everything is told through the eyes of Louis Bloom.
The movie has a clear message on the media and how they abuse stories and reap the benefits regardless of who gets victimized. Nightcrawler throws you right into the gritty streets along with a hustling thief, Lou and watch his transformation from being a sleazy but ambitious individual to becoming a manipulative, self-serving sociopath. Then you start to realize that he was like that all along. His charming charisma masked his true intentions, and this peek into his psyche is the most potent and disturbing aspect of the movie. It's a character study that encompasses an entire lifestyle... multilayered, deep, true.The cinematography and editing was for me on point as well, fast and slow cuts, amazing variety in pace and tone. We stay ALWAYS glued to the mind and realm of Lou, we get sucked into his life at night (only in the beginning and end we see him by daylight, did you notice?). This is SUBLIME storytelling.Nightcrawler a work of art: directing (storytelling), writing, acting... and basic human nature. It really does a hell of a job at sucking you into this dark gloomy world... It's thrilling, it's powerful, and most of all, it feels like it's real. It is INTENSE.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Mildly Disappointing but still well done,"Was not expecting what I got, but Jake Gylenhaal delivered an emotional, psychologically driven performance that thoroughly impressed me. The cast wasn't made up of big faces but it compliment Gylenhaal fairly well. I think I would've liked this movie if I had actually researched before I just dove into it, (ha, ha). I was expecting a story of a troubled lonely man who delves deeper and deeper into the criminal underground and actually starts committing major crimes. I got that to some extent. Just not of the caliber I was expecting. Don't go into this movie expecting a graphic, realistic look at the criminal underground is my advice to you. The best thing this movie has to offer is the acting and while it does have some good storytelling/writing aspects don't expect too much from this film. I think for this type of movie it needed a more gritty approach, but after discussing it with a fellow movie buff I realized that it wasn't totally bad.",6.0,Anonymous,Crime

Intense and unique thriller/charcter study,"This was a good one, dark unique storyline, which sees Jake Gyllenhaal as a shady crime journalist. Armed with a camcorder and police scanner he records violent events late at night in Los Angeles and sells the footage to a local television news station. Going to ever increasing lengths to capture car crashes, fires, murder and mayhem 'Lois' eventually films the aftermath of a violent home invasion, the resulting police investigation threatens to turn deadly.Jake Gyllenhaal was amazing in this; gaunt, brilliant, obsessed, slightly Rainman-ish and crazy. Even the way his character walks is unique. This was also a different story than I'd ever seen before which is so refreshing in this day of endless remakes, CGI fests and superhero movies.I was also impressed with Rene Russo as 'Nina' the news director who mentors Lois, welcoming his grisly crime photo footage as a chance to raise her station's ratings. Their relationships really shows Lois' rise to power. Bill Paxton has a small role as a fellow nightcrawler.Will watch this one again.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Dan Gilroy and Jake Gyllenhaal channelling Scorsese and De Niro,"""That's my job, that's what I do, I'd like to think if you're seeing me you're having the worst day of your life.""Dan Gilroy's feature debut is not only an impressive and dark character study of a persistent and ambitious man, but it also is a social critique of our culture's obsession over bloody and graphic news stories. It would be easy for Gilroy to center his screenplay on the cheap criticism of today's TV news stations motto, ""If it bleeds, it leads,"" but it goes beyond that and makes us wonder why we as an audience eat up those news stories. There is a reason why the media feeds us these graphic stories and it is because we have this morbid fascination for these kind of stories. That is exactly what Jake Gyllenhaal and Rene Russo's characters represent in this amoral and dark film. It's not only a criticism towards criminal journalism, but a sharp critique on our society's fascination with graphic and bloody images. Robert Elswit captures this dark mood through his camera lense to give us a different and stylish view of Los Angeles than what we are used to seeing on film.Nightcrawler reminded me a lot of Scorsese's work in Taxi Driver. Jake Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom seems to be in some distant way related to De Niro's Travis Bickle. Both these characters are dark and psychotic, while at the same time having some sort of charm that attracts us to them. Bloom is a determined and ambitious young man who becomes fascinated with the possibilities in the journalistic world. He likes to drive around at night and is drawn to violence. Unlike Travis Bickle, he has no sympathy for anyone and simply wants to make a career out of his freelancing camera work. The more violence he can capture in his camera, the better opportunities he will have to succeed. There are no moral boundaries when it comes to his work and the transformation he goes through in the film is subtilely played by Gyllenhaal. Jake Gyllenhaal is at his best when he plays these sort of dark characters that move around at night (Prisoners, Zodiac, and Donnie Darko come to mind).Rene Russo also delivers an impressive performance and plays a huge role in Bloom's ascendence as a nightcrawler. The power shift between her character and Bloom is portrayed really well in this film. She seems to be in control of the relationship during their first encounters in the news station, but as Bloom rapidly ascends in the business he takes control of his own destiny. There is an interesting dynamic going on between these two characters and in the end they aren't too different from each other putting their careers before others. How these two actors were ignored by the Academy for their performances is beyond me, but this film wouldn't have worked as well as it did if it weren't for those two powerhouse performances. Bill Paxton and Riz Ahmed also give interesting supporting performance. Ahmed (who was also great in Four Lions) plays Rick, a personal assistant of Bloom who is easily manipulated by him, and Paxton is a night journalist who Bloom perceives as his competition. The cast in this film deliver solid roles, but it's Jake Gyllenhaal who carries the film with his impressive physical transformation. As big of a star as he is, he disappears and becomes this amoral man who will stop at nothing to get to the crime scene first. He gives a magnetic performance and as an audience you never know what to expect next from him. Kudos to Dan Gilroy on his feature debut for delivering such a wonderful thriller and having had the vision to cast Gyllenhaal for a role he was meant to play.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Realistic, twisted, uncomfortable, tense","In Nightcrawler, you're following Lou who does freelance work by recording violent events during nighttime and selling the recordings to local television news. In the process of doing so he pushes the boundaries of legality because of his apparent psychopathic tendencies.
The film is great at building tension and making you feel uncomfortable as a result of the morally depraved actions depicted, which you get to witness first-hand through Lou's assistant.
Nightcrawler makes you feel like youre a passive accomplice in illegal activity and as though actually present, therefore making its single, - compared to contemporary spectacle driven movies - small-size and realistic action sequence feel incredibly real and full of emotional impact.
My only noteworthy gripe with it is that, in what seems to be an attempt to compensate for the small amount of action in the eyes of those whose attention cannot simply be kept by the great amount of tension, right around the climax, it resorts to including a romantic interlude and other details that do make sense as an extension of the protagonists psychopathy and the logical progression of the plot, yet feel contrived and unnecessary, making the movie seem like somewhat of a farce in the theatrical sense.

Lame to the point of lame...DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS,"In this self proclaimed psychological thriller, Jake Gyllenhaal plays the loathsome unemployed Lou Bloom, who with out a lack of better words reminds me of the charismatic yet wicked Ted Bundy, looking for a quick trip to the fast lane and will do anything to get there. With the help of his newly hired assistant Rick, played by Riz Ahmed, they speed through the city of L.A. looking for bloodstained crime scenes that they can monopolize on for a paycheck. Unfortunately they find more than just a few obstacles along the way. One being seasoned nightcrawler Joe Loder, played by Bill Paxton, who also will do whatever it takes to be the next big opening story in local news. Bloom soaks up journalistic advice from Nina Romina, played by Rene Russo, to get ahead of the game, doing so by any means necessary and the goal is the more gore, the bigger the score. This movie had great potential, but did not follow through to the end...or even from the beginning for that matter.While the action and sadistic nature of this movie were top notch, it was overshadowed by an anti climatic supporting cast and script. Gyllenhaal was superb to the point of award worthy, but there was nothing else in this story to write home about. He made me appreciate the non remorseful fast talker with the incessant need to succeed that he was drafted to portray. Russo attempted to do her part, and while she has some commendable scenes, she just did not fit the entire bill for me. Paxton couldn't even bring me the joy that necessary for me to thoroughly enjoy this film and he is among my list of favorite actors. If you are a Gyllenhaal fan, then this movie may just be for you. The role of Bloom was interesting and engaging, but with a slow start and a less than desirable crowning point, this movie did not keep me on the edge of my seat.I give this movie 2.5 stars.

With Jake Gyllenhaal you never go wrong.,"Honestly, I can't remember a movie with Jake Gyllenhaal which I disliked. Every movie which features him seems to be entertaining and often memorable. From the days of Donnie Darko, to Enemy (the last one I saw) and now Nightcrawler.In this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal is a loner who just doesn't seem to be able to get a job despite all his efforts. One night, as he is probably driving home, he sees a camera crew filming a fatal car crash and quickly selling the footage to some news channel. Mesmerized by what he just witnessed, he goes to a pawn shop the next day where he buys a video camera and a police scanner to track incidents. From then on, he will be driving the streets of LA on a hunt for the most unique footage.What starts as a way to make money, quickly spirals into a crazy obsession for the protagonist. And that's exactly what the movie is about: the transformation of a man who goes from being a lost cause to a completely different beast the moment he finds something that gives his life some direction. Sadly, as it often happens in the real world, the new him will have no hesitation in crushing everything that comes his way to make it to the top. As a spectator, you rub your hands while trying to imagine how far he will go.But apart from the adventures of our protagonist, what I liked about the movie is how the director depicts the unknown world of media in a way that feels surrealistic but true. You can't help but wonder if the movie is in fact closer to reality than you'd like to think and the world of communications is as obscure as you are shown. This enigma still got me thinking about the movie two days after I actually watched it.That in itself is a clear sign I got what I paid for. I do not often say this, but I will definitely re- watch the movie at some point. Personally, I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

news scavengers,"It's really amazing that 'Nightcrawler' is the first directing achievement of Dan Gilroy - whose record only includes a few scripts (one of the Bourne series movies among them). It's a real catchy, witty, brutal and realistic story about the thirst for sensations in the news and the monster it creates. It's also a very well written story (Gilroy authored it as well) with crisp and interesting characters which we keep discovering as long as they are alive on screen. The visuals also have quality - on one hand I have visited Los Angeles recently, so I could not only recognize the places but also feel the atmosphere, on the other hand much of the action happens at night and is news related, so the nervous camera moves with focus on blood and violence makes a lot of sense.The main character, Louis Bloom is unemployed. I suspect that the proximity with another more famous character L. Bloom is not coincidental, as like Joyce's Ulysses he is wondering at nights in a big city, looking however to more earthly matters of life. He is a smart unemployed who spends his time navigating the Internet in search of educational and motivational stuff that can push him out of the current status of small criminal, steeling metals and selling them by the pound. The only problem is that nobody wants to hire him, despite his verbal skills of self-promotion, and the reason is bluntly put to him by a potential employer: 'I am not hiring thieves'. There is however one industry that does not seem to have such scruples: it's the crime news industry. Local TV networks are ready to pay good in order to serve their customers (us!) the bloodiest news and the most graphical images at breakfast time. Bloom will soon learn the technicalities of the profession, and find inside himself enough resources not only to survive but also to become successful in it.The action takes place in Los Angeles, and we can even see the Hollywood sign at some point, but it's far from the typical Hollywood production. It actually has more of an indie atmosphere, and reminded me at some moments 'Drive' which was released three years ago. Same intensity, same fringe world. The difference is in the approach. There are no good guys in 'Nightcrawler', maybe the exception of Lou's assistant Rick (played by Riz Ahmed) who does not have much chance of survival in the world described by the film. The film takes also a sharp critical stand about the business, work and human (or should I say inhuman?) relation in the corporate world of America. The words we can hear day to day in the corporate environment sound so natural in the mouths of the criminals. Something must be wrong with the words or the way they are used.On a higher level however the film is not only about the industry and one specific character that makes his way in it. It is also about the audiences who create the demand for sensationalistic news soaked in blood. About us.Much of the quality of the film relies on Jake Gyllenhaal's performance as Bloom. Gyllenhaal has in this movie the sparkle, darkness and craziness of the big roles. He may not get the Academy Award this year, but he is getting close to that level. Rene Russo also provides an excellent support as the hungry producer ready to accept almost anything and to bend almost any moral or legal rules in order to rise the rating of her news show.This was the first movie I have seen in 2015. I can only wish that the year in movies will be as good as this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Preferred the trailer,"Like with many films now days I keep finding myself getting more excited and enthralled by the actual trailer. Saying that, this dramatic horrifying thriller did provide an entertaining level 7 out of 10 for viewing pleasure.It touched me personally and deeply like most films do with seeing how someone shows such enthusiasm while pursuing some form of employment only to keep getting his soul destroyed. The main character in this film was both likable and unlikeable at the same time presenting us with a sociopath personality. What struck me most was how Jack Gyllenhaal was visually presented to look unkempt, wild, greasy and hungry for success.The film reminded me very much of the End of Watch film also starring Jack Gyllenhaal due to it exploring a more raw realistic perspective of urban life and crime. The way in which this film is presented visually seems the cross between found footage and the more traditional method of filming which works much better than relaying on pure shaky amateur cam that often irritates me the viewer. Saying that I didn't like the way the film was visually filtered and would have liked to have watched a more saturated colour scheme. Something about it all seemed very 90's and washed out, something about it visually felt off.I also had a feeling that the director or others in the film crew wanted to make this film slight Gand Theft Auto in how certain scenes really did feel like the game which for me was a good thing without drifting off into why and reviewing GTA alongside this film.Rene Russo looked sexy, beautiful and curvy in this film and I so wanted to see more of the seedy adult like romance exposed. I think the whole sexual tension thing disappeared to quickly. That added taste to the mix would have made this more dramatic and titillating allowing for a more voyeuristic experience. I did enjoy seeing Rene's character being put in a position of looking exploited and vulnerable.Being myself interested in videography and photography, I loved it how it shows that its never about expensive equipment, but having that artistic eye and desire to delve into places often taboo and unacceptable by today's social standards. I loved how it presented an artist so willing to break certain rules of decency alongside taste. The way in which Louis crosses the line to get footage thats daring gets its audience to ask what it is we have to do in order to succeed in life in all aspects of the media and journalism.After all of that the film for me was something I would only watch every so many years if it just happened to be on view on some boring non eventual day which for me would most probably be a Sunday evening or night. If it had been made in the 1970's for me it would possibly have had more appeal. Even the name Nightcrawler seems very 70's.Overall a 7/10 based on entertainment valueCinematography 6.5 out of 10 Acting 8.5/9 out of 10 Story 7 out of 10, could have been deeper and more revealing",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Study of a sociopath,Jake Gyllenhaal is the man. He is growing in stature with each offering. An Oscar winning portrayal of a psychotic praying mantis deftly and coldly manipulating people and events to his ever growing obsession of making it big in the video news business. The direction of events are inexorably predictable; giving a new way of dealing horror by extrapolation and anticipation. We keep trying to reassure ourselves that surely somebody will - no must - stop him. But the people around him are easily taken in and manipulated by his geekily well informed articulated marketing sales spiel. A satirical and morbidly comic side permeates the movie but evil distills over and overwhelms. Brilliant classic. An easy choice for Halloween viewing.,8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Not as good as people say,"Probably one of the few that didn't like this film and didn't find this as appealing as everyone else. Here's why: Firstly Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Lou Bloom, portrayed as a freelance TV news cameraman with a nose for graphic tragedy, actually began as a weird petty thief. The problem here is there was no character background. The audience became manipulated. They were fooled into thinking this would be better than it actually was. It's mostly about fake news, a persuasive manipulative person getting into adrenaline junkie situations to make some quick cash then realises he could command more money and more respect. We are quickly thrown into a tense thriller.Lou goes around filming incidents he learned about on a police scanner. (It is not that simple believe me) and points a Black Friday value camera then sells this to a news company. Strange really if the character has been doing this for three months earning in excess of $1000 a night or whatever we never see him spending it or anything. There's just too much unbelievability with this movie.What was quite obvious to me and not to others was Jake himself slipping up so many times with his accent. At first he played a deluded, mental person let's be honest yet within a few minutes he's a fast thinking dreamer with an education. Not long after he's a rather posh accent, with manners almost English. Then not long after he's an American roaming around talking line he's a top businessman very prim and proper. Not much consistency. Yes he's a brilliant actor and really carried this film but I do not think through much of this movie that his performance was terrific or anything",4.0,Anonymous,Crime

Best LA Film Noir To Date?,"When few people we're talking about Nightcrawler, a film that was somewhat initially buried by its release date, I was lamenting that this masterpiece (one of the few American films that have banged my bells in the past decade) barely took home any hardware, while overpriced, badly acted and directed mediocrities were being regularly feted. Well, since the advent of 'fake news' as political jargon that's all changed as the streamers and the dvd crowd has caught up with a film not as shocking to me in its content, but in its level of excellence in almost every category of film making.
Needless to say, Gyllenhaal's noted performance represents the ne plus ultra portrait of the conflicted antagonist as protagonist, no easy feat. The guy is simply one of the best players of his generation, and yet, still remains somehow a bit under the radar, perhaps because he is far more artist than celebrity, unlike others, too numerous to mention.
What does disturb me still however is what I consider to be a general misunderstanding, on the part of the United States of Amnesia's filmgoing public to what the film is really about. First, I do not see Nightcrawler as a psychological study. It is a crime film. But who's buying this stuff? The public.
What Nighcrawler is theme wise is an on point dissection of the horrors of unregulated capitalism and the misguided ethos of of the one-dimensional desperate quest for profit (subsistence in the environment of radically inflated cost of living) as they spill down to the millennial generation through the internet, which becomes almost a character in the narrative, at once Lou's mentor and his alter-ego - like Lear's Fool leading him onto increasingly further depths of depravity in the wasteland of the world of the L.A. night. After all, this is what it takes to establish a successful business, from scratch no less, is it not?
In what is in many opinions the state of the art in scripts, this message is entirely driven home by the subtext in a tale that becomes considerably more than the taut specimen of L.A. Film Noir it presents itself as. Both understated and over-the-top, Nightcrawler deals with some of our most firmly entrenched and divisive social problems at a time when the fabric of our society is severely threatened and does not flinch in its facility for speaking truth to power.

A white knuckle thriller with a great turn by Gyllenhaal,"Not as though we needed any more evidence, but if there was any doubt about the talents of Jake Gyllenhaal then let Nightcrawler be the final word in the statement that he is one of the most impressive actors working today, as his creation of Louis Bloom is a creation for the ages in screenwriter Dan Gilroy's impressive feature debut that has some harsh points to make about today's modern day media techniques and makes them with a modern day Travis Bickle like central figure.While the city of Los Angeles is impressively captured here, a night time lit city of crime and desperate figures, while James Newton Howard's subtle yet effective score plays out as proceedings grow ever darker and while Gilroy's smart direction and unique script takes shape there is nothing that compares to Bloom. A haunted eyed loner who wants nothing more than success, no matter the cost, is a vile yet undeniably watchable figure that prowls on anything or anyone as long as he can achieve his questionable goals. From the moment we first meet Bloom in a restricted zone at a city train track through to the tense and white knuckle finale, Bloom is the cold blooded beating heart of the film and his rise from wannabe crime videographer through to aspiring businessman is one that will keep you well and truly glued to your seat even if proceedings sometimes take a turn for the unbelievable a little to often. Gyllenhaal deserves plaudits for sinking completely into Bloom, from his gaunt physical appearance, his empty yet razor sharp eyes and his general characteristic tics, this really is a full bodied performance that makes Gilroy's film more than the sum of its parts.While everything is professionally done in a production sense, Nightcrawler's greatest weakness is strangely found within it's narrative arc. Bloom's rise up the ranks of the local TV station is worryingly quick, his dealings with Rene Russo's desperate news station head Nina doesn't always ring true, Bloom failing to be penalised for obvious crime scene breaches make you scratch your head and Bloom's rivalry with Bill Paxton's industry veteran Joe takes a far fetched and in the end underplayed turn that feels like it belongs to another movie. It's a shame that so many elements of Bloom's story feel to far flung from reality, as when Nightcrawler strikes a believable cord it's a striking indictment of the modern day media circus and an often hugely original big screen picture.While not all elements ring true in this impressive feature, Nightcrawler is a great debut by Dan Gilroy. There's yet another award calibre showcase performance by the increasingly great Gyllenhaal and the journey into the mind of a man so concerned with his goal no matter the obstacles that may hamper his cause is an entertaining one. Nightcrawler is a thriller of the highest order and a depraved tale set in the city of Angels that deserves to be seen.4 abnormal job interviews out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Disappointing despite good performances,"While Jake G. and Renee Russo give good performances, the story is really lacking in development. It feels like a movie that was originally 10 hours long that got edited down to 2.There was very little character development. Like, we're supposed to just know all the characters where they are and accept them as is. This creates no deep connection between viewer and character- very superficial. As such, you never get quite a feel for the characters.It wasn't a bad film. In fact, it keeps your attention and was riveting at times. It was good, but very forgettable from a great movie standpoint- it's one you want to forget, even though it isn't bad.Also, they could have emphasized the behind the scenes of the news room even more to make it more compelling and intelligent. They delve into that, and it's interesting when they do, but like the character development, it's very superficial and shallow compared to where they could have taken it. It felt like the cliff notes of a movie that could have been much better.The final setup scene was anticlimactic. The reason I say this is because it looked like this guy was on an epic filming endeavor, and for that one story to be the climactic one felt a little lackluster. Once again, it just felt like it could have been better for the climax story. It was also a little bit unbelievable.Despite this I would say it was still interesting and one of the better movies I've seen this year, which isn't saying much. It was just okay. I guess that's what's expected from Hollywood today.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Nightcrawler, beware the beast in black - 95","Dan Gilroy has written a masterpiece of a script all by himself and makes his debut as a director - a very impressive work to say the least. The fierce satire that ""Nightcrawler"" targets modern media coverage and the lack of morality in news ethics is far from misguided, but is sometimes maybe hammered in a little too well. Despite this, ""Nightcrawler"" is a film that neatly and effectively shows the morbid thirst of all the people involved. And is an extremely vibrant thriller that manages to offer an equal dose of night-black social satire.With an very fascinating character, Lou that is in the moral darkness in which he ends up and see how far he actually goes is an equally refined and entertaining experience. With his studied and psychopathic behaviour, almost manic appearance, an extremely unpleasant person is created, as the slender Gyllenhaal portrays with brilliance.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
Nightcrawler - A Gripping Descent into the Dark Side of Journalism,"Nightcrawler, directed by Dan Gilroy, is a chilling and unflinching exploration of the moral abyss that can accompany the pursuit of sensationalism in journalism. Jake Gyllenhaal delivers a tour de force performance as Louis Bloom, a desperate and morally ambiguous character who will stop at nothing to capture the most gruesome footage for a hungry news market.The film opens with Bloom, a petty thief turned freelance videographer, stumbling upon the world of ""nightcrawling"" - capturing violent crimes and accidents in the dead of the night to sell to news stations. Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Bloom is nothing short of mesmerizing; his gaunt appearance and intense gaze capture the character's predatory nature and unrelenting ambition. It's a transformative performance that leaves a lasting impression.The cinematography, led by Robert Elswit, is both atmospheric and unsettling. The dark, neon-soaked streets of Los Angeles serve as the perfect backdrop for the film's ominous tone, reflecting the moral shadows that Bloom navigates in his pursuit of success. The pacing is tight, and the suspense builds steadily, creating an almost palpable tension that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats.Nightcrawler's narrative unfolds like a psychological thriller, as Bloom becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing increasingly gruesome scenes. Riz Ahmed gives a standout performance as Rick, Bloom's hapless assistant, providing a moral contrast to the protagonist's increasingly twisted actions.What makes Nightcrawler truly exceptional is its exploration of the ethics of journalism and the blurred lines between capturing news and creating it. The film raises uncomfortable questions about the media's role in shaping public perception and the lengths some are willing to go for success in a cutthroat industry.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

His brilliant acting, the screenplay, even the sickly, naturalistic lighting and score, seem tailor-made to vividly illustrate a complete wrong 'un.He is at the centre of a fairly nuanced story of news media corruption. The message appears not to be about the evil media corrupting a man, or a man corrupting the innocent media, but perhaps the media set-up being dangerously receptive to any monstrous practitioners who might turn up.There is a great deal to appreciate here, with good work in all areas, but I have to say, I came away feeling somewhat soiled, and can't say I 'enjoyed' the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
False Premise,"It's incomprehensible to me why someone would give this Movie a 10/10 rating, and still not take a minute's Worth to at least try to view the standpoint of the leading character. A man devoid of compassion, stripped of personal Insight, and in general, human emotion, is supposed to portray the complex composition that is wrong and right? Within the constraints of this being a ""it's wrong, so wrong, but somebody's gotta tell us how wrong it is"" kind of story, and a ""man gone wrong but just trying' to earn an honest dollar"" the momentum of the story strands on the lack of complexity on the main character itself - shallow, Hollow, the only purpose being survival - and for what...? Dog eat dog? Survival of the fittest? With Gyllenhaal so obviously lacking in aspects hard to number, the farthest I would would be venturing is survival of the worst, which is hardly breaking News - which pretty much screams out the most troubling part of this Movie; WHY NOT GIVE THE MAIN CHARACTER A MOTIVE?? By deriving him of his chief motive as a human being, the Movie in itself looses focus, point, and, in the end meaning, for a tale of the blind leading the blind is in itself pretty Close to pointless.

Jake Plays a Creepy Crawler,"It has been a while since I've seen a movie with a cretin the likes of Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal). Louis is a low-life crook and con man that happens across the job of ""nightcrawling."" Nightcrawling seems to be nothing more than listening to a police scanner and running around the streets of a major city filming tragedies. Because Louis has no conscience and no issues with treading upon laws and ethics, he gets film footage of things that other nightcrawlers can't (or won't) get.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role of a d-bag too well. He's a pathological liar and a sociopath. As the movie goes, so does any remnants of his soul. He progresses from small time lying and thievery to practically setting up murders all for his advancement.This movie takes me back to the 90's and the various sociopath-based suspense films I used to watch like Pacific Heights, Single White Female, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle and others. You know, those movies with the despicable character that has everyone fooled and can't be stopped by traditional means. Nightcrawler treads along that same path and it's such a fitting title for Louis Bloom because he was a worm. Actually, I think that'd be an insult to worms.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

Bloom's burning, all-consuming passion to excel to the next level of his 'business' knows no ethical boundaries; he stoops to manipulating footage--as well as the people around him--just to achieve success. Rene Russo (also doing top-notch work) is the disbelieving TV news director who can't question Bloom's morals...because she hasn't many herself. Writer-director Dan Gilroy has fashioned this intense character study with a nimble hand; even when the scenario becomes more of a suspense-driven piece, Gilroy does not allow the violent melodrama which ensues to interfere with his focus on Louis Bloom, an original and unpredictable character, a human question-mark.

A movie about demonic possession.,At least thats what it seems to be. Played left of center. Its about a disturbing guy who wants to 'be someone' and all he has is whatever he can scratch together out of whatever he can get his hands on even if that means stealing anything he can get his hands on. The main characters motivations are dark but never obvious unless you look a bit deeper. Nobody really does except for one cop who basically disappears from the flow of events as if she were no more than a fart. I doubt the main character would have been so seamlessly exonerated for his misdeeds as the film progressed because his misdeeds were of an ever mounting nature. There is no hero in this film-only a sad fade to black ending as the main character cinches himself a better position in the food chain through more realized trickery and false representation.

"To capture the spirit of what we air, think of our news cast as a screaming woman running down the street with her throat cut.","Nightcrawler is by far the most captivating thriller I've watched so far. Even after repeated viewings the flow of the story and the decisions and acts of the characters leaves me all disquieted. This is a very much realistic and dreadful thriller after all. The beautiful cinematography , the excellent screenplay , the outstanding performance by all, the gripping story and the mind blowing climax all very much awed me.I would say, Lou Bloom is one of the most complex and authentic characters in TV history. He's resolute, diligent, quiet smart and calculating. Contrariwise, he has no care for morality, professionalism and other's well being in general. He's simply a self serving sociopath. He manipulates, tricks and deceives, and does whatever to get what he wants. No matter whether the choices he makes inflict hurt upon others or not. The final scene where he instigates a bloodbath just so that he can capitalize on it, is a shocking and a very much satisfactory ending to his journey to the top. We already saw the insane and cruel routes he takes to deal with his competitors, but the last scene sealed the deal on his utter sociopathy and greed.Impressive performance by Jake Gyllenhaal, especially on the scenes when he is lying and manipulating others with a serious poker face and an ever charming smile. His gaunt look and bug eyes also helped him morph into his conniving character more. Not to forget the supporting characters Riz Ahmed and Rene Russo who nail their roles perfectly. The former perfecting his down on his luck, desperate and a bit slow character and the latter impressing with her always witty lines and strong persona. Rene Russo truly did astonish. Her character was the female equivalent of Lou. As cold and sadistic as him.It's theme was also delivered well.

Beyond creepy - Gyllenhaal was built for this,"As films go, this seems like an unassuming story - a journalist following stories in LA to make money photographing crime scenes - but nothing about Nightcrawler is to be expected. Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal on one of his strongest roles to date) is one of the most unsettling characters in film today, a disjointed, borderline criminal looking for both an adrenaline rush and easy money. Bloom is undoubtedly what makes this movie, but there is far more to it than just well-written characters.The dynamic between Gyllenhaal and Rick (the role that brought Riz Ahmed to American audiences) shows how uneasy the atmosphere is, whilst the competition with rival cameraman Joe Loder (played by the late Bill Paxton) shows just how far some people are willing to go for money. The deeper the plot goes, the more Bloom treads the border of sanity and the law, making decisions that others would consider reprehensible. Nightcrawler is worth watching for the tension and the drama - but don't forget to appreciate the darkness of LA's criminal underbelly.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Gyleenaal makes your skin crawl.,"Jake Gylennall channels Norman Bates and TV news gets cuffed around in Nightcrawler an absorbing tale of cold blooded ambition. Shot in an around the neo noir capital of LA Gyllenhaal as Louis Bloom slithers through its dark underbelly with a disturbing detachment that garners him the attention and admiration of local station directors and talking heads who live by the coda ""If it bleeds it leads."" Bloom, a petty criminal out ripping off fencing and manhole covers one evening comes upon an auto accident being covered by free lance videographers and decides to give it a shot. With a second rate video camera and first rate chutzpah he barrels into action, crossing police barriers and getting what others can't. His work now leads the newscast and he parleys that into bedding a ratings desperate news director Nina (Renee Russo)and hot red muscle car to roam LA after dark in search of carnage. When he is first on the scene to a house invasion with three dead he gets the money shots but also withholds evidence in hopes of stage managing an even bigger exclusive.Gyllenhaal is annoyingly excellent as the creepy Bloom, a focused pragmatic, misfit void of empathy and compassion. He may lack social skills and border on psychotic but his self confidence and deductive reasoning remains dispassionately sound. In a strong supporting role Rene Russo's news manager may be more grounded but she is just as jaded and perverse as Bloom as she plays fast and loose with the truth for ratings.Writer director Dan Gilroy does a fine job of maintaining suspense while hammering home the theme of the media run amok. In addition cinematographer Dan Elswit's night shots and fractured hand held imagery inform and provide a suitable backdrop to Bloom's task at hand.

Creepy as hell. Gyllenhaal is top of his form.,"Picture an introvert type of loner who is immersed in his computer and online learning and by coincidence happens to see a video footage reporter taking video of a recent car accident, our loner (Gyllenhaal) sees this as an opportunity to make a lot of money, and decides to do it himself. He gets a cheap camera and a police scanner and gets a few choice shots for a local news service, he soon learns to do it a whole lot better and finds fascination in more intense video footage of horrific accidents and other disasters for more and more money. He gets scary smart and quite the terror as his footage escalates into more and more gruesome footage. You begin to wonder which person is worse, the perpetrators or the guy getting the footage. One thing is really creepy is how Gyllenhaal treats his ""employee"" which is no better than beating your dog. The ending is especially creepy and truly makes one wonder if the real paparazzi or crime scene photographers who do arrive at a crime scene early do as Gyllenhaal's character does and withhold evidence, just to ""bank"" up a potential super shot that catapults them to top of game in this very dangerous profession. Nothing questionable, no nudity, some foul language, Rene' Russo is just as beautiful now as in her early roles and does an exceptional job as the station main reporter.

Slow paced burner,"First of all let me begin by saying that the story plot and the way the movie was developing wasn't quite exciting or spectacular in the sense of an action-intense packed thriller you would expect from Hollywood ingredient stew . The pace of the film was quite contrary, opposite of fast, slow burner, slow paced and in moments quite boring, I was at the brink of turning it off as it was putting me to sleep, but i kept watching it. What attracted me was the persona of this main character Louis Bloom played by Jake Gyllenhaal who pulled it off superbly, the only factor that saved the movie from utter nonsense. The character was portrayed as antisocial, wanna-be reporter with a sinister side, and more importantly a carefully thought out plan. This is not your ordinary delusional patient and character as you can see in many movies, he's not out of his mind ( maybe a little) completely, the course of his actions and the consequences they cause are carefully calculated and analyzed. He know's what is he after, he heard the calling of his dream job and will stop at nothing to achieve the goal. At moments i was a little disturbed by this, given that the character surrounding people weren't as determined as he was to succeed and achieve greatness and not just in material sense, you get a feeling that it's not just about the money, there was a subtle feeling that his goal transcends these limitations and he is not just after the material pleasures. Needless to say, I'm not very pleased by the plot and scenario, but the way Jake transfers you these hidden and invisible elements is sublime. I recommend this movie for the people that have the patience it requires to see it through and do a little analyzing.

Nightcrawler,"Nightcrawler is a realistic and dark film about a sociopath turning a smaller buisness into an eventual larger business, by filming and manipulating gruesome crimes, in order to put them on the news, glorifying and instilling fear into the people. He does whatever it takes to get what we wants, innocent's dying, manipulating a womens career, almost setting up a brutal crime, by withh olding information from the police and allowing his ""employee"", to be killed. This film touches on the subject how news glorifies brutality, and how big corporations and the people part of them, will do whatever it takes to achieve higher, touching on the major theme and subject of the evil side of capitalism. Lou Bloom, searches for power, but also for meaning. He is a sociopath, and doesn't connect with or like people, and find his true place to grasp power and manipulate, through his news company. This film explores the worldview of capitalism, as Lou is a white male manipulating his minority employee, as he also explicitly states that the news wants urban crime leaking into the suburbs as stories, to instill fear. The cinematography, editing, lighting, and framing are dark, gritty are perfectly fitting. The script is brillant. Lou Bloom speaks like a person imitating a real person, and uses his false charming and manipulative words to lure his employee and Nina into his game. He has no formal education, he says he spends time on his computer trying to learn new skills and take in knowledge, in order for him to excel, as he speaks facts and demands with no understanding of any human elements behind them. He doesn't understand buisness ethics and doesn't know to function in society. The score is meant to be taken as it is from Bloom's perspective, as he believes that he truimphat, after manipulating a dead body into view of his camera. And at first, the audience is tricked into rooting for Bloom. Ome of the film's essential themes, is that us, the audience, lets bad people rise to power because they give us things. That the ones will all the power were the ones willing to do anything, and step on anyone to do it. This is implied by Nina a few times in the film, and the film also shows corrupt capitalism and its connection to racism. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is amazing. The film's major theme is that it exposes the spirit of capitalism, and what the human spirit becomes in America. A character like Lou, who is disconnected from society, who probably wasn't correctly diagnosed, and gets all of knowledge through the internet and self help books, arrogant, emphatically bare, demanding and and succeeds through that. As this film takes the more realistic look at the underdog to riches story, and removes the downfall, as in Lou's case, he's only going to get more poweful. He is clever, with a learned and false sense of niceness. And in the beginning, Gilroy makes the audience almost feel sorry for Lou, with traits of likeable not relating to morality. The problem isnt Lou, the problem is the society that rewards him. The advantages of sociopathy in a capitalist society.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Fantastic, with a brilliant, brilliant lead performance","Man, this year is giving us some extremely entertaining films. Nightcrawler follows a Los Angeleno with no conscious (redundant?), Jake Gyllenhaal, as he finds his professional calling as a ""stringer,"" someone who films accidents and violent crimes and then sells the footage to the morning news. Man, is Gyllenhaal a scumbag in this movie! One of the biggest sociopaths in film history, the film is mostly amusing because it's just a blast to watch this slimy bastard work. This is not only his best work, but probably the best lead performance from an actor I've seen so far this year. As he gets better at his job, he gets bolder and bolder and thinks nothing of manipulating crime scenes (if he can get away with it) to get the better shot, and even the better story. Rene Russo plays the news director he directly deals with. Kevin Rahm (of Mad Men fame) plays the only person at the station with any conscience, so of course he is completely ignored. Riz Ahmed is also excellent as Gyllenhaal's assistant and protégé - kind of a goofy idiot, but it's fun to watch Jake bounce off of him. Any flaws are very, very minor, and I'd easily call this one of the great films of 2014, so far my second favorite (surpassing Gone Girl but not The Grand Budapest Hotel).",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Quite possibly one of the best examinations of a sociopath ever put on screen!,"'NIGHTCRAWLER': Five Stars (Out of Five)Indie thriller about a quirky sociopath who aggressively pursues a career in freelance crime journalism; video recording it and selling it to the highest bidding news station (also referred to as nightcrawling). The film features Jake Gyllenhaal in an award worthy performance, as the lead character, and also stars Rene Russo, Riz Ahmed and Bill Paxton. It was written and directed by debut feature film director Dan Gilroy and has received nothing but rave reviews from movie critics. While I found it to be very sickening, and extremely disturbing, I also think it's one of the best films this year.Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom; a thief as the movie opens, who makes a living selling stolen material from Los Angeles construction sites. He's determined to make something more of himself though and is inspired, by two 'nightcrawlers' one night, to go after a career in freelance video journalism. He specializes in violent accidents and murders, which specifically take place in wealthy neighborhoods, because that's what news stations will pay the most money for. He develops two odd relationships; with a naive assistant he hires (Ahmed), that's desperate to make some cash, and a career driven news director (Russo), that's past her prime. Bloom seems to lose any reasoning of what's right or wrong (if he had any to begin with) as he becomes more and more obsessed with making a name for himself.The film is quite possibly one of the best examinations of a sociopath ever put on screen; I would definitely compare it to other classics like 'TAXI DRIVER' and more recent hits like 'GONE GIRL'. The way Gyllenhaal's character (Louis Bloom) is so brilliantly calculated and disturbingly driven, in accomplishing his lofty goals, he's very similar to a character in 'GONE GIRL'; the two movies are also a lot alike in how they present all the darkest parts of society, and humanity, without showing much of the light or hope. Gyllenhaal's character also (eerily) seems to be driven by the same morals, and ambitious drive for success, that FOX News is always trying to promote on their network. This guy lives by the same exact moral code, and lack of ethics, that the popular conservative news channel is consistently trying to prove is necessary in achieving happiness and success in one's life. Their network is probably made up of hundreds of Louis Blooms, and Russo's news director character, as employees. Gyllenhaal is one of my favorite actors and this is arguably his best performance; Gilroy's directing and screenplay are masterful too. It's a movie I'll never forget and while it made me sick to my stomach (for awhile) after viewing it (and I found it hard to adjust to any kind of a happy mentality, for a great deal of time afterwards too), it's still a great film and shouldn't be missed. A movie this ugly and disturbing deserves nothing but compliments; for being able to do those things this well.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/ON8Zn42-940",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Great film!,"Oh after working in TV news for a few years. I had to share this with a few friends. They chuckled at the movie. Overall, it's a pretty good looking at working for nightly newscasts in a local area. Crime leads! You're supposed to (almost) do whatever it takes to get that shot. Now Lou Bloom's character and Rene Russo would have probably been fired in real life. I kept smacking myself at several scenes. But the story itself is very well put together. It could give people a look at actual police work and following scanners/ rushing to the scene to report the story. And I predicted law enforcement would step in after he moved the first body he shot to get a better angle. Overall, it's a good thriller film. You'll love this.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"That's my job, that's what I do, I'd like to think if you're seeing me you're having the worst day of your life.","Quite a debut from director and writer Dan Gilroy, Nightcrawler stars Jake Gyllenhall as Louis Bloom, a low level Los Angles thief desperate for work. Stumbling upon an accident he is introduced to the world of video news filming, opening his eyes to the money that can be made out of real life crime. Muscling his way onto the scene, it's not long before Louis blurs the line between the rights and wrongs of the occupation.We here have our eyes opened to the world of the nightcrawlers (genuine people), and it's a murky one. Gilroy enjoys multi genre blending, splicing bits of horror thriller conventions with satirical barbs pointed at the television based media. Bloom is a frightening character, a sociopath that easily manoeuvres his way around this shifty world, and Gyllenhaal superbly brings him to life. Gaunt (Gyllenhaal lost a lot of weight for the part) with hollow eyes, and spouting management monologues he has learned off of the internet, Bloom only see human misery as a way of making money. Not that TV station editor Nina Romina (Renee Russo) is that much of a better person, and the relationship between the two is troublesome yet dynamic thanks to the excellent script.The look of the picture needed to be atmospherically tight to the thematics at work, and thankfully that is the case. Predominantly set at night, it's all darkness and shadows that in turn are mixed with neon lighted cityscapes and dimmed lamplights. Bloom is at home here, the surroundings match his bents, he has found his calling to a side of the City of Angels which has a fascinating car crash kind of believability to it. The key to it all is that Gilroy and Gyllenhaal rope us viewers in to the point we can't look away, even as Bloom gets worse, morally bankrupt, we are right there with him looking trough his cameras.The relationship between Bloom and his sole employee, Rick (Riz Ahmed) is a little undernourished, but it's a minor complaint. For this is a sharp piece of film making, gloomy of course, but stylish with it, it's also thrilling and deliciously troubling into the bargain. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Way creepier than your average ""scary"" movie","Give it to Jake Gyllenhaal for pulling a copy of the DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5) and looking up the characteristics of a sociopath. He lack of empathy and blinking, the muscle car, the sudden outbursts, he just nails the real sociopaths who wander the streets around you every day. While slow to develop, the movie excels at asking some difficult questions about sanity, social mores and The American Way. Both Gyllenhaal (Lou) and female lead Rene Rousso's (Nina) characters succeed largely by being will to go farther than their competition. Certainly for Bloom he crosses the line into deliberate murder but Nina's morality is trickier. She gives herself completely to Bloom to get ahead at the television station where she runs overnight news. She manipulates the truth and enable's the initially small- time criminal Lou's unlawful behavior while showing no remorse or concern. So is just a career woman trying to get ahead by whatever means necessary and can't be held responsible for Lou's actions? Or is she guilty by association? The movie also raises questions about sanity. Certainly Lou's view of his ""business"" (Video Production News) as an organized professional firm is at first fraudulent and self-deluded. Or is it? Don't we celebrate people who built people who build major businesses based on some self-deception and that of others? Or does Bloom really see himself at the center of a thriving organization that just hasn't coalesced in the physical reality around him yet? The decided lack of morale to the story at the end of the film strongly recalls a 1992 Tim Robbins movie about the film industry called ""The Player"". In this busy as well (all businesses?) the dirtiest player who doesn't get caught wins. ""Nightcrawler"" delivers these starkly discomforting lessons in a slow-burn, too-real-to-life story. In short, if you want real scares, see this movie and realize these type of people are all around.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
"NIghtcrawler very good film, not perfect","Nightcrawler is a dark satire where Jake Gyllenhall play the role of a sociopath who bases his personality off what people should say at a job interview.Lou (Gyllenhall) needs employment and is willing to do anything he can to get it, driving past a crashed vehicle he meets a freelance journalist who sparks the idea in his head to get in to the business of journalism for very gruesome crimes. this starts Lou on a very twisted road of him doing what ever he can to be the best.The film in all was great to watch with very interesting view on news and sociopaths but not serial killers. The lead role of Lou played by Jake Gyllenhall was great, some people complain a his lack of emotional depth but that is a stupid argument when Gyllenhall plays the role of a sociopath (someone who cant truly feel emotion like the rest of the human race).My only issue I would say is the trailer i'm not sure if this was only in my cinema but his motto in the start of the film and trailer ""to win the lottery you need to make the money to buy a ticket"" which is said allot in the trailer (even screamed) only appeared once in the film in fact Lou only screams in the mirror once making me think that it was recorded purely for the trailer (False Advertisement).

"Thrilling Performance by Gyllenhaal in ""Nightcrawler""","Jake Gyllenhaal fits perfectly in ""Nightcrawler"", an intense, twisted and darkly comedic directorial debut by Dan Gilroy. The film starts with the premise of a young man struggling to find work, following the common idea: ""If you want something, go get it."" While that may seem trite and uninteresting, the extra mile is taken here into making a very interesting and sometimes disturbing two hours.The film develops a distinct visual style, casting a lot of its characters into the darkness of the night, accompanied by all the bright lights of the city and the story - the cameras, streetlamps, TV studio lights. Along with James Newton Howard's score, it gives off a very eerie mood that fits the night life of the film.Throughout, we follow Gyllenhaal's character Louis Bloom, and right from the beginning we get a good sense of who he is, and what he will do to achieve his goals. He's brilliant and deranged, making for a very funny yet frightening character. As he delves deeper and deeper into his new work, the stakes get higher and higher, until the closing, which I personally enjoyed very much. Along the way, we are given intense action scenes and incredible performances by Gyllenhaal and the rest of the cast.If you want to something refreshing and engaging, ""Nightcrawler"" comes highly recommended. Gyllenhaal succeeds in playing a man so despicable yet likable, and it is thrilling to watch him progress through the film. RATING: [8.5/10]",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A one trick pony but with a very good trick,"This story centres around a very unusual and compelling character played by Jake Gyllenhaal. He enters the world of live action journalism after witnessing a car crash and the reporters jostling the paramedics to get shots of the victims to sell to the news networks.There is a quick look at society and its grim fascination with instant media, but not as much as I expected (to be fair it has been done to death). I also expected the main character to go off the deep end and start engineering his own stories. This doesn't really happen and I am little pleased as it would have been a bit obvious.In fact this film is solely about the central character and his methodology, which borders on autistic, the other characters and events are only shown as stimuli for his reactions. This makes the story feel a little bland and the other characters a bit shallow but is essential for the central plot of the film.A very interesting film with a great character but left me feeling a bit unsatisfied.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
An Elegant Exercise in Style,"Lou Bloom is a man without boundaries. He has no family, no history, and few emotions. We first happen upon him demonstrating his sheer disregard for confines of any sort by cutting through a fence to steal scrap metal. When he is confronted by a private security guard, he attacks the man and steals his watch. In a common theme throughout the movie, Lou gives no thought to consequences and none are forthcoming.Later, Lou watches a freelance videographer show up at the scene of a car accident seconds after the police, recording graphic footage that will fetch hundreds of dollars from local television news stations. Unencumbered by barriers that would hold back members of the audience, Lou steals a bike to pay for a video camera and begins shooting daring and aesthetic visuals at crime scenes. ""If you're seeing me,"" he says, ""you're having the worst day of your life.""The film's antihero is played immaculately by Jake Gyllenhaal, who prepared for the role by losing 20 pounds and memorizing the entire script like a play. And it is a script worth memorizing, or at least reading. It conveys by itself the mood that will stay with you long after the story has been forgotten. Among the many fascinating details in the script are the scenes in which Lou Bloom pitches in the convincing fashion of a slick George Clooney character, but the scene is not so contrived, the screenwriter not so kind, and Lou's persuasion is not quite compelling enough. These conversations are unnerving and surreal in a way we haven't seen before.This movie has respect for acting and writing, but also for craft. It is well shot in understated noir, and the scenes that take place during the day are like a breath of fresh air, a break in tension, before we fill our lungs and submerge again into the night. The directing is atmospheric and obsessive, raw and minimal. Where it could degrade into mayhem, it is instead an elegant exercise in style.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Excellent story, moderate execution","To be honest, the title pretty well sums it up. This was a movie made by a screenwriter, and in my opinion, it would have been better off in more capable hands. I feel like an excellent choice for this style would have been David Fincher. However, while the film we are presented has its flaws in storytelling ability, the story it is telling is well worth watching. Gyllenhall delivers another in a series of stand-out performances as one of the creepiest and most unnerving characters I have seen in a film. The cinematography was well done, but nothing too noteworthy, and James Newton Howard's score (one of my favourite composers) was rather unnoticeable.

An unexpected masterpiece,"When a movie manages to make you forget that you're watching as famous an actor as Jake Gyllenhaal because you're totally engrossed by the character he's portraying, you know you're viewing something special. Nightcrawler is a character study, a look into the mind of an already established psychopath as he delves deeper and deeper to the point of no return. You follow Lou Bloom, a man who goes from one payout to the next in a variety of illegal ways, until one night he discovers he has an unmatched talent for Nichtcrawling, which is the filming of crime scenes and violent acts for the seedy underworld of the late night news. Bloom becomes so obsessed with capturing the best possible crime on camera and goes to unspeakable lengths to achieve his goal. Gyllenhaal gives the performance of his life as the creepy yet totally gripping lou Bloom, with his wide eyes that never blink and stilted conversations that sound as if he's gone onto the web and looked up 'How to talk to people'. The whole movie essentially follows his journey up the ladder of the Nightcrawling profession, in fact I don't think there's a single scene in the film which he doesn't appear in, as the other cast members really do play supporting roles for the main even that is Bloom. The action sequences are done immaculately, with the last 20 minutes of the movie proving to be the tensest I've seen in a long time. I can't think of a serious issue I have with this movie. The acting from Gyllenhaal is Oscar worthy, the storyline is unpredictable and tense and even the directing, whilst not perfect, really portrays LA night-life superbly.

One of the best Thrillers in Years.,"WOW! What a great film or video that is, since it was shot on 4k video and some film? Anyway, this movie has all the elements that one expects from a good thriller. Lou Bloom, the protagonist and at times the antagonist, is a lone wolf, who quickly becomes Johnny on the spot news cameraman as he takes us on a tour of what it takes to make it in the Los Angeles news market. In a broader sense it really reflects reasons why society tunes into the news and why the news itself is manipulated...because we want to be manipulated.The movie is perfectly executed. It has a low budget and independent feel to it but that's actually one of its strength. Because of this, the story becomes more personal and compelling. It has unique and original set pieces that are carefully structured in a way that you can never fully get ahead of the character but pays off in ways that you don't expect.

"Original, distinctive drama thriller, ambitious in everything it sets out to do","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningLouis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a mysterious, lonely oddball, who is trawling the streets of LA looking for a job. One night, he chances on a highway accident, and is struck by cameraman Joe (Bill Paxton) and his determination to be right at the scene for his local news channel. After obtaining his own equipment, he shoots some footage of his own, and brings it to the attention of station head Nina (Rene Russo), who comes to be impressed with his style. But as he becomes more deeply drawn to his new activity, he crosses more and more blurred lines and becomes desperate for the best.While most films are driven by an intriguing plot and a cohesive narrative of some kind, there are sometimes those that are motivated by a central performance, or as a character study of a certain individual. Intended as a satire of the twenty four hour news culture, and of the ruthless determination to succeed in that world, debut director Dan Gilroy, who at the age of fifty five at least has a lot of writing credits to his name, has given us in Nightcrawler Gyllenhaal's Bloom, a fictional character set against the backdrop of this modern world. Channeling a method style in the vein of Robert De Niro, he creates a character with a mysterious background, who has something smouldering beneath him that begs to be unravelled. He's a socially awkward and unaware man who doesn't come off as a normal person in any way, and at certain points, like when standing in front of a bathroom mirror, suddenly unleashes a roar of insanity.Although awkward, he is charismatic and hooks the viewer and the people around him in with this magnetic web. These people create some fine supporting characters, including Paxton's rival 'nightcrawler', who goes from being disinterested to frustratedly desperate to work with our anti-hero, as well as Brit Riz Ahmed, managing a fine American accent as Bloom's hungry but naïve co-worker, and Russo's station controller, who proves only marginally less hungry for infamy as our lead boy. But above everyone else, this is destined to be one of Gyllenhaal's defining roles, in a film centred around him and driven by his character's mesmerizing personal quest. In the first film he's directed, much like the film itself, Gilroy coats the whole thing in more of an intriguing style and veneer than anything else, but it doesn't make it any less dynamic or original.It would have been nice for more layers of this edgy and mysterious character to have been revealed, especially since the film is so centred on him, but Gilroy has still achieved something quite funky and new. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
A Thrilling Character Study of a Genuine Sociopath,"Nightcrawler, in a nutshell, is about the moral depravity of journalism. Louis Bloom is a true sociopath, lacking any kind of empathy for anyone. In fact the only living thing he seems to show care for is his house plant that has pride of place next to the TV. He's a scavenger and a thief, completely unemployable. That is until he happens upon a car accident on the highway, stops to investigate, and bumps into a news crew filming it. He suddenly gets an epiphany - that's what he wants to do with his life; that's how he can earn himself a lot of money.The film then follows him as he embarks on this project, and each instance sees him push the boundaries of legality and morality that little bit further, until he's trespassing, moving bodies, and even sabotaging rivals. Louis is the extreme embodiment of today's paparazzi. He has no care for his subjects - just getting the best shot of them to earn him the most money. But there's more. He's egotistical, ambitious, manipulative, and curious. There isn't much he won't do in order to further his goals, including playing the people he surrounds himself with with threats and blackmailing. He's an all-round unlikeable guy, and yet he's such an interesting character that you just want to know more about him.That is, undoubtedly due in large part, to Gyllenhaal's exquisite performance. I haven't seen him make a single mis-step in his career (even his English accent in Prince of Persia was better than most), and Nightcrawler is no exception. If anything it only makes him an even bigger force in the acting world. He carries the entire movie and absolutely makes the most of it. It cannot be understated how spot-on his portrayal of a sociopath is. From the trailers I thought he was going to be playing a Jordan Belfort type character, but in reality he plays Louis a lot closer to Christian Bale's Patrick Bateman (American Psycho); a genuine sociopath (by which I mean not the typical Hollywood sociopath/psychopath that plagues slasher flicks). In fact I would probably say Gyllenhaal's Louis Bloom is a much closer representation of a sociopath than Bale's Patrick Bateman purely because Bateman is still a serial killer, whilst Louis never actually kills anyone (the majority of sociopaths aren't murderers).Visually, as I mentioned, Nightcrawler definitely mirrors Michael Mann's Collateral. It's the same city filmed in the same way so that it comes alive and becomes a character itself. Much like Collateral, Nightcrawler explores much of the city, showing the different neighbourhoods and different people that inhabit it. It also takes place almost entirely at night with the streets bathed in the orange glow of the streetlights.Nightcrawler is an entertaining character study of an unlikeable guy, which feels like such a rarity these days. The satire angle is also very welcome, even though it satirises a fairly unoriginal concept. I mean there's quite a lot of unoriginality on display in Nightcrawler. We've watched Collateral and we've gotten to know Patrick Bateman. The problem is the comparisons are so obvious. Despite all that it does put an original spin on it though (how many movies have you seen that follow a sociopathic news cameraman?), and what isn't original it arguably does better anyway, so for that I have to commend it. It's thrilling and tense, with a dash of witty humour here and there, and Gyllenhaal's performance is incredible. I give Nightcrawler a solid 8/10 and would certainly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Unnerving Thriller,"Jake Gyllenhaal nails it. No doubt in my mind. His Louie Bloom is this paradoxically charismatic and repugnant character, giving unnerving, wide-eyed, unblinking glares straight into the lenses of the camera as he looks through his own. Intelligently, the director never shies away from staring straight into the beast the script created. He is cold, calculated, and every moment he is on screen, his facade for the audience begins to chip away. Gyllenhaal does marvelous work, transforming himself into this solitary pack-animal, this night crawler. I'm surprised the Academy took no notice.The script also deserves commendation. Bearing enough intricacies to make it believable as normal conversation, and yet giving the main character enough ticks to make him seem just the least bit...off. The dialogue flows out of Gyllenhaal perfectly and it is one of the reasons he can succeed so well.Unfortunately, the film loses steam after the climatic action sequence. Without spoiling it, I felt it left too much unresolved or unexplained. It lost some weight there. However, those narrative moments were edge-of-my-seat and thrilling. The picture it painted of LA, and criticism of media and its consumers, was great food for thought.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime

Definitely Not a Date movie.,"Unless your date is Aileen Wuornos. Finally, a film that creeps you out with its failing-as-a-human main character. Saying this is a modern day ""Taxi Driver"" is not over reaching, though it lacks the extraordinary photography and musical score of that great film. While there is violence and gore, what is refreshing is none of it feels the least bit gratuitous. Nor is it the ultimate creep factor. Mr. Jake Gyllenhaal's performance is actually what kept me, literally, on the edge of my seat. Was Jake Gyllenhaal in every scene or did it just feel that way? His character is a monster—the kind of mad fiend who succeeds in today's society.There are many implausibilities, things glossed over, and holes in plot and development. However, the premise and underlying tone, as delivered by Jake Gyllenhaal and his supportive cast, never falters or fails to stay glued to its sick and twisted point. Sadly, dark sardonic comedy is such a lost art in cinema that I found myself to be the only one laughing in the theater on a Saturday night.Look for Mr. Gyllenhaal to excel in lesser awards shows for this performance. The academy could nominate—it's the right release date to be taken seriously. But he will not get Oscar. Not for his lack, but the director is just too green filling out all the little things that would have raised up ""Nightcrawler"" from my-goodness to Greatness. No offense to Mr. Gilroy. As a directorial debut, from his own script, I am quite eager to see more. Perhaps he was one DP and one composer, plus a few glitches in the third act short of a home run.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

you have to  make the money to buy the ticket.,"I sure am glad I spent the money to buy my ticket into this movie. This is by far the best and most intriguing movie of the year thus far. Critics are raving about this movie, and now after watching it, so am I. Jake gylenhaal delivers his most intense and thrilling movie of his career to date. He gives the movie an insane and uneasy feel. In summary Jake, tries to find a job, but no one will hire, so he goes the extra mile, to get a job as a camera man. I don't want to spoil the rest, so you will have to find the rest out when you experience this heartpounding thriller. This is a thriller that will keep you on the edge of your seats, from start to finish, but delivers laughs throughout. In conclusion, this movie is brilliant and worth the money to buy the ticket.",10.0,Anonymous,Crime
Such the uncomfortable. So good though.,"-Nightcrawler stars Jake Gyllenhaal as a somewhat sociopathic man who capitalizes on the news industry in his attempt to pursue what I would describe as the American Dream. Judging on similar tales about the American Dream, such as 'The Great Gatsby,' is not always a positive thing.-Nightcrawler was about as good as I expected it to be. It was very well made and compelling. It also told the story and theme very well, with a building sense of negative connotations as his news filming progressed.-This was probably one of Jake Gyllenhaal's best performances. He was fantastic. Everyone else was good, but not great.It was about two hours and very well-paced. It had a pretty neutral overtone, however, which came from the very unlikable main character. He's compelling to watch, but you just have to hate him. I was not a huge fan of its ending either, but I guess it ended how it ended. It was a much better ending than The Maze Runner! -The music was very good.-It's rated-R because of its moderate language, which was a little above Gone Girl and largely under Fury. It also has some violence, but PG-13 violence.-Overall, Nightcrawler delivered in exactly what it was supposed to! It was well acted, well told, and offered an uncomfortable compelling story and tone to the film. If that is your thing, or if the trailer looks good to you, Nightcrawler is worth seeing in theaters! I personally enjoyed it a lot and would give it an 8/10!",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Magnificently Dark and Curiously Humain,"We rarely see movies that suck us into an understanding of the dark side of sociopathy. This piece does so quite nicely. Jake Gyllenhaal gives a brilliant performance, capturing both the attraction and mystery one finds in a sociopath. Manipulative, pathological dishonesty which fits his purpose perfectly. An incapacity for recognizable interpersonal relationships and a complete lack of conscience or empathy... All delivered in a very convincing and attractive package. Finding an existence in what we recognize as a dark, morally questionable environment (news reporting) and pointing towards an even darker potential that what is actually delivered.It is quite easily believable and doesn't splatter us with any moral lessons, that is left up to the audience. The audience is given plenty of ammunition.Beautifully done! I see so many vapid films dressed in over the top effects and carefully plotted (yet typically absurd) sociological lessons that it is quite a pleasure to stumble in on actual perceptive works of art, which is what this movie is.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Not the most thrilling movie, but it was decent","Interesting movie about a guy who tries to capture footage of crime scenes. I thought the plot was decent; it was simple and straightforward and didn't have much surprises. I thought the few actions scenes in the movie were good and made the movie a bit more thrilling. I was a bit intrigued while watching the movie, but it was just not that thrilling until the end of the movie where it got a bit more enjoyable and something happend at the end which I did not expect.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie of the year,"Dan Gilroy makes an explosive directorial debut with, what could very well be, the best sociopath put to screen since Hannibal Lecter. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Louis Bloom—a smart, down on his luck thief who steals manhole covers and chain link fences to sell for scrap. After a night of thieving, he witnesses a film crew shooting the aftermath of a car crash. The following day Lou steals a bike and pawns it for a camcorder and a police scanner. He films a victim of a carjacking and sells it to the local news, thus starting his new career. Most of the films success lies in the writing and Gyllenhaal's excellent portrayal as the aforementioned sociopath. Louis will stop at nothing to get what he wants whether it be to advance his career or try to negotiate sex out of his boss, Rene Russo, the morning news director to whom Louis sells his footage. Nightcrawler is a great slow burn of a film, one that doesn't come along too often.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
Very enjoyable but heavy propaganda element,"This film is extremely well done, well acted and very enjoyable. However, having said that, I have to warn the potential viewer that there is a very heavy element of propaganda in this film. The problem with this film is that it demonizes entrepreneurship in an era when small business management is a dying art. The main protagonist, through a process of self discovery, finds that he is a very skilled business man and by the end of the movie he has established a successful small business and provided several people with jobs. He is also a complete psychopath and a total prick. You get the gist? If you can stomach the propaganda, this is a very enjoyable film. I would like to see the writer and director make a film about someone who climbs the establishment ladder by being a psychopath and a total sellout. That would be a movie I could enjoy without feeling guilty about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
Best movie of the year.,"I just wanna start off by saying that Jake Gyllenhaal absolutely amazes me in this role. You simply cannot look aways from the screen, especially while he is talking. I would not be surprised if he wins the Oscar for best Actor. There are more than a few scenes in this movie that will give you chills. The story was very good as well, very well written movie. The acting from each role was good, but Gyllenhaal stole the show for sure. One thing I have to say about this movie was the cinematography and the lighting. It was AMAZING. For this being Dan Gilroy's first directing job, he killed it.There were a few things about this movie that were not exactly believable, but that is the beauty of it being a movie. Gyllenhaal's evil grin and manipulative nature in this movie blew me away. Also, he rarely blinks while he is on screen which is interesting. His character development and transformation is great and captivating. Go see Nightcrawler, you will not be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
such a adrenaline rush movie,"""Nightcrawler"" is a dark, fascinating look at the world of crime journalism in Los Angeles, starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Lou Bloom, an ambitious but morally twisted man who will do anything to get ahead. Lou starts off as an outcast but quickly becomes obsessed with filming violent crimes to sell to news stations. What makes this film so compelling is how it examines the blurred lines between ambition and ethics. Gyllenhaal's performance is chilling and intense; he brings a creepy yet captivating energy to the role.The film is an adrenaline rush from start to finish. You watch Lou manipulate and exploit people without a second thought, all for the sake of getting the ""perfect shot."" The story gets darker and darker as it progresses, leaving you questioning just how far someone would go for success. It's an eerie commentary on modern media and sensationalism, wrapped in a tight, gripping thriller.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime
How come it has almost 8 ratings !!!!!,"Normally I trust the ratings from IMDb so when I saw a rate that was over an eight I decided to watch Nightcrawler, despite the high ratings I was in for a disappointment. The movie is far from special. It offers a whole lot of nothing as there is no build up. There is nothing about the movie that is scary, suspenseful, or even funny about it, it does contain however a whole lot of bad driving and passive aggressive threats. We continued to watch hoping for a turn around but everything, from the moment it starts to the second it ends, was kind of blah. Not sure there is much to say about it other than BORING! guys don't waste ur valuable weekends for this good for nothing ' nightcrawler",2.0,Anonymous,Crime
One Of My Favorite Films Of 2014 So Far.,Nightcrawler is one of my favorite films of 2014 so far this year. Gyllenhaal is starting to become one of my favorite actors. He has changed his whole career around by playing more serious roles and different roles. This is probably one of the best movies he has acted in. Gyllenhaal's character is kind of like Patrick Bateman from American Psycho he's just creepy and scary. The story of Nightcrawler is very interesting and different. The film looks beautiful especially when scenes are taken place at night. There are some really cool shots in the film that have a point of view in the car. Now this film is not for everyone some people will like this movie and some won't like it. There's going to be people that will root for Gyllenhaal and some just want to see his character dead. The acting is fantastic but I think the most important character from this movie is Gyllenhaal because the movie just focuses on him. I really think Gyllenhaal will get a nomination for an Academy Award and I won't be surprised if he won. The screenplay of this movie is also fantastic and I think it will get a nomination for that. There are some very intense moments in the movie especially in the last 30 minutes. Nightcrawler is one of my favorite movies of 2014 and I hope everyone has a chance to see this movie.,10.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Completely Mesmerizing, Gyllenhaal Get's Lost In This Role","WOW. I had heard basically all great things from the reviews of this film going in so I was pretty confident it was going to be good, but had no idea how good. Jake Gyllenhall once again gives an Oscar worthy performance as a crime journalist who gets caught up in 'his business' and pushes the limits of what is morally right. I haven't seen all the performances so far but I cant see Gyllenhaal not getting nominated. It's not even him in the role, it's Louis Bloom. Not once do you even really think that it's Jake Gyllenhaal, and there aren't many actors who can do that.What's perhaps the most amazing thing about this film is that it's Dan Gilroy's directorial debut. Every shot and scene perfectly flows and the finale is stunning. This film truly kept me on the edge of my seat. The limits that Bloom goes in this film to protect his business and for financial benefit is insane. What's really scary is that he's not phased by the most ridiculous things that happen to him. I actually found myself rooting for this borderline psychopath throughout most of the movie. That's when you know a film is actually making your brain function. This movie is one of the most thought provoking movies I've seen in a long time. It's drawing comparisons to Drive, which is fair. But it's also less artistically driven and meant more as a brain twister. This film also has one of the most intense finales of any movie this year, that's great directing.Bloom basically becomes obsessed with his job and building himself as the top 'video news journalist' and it completely encompasses him. He starts taking things too far, as you may have thought. And really Bloom is basically the antagonist to his own protagonist. It's worth noting how much insight this film gives into this world and how people potentially get video on crime scenes. It's actually quite scary to think that real life people are doing things very similar to what Bloom does. I really cant recommend this film more. It's a great psychological thriller with a great lead performance. Expect this one to get a lot of buzz come February 22nd.+Gyllenhaal? Nope it was just Bloom+Beautifully shot+Mesmerizing story+I'm rooting for antagonist/protagonist+Gripping finale+Thought provoking9.8/10",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Its cruel, Its cold.....Its media !!!","Nightcrawler is not a great movie but the damn performance of brutal coldness and the original screenplay is all the way up.Its a story of media, news reporters, news generators, money blinds, lonely and isolated lives aiming to develop at the cost of revenge with others, with people. Nothing much but a bit of exaggeration of truth. Started with a fine motion just like Drive movie, it moves on creating some situation and base at the same time luring over news channels. Next it just suddenly but cohesively turn to one incident and says a lot in that for which character development was done earlier.This movie is definitely must watch, everyone can see themselves in it. We at some time or other, for our benefit, without any hesitation exploit the situation, we are liars, without even caring for its consequences over self and over others.",8.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Unfortunately, more of a reality show than a satire","In Dan Gilroy's powerful first feature Nightcrawler, Louis Bloom (Jake Gyllenhaal) is a free-lance photographer who prowls the streets of Los Angeles at night looking for disaster footage he can sell to TV news networks looking for sensationalism to attract viewers. If you think the film is a cautionary tale about the danger of disappearing ethical standards in journalism, think again. While it has the look and feel of a satire: exaggerated situations, overdrawn characters, and dark humor, it is, unfortunately, more of a reality show than a satire. Not only an indictment of the ""fear porn"" that dominates our news, it is also a character study of a sociopathic personality who reflects its dubious morality and of those whose viewing supports the ratings that keep it going.Set in Los Angeles, Bloom is a petty thief who makes a living stealing and selling scrap metal. When he comes upon an accident on the freeway, he watches as an injured woman is pulled from the wreckage of a flaming car while a news van arrives on the scene. The van belongs to cameraman Joe Loder (Bill Paxton) who is first on the scene to shoot footage of the accident. As a ""nightcrawler,"" his job is to provide film clips to be shown on the morning TV news show. Looking for a new career path, Lou decides that this is a job that he can also do. As his own self-evaluation proves, he is a fast learner. Learning to talk the language of corporate upspeak, outwardly he exhibits a smooth-talking sincerity, but can scarcely hide the hollowness of what lies underneath.Picking up a police scanner and camcorder, Bloom hires Rick (Riz Ahmed), an unemployed and homeless young man for $30 a night to help him navigate his Dodge Challenger through L.A.'s mean streets. Though Rick needs a job badly and is mostly loyal to his boss, he never really buys into Bloom's modus operandi and becomes the only voice of humanity in the film. Both Lou and Rick find plenty of blood and gore to satisfy Nina Romina (a terrific Rene Russo), however. She is the news director at a struggling Los Angeles TV station who is willing to pay good money, even for the most horrific footage. As Nina tells it, her preference is for violence that takes place in the white suburbs with a black man as the perpetrator.Her ideal footage is ""a screaming woman, running down the street with her throat cut."" She is also not above manipulating the news for the sake of ratings. Captured by cinematographer, Robert Elswit, Nightcrawler takes us to accidents, fires, police shootouts, and a multiple murder. In his uncontrollable desire for profit, Bloom's activity veers more and more into legally and morally questionable territory, tampering with evidence, breaking into crime scenes before the police arrive, and more, even though his actions are uncharacteristically overlooked by the police.Nightcrawler is fast-paced, engaging entertainment that ranks as one of the best films of the year, yet it is mostly Jake Gyllenhaal's performance that keeps us riveted to the screen. Gyllenhaal disappears into his character in such a way that makes him truly scary. Unfortunately, however, in a society that elevates individuals without integrity into folk heroes, we admire people like Lou because he stands outside the system. Bloom teaches us that anyone can become successful regardless of their limitations if they provide a salable product without regard for its true value or for anyone that stands in their way. Without any scruples, like Frank Abagnale, Jr. in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can, he lifts criminality and moral blindness to the level of art.",9.0,Anonymous,Crime
"Slimy, Slimy, Slimy","This film deserves a much higher numeric rating than I gave it, but it is just so slimy, I can't give it higher.The film is about the lowlife nature of TV news. How low they'll go to get a story. My view is really not changed by this for TV news because the way they warp public concern about weather events, create panic, create public unease purposely for ratings already makes me sick.The film shows that they go even lower than my opinion of them now. Jake G is now at his best level of acting skills I've seen. The awfulness of his character is disturbing.

Steady hands!,"Lou Bloom:""Steady hands, steady hands"".The story is about a young man, desperate for work, stumbles upon the seedy underworld of L.A.'s crime journalism. The break-neck pace is all about being the first on the scene - murder, accidents, fires, mayhem - and selling the gratuitous footage to the local news stations. But the better he gets, the more likely he is going to become the next story.I heard so many great things about Nightcrawler. The critics said the same like, ""It's a flawless peace of entertainment"" or ""One of the best movie of the year"".- So I was looking forward to the movie by hearing all the good buzz from it, and after seeing it I can say that this movie is flawless.Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performance he ever did in his career. He lost a lot of weight for this role and I can say it pays off so well. I love how he makes his character so creepy, but so interesting to watch on screen. I swear to god if he doesn't get a Oscar nomination for his performance in this movie, I will be angry and disappointed at the Oscars, because when I watch a movie and don't see the actor, just the character that right they is talent.The director of this movie (Dan Gilroy) and he was only a screenwriter for most of his career and this movie is his first time directing and my god his he brilliant. Dan Gilroy but a lot of effort in this movie and I heard that the director of the movie actually met some people who do these things that people call ""Nightcrawling"", and to me that shows that this guy should make more films in future, because he's the kind of director that movie need.The writing in this movie is some of the best writing I've seen since Boyhood, I mean every sentence in this movie glues me in it's story and character's. The move itself has that dark, uneasy and hash look to it, but that's life. The shots were good, the other cast member's were great as well.But as I said in my Interstellar and The Guest review, the movie isn't going to get the perfect rating of four out of four star's, but the movie is still brilliant.",7.0,Anonymous,Crime

"Hannibal Lecter becomes a reporter, consumes people with a camera","8.9 of 10. What you might imagine could be the beginning of Rupert Murdoch's story, or that of one of his henchmen at FOX News, such as Roger Ailes.There have been several films trying to capture the conflicts of interest and insanities that perpetuate TV news, but this is the first I'm aware of to get far beyond the anchor desk, up and down and around the corporate media career ladder.While Jake Gyllenhaal provides a sound performance, unlike this year's Mr. Turner that Timothy Spall transforms beyond the lines, the script and story is what really makes this film work. Jake almost detracts from it by being/looking nearly as old as Russo who is ""twice his age"".
