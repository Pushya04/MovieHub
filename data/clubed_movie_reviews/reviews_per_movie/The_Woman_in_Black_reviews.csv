Life in Perspective,"People have complained that this is a horror movie filled with horror movie clichés. But how could it not be? I mean is it suppose to be a horror movie at the local shopping mall? No, of course it is in a haunted house, were else would it be? As much as this movie drew on the horror standards, I found it refreshingly different from most horror movies. Part of what I want from a movie is something different, not more of the same, and I think in that respect, all things considered, this movie delivered.While it did make use of the standards like jump scares, I really felt the suspense of this movie. I mean, at least for me, this movie was wound very tight. The suspense was ratcheted to the limit.While I'm still not past Daniel Radcliffe's voice, I still hear Harry or Daniel, his face and body language were spot on, and greatly added to the tension of the movie.In the end, it is what it is, a suspenseful horror movie that gets the job done. This isn't a genre noted for 'Academy Award' performances. But as suspenseful horror movies go, I was very satisfied with this one, and thought they did have a new approach to an old genre.Steve B",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing to dislike,"There's nothing to dislike about this new version of Susan Hill's classic ghost story, THE WOMAN IN BLACK, except that it's been filmed before (in the 1980s) and, inevitably, the earlier one was better. But this release of the story, made by the newly-revamped Hammer films, gets most things right.First off, the production has a wonderful look to it. The locations are wonderfully bleak and isolated and the backdrops scream Gothic. The characters look and feel right, from the reliable Ciaran Hinds to, yes, Daniel Radcliffe as the youthful hero (I'm no fan of Radcliffe in the Potter films, but having seen MY BOY JACK I'm convinced of his talents).The horror aspects of the story are where this new production falls down a little. Not because they're bad, because the scares are efficient enough in themselves...it's just that they're so, well, predictable. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is one of those films that suckers the reader into a quiet moment before startling them with a sudden movement or loud noise (and sometimes both together). And it does it over and over again. And again after that.Still, for me, mood and atmosphere is everything, and at least this gets that right. The scares may be predictable, but in all other respects THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a film that pays affectionate homage to both its source material and the kind of glorious ghost stories of old.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Good Ghost Story Developed at a Slow Pace and Beginning Similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula,"In London, the lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) still grieves the death of his beloved wife Stela (Sophie Stuckey) on the delivery of their son Joseph (Misha Handley) four years ago. His employer gives a last chance to him to keep his job, and he is assigned to travel to the remote village Cryphin Gifford to examine the documentation of the Eel Marsh House that belonged to the decently deceased Mrs. Drablow (Alisa Khazanova). Arthur befriends Daily (Ciarán Hinds) in the train and the man offers a ride to him to the Gifford Arms inn.Arthur has a cold reception and the owner of the inn tells that he did not receive the request of reservation and there is no available room. On the next morning, Arthur meets the solicitor Jerome that advises him to return to London. However Arthur goes to the isolated manor and soon he finds that the Eel Marsh House is haunted by the vengeful ghost of a woman dressed in black. He also learns that the woman lost her son drowned in the mush and she seeks revenge taking the children of the scared locals.""The Woman in Black"" is a dramatic horror film by Hammer with a good ghost story developed at a slow pace. The beginning is very similar to Bram Stoker's Dracula, when the young lawyer Jonathan Harker is sent to a remote village to a real estate business and has a cold reception by the villagers.The vampire is replaced by the evil ghost of a woman in black that takes the children from the dwellers. The conclusion is a little disappointing but the film certainly makes the viewer startle many times along 95 minutes running time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""A Mulher de Preto"" (""The Woman in Black"")",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A DARK, GLOOMY THRILLER","The Woman in Black is a great relief at times where blood and gore depends on whether a film is scary or not. Daniel Radcliffe delivers us a mighty fine performance. The best thing I felt about this film was, the atmosphere which remained dark throughout the 90 minute runtime. The first thirty minutes or so depend a lot on jumpscares that are somewhat effective but bland. In fact, the terrifying moments in this flick, are rare. It focuses on the content, and everything that makes a film perfect. However, the entire subject of children walking to their own deaths is rather unsettling. The film scares a person based on how they define 'scary'. If you are the person expecting a lot of gore and messed up faces and things like that, turn away, this film ain't for you. Watch this one for stellar performances, a great story, and fine scares that are actually the epitome of 'actual horror'
A good watch.(Moreover, this one is set in the early twentieth century. There is something extremely pleaseful about period horror, dont you think?)
So, I rate this film a much deserved-7.2/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If there's one thing horror movies have taught us, it's that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear.","30 years and several retools on from Susan Hill's now seminal pocket novel comes the big screen adaptation of The Woman in Black. Swapping the lingering, life-spanning impact of Hill's Dickensian book of the dead for a hollow yet effective house-of-horrors yarn that'll have you stirring in your seat- and out of it.The film's set-up is more or less identical to the book but with a few baffling tweaks; Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is a solicitor and widowed father of one who's summoned to a remote town and manor on an eerie northern marshland where he's to settle the estate and will of a recently deceased old hag. Somethings wrong with the place, though. An ominous figure stalks and taunts and haunts the townspeople. A child falls whenever it is seen; a woman in black.If there's one thing horror movies have taught us, it's that ghostly old dears and kids are a recipe for new underwear. And what do you know, The Woman in Black has them both in droves. All of which reside in a haunted, Victorian mansion in the middle of nowhere. The film charts Kipps' probe into the strange happenings from inside the damned estate in this simplistic yet effectual horror gem that's as playful and frightening as it is enjoyable.As a stand-alone picture, director James (Eden Lake) Watkins' Woman in Black is as sound a horror of this ilk and purpose come; the haunted-house caper has been done to death then done again over the course of cinema's history. The Woman in Black is the best of its kind for quite some time. When measured against the book, though, it comes up short. Despite remaining faithful to its source through large parts and absolutely nailing the location, Jane Goldman's screenplay omits certain key scenes as well as the haunting bookends that made Hill's novel one the finest ghost stories of all time. Fans of the book will find it hard to fathom why these decisions were made. Maybe Goldman and Watkins wanted to stamp their own, uplifting mark on the tale. Shades of Kubrick's Shining? Not quite. I won't reveal what transpires in Hill's novel, but if the film had followed suite, it would've had greater substance and longevity.Grafting Harry Potter onto its set-up ensured Watkins' film spun a profit before it hit a single screen. In an undemanding role that require Radcliffe tread cautiously and look scared, the boyish Brit does what's expected of him but fails to impress; to say he's believable as a father would be stupid. He isn't. If Radcliffe is looking to break free from his Potter persona, it's going to take a lot more than a 12A, British horror film to do the trick. Albeit a damn good one; the Evil Dead 2 a la Dickens without the gore, gut laughs and satire. Jumpy, jittery and fun. Yes, fun. The Woman in Black is by no means a black comedy but its clichéd set-up and slow-boiling pots of suspense are so well conceived and cooked you'll be scared silly and amused at the same time. Nervous laughter? You bet. Watkins' delays the unveiling of the shadow shrouded woman to the bitter-end but when we finally see the bitch, its no laughing matter.Think The Shining without the depth. Think Paranormal Activity without the realism; a minimaliststic, nail-biting scare-fest primed for the big screen that joins the likes of The Others and The Village as well crafted mainstream horrors fit for young and old.

Much of the movie was involving until it got to the ending,"(2012) The Woman In Black
HORRORBased on a novel written by Susan Hill, which at the beginning has three underage girls committing suicide by jumping out of a window and then some screams are heard. Then after the credits is Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliff) a widowed father with a son to look after whose been summoned to visit an estate to settle some affairs located on some small village who has no choice but to leave him with his nanny. Once their, he ends up staying at the very attic where the three young girls jumped off from and upon visiting a colleague tries to send him back home but he refuses but instead visits the manor to look for some documents where while looking through a window he sees a 'woman in black'. This film has all the ingredients for a great haunted house film from remnants from ""The Changeling"", ""Poltergeist"", ""The Haunting"", ""The Devil's Backbone"", and ""The Orphange"" among others. And my rating might've been higher if it wasn't for the ending which was predictably dumb and seemed to look like it was unnecessarily tagged on, for it wasn't enough to bog down what I liked about it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very creepy film,"Daniel Radcliffe's first film role after the end of Harry Potter is playing a lawyer in the early 1900s. OK, that's cool. This film is both an adaptation, and a remake, but I have neither read the book, nor saw the original film, so I went into this film with just one wish, please creep me out.And for the most part this film does that pretty well. I was creeped out throughout a lot of this film, and jumped a descent number of times. I think the reason it works so well is because it has great atmosphere, there is a twenty minute long sequence with almost no dialog with Daniel Radcliffe just walking around the house. And for a PG-13 horror movie, there are some pretty terrible ways in which KIDS, get killed. The ending has balls, it is both sad and happy at the same time. The acting is good, and it has really good production value, it really looks like the early 1900s.Now there are a few problems I had, the first twenty minutes have a few of the cheap jump scares, like a crow flying across the screen. Thankfully the scares get more real as the film goes on. There were a few times where I did feel kind of bored. And this may just be a personal problem, but Daniel Radcliffe, looks way too young to have a four year old kid. I mean he's 22, I know they had kids early back then but come on, but like I said, maybe it's just because I'm so used to him being Harry Potter.The Woman in Black is the best horror film of 2012 so far, granted the only other one I saw was the Devil Inside, but I did enjoy this film, and recommend you check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
About as creepy as you can get!,"""The Woman in Black"" is an exceptional horror film...and much of it is because the plot is very unique and the ghost is one god-awful creature!When the story begins, Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent on a business trip to sell Eel Marsh House....a mansion that's somehow sat vacant for years. Soon after arriving, Arthur starts to understand why....it's because the place is haunted. However, it's not a typical sort of ghost...it's an evil and vengeful spirit who is angry at the town and has been killing its children! The deaths are all very creepy and vivid...and Arthur is bent on trying to appease this evil ghost. Good luck with that, Artie!The film really excels when it comes to a creepy atmosphere. A lot of time, you are waiting for something terrible to jump out at the screen and it works well because they both kept the tension building AND made a great payoff when it did happen! Overall, a wonderful and very creepy horror film...one of the best I've seen...and nearly earning a 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of my favorite horror theater experiences,"I am vividly aware, as are most avid moviegoers, of the horror movie machine. It churns out Final Destinations, exorcism films, and at an even higher frequency, ghost films. At first glance, The Woman in Black appears to be yet another of these ""ghost films,"" where cheap scares, predictable plot ""twists,"" and horrible acting drag the viewer down into an hour-and-a-half maelstrom of mediocrity that can only end at the appearance of ""Directed by...""According to most of the reviewers thus far, The Woman in Black was a letdown. So perhaps it is because I went into the film with no expectations that I came out of it impressed and very, very shaken. I do not plan to explain the plot to you (many have done this already and there is a synopsis which does a far better job than I could), but I will argue in favor of how successfully scary this film was. Yes, it contains ghost film elements we have all seen before, but they are cleverly and patiently arranged so that the viewer becomes totally enveloped in atmospheric dread. Sure, there are ""jump"" scares, but these are also complimented by many shots which unfold slowly and effectively. It sometimes reminded me of the 1961 film, The Innocents, if that gives you a better idea. Radcliffe is also a worthy focal point of the film, keeping most of the fear and anticipation unspoken throughout.I would not nominate this film for any kind of award, but it achieves what I believe should be the ultimate goal of all ""horror"" movies: to draw us in so close that when our fear manifests itself on-screen, it is already too late to turn away. It rates high as one of my favorite horror theater experiences, alongside The Descent and The Strangers.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Like a ghost train, but with better effects","This was one of the most generic and amusingly ridiculous haunted house films I've ever seen, but the scares do give you bang for your buck. I suppose it's kind of like ""The Grudge"" in that regard. Personally I was expecting more cerebral atmospheric horror than the choreographed staccato JUMP tactics, but it was very much the latter and they were relentless.It just felt more like I was watching one of the those attractions at Disney Land, than an actual movie; 70% of the running time is comprised of Radcliff walking from one ridiculously cobwebbed, creepy doll-littered room to the next while the viewer waits nervously for a piercing violin chord and a scary face to jolt them out of their seats.Radcliff is actually pretty decent for all that he had to do (basically stay wide eyed and tense). Ciarán Hinds was underused and the rest of the cast were just bleh... Not sure I can compliment the actress who played the ghost, but her makeup team did an exceptional job.Entertaining distraction, but don't expect to even remember the character's names once the credits start rolling.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Obvious regarding the genre standards but still effective and surprisingly chilling,"I'm not sure why it took me so long to get around to watching this film – it sat in my queue for quite some time and never appealed. The plot is your standard ghost story / haunted house fare – a tragedy which has resulted in lingering horrors which a new person in town doesn't fully appreciate but, when he does, he tries to make up for the past to make it all stop. There is detail around this but essentially this is what it is and at its base it is familiar. The delivery follows a similar path in terms of what it does, because we have creepy children, creepy dolls, lots of shadows, static figures and half-seen movements.All of this is very much of the genre but yet it is still effective and I was surprised by just how frightening parts of it were – it more than earns the 12A certificate it got in the UK because for sure the intensity and unnerving aspects of it do more than gore or language would do. The film opens with a strong scene of three children who seem compelled to calmly throw themselves to their death out of an attic window. From here the creepiness continues in a similar, understated manner in the way a good ghost story should. Okay it is not breaking new ground with half-seen faces in windows and lots of jump scares as things happen, but it still works well. I watched it with headphones and the impact of the sound design is also important – while it of course does the sudden noises well, the silence is very well captured because it is not just ""no noise"" but rather the stillness of waiting for something to happen.Radcliffe leads the film well, convincing in his performance and making for a likable lead – although he has his Potter fame, he doesn't overplay here and (for me at least) his fame didn't distract from me getting into the film. He is well supported by good turns from the supporting cast, but the main work comes from the production design as the house is creepy and is well filmed, lit and captured to have a tangible sense of dread and presence – this is what makes the film as enjoyable as it was. It is still a genre film for sure, but it is one that works well with plenty of atmosphere, chills and scares.",,Anonymous,Horror

Old fashioned spooker delivering on its perilous period promise.,"The Woman in Black is directed by James Watkins and adapted to screenplay by Jane Goldman from Susan Hill's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer. Music is scored by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones. Plot has Radcliffe as young London solicitor Arthur Kipps, who is sent to the North East village of Crythin Gifford to clear up the affairs of deceased woman Mrs. Drablow. When he arrives he finds that the memory of Drablow, and her remote house of Eel Marsh, holds the village in a grip of fear, particularly those who have children.....It's fitting that that bastion of British horror, Hammer Studios, should be behind this delightful period ghost story. For this positively oozes old fashioned values, harking back to all those wonderful spookers set around a creepy village that featured an even creepier castle or mansion at its core. More presently, the film has kindred links to the likes of The Orphanage, The Others and The Changeling, while the vengeful spirit acting out of Eel Marsh House is pumped by J-Horror like blood and Darkness Falls' Wraith bitch nastiness. So clearly The Woman in Black is not a fresh arrival to the horror splinter where the ghost story resides. However, great period ghost story films are in short supply, and Watkins' film most assuredly is a great entry in the sub-genre.Propelling it forward is Watkins' (Eden Lake) excellent sense of mood and crafting of palpable unease. Quite often the better ghost story films are better because they operate on a what you don't see is what scares you more level, Watkins has managed to keep that aspect of his film whilst also giving us enough of the truly terrifying spirit to jolt us in our seats; often showing her to us and not to Radcliffe's Kipps! When the shocks come, and there are many and they are bona fide underwear soiling, they act as merciful releases from the built up dread, but then when Watkins doesn't deliver a shock, we are left waiting uneasily, darting our eyes all over the expansive frame, searching fruitlessly for a glimpse of something troubling. Did that wind up toy move? Is that a pallid face we just glimpsed in the shadows? That damn rocking chair is the scariest there has ever been! And on it goes....A film such as this is only as good as the production design and setting for the story. Thankfully Watkins and his team have nailed it there as well. Eel Marsh House exteriors are Cotterstock Hall in Northamptionshire, perfectly foreboding, while the beautiful village of Halton Gill in the Yorkshire Dales gets a Hammer Horror make over to become Crythin Gifford. But it's with the interior of the house where the makers excel, an utterly unforgiving and upsetting place, brilliantly under lit by Tim Maurice-Jones for maximum scary effect.On the acting front the film rests solely on the shoulders of Radcliffe, and he comes up trumps. Initially its awkward accepting him as the father of a young boy, and once he gets to Crythin Gifford he is dwarfed by all the other adults who live there, but once the Victorian setting envelopes him the awkwardness evaporates and the characterisation becomes more realistic and easy to sympathise with. The character is changed from the book, meaning Radcliffe has to carry inner torment as well as exuding an outer coat of trepidation blended with stoic fear. It should be noted that for much of the picture he is acting on his own, reacting to the house and the overgrown gardens and marshes, in short he is terrific and it augers well for his adult acting career. In support Hinds and McTeer are pillars of professionalism, with McTeer's Mrs. Daily a creepy character in her own right, but it's also another neat meditation on grief that sits alongside Arthur Kipps'.The ending is also changed from that in the novel, and it's already proving to be divisive. How you react to it, and it is up for a two-fold interpretation, may dampen your overall enjoyment of the picture? Personally I have no issue with it, I was still sunk in the cinema chair breathing heavily at that point! The certification and the presence of Radcliffe ensures that a teenage audience will flock to see it, many of whom will not get the ""horror"" film that they are after. Hopefully the word will get out that this really is only a film for those who love a good boo jump ghost story of old, that's its target audience, and that's the people whose reviews you should trust. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

This movie transports the feeling of the early 1900s very well and the creepy scenes are quite good.

On the negative we have, once again, annoyingly loud and often false jump scares, who ruin the experience a lot. Definetely worth a watch, allthough I am a little disappointed.

a slow story that has been seen before,I had really high hopes for this movie after seeing the preview. Unfortunately the preview was the the only thing I ended up liking about this rubbish. After about an hour into this very slow paced movie I realized that this movie was just never going to get any good. Harry Potter does a great job in his first break out role but the story just comes up short with minimal scares and a crawling pace. The setting and time period have all the makings of a great spook flick. People were actually laughing out loud in the theater at how the mood would build up to something that was going to be chilling but then would fall flat. Big disappointment.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror

The film stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White.A young lawyer travels to a village to examine a house and encounters a vengeful ghost of a woman.I have read reviews of this film in which viewers were going gaga over the horror in the film and I would also like to give my vote in this favor. The film is indeed scary and justifies the hype seen on various reviewing platforms.The plot of film is intriguing and to much extent the execution is good, the film doesn't wastes mush time in character explanation and comes straight to the point. The director is been successful in creating the atmosphere of scare be it through the darkness, the creepy dolls or the background environment. Though there are lots of jump scares but the director had avoided using eerie sound to create horror.Acting is superb and Daniel Radcliffe carries the entire film very convincingly, in terms of support cast apart from Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer none of the cast gets much screen space.Screenplay of the film is slow but the screenplay writer has been successful in scaring from the beginning although till the time the film reaches to it's end the horror starts to diminishing because in my opinion the viewers gets habitual. The climax of the film is good and is unconventional.Overall a decent scary film and if you love horror films then this is the film for you. A must watch.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Why was the guy who wrote the screen play allowed to leave screenplay college?

The film feels horribly rushed with barely any sense of foreboding or dread. Just cheap jump scares which wear horribly thin after a very short time.

"Lamp lit sets, rolling fog, graveyards - old school horror.","Mr. Kipp is assigned to handle the estate of Alice Drablow who owned Eel Marsh. The longer he stays on at Drablow estate the more horror he witnesses which pushes him on to uncover what is taking the lives of the local children.Not to be confused with 1989's competent made for TV film, Hammer films production boasts a terrific cast, looks and sounds great with real locations assisting the gravity. Set in early 1920's, the period is wonderfully recreated - a time where séance and superstition is rife.Opening with a creepy melodic score and an eerie children's party which ends mysteriously tragic you know your on somber solid ground and in good horror hands. There are plenty of scares, spine chilling moments and jump scares which have the quality to make hairs stand-up on the back of necks thanks to the fantastic sound design and visuals.Lamp lit sets, odd grim town folk, rolling fog, graveyards, ghosts, creepy dolls and photos, this version of Woman in Blank oozes atmosphere. James Watkins delivers a slow burning chiller which allows the tragic character of widower Kipp time to breathe.Based on Susan Hill's novel The Woman in Black's excellent writer Jane Goldman includes the old horror clichés in the screenplay but injects realism along side. It all comes together thanks to the great casting. A mature Daniel Radcliffe as defiant Mr Kipps is surprising effective, veteran Ciarán Hinds is on top form as wealthy land owner Daily and Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White are all wonderful. The supporting cast even down to the child actors are effective. Nevertheless, Radcliffe is very much the focus.It's refreshing like the recent Innkeepers (2011) with it's back to basics approach of little blood and simple chills. Arguably surpassing the Haunted (1995), The Others (2001) and reminiscent of the Haunting (1963) Woman in Black harks back to the days of old school horror and scares with a modern slick execution.The icing on the cake is its horrible, yet, brave heart wrenching downbeat or debatably upbeat ending which will stay with you long after the credits roll.",,Anonymous,Horror
An atmospheric ghost story,"At last an atmospheric ghost story set in a haunted house with an unrealistic back story and creepy villagers! It is frankly a pleasure to watch a semi-intelligent ghost story without the pointless gore or the shaky hand-cam style. I am personally delighted that Hammer have returned to what they do best! The setting is so stereotypical of a ghost story it practically becomes a character in the film. And this is by no means a negative thing. The house is suitably isolated by geographic location, fog and the tide. The nearest village is filled with unwelcoming locals and strange tragedies. And the story is set in a time before modern cynicism. Saying that, it is not without its faults. Radcliff tries but it is difficult to accept him as a grieving widower and father. The story is at times too stereotypical and predictable. However, I am welcoming the return of a genre that the British film industry do so well. I hope to see many more.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Worth a watch but TWIB Veterans may be disappointed,"My interest in TWIB was stirred when a friend suggested I watch his recently acquired copy of the 1989 TV Movie of this famous Ghost story based on the work of Susan Hill. Having chosen to start watching said copy at sometime past 11 at night I could not believe what I was witnessing. It was simply a masterpiece in storytelling, with a dark foreboding atmosphere, a gloomy and wild setting and a chillingly horrific spectre. In short all the elements of your classic Ghost story were present and after ""That"" scene (which was frankly heart-stopping) and with images of ""That"" face and ""Those"" eyes, plenty of uneasy nights followed with more than necessary rooms constantly lit around my house.Needless to say I readily purchased a copy of the Book and was delighted to see that essentially the film had stayed true to the book albeit with a slightly different ending (although the same sentiment)and the odd cosmetic character change here and there.Fast-forward 3 years to 2012, and this latest production supported by that stalwart of British Horror, Hammer and with an adapted screenplay by Jane Goldman. It is fair to say that with my previous experience of this story I have followed this film's development with some relish and could not have had more anticipation if I'd tried. Unfortunately, perhaps that was my downfall.....I'm a firm advocate of the old adage ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it"" and for me this new version just tries to be too innovative. Far too many iconic scenes are either completely removed (The Drablow funeral, Spider's tangle with the Marshes, anyone?) or changed beyond recognition (The child's bedroom scenes). Both the book and '89 film gradually built the appearance of the actual Woman in Black with slow snatched glimpses/descriptions that led the reader/viewer to almost be able to feel the evil, not too much seen, just fleeting, haunting and dramatically unsettling images. This new version just reveals too much too early and frankly the whole suspenseful atmosphere just does not feel as genuine as the previous incarnations of this story. That is even before we begin to mention the less than convincing special-effects in use here. Low budget or not, as an avid horror fan, I have seen much more convincing Ghosts created on far smaller budgets. It seems that using heavy doses of black mascara on a real actress as they did 20 odd years ago would have been a much wiser choice.And now the ending.... Ah, oh dear... What on Earth were you thinking Hammer? In the book - The ending WORKS. in the 1989 version, the amended ending - WORKS! Why, why, why change it for a mish-mash ending used 1,000 times before in almost every other Horror film out there????It would be unfair to say that TWIB 2012 is a poor film. Far from it. It is still a good story, well recreated period scenes, relatively engrossing and Radcliffe is unrecognisable from his HP days. Honestly, you could think he'd been Potter 15 years ago, such is the drastic change of image. He also turns in a good performance and Ciaran Hinds, as ever is absorbing and masterful in his role.But that's the problem Hammer and Goldman have combined to give a GOOD Ghost story that offers nothing new. The Book and 1989 version are GREAT and amongst the finest examples of their genres within their respected media. That is quite simply the difference.

So scary,"This movie was the end of me watching scary movies ever again. I scared the hell out of me.As a horror movie I can say it is brilliant because it is so scary. But I should have stopped watching it from the opening scene. I should not try out of curiosity to watch the whole thing. I do not know what happened in this case. I have watched quite a lot scary movies including movies like the Exorcist, Saw, Scream, the Ring, the Grudge, the Eye, etc etc. OK someone might tell that those are not so scary compared to others. BUT the woman in black shocked me. My boyfriend came to see me after I had just watched the movie (plus I watched it with low sound and my hand almost covering my eyes 'cos i could not watch it otherwise) and he found me shaking out of fear. I told him I had watched a really scary movie, he insisted on us re watching it together in order for me to overcome that irrational fear but i could not. The next day he watched it alone out of curiosity and he said he was not scared at all. I do not know what to say. I say so many movies with exorcisms, ghosts, vampires, serial killers etc but this one marked the end of me watching any kind of creepy staff again. I do not know how to explain the fear I felt for the very first moment",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally a scary movie!,"I went in to seeing this movie after reading the book, and personally I thought it was great. Horror movies these days get loss in blood and gore and that's what the work thinks is ""horror"" these days, thankfully this movie took a turn to what horror actually is. There are plenty of scenes that make you jump and keep you on the edge of your seat and the storyline is great too. The only weird thing was there were just a couple scenes in which I just couldn't help but think of Harry potter but that didn't even come close to ruining it for me. I was nervous because I thought they Showed all the scary moments through the previews but they did not! Daniel Radcliffe did a great job and I would go see it again with out a doubt. We need to see more horror movies like this one!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
effectively creepy atmosphere and great sets can't save this from boring horror tropes,"The two strengths that this movie had were the deeply eerie atmosphere and the storytelling. While the story itself is fairly cut and dry - the source material being a little more in depth but not by much - how it's told in the film carries a certain respectable weight. The creepy factor is high, as the sets l, music, and camerawork are all well done. However the beaten to death tropes of the genre - and I'm not just talking about predictable jump scares; a few of those actually""got"" me - are emphasized in the third act, making the antagonist lose her merit in my eyes and rendering the climax very... anticlimactic. The very ending was a nice touch, but not surprising by any means. Ciarán Hinds is always effective in his roles, and was here, too. Radcliffe wasn't bad, but I was hoping for more emotion. A high 6 or low 7.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Woman that had Potential,"** out of (****)After the abysmal trainwreck that was ""The Devil Inside"", I was looking for a decent roller coaster ride of chills and thrills. The hoopla for this movie certainly rose to such gargantuan heights, and a good chunk of top critics took a liking to this, so what went wrong? Everything.""Black"" revolves around a young lawyer, who travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.Being an avid horror fan, especially of the supernatural sub-genre (if you will), this movie basically shot up my adrenaline from the first shot of the trailer 'til the last. I was more than ready for this movie. So automatically, I am disqualified from the ""hater bias"" bullcrap you IMDb'ers like to toss around when us average Joe's get disappointed by a film, that we were actually rooting for from the start.Well, first off, this film is just not scary. The first half of the film is conducive to cheap and generic jump scares, that just fall flat on their faces. Oh look it's some murky liquid leaking from a dirty faucet! Oh look it's just a bird! It was just all very cheap. From the first half, it is just tedious to endure. We don't establish a sufficient enough amount of character development and we really don't go in-depth with the premise. It is just a very stale first hour or so that's chock-full of filler, so as to consume most of its running time. Just lots of blabber about the town and tons of GOTCHA! moments that don't fully run their course.Then we get to the second half which is a notch better from the first, but still don't bring us anywhere. Here we get even more jump scares, some which prove to be effective and others which are just tedious time-wasters. Here's a lesson to future filmmakers: You can use the cheap thrill tactic maybe about three times at the most. If you abuse your power, you're just downgrading your film and everything else just becomes that much more uninspired. But let's steer clear from my rant of jump scares. The story. From the trailer, the premise sounds bone-chilling and simple enough, right? The film overcomplicates everything and raises too many questions that are left too open-ended. And atop of that, the pacing is just way too slow. The whole film is just a slow-burn effect that amounts to absolutely nothing. And that ending? Oh boy, this movie is just a mess.Well, there are a few good things I can say for ""The Woman in Black"". For one, the production crew did their homework. A lot of attention to detail is payed when organizing their pops and set designs. This is one of the most visually exciting horror films I've seen. And also, the performances are very strong. Daniel Radcliffe ditches his whole Potter affair and does something very worthwhile here.All in all, ""The Woman in Black"" is such a huge disappointment. The scares go nowhere and are recycled, the pacing is just too slow and tedious that it's almost a chore to sit through, and the premise is even less than compelling. It's quite a shame considering it looked like a refreshing and nostalgic horror film that could've started '12 on a high note. Unfortunately, any potential it had was wasted. Well, I guess you can say it isn't terrible and actually raises a peak of interest here and there, but that doesn't amount to much when you're paying a hefty price for it.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Ten points to Gryffindor,"I can honestly say that I have really never been more terrified in a film. Not that I can remember. From the beginning of the film, the mood is set - something is horribly wrong. The screenplay was simply brilliant. The adaptation from stage to screen was highly successful, in my opinion. The scenic designer did a fantastic job with everything from the nursery to the town Kipps stays at. The directing was also something to be applauded. Over all, this film was wonderful and I would recommend it. And I must say, Dan Radcillffe did a great job. He may not be the most incredible actor, but he has really improved so much. It's most evident here because he could not hide behind words or a wand, he could use just his face and body language. They are an actor's tool after all. To be able to carry a film with body language is something to be commended. Few actors can.On another note, I adored the fact they never hid the Woman in Black. They embraced her from the beginning, with little traces of a face in the windows as they were passed. The simplicity of the film was what I think made it so terrifying. There weren't blood and guts flying around with a poor sap strapped to an operating table while a deranged lunatic tries to connect him to the anus of another. It was a simple, yet effectively frightening, ghost story. I can say I loved every second of it.If you love horror films, give it a go. This is the first film I've seen in quite some time that was worth my entire $10.00 to see it.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Ho-Hum, Haunted House, Vengeful Spirit, Who Cares?","The Woman in Black (1:35, PG-13) — fantasy: supernatural, 3rd string, formulaThe Woman in Black is a standard haunted-house story (bereaved mother seeking vengeance for her dead child from beyond the grave), in this case with almost no dialog, just poor Daniel Radcliffe (as pre-WW1 solicitor Arthur Kipps) walking around said house looking grim.During the course of the movie Radcliffe displays between about 0 and 2 days worth of Nixonian 5 o'clock shadow, not monotonically increasing, as one would expect, but rather coming and going to the point where I was spending more time watching that than paying attention to the plot. Really bad continuity here, making you wonder why they didn't think this thru in advance, or at a minimum clean it up in post. Also way too many cheap-thrill scenes that were more ""Ho-hum, what, again?"" than frightening.What did it have going for it? An interesting setting, at big old dark Eel Marsh House, on a promontory accessible only via a causeway during low tide. Effective atmospherics. Lots of work for the foley artists. A nice non-existent twist when local burgher and ostensible skeptic Samuel Daily (Ciarán Hinds) DOESN'T turn out to be some kind of secretly malevolent deceiver but is instead genuinely friendly and helpful.Opposed to this are the dreariness, almost complete absence of any cast or dialog, over-familiar premise, and my standard lament about all such movies, namely that they may tell us WHY the evil spirit is doing the wicked deeds, but they never show us HOW.It's a sad commentary on the film when you find yourself thinking ""OK, if you want to kill off all the kids in the village, just do it and be done with it!"", but such is the impatience engendered by the petulant, dithering deader that I was hoping she'd finally get it over with so I could click my stopwatch off and bail out of the theater.All of this combines to barely put The Woman in Black into the ""up to you"" range if you like this kind of thing.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too old . . .,"I can't get excited about the film version of Woman in Black any more than I could the hoary stage play now second only to Mousetrap for West End longevity. The haunted house conceit with all its creeks, cracks, and cranky toys is too old itself to creep me out. That the film revives the old Hammer film company is the best revision of all.Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe), a young 19th century attorney, is given a last chance with the firm by going to an old Victorian mansion at the end of a vulnerable causeway to settle the estate. Leaving behind his motherless boy, Joseph (Misha Handley), an early part of the abandoned-child ghost motif to come, Arthur and we endure the loud bangs in the house when each door opens, the fuzzy ghost of the mother who long ago lost her child at the mansion, and a thousand other bumps in the night to make even the rude mechanical restlessly sitting next to me say, ""This is getting dumber by the minute."" It's not always dumb if you sense in the adaptation of Susan Hill's classic novel a theme expressed best by James Joyce as the ""melancholy unity between the living and the dead.""The film pivots on the attempt of parents to connect with long gone or lost children, who return in either vision or reality, depending on your opinion of the occult. In that way the film is saved from being a repetitive vehicle for scary-movie tropes. I even found a visual reference in the long hall of sconces to Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast. Thank goodness for cinema history in needy places.Kave Quinn's production design, right down to the folk art toys, is noteworthy as is Tim Maurice-Jones's cinematography, be it bird's-eye shots of the mansion or dimly-lit corridors. In a better horror story, both artists would be better feted.If you are anything of a realist, you'll probably chuckle at the ending, a lame attempt to reflect Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's belief in spiritualism. Like the film before it, the ending is less creepy than it is comical. Part of that comes from Daniel Radcliffe's less than smooth delivery and the laughable horror elements that will grace this genre forever.Join the dead in one happy party hosted by Hammer Films.",,Anonymous,Horror
Good Thriller,"Traditional horror movies with ghosts in the classic sense are no longer as popular as they used to, so the move to make a film adaptation on this subject brought some freshness in this sub-genre. They chose an excellent material for the recording, the popular novel from Susan Hill, and gave it to the chosen writers and gathered a quality team of actors together, so that the final product could not fail. There are many clichés and individual attributes repeats from popular movies, but on the other hand it can be seen as a realistic replication eerie atmosphere at so many times tried and tested method that does not make mistakes. Quality horrors, in my opinion, give us pounding tension as the film progresses and the end of the film is reduced to an explosive scene that resolves it all. With this film it is not that case. From the start the viewers are given tense scenes that do not escalate at the end, so that the film is more thriller than horror.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Predictable & slightly disappointing,"I'll try and keep this a brief review.To support my summary of 'predictable and slightly disappointing'; I thought it was predictable because it was advertised as a 'jumper'. By this I mean a film that uses suspense and load noises and imagery to scare the viewer or make them jump. This effect leaves no post-traumatic stress which only a few horrors and thrillers really cause these days. For example, the Paranormal Activity films, personally left some anxiety afterwards because of the realism in the film but also the way in which the events take place in bedrooms and the home in which we are expected to go to sleep in after watching them (with difficulty).The sudden flashing imagery and screaming to cause jumps in the film were effective; most likely of which for myself, was the woman screaming in the reflection on the window whilst the protagonist is looking down on the graveyard. However this is a little predictable for enabling fear or a jump in the audience and resembles a 'ring girl online game' or 'zombie girl' in which the user is scared spontaneously whilst viewing or interacting with a video by a girl or woman screaming suddenly appearing on the scream with use of audio to back up the suspense and scare.Whilst it sort of celebrates Daniel Radcliffe's diversity as an actor, and I don't doubt the quality and commitment he gave to the role, for an hour and fifteen minute thriller I was disappointed. I appreciated the narrative and storyline (which ironically some people didn't) but the execution of the premeditated reaction in which everyone expected from this film did not deliver.JWL.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dan the Man in ""The Woman in Black""","So finally the wait is over. The question that has been eating every Harry Potter movie franchise fan,hollow, is finally laid to rest. The question in question is ""What happens to our boy wizard post Hogwarts School of witchcraft and wizardry"". It's a natural question because, over the years people have literally grown up with the trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione. So, more than the excitement about the celluloid adaptation of the horror novel ""The Woman in Black"" ,it was this childish curiosity which drew me to catch Dan Radcliffe's next outing on the big screen.Set in the Edwardian era (my 2nd favorite era after the Victorian one) the movie opens into foggy and murky environs of the city of London. Radcliffe portrays the role of Arthur Kipps, a widower and the father of an angelic 4 yr. old boy. It's as if the foggy weather outside is the depiction of the turmoil and murkiness in his life;Kipps an emerging lawyer is sent to a seemingly harmless assignment to handle the estate of one Alice Drablow, owner of an English manor known as the Eel Marsh House. The manor is located on a desolate island in the marshes as opposed to verdant locales of the English countryside, which just enhances the clouds of eeriness that shroud the movie throughout. As fate would have it, this harmless assignment turns out be a perilous one and one which tests Kipps to the hilt. As if a village run over by superstitions and small kids committing hara-kiri weren't enough, he has to lock horns with the curse of a mysterious lady in black and in the process muster all the courage deep down in labyrinth of his mind as a part of a plot which finally becomes a fight to save his child. What provides him solace throughout the movie are the visions of his wife every now and then in her wedding gown, his lady in white,if you will.The director James Watkins maintains a solid hold on the movie and the final product, if not edge of the seat stuff, is gripping enough to grab the attention of the viewer. The whole movie has the look of a good old fashion horror flick. Be it the macabre environs of the haunted and dilapidated mansion, or the scares conjured in good measure by the mysterious lady in black who sneaks up on you every now and then for some seat popping moments .Add to the above, creepy toys, toddlers walking away in deep trance, the rocking chair and above all the indispensable black crow and you have one hell of a chills inducing department.Now coming to the performances of the cast. First up is our protagonist. As stated earlier, Radcliffe carries a sombre and pensive demeanour throughout the flick. He shows just the right amount of understatement and restrain demanded by the role and boy does,Dan emerge with flying colors in the end. He fits into the shoes of a difficult role with ease just like an experienced campaigner (well with 8 HP films behind him,I shouldn't call him that). It's very easy to over do your part in such a role and appear wooden when it comes to showing a glimpse of those hidden emotions, but with his grimness and pensiveness in culmination with scattered outbursts of emotions one can't help but take away an image of Arthur Kipps and not harry potter when you finally exit the movie hall. As for the rest of cast, nobody else has enough screen time to make an impact except for the woman in black(Liz White) who sans any dialog manages to make an impression, a shuddering one at that. You wish the Dailys(Ciarán Hinds as Sam Daily and Janet McTeer as Elizabeth Daily) had more screen time; otherwise they carry out their parts with panache and in sync with the demands of the film.So, in the end what you have is a satisfying enough horror mystery which I must say is good adaption of the novel. Adapting a novel to screen is a precarious task and difficult to pull off and the final product as conjured up by Watkins looks good. Credit to the able screenplay and direction, Watkins and his team concoct a ""just about there"" flick and upliftingly enough for potter fans Radcliffe packs quite a punch with his commendable performance, but still looks too young to play a father.In my case I couldn't help but wipe a tear a or two off my eyes as I left the theatre brimming with emotions and sighing ""our lil wizard has finally grown up""",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Very disappointing,"Don't believe the hype is what I want to say, there totally is nothing scary about this movie. There is a constant effort being made to startle you with the music or sound effects. I would like a full refund of my money, and by the way the hot dog was cool and under cooked.At one point in the film I nearly fell asleep. I think the scariest moment in this film for me was when I realized that nothing was really gonna happen.I think that when movie makers produce films like this and dupe the movie goers they should be banned from making films for 1 year. What they did here in this movie was to have the music and sounds jump out at you. Now days a night out at the movies with your girl friend, that's 2 tickets plus drinks, and something to eat can cost you nearly $100.00. I saw nothing of any value in this movie, producers really need to be more responsible about what we are about to view. I don't appreciate being mislead and I don't like smoking mirrors.

Positive evocation of Dracula and other period Hammer films,"Creepy and off-putting, The Woman in Black really is a terrific thriller. It's intended to shock, and in many scenes it is successful. It's a moody, psychologically scarring throwback to the old Roger Corman movies based on Edgar Allan Poe stories, with an amazing adult performance by Daniel Radcliffe as a young lawyer out of his depth.Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), a down-on-his-luck attorney, is asked to travel to a remote village and find out if a recently deceased woman has left any heretofore unknown wills. It's Kipps' last shot at success, his employer sternly warns him. His journey to the village is eerily similar to that undertaken by Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula. Something's not quite right with the town, which clearly doesn't want him around, something to do with children being murdered and people blaming a dead woman. You know how it is.Kipps' sleuthing leads to more and more questions. Who was the woman (ostensibly, his client), really? What relationship did she have with the town? And what of those treacherous marshes, and that long and winding road to the main house that is impassable when the tide is in? Why is it that every time Kipps turns around, a shadow darts away? Understanding that these are all staples of the great horror movies of yore doesn't mean that this film is stealing; it is merely authentically replicating the desolate atmosphere, in which a whisper can signal death.I entered the theater knowing very little of the movie's content. Was it to be a mystery, and we'd find out who the titular woman was at some point? It is, and we do, but that is only part of the puzzle. The best horror movies, in my opinion, are the ones that build just the right amount of suspense and then pull the rug out from under the viewer. A slow buildup must have a satisfying payoff. Showing the evil the lurks in every other scene dilutes the fright quotient. This movie doesn't do that. It pulls no punches to our psyche.It is so closely shot by Tim Maurice-Jones, who's best known for his work with Guy Ritchie. Maurice-Jones' style here is to capture almost every shot from Kipps' perspective, thus bringing the audience that much closer to the terror he's supposed to be feeling. Radcliffe, to his credit, never comes off as some innocent lad who's just starting out in the business, and although Kipps is perplexed - much like Edward Woodward's character in The Wicker Man - he is determined to see things through, even though he has strayed a bit from his original mission.Something is definitely wrong here, and it involves the children. Are they to blame for the nefarious goings-on? Are their parents? No one is saying anything. To make matters worse for Kipps, he has a young son of his own, whose mother died in childbirth and who is coming to visit Kipps in a few days. The grief felt by the parents of the fallen children only heightens Kipps' own fears.There are several moments that, on the Internet, would be called shock videos. Everything seems normal, and then BAM, something pops out of nowhere. In lesser movies, this might be seen as a crutch, a way to stun your senses to get a particular reaction, but here it all fits in, and it conveys mortal terror. The Woman in Black's identity is revealed very early in the film, so the mystery isn't who she is but why these events keep occurring. Is it all superstition, or is there something more to the spiritual aspect of the plot?The ending is tidy and satisfying, but it is by no means conventional or predictable. In fact, it opens up even more questions. But more importantly, director James Watkins and screenwriter Jane Goldman (based on a book by Susan Hill) do not take the easy way out. People do not necessarily live happily ever after. Story threads are not necessarily sewn up tight. It is a riveting film steeped in a macabre atmosphere teeming with the potential of death with every slow approach to a corner or a locked door.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Besides some scarce dialogue and frightening encounters, almost nothing interesting happens. You want to find out how it ends but it's a bit hard to endure basically the same thing, repeating over and over again.It is grim, it is sinister at times and it has a catchy plot, but its course of events is a bit letdown, not to mention the unsatisfactory finale which, in my opinion, makes the whole struggle before it simply pointless.

"""The Woman in Black""- Excellent atmosphere and an intriguing story are let-down due to a lackluster over-reliance on clichés and jump-scares. Adequate, but nothing special.","It's sad that a film can do so much right... from sharp and crisp visual direction to wonderfully atmospheric and Gothic music to top- notch performances from a wildly talented cast... yet still come up short and even stale at times. But such is the case for 2012's ""The Woman in Black"", the second adaptation of a 1983 horror novella by author Susan Hill. While the film is certainly one of many strengths and is sure to raise some goosebumps from general audiences, the fact of the matter is that anyone with even a passing knowledge and appreciation of horror will likely recognize and bemoan the fact that the film falls into the same trappings and faults of many other modern releases- that being an over-reliance on the same old clichés that pollute the genre as a whole, and for its woeful over-reliance on jump-scares.Still, the film is most definitely an enjoyable experience. It just falters a bit too often to be anything more than ""average"" and ""adequate."" Which is a shame, given the rampant talent that is obvious both on-screen and behind the camera.In Edwardian era England, lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is dispatched to the town of Crythin Gifford, where he is set to work on the sale of a massive estate. However, not all is well in Crythin Gifford- and it soon becomes clear that a dark and vengeful specter of the past is haunting the town, claiming the lives of local children and driving them to commit suicide. And it is up to Arthur and his associates to solve the mystery and try and save the town from this vile entity... But at what cost?Helmed by ""Eden Lake"" director James Watkins from a script by the ever-reliant Jane Goldman, I do think the movie has a lot going for it. Watkins has a very keen and wickedly stylish eye, and seems to relish in delivering the most wonderfully oppressive and dreary visuals possible. It's a very slick and moody film from an aesthetic standpoint, and I absolutely love the tone that Watkins establishes early on and builds off of with each passing scene. Goldman's script is generally tight, concise and moves at a fairly good pace, and her structure works well at building the mystery and suspense for much of the runtime. Add to that a genuinely disturbing and freakish musical score from the wonderful Marco Beltrami and a first-rate performance from star Daniel Radcliffe, and you should have a sure-fire winner.Unfortunately, as I noted above... there's just too much of the same-old, same-old here to really get excited. What promises to be a tense and exciting supernatural horror in the first act quickly degenerates into a by-the-numbers thriller by the film's midway point. While I refuse to spoil any of the twists and turns of the tale, I will say that most fans of horror and suspense, or even people with the most basic interest in film structure will see everything coming from a mile away. It does take away some of the potential suspense, and outside of a generally surprising climax... most people will be able to call the shots way ahead of time. And then there's the jump-scares. My god... the jump-scares. It's really kind of irritating how so many modern- day films think that random jolts are a proper substitute for horror. Jump-scares are not, well, scary. They're startling. And their effect is only minimal and fleeting. They need to be earned and artfully used in moderation and in key-moments to be effective. And for the most part, they aren't earned and they most certainly aren't used in moderation here. You can't just keep throwing something in the audience's face over and over with a loud stinger and expect it to be ""good horror."" It really betrayed the genuinely and truly disturbing sequences of fear and anguish throughout the film. There are so many good and freakish sequences, that the random jumps that keep popping up end up dragging the whole film down. They cheapen the experience.Still, it's not a total loss. The film is filled to burst with wonderful Gothic style, some fantastic sequences of dread and tragedy and admittedly a great turn from Radcliffe in one of his most notable roles outside of the ""Harry Potter"" universe. It might be pulled down a few pegs due to its admittedly large faults, but I think general audiences will get enough of a kick out of it to make it worth at least a rental. Just know that if you're a horror junkie or a genre enthusiast, this isn't really ""great horror."" This is ""popcorn horror"" for the masses.I give ""The Woman in Black"" a ever-so-slightly above average 6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Slightly Predictable And Repetitive But Good At What It Does,"A very easy film to market . Just tell everyone it's a Hammer production even though many production and distribution companies were involved in the production , stick in Daniel Radcliffe fresh from the Harry Potter franchise and use a poster that looks exactly like a Harry Potter poster and you're guaranteed to make a profit within a couple of weeks of the film opening especially if you're looking at a certificate 12 where some recent Harry Potter fans might want to see itOne should bare in mind that despite the association with Hammer THE WOMAN IN BLACK isn't an out and out horror film but more in line with a traditional English ghost story meets period drama .Did I mention this was a 12 certificate ? It does have that Hammer ethos where a young middle class gentleman arrives in a small village where they're not used to strangers and this newly arrived stranger finds himself trying to solve a mystery . It's interesting how many people who feel the need to comment on the film constantly use the adjective "" atmospheric "" to describe it and it's impossible not to notice this . It's also well photographed and the look of the film has a blueish cold tone to it and the film contains some very good set design . The downside to all this is that for long periods of the film there's not much happening narrative wise and gets a little bit repetitive as Radcliffe's character Arthur Kipps enters a dark , lonely room , looks around nervously then "" BANG "" a loud noise is added to the sound mix making the audience jump . It's a cheap trick , though an effective one but becomes very overused and the portent dread built up in the early half of the film becomes negated by the repetitive predictable manner as the film continues . That said having watched far too many recent horror films ( Usually on the Horror Channel ) whose only selling point is mean spirited graphic gore it is nice that occasionally a film like this comes along that isn't dependent upon violence in order to grab the audience and make money so here's hoping the somewhat dubious but successful name of Hammer continues with THE QUIET ONES and well in to the future",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"deserving an 8/10, well worth your time and money","OK, I'll admit, I went into this film with not very high expectations, I left on the other hand pleasantly surprised and genuinely creeped out. Daniel Radcliffe, while not the best actor, also exceeded my expectations. The movie theater was packed and people really seemed to be enjoying themselves. People screamed when they were meant to and shivered accordingly. At the end the theater broke out in applause, and it was the most packed theater I've seen since the midnight premiere of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Walking out into the lobby people were still blown away, and I myself could not believe what just happened. So what I'm saying is, if you're looking for a fun night to be creeped out in an old fashioned horror film sort of way, go see the Woman In Black, you will not be disappointed.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Excellent,"Daniel Radcliffe has definitely grown up from his days as Harry Potter. This movie is reminiscent of the 1970s Gothic horror films. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys real horror movies such as the movies with Oliver Reed. The location this movie was filmed is spectacular, and the ending is unbelievable. This is definitely a movie that has people jumping in their seats. It is not overdone, and each of the actors/actresses do a fine job. This is filmed on location at Layer Marney Tower in Essex England. The film was planned to be shot in 3D, but that plan was later scrapped. I am happy that it was scrapped because this film does not need that kind of theatrics. It's well written with a great plot and excellent acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Kids,"Daniel Radcliffe is practically still a child, but he has to play a father in this movie. Another Hammer film, that finally seems to have a good one under its belt (if you take Let me in out of the equation that is, so let's say a unique good one). Hammer films came back, but it didn't seem to really take off. With this one it could change (if people will accept it, when it comes out on DVD and Blu Ray).To solve the mystery: Daniel R. is good in his role, the fact that his godson played his kid helped a lot I reckon. Also it's a nice change of pace for Ciaran Hinds. He's a good actor, but can play it mellow for once, instead of going all out (he was rather mellow in Rome, I meant his movie roles). Some nice shockers and a really nice story make this a worthwhile watch",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The Woman in Black – predictable, derivative, tedious and clichéd commercial mess","Night of the Living Dead, the independent horror film made in 1968 had perhaps the eeriest moment I have seen in film – the lady getting stabbed by her own possessed daughter while her screams are heard in the background. The repeated motion of the daughter's hand striking with the knife is seen, but I don't recall having seen the actual penetration of the knife. Although we do see the dead woman lying in the corner, with pain and shock on her face – this is true horror. Very few movies bring this kind of terror – Rosemary's Baby, The Blair Witch Horror, Carrie etc. The best part about them is how we are constantly aware of the imminent tension and are lead to it slowly, thus intensifying the impact when it hits us. Night of Living Dead kept me unnerved right to the iconic ending when it rained all its force with a sweep. How wonderful to have such movies among us!Then there is The Woman in Black – predictable, derivative, tedious and clichéd. We are aware that there is going to be an element of horror because it written on Daniel Radcliffe's face even when he has not faced it. How many times do I have to see spooky children that seem to be controlled by some supernatural element? Their blank, expressionless faces their slow walk and synchronized actions. This time we have creepy dolls and toys as accompaniments; the mother who brings such toys for her children is an unfit one. Daniel Radcliffe plays Arthur, a young solicitor sporting some sideburns and a sweaty, haggard look, whose wife is dead and now lives with his four year old son who notices draws a stick figure of him with an unhappy look. Oh, such a clever boy (roll eyes)! He has to handle an estate which no one is ready to tread, especially the quiet, ominous country people, who believe the house is cursed. Daniel steps in and sights a woman veiled in black, hence the name. The villagers tell him to keep away as their children because of his visits to the place. But Arthur, for some reason known only to him, wants to unravel the secrets. Perhaps he may get a raise!The movie is excruciatingly boring partly because Radcliffe looks tense when he isn't supposed to be and is relatively calm when he is supposed to be frightened to death. The direction itself is so indicative that it's a horror film, with the affected, spooked up style of talking, even in the exchange between Radcliffe and the lawyer. I don't like this senseless overstatement of fear, its shoddy. Radcliffe's Arthur smells a strange air in the village, with most of the residents being unfriendly and reserved. Everyone has that look which says 'Yeah, this is a horror film! Be frightened!'; I would not have been surprised if they had added Bela Lugosi's "" Be Afraid!"" monologue. The fear factor is close to nil; I swear the entire theater, mostly comprising of women and teenage girls, remained dead silent throughout. Even when the ghost's presence became more and more evident. And I disagree with Rotten Tomatoes' consensus that ""it may not provide enough of them for viewers attuned to modern, high-stakes horror"". It is a slighting remark since there are some viewers like me who are attuned to modern, high-stakes horror but appreciate more the horror that is subtly but effectively delivered. This movie was commercial mess.I wouldn't recommend The Woman in Black to anyone – it is devoid of any unsettling moment and may be too boring even for 13 year olds.My Rating: 2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
OK if u like old fashioned Gothic,"I was very much looking forward to watching this film after all the raving reviews i'd read about it, but, i must say - in my own opinion, it's not at all highly anticipated as I expected. It starts out quite slow, although there IS a sense of suspense, I was disappointed where that led to. It's an old fashioned Gothic flick - I personally cannot call it a horror) but more of a phsycological (however u spell it lol) film! I do think it's over - rated but if u enjoy going back to square 1 when they were 1st making horrors ( creepy noises, creaking, shadows etc) and like films set in the 20th century, then go watch it.

Could have been better....,"Anticipation played a big part in the viewing experience with this movie, hoping to see Daniel Radcliffe break out of his Harry Potter persona. Unfortunately, the movie was overall, a let-down.

For a horror, it did well in the ""take your high school girlfriend to scare the crap out of her"" scary moments but the plot was somewhat weak. Not a lot of thought was put into this movie and I felt it was created more for the ""scare a minute"" factor than actual storyline substance.

Really creepy !,"There is life after Hogwarts. I went in expecting it would be more thriller like (like Sleepy Hollow of Depp) and Radcliffe will not able to throw off the shadow of Harry Potter and when I saw him, I thought of Potter and if this would somehow be a continuation of the same character acting but I was quite wrong. Its a really good horror movie of the old-fashioned kind (i.e. all good suspense, no effects and nonsense). Radcliffe has done an amazing job and he has been successful is losing Potter !

Harry Potter meets Ghost,"-- www.Ramascreen.com --THE WOMAN IN BLACK is a mildly entertaining horror film that rides heavily on the popularity of Daniel Radcliff. It's going to make a lot of money at the box office, not because it's attended by genuine horror fans but because it's attended by Harry Potter fans. But that doesn't necessarily mean a bad thing. Some aspects about THE WOMAN IN BLACK does work, it has enough fright to keep you alert. But the concept is nothing new and the ending is too convenientBased on an '80s book, by Susan Hill, that was previously turned into a TV movie but this is the first time that it hit the big screen. And with the help from revamped Hammer Productions, which gave birth to a lot of classic Brit horror films, and screenwriter Jane Goldman whose contributions to X-Men: First Class and Kick-Ass I admired, THE WOMAN IN BLACK becomes a feature length horror film that lurks in the dark and frequently jolts you to your core. The film unfortunately suffers from unintentional humorous situations. Scenes that are supposed to be scary becomes slightly comical and scenes that are supposed to be dramatic becomes tacky for lack of a better word.I enjoy the environment in which the story is set. It's gloomy, often foggy as well, and it features a massive landscape that could drown whenever the tide rises. The film has all the elements needed to tell an effective horror story, a creepy empty mansion, a vengeful, murderous spirit, a protagonist conflicted, and I think director James Watkins did a splendid job of maintaining the unpleasant, uncomfortable tone. The only problem is there are too many mcguffins that come into play. The film is obsessed with certain things way too often. I'm OK with horror films that give ghosts personalities and agendas but the lead ghost in this story is too erratic for my taste.I know what you're wondering. So how did Radcliffe do in this film? I've gotta be honest with you, Radcliffe playing a father to a son is as unconvincing as Anton Yelchin with facial hair acting like an seasoned man in Like Crazy. It's as hilarious as watching Radcliffe played an older Potter at the end of Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2. I just don't buy it. I understand that Radcliffe wants to move on and show the world that he can do more than just casting spells and waving wands, but I don't think he gives the audience enough time to be ready to see him in an adult role. Performance-wise, I think he plays Arthur Kipps with a certain composure, he knows his character is conflicted, part of him just wants to get the job done and return to his son, but part of him wants to believe in the supernatural because he misses his dead wife, which probably lead Goldman to writing an ending that gives you a reunion as the ghost's way of saying thanks. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is in a sense a very traditional ghost story because there's an unfinished business involved and the longing for reunion with restful peace. It doesn't leave much for further interpretation but if you love a good scare, THE WOMAN IN BLACK does the trick.-- www.Ramascreen.com --",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Maybe for someone who rarely attends Theater, this might be worth watching.Also, when browsing IMDb reviews, if you see too many 10/10, just rely on the lowest ratings, as obviously these reviewers must be actor fans or pretty easy to impress.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Super scary and super fun film!,"occasional hints of the terror that is yet to come. There's no gore or cheap tricks, just scares in the best tradition of traditional ghost stories. In one scene a shot of an open door manages to cause hairs on the back of the neck to stand up. The story harks back to the M.R. James ghost stories with a well meaning man unleashing a malevolent force, in this case the Woman In Black herself.This is one of the creepiest, spookiest ghost stories ever filmed. Adapted from Susan Hill's book of the same title, the tale centres around a young lawyer sent to settle the estate of a deceased old lady. At the funeral, he sees what he thinks is another mourner, a woman dressed all in black. When he mentions this to others however, he gets a strange reaction and quickly realises all is not as it seems. Whenever this woman appears, so local legend says, a child will die. From then on, things become more and more tense as he becomes haunted by this mysterious woman. This production uses no special effects or fancy sets and to be honest, I think it would have detracted from the film if there had been. Instead, the viewer is left to concentrate purely on the story which becomes increasingly tense as it develops. There are several moments that will make you jump or send a shiver through you. Watch it alone with the lights off if you dare!",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Fans Want Something Different, This is It","First of all, I don't normally watch horror movies in the theater. I prefer to watch them at home, at night, with the lights off and with as little people around as possible. With this film, it hardly would've mattered. Insidious, The Shining, The Blair Witch Project and Paranormal Activity 1 and 2 are the 5 sole movies that have frightened me as much as this has, so fright fans: put this film in your plans. Daniel Radcliffe is excellent in this film playing a young lawyer near the turn of the 20th century living with his 4 year old son and grieving over the death of his wife during child birth. He is sent to a small village to manage the estate of a recently deceased woman. Obviously there's much more to be seen. The setting and premise of this film is done perfectly. The film has a very dark theme that it wants to get across and it does so superbly, not to mention how well it mixes with it's frightening tone. I've heard many complaints over how films have run out of ideas, but every now and then there's a good one. This is one of them. Yes, there are jump scares, but they're done in a way you haven't seen before. The movie will build up tension for almost 5 minutes until you literally are begging for the scare to come, and then it doesn't, and the music goes away. Now, you think, it'll come right now, it's in the mirror, behind the door, etc. No, the scare doesn't come. It gets you to the point where you actually realize there isn't going to be a scare, and then it finally comes. This film is the first horror movie that I've ever seen that I believe deserved Oscar nominations: costume design, cinematography, and Daniel Radcliffe for best actor. Unfortunately, with today's standards for the Academy Awards, there is almost no way that this type of movie would be nominated for any type of Oscar, though it certainly deserves it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good popcorn horror with a classy English feel,"I tried to know as little as possible going in, I didn't hype myself up at all, I just sat down and watched (I saw the trailer but that was it) I really enjoyed the film once I got past the fact that Daniel Radcliffe still seemed too young for the role, even with his new sideburns and stubble, which actively grows between shots. There are some genuinely great horror moments, obviously as it is a horror film, great shocks, some nice suspense. But nothing left me rattling with terror or kept me up that night thinking about it. It was a great story, we all enjoyed the story, it was well shot, looked great, great cast to be honest, everybody was good in it, you won't be bored, its a good length...come on guys just watch it.

There are definitely scares and jumps aplenty.My only complaint is that I felt the plot was a little shallow. There were many frightening scenes, but not enough background information, which I felt took away from the overall eeriness of the movie. I had hoped that all would've been resolved at the end, but was sorely mistaken and was left feeling empty and disappointed.Overall, it's a great movie to see when you're alone on a stormy night and feel like being terrified until dawn.

"""The Woman in Black"" shines with old-school thrills and chills","The 2012 British horror film ""The Woman in Black"" (PG-13, 1:35) has a diverse heritage. The basic story first appeared in a 1983 horror novella by Susan Hill. In 1987, the story became a stage play which is still in production and has become the second longest-running non-musical play in London's West End (behind ""The Mousetrap""). A made-for-TV version debuted on British television on Christmas Eve 1989, but made minor changes to the story with which the novella's author took exception. The story was even more significantly changed for the 2012 big-screen version. But the feature film's rich pedigree goes beyond the story's adaptations and changes to the original version. ""The Woman in Black"" is an old-fashioned ghost story which uses low-tech thrills and chills to maximum effect.The big-screen adaptation eliminates and condenses many of the novella's details to produce a tighter story. In his first post-Harry Potter film role, Daniel Radcliff stars as Arthur Kipps, an early-20th century English lawyer whose wife (Sophia Stuckey) died in childbirth, leaving him to raise his now 4-year-old son, Joseph (Misha Handley), as a single parent, but with the help of a nanny (Jessica Raine). Arthur's employer tells the still-grieving and ever-morose young man that his job is in serious jeopardy if he fails at his new assignment – settling the estate of a recently-deceased recluse named Alice Drablow. On the train to the small northeastern English town of Crythin Gifford, he meets a resident of the town named Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds, also a veteran of the Harry Potter franchise) who offers him a ride into town. Arthur's interactions with the locals suggest that this is either the least welcoming town in all of England, or that the townsfolk have a personal problem with Arthur or maybe a bit of both.Mrs. Drablow lived in the large, spooky-looking Eel Marsh House, a mansion that is only accessible by a long, narrow road which disappears every day at high tide. Mrs. Drablow was a widow whose adopted son drowned in the surrounding marsh years earlier, eventually leading her to hang herself in grief. Her house is filled with piles of papers that Arthur must sort through before the estate can be settled and the house can be put on the market. These papers reveal that Alice Drablow's sister (the boy's birth mother who lost custody to her sister and blamed the sister for the boy's death) was a tortured and possibly mentally-ill woman who the locals say haunts the house. They say when someone sees her ghost, a child dies. Arthur doesn't believe in all that (nor does Mr. Daily, who befriends and helps the young attorney), but there's definitely SOMETHING going on. The creeks and thumps that Arthur hears in the old house turn into crashes and screams – and the increasingly frequent appearance of a female figure dressed in funeral garb. Bad things do start to happen in the local area. Arthur has his hands full trying to do his job, figuring out what is happening in Crythin Gifford and stopping it – and doing all this before his son's nanny brings Joseph to the town to meet up with his dad at the end of the week, as Arthur had arranged before he left home.""The Woman in Black"" is a throw-back, both in setting and in tone – but in a good way. The Edwardian England backdrop separates the audience from their modern horror film expectations and the unsettling old-school sights and sounds can still produce effective scares in the 21st century. The movie is scary, but it's also dark and tense, much like ""The Others"" in 2001. Radcliff is convincingly troubled and carries the film very effectively. Hinds is equally troubled, but sympathetic and helpful. The actors playing the residents of Crythin Gifford make for a solid ensemble, their emotions ranging from callous indifference to frightened anger to extreme grief. The titular specter is so frightening and omnipresent that you may end up looking for her in the dark corners of your house. All this adds up to a believable story and a mystery that you'll want to see solved – plus an ending that you'll likely find both horrifying and touching.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
DARK & SCARY OLD FASHIONED GOTHIC HORROR,"Daniel Radcliffe is a superb actor & of Course was great from the Harry Potter films but he's gotten better & better & he's perfectly cast here in the role of a recently widowed solicitor who is sent to a very remote village to check over a huge old mansion of a recently deceased woman.
The recently deceased women is supposedly a terrifying evil spirit who is killing off the small towns children & she's known as THE WOMAN IN BLACK!!!The look of this new Hammer Horror flick is beautifully designed with a thick atmosphere of creepiness & full of Gothic imagery & has totally nailed the old fashioned Hammer Horror look & feel, the Cinematography is beautiful & very Spooky & there's some real scary moments in this movie that did freak me out abit.
The old fashioned victorian production design is gorgeous & the music is suitably creepy & the big old house is Amazing to look at & full of texture & richness in it's thick Gothic detail.
This is a superbly Crafted Ghost story with a standout lead role from Radcliffe who really carries the whole film with his vulnerable & sad performance, he's excellent & the movie carries a deep emotional weight to the story when the Mystery is solved & tje fact the poor innocent village children are made to kill themselves in horrific ways by the Woman in Black is very disturbing & that unsettling feeling is always there in it's atmosphere.
The little remote village live in fear & there's nothing they can do about the evil Ghost that torments the towns people so there's alot anger, sadness & grief that follows the people around & Radcliffe's Kibbs can feel it all, there's something going on & everyone knows bit him & will he uncover the Mystery.

It has so much tension, so much implied horror and some great, albeit too few scares. Radcliffe is excellent in the role, he's sincere and somehow innocent enough to fit the role incredibly well. Plaudits also to Janet McTeer, also excellent.The production values are excellent, it's a beautiful looking film, it's eerie enough without being overdone, we don't have creaky doors or loose floorboards, just the right amount.I thought the start was incredibly chilling, and helped to set the tone.A truly excellent movie, a shame they had to follow it up with the slightly heavy handed second. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The suspense was fantastic, literally on edge of seat behind hands.","Horror is my favourite genre of film, but these days the horror films that are churned out lack the most important thing and thats scares. While Woman in Black won't leave much of a lasting impression on you beyond the end credits, it must be noted that the film does pack a punch to your nerves where other films may just try to gross-you-out.Set in the late 1800's, the film looks stunning set in the dark north of England. The brick work and fog really set the mood, and the under-stated lighting allows the imagination to run wild. The film is directed with a certain flare, the camera is framed perfectly to fill with horrific images and the film is edited so very crisply. The music and sound is also a big plus here, atmospheric and above all creepy. The string orchestration sneaks into the back ground and at the times of pure silence and gentle thudding, it just makes it all the more effective.Though generally good the film does lack a fair amount of story. The first half hour seems rather pointless, and neither builds character nor furthers the story. And the worst of all is the ending, which not giving anything away, was just a little too ""neat"" for my liking. The other problem I had is with lead actor Daniel (Harry Potter) Radcliffe, whom seems to only have two facial expressions. Though he played gormless fear rather well, his chemistry with other actors was non-existent. The worst sign of this is with his young son, there is a major unbelievability for his love for his son and this is fatal in the final moments of the film. Though by and large this is only a minor grievance, as supporting actors are great and the bulk of the films best bits are without dialogue.All in all Woman in Black is a superb horror film, and well worth a watch. It's a nice break to have a horror film, whose interest isn't to splatter blood and guts everywhere. It's the perfect antidote to the Hostel's and Saw's out there.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'll admit I am not really into Gothic, scary movies, so perhaps it was my mistake to rent this DVD. But seeing as this is supposed to be a bit of a classic and it has been on as a play in the West End in London, I expected it to be worth watching. However, I wouldn't waste my time if I were you, unless you want to have a bit of a giggle, which I'm sure wasn't the intention when this movie was made...!",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Great Lead Performance With A Tense Atmosphere, But Falls Down With The Plot-Holes And The Weak Scares That Feel Forced","Pros:
1. The costume and set design are brilliant which allows the 19th century gothic backdrop to not only cement the world-building, but also to add an eerily tense atmosphere.
2. The colour palette helps to convey a cold and oppressive environment.
3. The slow and purposeful camera movements, including the zoom-ins, build the suspense magnificently.
4. Daniel Radcliffe (Arthur Kipps) delivers a great performance.
5. The make-up is fantastic as Jennet (Liz White) looks absolutely bone-chilling.
6. The sound-mixing is incredible which also lends to the fomenting of a tense atmosphere.Cons:
1. The score and loud sound effects are massively overused and they cheapen the scares.
2. The jump scares are often pointless and annoyingly forced.
3. There are a few too many dutch angles that are needless and distracting.
4. There are a couple of plot-holes: A) If the townspeople know of, or strongly suspect, the existence of the curse, then why didn't they move away? B) How did Arthur Kipps not feel Joseph Kipps (Misha Handley) leave his grip and walk away at the end?",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Complete waste of money,"Without a doubt one of the most disappointing films I have watched in a very long time. Hammer came up on the opening screens and I should have realised it'd be on a par with the worst of the Hammer House of Horror trash. Surely film makers can do better than this these days!If it was intended - as I know it was - to be scary, it failed, dramatically. I could (and did in many instances, by the time my partner and I were thoroughly bored of the movie) tell when and precisely where on screen the 'woman' would appear. There were incredibly poor green screen scenes (notably when the main character and his cohort were driving across the causeway) during which it was completely obvious they were in a car, in a studio, and the scenery was green-screened on.And the ending was predictable from the middle, if not even earlier in the film.I've heard folks say this film made them 'jump out of their seats', or even scream. Well if they enjoyed it, good luck to them, but for my money Tom & Jerry is more scary.I fail to see any reason to write anything further as everyone has different tastes and some may well like this abomination.

""The Woman in Black"" was surprisingly good and I was even able to look past Daniel Radcliffe as his former Harry Potter because of the fantastic acting.The story does a good job at bringing chill to the viewer as the plot stays a mystery from throughout the beginning to the middle. Along with the chill, there are plenty of thrills that have you startled here and there throughout the flick. The director does a good job at timing the thrills for the fact that you feel like something is about to happen, but still ends up startling you because it's not exactly at the moment you were expecting.I have to disagree with some of the reviews on here that state that the movies goes downhill after mid way through. I felt as the tempo and chill continues all the way through till the end, and actually thought ""The Woman in Black"" has a decent ending unlike many horror/thrill movies. Again, my opinion but overall thoroughly enjoyed the movie and give it an 8 out of 10.The only advice I would give is possibly wait a week or two to go watch ""The Woman in Black"" due to all the giggling, texting, talking teenagers obsessed with Daniel Radcliffe, who fill the theater for this movie due to thinking this is somehow a sequel to the Harry Potter films.... I can say in appreciation that it's far from the Harry Potter story-line :)",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric and moody Victorian ghost story offers plenty of shivers...,"You have to be in the mood for a good, authentically creepy ghost story to fully enjoy the quiet chills of THE WOMAN IN BLACK. It's only after the story ended that I realized I'd been taken by something I should have seen from the beginning. At any rate, the ending did come as a twist for me--but in view of all the preceding events, it was indeed foreshadowed by information given about the title character.Daniel Radcliffe has to carry the weight of most of the film on his own shoulders and he does a very satisfying job as a young lawyer whose firm sends him on a mission to a remote village accessible only when the tide is low enough to permit horse and carriage to enter. The story depends on the musty atmosphere of a decaying mansion full of shopworn dolls in a nursery where three girls met their fate years ago.Radcliffe's only friendly neighbor is Ciaran Hinds, who helps him get to the root of the troubled village and the death of numerous young children. The extremes to which Radcliffe is willing to go (as in the marsh scene where he recovers a dead boy's body) are improbable, to say the least, but so graphically enacted that you have to believe it. It's one of the most suspenseful moments in the story. Radcliffe is willing to recover the corpse to give it a proper burial next to the mother, whose spirit is evidently haunting the old mansion.The surprise ending fits the story but came as quite a shock to me, although with hindsight I can see that there was some preparation for it if you paid close attention to the script.For lovers of Gothic tales full of mist, suspicion, brooding townspeople and dangerous marshlands, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is your ticket. Good production values are in abundant evidence. Hammer is certainly making a good comeback in the horror genre with this delicious ghost story. Fine cinematography is another big asset.Radcliffe makes expressive use of his penetrating blue eyes framed by bushy brows that confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"The atmosphere is there, but all I get is jump scares, but not REAL scares.","Woman in Black is an old-fashioned horror movie directed by James Watkins and starring Daniel Radcliffe. I've seen many reviews praising that it is very creepy and stylish but I don't think the Woman in Black is made for me.The setting of the movie is around the late 19th century of a young lawyer is heading to a deceased house to sort out some stuff, and then unfortunate things start happening. Something that I like about this movie is its cinematography. Every shot in this movie really make you feel that you're in that period of time. I also like how the director moves the camera from the first person view which it tries to imitate the sight of Radcliffe. You know you are ready to expect an unexpected scare since the camera moves very slow. The house itself is also very terrifying. All of the things inside the house, including the strange dolls and the long, dark hallway all elevate the tension of the movie.I do not mind all of the jump scares in the movie as long as they're used in the right time and place, but some jump scares are just cheap, especially in the first act of the movie. You got crows flying everywhere, or just random noises that just came out of nowhere. Something that I really do mind about the Woman in Black is that I'm confused with what direction it is going. You are been delivered some very creepy atmosphere every time is should be scary, but I think they could've given more especially when this is a slow- going movie, like very stuffy. We got to see Daniel Radcliffe walking through the hallway and exploring every room of this house, but as a whole you don't really get everything from the 25-minute walk-through. For example, you can see the shadows of the woman standing far from Radcliffe but that's all you're given in that scene. It could've given more to the audience. It's not scary to me, but just very creepy. All of the dolls and decorations help to build up the creepy atmosphere but not really a thing just scare you (except the jump scares).I think that Woman in Black could've given as much terrifying scenes as its creepy atmosphere then this movie would just be incredible. Otherwise, the Woman in Black is just a very smooth, stuffy movie that has great performances, moody atmosphere, and stylish cinematography but lacks the most important element to become a horror movie - real excitements. I didn't really mind the ending but after the movie ends, the first thing popped in my mind is sigh... this is such a slow- going and stuffy movie! Maybe this kind of movie isn't made for me I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
mediocre but not terrible,"First off, Radcliffe did a better job than i was expecting, however, a better actor would have improved the movie substantially since his character is expected to shoulder the entire story.
There is absolutely not one single new thing here. The elements of the plot are old and stale, but since the sets and the photography are so good you dont notice too badly.
I cant truly consider this to be a horror movie; there just arent enough scares to qualify it as such. It could be best described as ominous without being truly frightening. There are a couple of jump scares that work well enough though.
The best parts of the movie depend solely on atmosphere, because there isnt enough originality in the screenplay or depth in the psychological elements to make it anything more than mediocre.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Daniel did well and never reminded me of you know who...(HP),"Another release from the new Hammer studios. This is maybe the most look-a-like Hammer so far. Still some will have nostalgia towards the old Gothic Hammers with Cushing and Lee but that's over. The acting done then and the way it was filmed is over.Back to reality. They really made a risk by giving the lead role to Harry Potter, I correct, Daniel Radcliffe. And naturally you will compare it to Potter but I must say that he did so well here and Potter is forgotten. So far so good and I would even go further. This time it was scary. Let me explain. It isn't a slasher or whatsoever, this is a pure ghost story but it do has some jump scenes in it. And I can understand that newspapers were writing about people screaming in their seats at the cinemas. That's because youth thought they were going to see some, sorry, Harry Potter stuff.James Watkins was the director here and I must admit that he knew his stuff by directing Eden Lake (2008), a flick I liked a lot. It isn't fast moving but it got my full attention. It's not a flick full of red stuff it even didn't got any nudity like the old Hammers. I liked it and I guess Hammer did good with giving Daniel the lead. It will attract old Hammers geeks and it will attract Harry geeks.On part of the effects naturally they used CGI but it didn't bother me because we are looking at ghosts. The best Hammer so far, I mean from the new Hammer. But I'm sure it will gave his pro's and contras.Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Daniel Radcliffe is also great in the role of the protagonist, Arthur. It's almost crazy that the movie has such a low rating, while other boring horror movies are considered better than this.

Watchable....,"It is Watchable... It is Daniel Radcliffe.. It is Spooky.. There is nothing wrong with this Film... But having said that... Why watch it... If you have nothing better to watch, okay... Otherwise really it is the same ol same ol.. with no Interesting twist.... Rather dark and somber.. and grim... The Spooky house is good though, and Daniel Radcliff proves he can be more than just a boy wizard! Which I suppose is the point he was trying to prove. Or maybe no one offered him nothing better because they reckoned he couldn't do it. I hope he does get really good roles! There is definite potential lurking around inside him. I wouldn't keep this movie on my favorite collection shelf... but it didn't bore me to death... which is why I am still alive and writing this review! I like the scenery in this Film, very good scenery very nicely shot! They certainly made an effort! The spooky stuff is quite normal and predictable, but they had a very good location - which creeps you out before anything creepy even happens! So 6 out of 10 to Mr Radcliff! I hope he lives long and prospers!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Watch it twice,"The Woman In Black is way better on the second watching. You get past all the dumb ""boo"" noises and really get into the tragedy. Sadly, it's just not very scary. But it is beautifully shot, scripted, and acted. There is no gore to be had, so if that's your thing this isn't the one for you.The Woman In Black is a refreshing break from the thin, uninspired swill that the big movie corps like to dump on us every Halloween. The difference is the pervasive sense of grief and melancholy that is such a departure from the ""jarring"" route that is so well-mapped out. It's easy to make someone jump. It's harder to make someone feel connected to overwhelming sadness. That's what makes this one stand out. Fear is temporary: despair sticks with you.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Brilliant.,"I honestly just thought this film was incredible. Parts of it were absolutely terrifying and I'm not one to be scared by films. I jumped so many times and even screamed at one point. Regardless of the terror it's left me with, I would watch this film again and again and again. Initially I was worried Daniel Radcliffe would portray Arthur Kipps in a very similar way to Harry Potter, but I soon found that he actually has far better acting skills than I realised and I was left in awe. The whole way through the film I was pretty much entranced. Even the ending, which was one I think would usually irritate me a little, impressed me. I'm almost lost for words. All I can really say is that it was amazing and I'd recommend it even to the wimpiest of people!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Decent Horror Flick With Some Spine-Tingling Moments.,"Containing Some Spooky and Spine-Tingling moments, The Woman In Black is a decent horror flick with a matured and good performance from Daniel Radcliffe(his first lead role after the harry potter series) topped of by good and spooky background music which makes this into a decent movie.The Story which is based on the novel written by Susan Hill, is about a young lawyer who travels to a village for a work, and stays at a big spooky mansion, only to realize that the mansion is haunted by a vengeful spirit of a woman. After he realises about the woman, mysterious death's begin to occur in the village, and he decides to find out the solution to get rid of this woman spirit.The Acting by Daniel Radcliffe Portraying Arthur Kipps is good and matured and he does a very good job in his first lead role after harry potter, along with decent performances from the rest of the cast, specially Roger Allen who portrays Mr Bentley and is the only friend of Kipps in the village.A Decent Job from the director in making this movie, specially helping Radcliffe with his role and also looking into the other aspects of the film to make this into a decent horror flick. The Story is quite good and scary at times, but does become a bit illogical at times, but well done to Jane Goldman for writing a good screenplay, and also a good story by Susan Hill.The Cinematography in the movie is also good and the early 1900's Britain is shown very well and also the spooky places shown in the movie is good,and a job well done to the cinematographer. The Background Score in the movie is also very good and spooky at times, good job by Marco Beltrami to synchronise the scenes very well with his music.Well, You cannot expect spine-tingling moments throughout the movie, but horror movie lovers will find this quite good and interesting, as an interesting story and spooky and spine-tingling moment make this into a decent flick.My Rating: 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good but Radcliffe does not yet have enough maturity for this role.,"Daniel Radcliffe has definitely grown up from his days as Harry Potter but I question whether he had grown up enough for this role.The film is very good on the whole and is very much the sort of horror film I enjoy, lots of things to make one jump but without the boring and unnecessary gore.I think that the scares were well placed and sustained, with good timing but they would all have worked just as well with any other actor.It cannot be denied that Dan is a good actor but I did not think he was ready for this role; he does not yet appear to have the emotional depth or maturity and probably not enough experience of life to play the part of a young widower with small boy very convincingly at least not yet, and this film could have been so much better with a more mature actor.A good effort but he is trying to run before he can walk.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Hammer House of Horror,"Years ago I saw the long-running play of this film but so long ago as to forget almost everything but the scary face of the Woman herself, so it was great to sit in late of a night and let Hammer films scare me once again with a traditional haunted house tale.Shot in a washed-out, almost monotone kind of colour - scheme, this was a well-paced and beautifully filmed movie, in particular the house interiors and the spectacular views of the desolate, tide-covered road leading up to it. Daniel Radcliffe returns to the supernatural to play a recently widowed young solicitor tasked with investigating the papers attendant on a recent death at said house, only this time he has no magic powers to assist him. In truth he's way too young for the part, especially with a five-year-old looking son in tow, but he otherwise cuts an effectively gaunt figure facing up to the enmity of the village for disturbing the old ghost, who every time she's seen prefigures the death of a young child.As is the norm in films of this type, despite experiencing some very strange goings on at his first visit to the house, he nonetheless decides to not only return but to stay over alone (bar an accompanying dog) when he could just as easily have had all the relevant papers transported to the inn where he's staying.Suspense is built up nicely for the fright-scenes with subjective camera shots, flash cuts and an atmospheric music score. There's worthy support for Radcliffe especially from Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer as the wealthy couple also struck down by the curse. It all comes to the boil with an unexpectedly callous but in the end appropriate climax, as you realise that Radcliffe and his son could never be happy as they were anyway.In short, a rattling good ghost story, just like Hammer used to make.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Long Black Veil!,"The Woman In Black is a great little unpretentious spook fest well worth your attention. It has a fine cast, evocatively interesting locations and sets and first rate cinematography. Most importantly director James Watkins has sensibly concentrated on slowly building an atmosphere of generally unseen dread and terror, rather than turning the film into some sort of special effects extravaganza. In this respect the film might be described as being a traditional ghost story, reinforced by the Edwardian English time setting of the piece. But this certainly is not to detract from the quality of this creepy tale of a young, recently widowed lawyer who travels to a remote village where he discovers the vengeful ghost of a scorned woman is terrorizing the locals.Daniel Radcliffe well and truly casts aside his Harry Potter persona to play lawyer Arthur Kipps, still semi-depressed and mourning his young wife Stella, who died 4 years earlier giving birth to their son. The film is centred around his character and requires a great deal of adroit use of facial and body expressiveness, as he is the sole (human) character on screen for long periods. This is a movie, not over-burdened with reams of dialogue. Ciaran Hinds is on hand though, to give fine support playing local landowner Sam Daily, one of the few local people willing to assist Arthur attempt to complete his tasks for his London law firm, despite his family also being tragically affected by The Woman in Black.The film was both a critical and commercial success and I have to admit I'm surprised James Watkins doesn't have a higher cinema profile, having only directed one feature since. He seems to have a strong understanding of what constitutes a good film, with an easily appreciated example, being the inclusion of the sad/happy ending, rather than just going for some sort of shock finale. Watching The Woman in Black may well see you adding a bit of colour to your regular movie diet.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slow start, but very solid, old fashioned ghost story","First of all, forget the rating system on IMDb. I rate by genre. How can I compare this movie to a classic like To Kill a Mockingbird? Impossible. The Haunting (from 1963) would be a TEN in the Ghost Story category. In my opinion, movies like Poltergeist would be a 4, whereas Insidious maybe a 5. I am hoping that there are movies I haven't seen (due to research on IMDb) that would fall even lower on a rating scale of this nature. I must point out that I have NEVER seen a Harry Potter film, so no prejudice here. Except for the aforementioned Haunting, not too many movies would hit the Hall-of-Fame numbers of 9 and 10, but The Woman in Black dares to hand out enough chills and thrills to creep very close to such a lofty ranking. Except for a VERY slow start to the film, this movie ranks right up there with the best that I have seen when it comes to ghosts and spirits. A couple of cheap BOO moments, but that has to be expected. By having the movie take place in the early 20th century and in good old foggy England, you don't have to deal with cell phones and home video to ruin the story. Wait until late at night, dim the lights and get ready to be spooked. Be patient, since the beginning drags a bit and really, the ending could be a bit better, but the middle 70 minutes has plenty of chills. Children over ten can enjoy it, as long as they have been exposed to spooky stories in the past. No sex, no swearing and very mild gore/violence. I'm a bit old fashioned, but I really liked it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Extremely cliché'd, borrows a lot from various other horror movies. Very predictable.",I saw this movie in a theater and so in two parts. There was hardly any build up in the first half and you would almost forget that this is supposed to be a horror thriller. The second half however seemed very rushed as if the director was running out of film. The scare scenes were fun to watch though in the theater with good sound effects but the thing that bugged me was how unperturbed Radcliffe was at each scare sequence. Spoiler: He doesn't even scream once to things that would make me crap myself if I witnessed in real life. I've heard that British people aren't the most expressive and always try to maintain their composure. But this is ridiculous. I expect good horror movies to have a lot of subtle things apart from the scary scenes that stay with you after watching the movie like the 3:00am from Emily Rose or those faces in the exorcist that would pop up for a second. The story in this movie is nothing new and is very poorly made. It's very similar to Sleepy Hollow (not a good movie either). I gave it a 1/10 because I can't believe it's got a 7.7 which made me go see it. The movie should actually be a 3.5 or 4 out of 10.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror

Horror by the Book,"Recipe for a Hollywood horror flick: pick a screenplay with a vaguely creepy-sounding title like The Woman in Black. Be sure the writer included one or all of the following: portraits with the eyes scratched out, little kids' drawings, antique toys, etc. Next, shoot everything at half exposure. Then pick a quiet weekend to release and collect your fifty million dollars. Repeat. It's a racket that works like a charm, and isn't going away until the audience does.The Woman in Black stars 'Arry Potter 'imself — Daniel Radcliffe — as Arthur Kipps, an adolescent English estate lawyer bound unluckily for a haunted house in the boondocks. Kipps' job is on the line, which accounts for his eager beaver attitude upon arrival, and dogged insistence on seeing the property, even against the behest of, oh, everyone in town. You know where this is going.Once inside the isolated island manor, Kipps can't seem to get any work done. A typical sequence of scenes plays out with the protagonist sitting down to study a stack of documents and being immediately distracted by some foreign sound or supernatural happening. And then the investigation's afoot; jump scares abound, though they fall too formulaically to conjure much anxiety or subsequent shock. After all, scares by appointment aren't very scary.The screenplay is particularly disappointing given its author, Jane Golden, who spun genre into gold with Kick-Ass and X-Men: First Class. Too dour to pass as a throwback haunted house flick, and too clichéd to surprise anyone, The Woman in Black is caught in the nebulous nowhere between fun and frightening. Even if her writing were stronger, however, there's no guarantee it would be spared the blunt hand of James Watkins, a director with the finesse of a steamroller.He brings not an ounce of aesthetic originality to the table, imbuing the movie with the same ugly, washed-out palette of six dozen other studio horror failures. The technique is intended to foster a mood, but it's a cheap substitute for good old-fashioned filmmaking. Mood isn't achieved in camera — it's an aggregate of art direction, camera placement, performance, music, etc. The obvious digital look of the film also hampers the believability of its period setting — the turn of the century never looked so bland.Performances add little life to the landscape. Daniel Radcliffe manages not to embarrass himself, and that's being generous. Frankly, it's tough to buy the Hogwarts alum as a dad when he's been playing a teenager for ten years. It's equally tough to imagine him a widower, as he broods with all the emotional turmoil of an Olsen twin. Ciarán Hinds plays Kipps' sole confidant in the haunted hamlet, and fittingly enough, delivers the film's sole compelling performance. Still, his character never goes anywhere, a waste of Hinds' talent.Effective horror is contingent upon a willingness to take the audience outside its comfort zone, and The Woman in Black is too creakily formulaic to creep us out. Because Hollywood is a business, it's more desirable to greenlight a derivative script and hire a yes-man director than to risk something edgier that might not pay off. The cycle continues. The Woman in Black follows that recipe to a T, but there's something lost in translation. Maybe the recipe wasn't all that good to begin with. Maybe the whole cookbook needs to go.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Grim Fairy Tale,"I saw ""The Woman In Black"" on the London stage in 2009. Then, it was a two-man show, although the two men didn't play nearly as many parts as appear in this picture. The sets were very spare and I thought the whole production was a tribute to the ingenuity of the stage director.The movie, however, is like ""The Woman In Black"" on steroids, with many added characters and a great deal more plot than it needed. Instead of creating the terrifying moments in your imagination, this movie is loaded with visual ones in almost every scene. Some are manufactured - movies today like to 'sneak up' on audiences with a sudden apparition accompanied by a sudden blast of loud music, which I feel is cheating. It gets tiresome after a while and I couldn't help thinking they had it right in the play; leave some of the horror in the audience's mind.The mood of the play was of an engrossing ghost story, related by one of the principals who lived it. This movie is a relentless downer - doom and pathos throughout and with no comic relief anywhere in sight. No one smiles or strikes a cheerful note and there is no uplifting message to be found. This makes it hard to find a rooting interest in any of the characters.Nevertheless, if you like scary movies, this one is for you, because it is one of the scariest I can remember. But see the movie first before you see the play, because the play will spoil it for you.",,Anonymous,Horror
Dark Gothic film which may give you the creeps,"The Woman in Black. A dark Gothic tale which uses every creepy trick in the genre and finishes in a plethora of loose ends! The filming, where you can see it, is good. A lot of the atmosphere is generated by the music and loud bangs will make you jump. There are few characters who appear to be sane and the story line takes spite and hatred into infinity. If you know England, the Yorkshire village is filmed near the Essex marshes, which perhaps only have the east coast in common. The village and its people are like in the comedy series ""The league of Gentlemen"". Not much in the film is understated or left the the imagination. it perhaps would have been creepier if it had been. The ending is a bit predictable, fatalistic and expected. The most disturbing aspect of the film, from my point of view, is that superstition, ignorance, spite and hatred are the dominating themes. It wouldn't appeal to a tidy mind. The bereaved hero, Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) has gone to a Gothic house ( which looks like Satis House in Rochester, Kent) to sort out the estate. The mess of papers is never sorted out. The house never gets on the market. Disturbed minds are never sorted out. Wherever there might appear to be normality is an undercurrent of extreme insanity. I really liked the vintage car and the vintage railway scenes, although I am reliably informed that the locomotive used dates from the 1930s not the 1910s. I once stayed in a Yorkshire Inn, which had that kind of atmosphere. I decided to go into the small communal lounge upstairs where there were a lot of stuffed animals around the room, the rain beat against the window panes and the wind howled around the eaves. I put the television on and the film Damon Omen started. I heard an uneven rhythmic tramp on the wooden staircase which led to corridor outside the room I was in. The door opened with a creak. My heart was racing by this time. There stood the black- bearded landlord and it was his wooden leg I had heard on the stairs. We both jumped in surprise to see each other. I decided the warmth of the open fire in the flag-stoned bar and a draught Theakston's Old Peculiar with my friends was preferable to watching Damon Omen on my own that night. I was reminded of that incident when I watched The Woman in Black.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Chasing Shadows,"Greetings again from the darkness. The quest for quality horror films is a never-ending project. Since low budget fright fests are the easiest way to make money in Hollywood, most take shortcuts that leave us feeling cheated. This remake of a 1989 British TV horror film actually has wonderful production design ... the Gothic mansion is a sight to behold. Unfortunately, the shortcut here was a story that offers little substance.Daniel Radcliffe (yes, Harry Potter himself) plays a young, widowed solicitor named Arthur Kipps, who is still grief stricken, and now on the verge of losing his job. He is given one last chance to prove his mettle by going to a remote village to settle the affairs of recently deceased client. His young son (Misha Handley) and his nanny are to meet him in the village a few days later.The local townspeople clearly don't want him there and are constantly trying to shoo him back to London. Of course, no one ever bothers to tell him why they are frightened and why they are so angry with him for going to the old house. This mansion is a work of art. It has the necessary creep factor to star in a real horror film. The furnishings and fixtures and decor are really the star of the movie. It's not giving away anything to say that every time Radcliffe sees this mysterious woman in black, something bad happens in the village.The annoying thing about the film is that whenever we get a chill-inducing moment like a shadow in the background or a figure passing by a mirror, it is immediately followed up by a cheap parlor trick involving a sonic blast of music and an ear-piercing scream. It's as if the director (James Watkins) is convinced movie goers are too ignorant to know when to be scared, so he provides clues to say ""Scream now!"" Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer add a touch of class to the film as Mr.and Mrs. Daily, who recently lost their son. Mr. Daily has found solace in the bottle, while Mrs. Daily teeters on the brink of insanity. My theory that no film featuring Mr. Hinds can be all bad is tested here, and Ms. McTeer was seen recently as the best thing about the Albert Nobbs film.On a positive note, this is a nice transition movie for Daniel Radcliffe. He has quite a career challenge as he tries to break loose of the Harry Potter clamp. He succeeds here with quite a different physical appearance, though he really has little to do but alternate between a distantly forlorn look and peering cautiously around dark corners. A couple of interesting notes: the boy playing his son is Radcliffe's real life godson, and the actor who played Radcliffe's role in the 1989 original is Adrian Rawlins, who played Harry Potter's father in those movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Some Good Atmosphere but Not Enough Scares,"The Woman in Black (2012)** 1/2 (out of 4)Hammer Films' latest about young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) who travels to a small village to close up on an estate but not realizing that the town is haunted by a vengeful ghost who had her son stolen from her years earlier. Now, every time someone sees the woman their child dies from mysterious circumstances. THE WOMAN IN BLACK is almost a good horror film but there were just a few too many flaws for me to completely the enjoy the film. I think there are quite a few good moments sprinkled throughout the movie but in the end there just wasn't enough scares for me to give the film a better mark. I think director James Watkins does a pretty good job with the visual style of the movie and he also manages to build up some interesting atmosphere. The film is clearly trying to be a throwback to those old ghost and Gothic movies from the 1950s and there were countless times where you could feel the fog and atmosphere breathing down your neck. The one issue I had is that the movie was never really scary. Perhaps we've just witnessed too many ghost stories over the past few years but the old-fashioned scare tactics here never really work. The director certainly can build up the jump sequence but I never felt the pay-off was there and several times instead of scares we get those loud ""jump"" scenes where something loud happens and to me this isn't a scare. The performances in the film were all pretty good with Radcliffe doing a nice job with his character as he's able to give it some depth. Both Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer offer up fine support as well. THE WOMAN IN BLACK has a fairly effective, if predictable ending, that almost saves the movie. There's no doubt that those who appreciate those Gothic films of the 50s should be entertained for nostalgia alone but in the end the film still needed a tad bit more.",,Anonymous,Horror

Why wasn't it a big hit?,"I don't know why The Woman in Black wasn't a hit. The studio tried out Daniel Radcliffe's star power fresh from the Harry Potter series, allowing him to headline a movie as an adult. He plays a widower, so those who might feel strange seeing him as a grown-up love interest have nothing to worry about. But he does interact briefly with his young children, so those who want to believe he is indeed growing up can see evidence of that. The film is a period piece, so the Harry Potter audience can still see him dressing in cloaks and using candlelight. It's slightly spooky, adding to the familiar element of witchcraft. So why wasn't it a box office smash?If you care about the plot and aren't just going to see it because you long for more Harry Potter, it's based on Susan Hill's gothic novel. Daniel plays a young lawyer who travels to a small town to look into the paperwork of a local inn whose owner has died. But when he arrives, his reservation has been lost and he's repeatedly warned to leave town. Unexpected spookiness at every turn, he's drawn into the mystery but fears he's in too deep to escape!I really enjoyed this flick, and I went to the theaters to see it with my family on opening weekend. It wasn't gory or violent, but it was certainly scary enough to make me jump in my seat a few times. The mystery element was interesting, and I liked getting immersed in the period surroundings. Daniel Radcliffe took charge of the film and had enough energy and talent to show the world, ""I can be a big star even without those round glasses."" And he looked really handsome, too! This is a great choice for Halloween, especially if you like your thrillers to be more frightening than disturbing.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I'm impressed,"The Woman in Black tells the story of a young lawyer whose wife passes away and leaves him to raise their son alone with the help of a nanny. The lawyer travels out of town to a remote village where he discovers that a ghost of an angry woman is terrorizing the town. More specifically, the town's children. The lawyer attempts to save the town and give this demonic presence what she's been searching for.Visually the film looks great. It's filled with interesting locations, beautiful lighting scenarios and very believable costume design. The look of the film was very intriguing using a sort of haze or light fog over much of the images. You certainly want to know more about the mysterious town and our traveling lawyer. The film was marketed as a horror/thriller which I do believe suits it well. Audience reaction in the showing was through the roof with the film being filled with jumps and jolts from its viewers. The sudden movement and sound kept viewers on their toes and kept them plugged in into what would otherwise be a very slow film. I will even go as far as to say that Daniel Radcliffe did a good job with the script that was given to him. I bought into the idea that he was a father, a lawyer and a very confused and curious man.However I don't believe all of these positive things saved the film from the most important thing; the story itself. The storyline contained so many holes and characters that led absolutely no where. It was one of those films that was building and building and once we got to the peak we realized that the foundation was way too weak for all of that time and anticipation. I would have to spoil the entire film to really get into it, and I just don't want to do that because I don't think its a movie that you should not see. You may love it. It's a toss up. I just wish the plot had a bit more substance and mythology into its main back story and main points.I do believe this will keep Daniel working though. His performance, however not the strongest, proves that he has enough in him to be more than the boy with the scar on his head.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

"True to the book? No, but still a fantastic film.","I had been waiting for the release of this film for a long time, The Woman in Black book, and stage play are fantastic and I was hoping that the film would do both of these justice. And in the main I think it does. The adaption from the original book is rather far off, however the main plot points are roughly similar. Daniel Radcliff as Authur Kipps, I wasn't keen on this casting, a fantastic actor but it seems he is not yet ready to play a married man with a child of 4, 10 for effort however. The supporting cast are very good and it is always nice to see a lot of British talent. It is a step back into the the real meaning of the horror genre, no blood, or gore, but real edge of the seat scream out loud frights, and terrifying imagery which will remain with you long after the film ends. There is nothing revolutionary about this film, and the story does become a little over dramatic at times and I still support the fact that it would have been just as good by sticking to the original plot. None the less entertaining, and well worth a watch, but not for those with a nervous disposition.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""I believe even the most rational minds can play tricks in the dark""","The Woman In Black surprised me as a film. The production design and the general aesthetics of the film, mainly the village and interior of Eel Marsh house were beautifully crafted, and you truly feel transported to a different time.I like Daniel Radcliffe (Arthur), I think he has developed into a great actor far from his days as Harry Potter. I think he can now perform in a variety of diverse roles.Daniel had to shoulder this movie on his own, and he accomplished it. He did look a little young to play a father figure, however, he played a sentimental character who was very believable and one who you genuinely cared about. Ciarán Hinds (Sam) is pretty versatile as an actor, and so he gives a great supporting role.For a film in this genre, it was about what you would hope for, and also what you would expect. It didn't blow me away in astonishment, but it did have its suspenseful moments.Was I interested? Yes. Did it keep me guessing, Yes? Was it entertaining, Yes, Will it be remembered? No. Why? Because it is full of cliché moments that we have seen many times before. Even though some of these were effective in the film, they are not entirely memorable.I didn't have a standout part of the film. It all blended as a solid piece, but it just didn't go to the next level or have any unique ideas for it to become more significant.The ending had a nice twist which was also a tad frustrating however, I don't believe it had the haunting effect the writers, and director were hoping for.I rate my films either 6 or 7 out of 10, because they are quite fun to watch, but leave little else to the imagination, and are not something you generally would go back to after you have seen them once. The Woman in black sits in that category for me. I prefer more powerful, and effective films in the gothic thriller genre such as Sleepy Hollow, Crimson Peak, and Interview With A Vampire.6/10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Harry Potter and the Woman In Black,"Let's face it: The main reason for this movie's success is people want to see Daniel Radcliffe stretch his acting muscles beyond Harry Potter. I happen to be one of those people. I also like a good haunted house story so there were two good things going for this movie. A lot of people told me to go see Chronicle instead but nope, I was determined to see this.The film stars Daniel Please-Don't-Typecast-Me-As-Harry-Potter Radcliffe who must leave his son to go battle a haunted house with a witch and zombie children. It is here where his son draws pictures of his dad never smiling and his dad is like, ""Hey, you're right. I don't smile!"" And keeps not smiling.The townspeople hate him because he doesn't want to be in anymore Harry Potter movies and they even block his path to continue his plot in the haunted house. Once there, a lot of creepy things happen like strange loud noises up the stairs that he must go and investigate.... with a candle and an ax. I mean, this is some loud noises he has to go investigate and what he sees would make me run out of the house like a screaming girl. Somehow, he finds time to sleep which after being terrorized by the zombie children and have scary faces appear at you in an otherwise creepy looking house would probably make me want to catch a few Zs too. Of course it doesn't go very well but luckily he had a dog to bark to wake him up.Woman In Black has plenty of jump scares and tension filled moments. I had to mark the review down because of the ending. It really isn't a bad ending or anything but some of the things that happen seemed either pointless or stupid. Like why lock Harry's friend in a room when nothing was going to happen to either one of them? And to not to give the ending away, but the scene between mother and son: I doubt the mother would be that happy.But one thing I'm thankful for is that Woman In Black was a pretty good movie. I was scared going on, not because I thought the film was going to be scary, but I thought it was going to disappoint me like that godawful Don't Be Afraid of the Dark movie. It wasn't anything like that. If you excuse me, I'm late for Hogwarts.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric and creepy... Definitely not one for the youngsters...,"This film has quite a slow deliberate pace that adds to the atmosphere and suspense of the storyline. It also heightens the effect of the shocks that hit you every now and then. The plot is quite grown up and I have heard it said that when they set the certificate here in the UK at 12A, it should mean 12 and no younger and I entirely agree. There were a few younger than 12 in the audience with me today and I can almost guarantee most of them will be having nightmares tonight. On a personal level, I enjoyed it very much. It has be criticised for there not being enough scares in it, but for me there was just enough (given its certification).

Decent atmospheric chiller,"Having first read the novel and watched a TV adaptation in my English class as a 14 year-old, I had pretty high expectations of this big- screen version. And overall I wasn't disappointed.I felt the film capitalised well on the seclusion and isolation of the town and, more importantly, Eel Marsh House. You really do feel that there's no way out once Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is at the house. The house itself is suitably eerie and has you on edge for as long as Kipps is there.There are plenty of little frights throughout the movie, but I didn't feel this ever became cheap and pointless like so many other films in the horror genre. Indeed, i'd classify this as an honest old-fashioned ghost story more than anything else. Daniel Radcliffe is clearly going to struggle to break away from his earlier role, but I thought this was a step in the right direction. I did actually care about what happened to the character, which is more than can be said for so many lead characters.Where I felt the movie fell down was showing the dreaded Woman a little too much. It's that old thing where sometimes the more that's left to the audiences imagination the better. The setting was definitely creepy enough that they could have left her out of a few more scenes. I also didn't like the very end scene simply because it's not how I would have ended it. You'll have to decide for yourself though.All in all I recommend this as a very worthwhile way of spending a couple of hours.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unfortunate plot,"We've just come too far as a society for this type of film to have any real scare value. So Danny boy is trying to kick his HP days.

There's a creepy house in the middle of nowhere with a bitter old ladies ghost in it. Yawn. Anybody who thought the ending was any good, I simply pity. I'm afraid you have to be on the left side of the IQ bell curve to think that.

Good one - but for cinema experience,"I am 28 & a fan of horror movies & psychological thrillers. I was not that positive to watch a movie with the Harry Potter superstar. But my girlfriend (harry potter fan) urged me to give it go. I had seen the performance in the theater, and I was really satisfied. So, yes, I gave it a go.Pros:1)This plot takes place within atmospheric, dark, old-aged sceneries. Well done. It did put me in it, at once. I really enjoyed all the places the plot unfolded.2)The acting is quite satisfactory. Even Harry. But mostly, the reactions of the villagers, brief and sudden, make u feel wondering ""what is going on here??"".3) The scary moments and atmosphere rocked. Unexpectedly good. I repeat, I am a horror movie fan, and this scared me more than movies like the ""ring 1"".Disadvantages:1) SHAME on those who have a 12+ year old for this movie.ABSOLUTELY SHAME.

Entertaining but Nothing New.,"""The Woman in Black"" is by no means a stroke of brilliance, nor will it really scare you in the theatre or haunt you after the credit roles, but as far as good 'ole ghost stories go, it's a pretty good film.Based on the 1983 book by Susan Hill and a remake of Herbert Wise's 1989 film, the story is about a grieving widower, a lawyer named Arthur Kipps, facing severe financial problems, who must take leave from his son and attend to the estate of a deceased woman, only to find her property to be the source of much fear in the small town in which she resided. As Kipps begins to discover as the secrets hidden in the history of the family which lived in the home, he learns that the threat of a ghost and its ties to the death of numerous children may very well be more real than he had feared.The film features some interesting yet clichéd bumps in the night, but under the direction of relative newcomer James Watkins, ""The Woman in Black"" does unfold in a nice, well-paced, terribly creepy manner, although does not really bring anything new to the genre. The inclusion of uncensored death of children is somewhat of a refreshing twist (usually such stories try not to make death of non-adults nearly as graphic) but overall, the film is not going to go down in history as a brilliant twist on the genre. I give it credit for not having a stereotypical ending and the film does include some seriously beautiful cinematography.As for Daniel Radcliffe? In his first post-Potter role, many are commenting on the fact that he didn't really stray as far away from his well-known past as much as he should have, but not being a terribly big fan of the Potter films, having thus seen only the first three, I think Radcliffe does an excellent job here. I did not feel that I was watching Harry Potter for the length of the film and, hey, for the first time ever, there were moments that I thought Radcliffe was actually, dare I say it, looking kind of sexy. With his very expressive face, no doubt honed through many a take on previous sets in which he needed to exude fear, he portrayed the downtrodden and almost helplessly sad Kipps with almost mathematical execution.""The Woman in Black"" may not be the dawning of a new age of ghost stories, but it does prove to be a great spring board for Radcliffe as he dives into the next phase of what could be a very impressive acting career.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Thriving on the dark and scary,"Brilliant acting by both Daniel Radcliffe but also the rest of the cast and crew, this film is really thriving on the dark and scary mood of all the characters, some are angry, some are scared, some are helpful, but they all live with the fear of the unknown, of what is have been and are happening at the village and the house.That being said, this is a somewhat classic horror film in many ways, the dark and shadows play a big hand in the settings, the creepy slow music and noises play with your mind and the glimpse of something that might or might not be there gives your eyes something to look after. When it all plays together as it does in this film, you get the thrills, the jumping moments and the creepiness and that is what defines a good horror flick.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A chilling ghost story!,"I was looking forward to seeing this movie as I have read the book and really enjoyed it, so I was very interested in seeing how they would translate it into a film. Woman in Black did a really good job at keeping the tone of the book all the way through the film, and I do think that is the most important thing in a book to movie adaptation. There are some quite big difference between the events that happen in the book and the events that happen in the movie, but I appreciated the changes as they made it an all round better film. People seem to forget that if a film kept 100% faithful to the book that would not make a good movie, so I had no problem with any of the changes the film made.Overall Woman in Black is a chilling film, it kept great suspense throughout and had me on the edge of your seat waiting to see what was around the next corner.

Daniel Radcliffe bids adieu to Harry Potter persona,"One thing comes out of your mouth, when you see Daniel Radcliffe as Arthur Kipps and that's- WOW. I thought it would be very weird to see Daniel as somebody else other than Harry Potter, but he played Arthur Kipps quite brilliantly. Although, he is still very young and didn't look like a father of a 4 year old, but, what matters is acting and that he did quite well.This movie is a remake of a 1989 movie of the same title. I didn't see the old flick. But when I saw the reviews of the old flick I wanted to see it. But, I thought it would be wise to wait for a few months, as I knew the remake was going to be made.The movie was good, it was not stupid and gory as nowadays horror films are made. It was a good scary movie with a fine story and nice (it seemed reasonable to me) ending. It relied on good acting of Daniel as well old fashioned scary moments.I was looking forward to see this movie, as I wanted to see how Daniel would come out of the Harry Potter persona. He did it quite well actually. Normally, if an image of a particular actor is built, it becomes quite difficult for him to break out of that image( All the characters of FRIENDS look stupid in anything other than FRIENDS). But I think Daniel is a fine actor and he will go a long way.It is a nice old fashioned horror movie, which will be liked by the people who are not amused by stupid gory flicks.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

A decent return for Hammer but take 2 stars off for the UK version,"To start off I'd like to say how annoyed I was to find out that the producers of this movie where so eager to put their greed before art in insisting om making cuts (essentially making the film less scary/threatening) in order to make this a 12A film in the UK. What they failed to see in their blind rush was that certificate probably put off a lot of adults such as me from watching the UK version. I could go on to say that I think certification these days is almost pointless but this is not the place. Take two stars off for the heavily cut UK version.Fortunately I was lucky enough to see the US version of the is film. I was happy to see a return of Hammer Horror at last and this was a decent, if not great edition to the collection.Good stuff:It is quite scary and their are a few really good jump out of your seat moments. It's not overly long and the story moves along briskly towards it's end.The setting in history is a good one (I mean if that had a been a torch our hero was carrying and and not a lantern it would not have had the same effect) and the set design, wadrobe and even the countryside all fit well to a feeling of foreboding horror.Bad stuff:As many other's have pointed out Radcliffe is too young for the part really and his acting skills and his accent are a little clunky at times. Especially when he's the same scene as the excellent Cieran Hinds. Radcliffe obviously brings along a fan base but I hope in future Hammer take a bit more of a risk and perhaps use lesser known actors without baggage.It's scary but not terrifying, opting for 'jump' moments which can become a bit of a gimmick.All in all it's a solid 7 movie. I hope future Hammer productions take more risks and stray from this path of safe and certainly profitable productions. Of course they need to make money, but horror films can make money by trying new ideas.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chilling !!!!,"Woman in Black , directed by James Watkins , based on a novel by Susan Hill is a scary , you-name-it horror-scenes thriller which is sure to keep you engrossed in each frame coupled with a very well written story. Aurther(Daniel Radcliffe) is a struggling lawyer who has been given a last chance to find out about the unknown will of a deceased woman Mrs. Drablow in a remote village. The moment he reaches the village, he finds weird thing about village and its inhabitants. The villagers don't want him to stay around when they realize about his investigation to the strange house, far away from the village, in the creepy island. Sooner, he is assisted by Simon Daily (Ciaran Hinds) who is the only person in the village to solve the mystery of killings of children due to strange appearance of a woman in black in that house The Woman in black , a remake of a 1989 TV movie of same name, was an outstanding thriller that is sure to give a chill down your spine. The new time director, James Watkins, handles the story very efficiently. The 90 minutes flick helps to keep your attention in each frame. I would like to mention couple of scenes including the one where Aurther moves to top floor to find about the movement of easy chair and the one where he takes a nap in a chair and gets up being shocked by the barking of his dog. The Cinematography is brilliantly executed displaying the European country side effectively. The background is haunting that gels well with the movie. The dialogues are impressive. Art direction is splendid. We have known Daniel Radcliffe for his Harry Potter series but believe me the actor has shown lot of promises apart from his magical tricks. He completely carries the film solely on his shoulder. Ciaran Hinds does good job in the supporting role. On the whole , The Woman in Black provides ample scary moments which will keep you on the edge of the seat and is sure to keep you engaged throughout the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Nutshell Review: The Woman in Black,"Is there screen life after Harry Potter for Daniel Radcliffe? The answer is a resounding yes, going by how the actor has now matured and is able to carry an entire movie on his own, and better yet, having extended scenes with nothing else but his character on screen the entire time, groping in the dark, figuring out what's lurking behind sinister shadows, looking afraid, yet resolute in sticking to what he's been tasked to do for family.The Woman in Black, based on the novel by Susan Hill and is still an actively staged play, has more working for it than just Daniel Radcliffe's singular presence on screen. It's adapted for the big screen by Jane Goodman, responsible for adapting some of the best, in my opinion, stories in recent years such as Stardust, Kick-Ass, The Debt and X-Men: First Class. And director James Watkins may only be one film old, that effort was the remarkable Eden Lake, and he follows up that horror effort which was more slasher, with one that's more ghoulish here. I suppose having a strong story, which kept to its spirit (pardon the pun) rather than to follow verbatim, worked wonders, and Watkins pulls out all the stops despite having to dig in deep from the bag of old scare tactics and tricks.Radclife plays the lawyer Arthur Kipps, who's given one final chance by his company to prove himself by heading out to a remote village to wrap up the paperwork for a, well, spooky mansion. A widower, he reluctantly bids his son farewell, and hops onto the next train hoping everything could be completed in time for the weekend, where he can be back in London to spend quality time with his kid. But Murphy's Law means that desire never really got fulfilled, as Arthur takes it upon himself to find out what exactly was going on in town when kids happen to die during his visit, with the villages adamant that he packs his bags and head home.And with kids dying and dropping like flies, it got really creepy from the get go, where three girls inexplicably take off from their attic window, complete with eerie sounding music, and scary looking toys that seem to be popular items used by the art director to pepper the set with. And as a friend puts it, one can't really go wrong with haunted mansions, as we get one main mansion and a few other for red herring fun, but nonetheless having them milked for light and shadow play to perfection, complete with long dark corridors, creaking staircases, and a beautiful marsh in its immediate perimeter that isolates the house from civilization when the tide comes in. And when Watkins amplifies the horror quotient from the midway point with Arthur single handedly exploring what's behind some fast moving shadows and whispering noises, be prepared to let out a little girlie scream now and then, because such scary moments catches you offguard even though you're primed with anticipation of the usual tricks that come out of the bag. They all worked quite effectively to make you squirm a little in your seat.The Woman in Black isn't all just silly scares with little substance though. At its core it wrapped things up pretty nicely in a sort of bittersweet fashion, and given its success at the box office, a sequel has recently been announced. The strength comes in the characters and their potential in adding a lot to the plot, such as Ciaran Hind's rich landowner Mr Daily, and his wife (Janet McTeer) who goes into a trance, seemingly possessed by their deceased kid who communicate through his mom. Mr Daily on the other hand isn't quite the believer despite the strange incidents happening around town, and proves to be quite the reliable ally for Arthur to maintain his sanity. As already mentioned, Radcliffe's Arthur will draw you to his cause as the man who's backed to a corner professionally, and having supernatural disturbances is the last thing he needs to derail his putting food on the table.What also worked in the film's favour is its period setting, which somehow provides an additional dimension to the level of creepiness throughout, with plenty of shades of black and grey. The art direction is superbly handled, as is the cinematography and its score by Marco Beltrami, where without these strong technical attributes, The Woman in Black will probably pale in comparison to its film peers. It isn't everyday that a horror film has elements that clicked and don't come off as silly, so if you're in the mood for a little creepiness, then this film will undoubtedly and should be your choice.

The Power of Silence,"I recently developed a list of qualities a good haunted house should have.Leaving visitors with an unnerving sense of ""something is not quite right here"" was one of them.The film adaptation of ""The Woman In Black"" has this unnerving quality.Horror isn't, as most reviews on this movie will agree, the use of gore and violent death, but the anticipation built from not being able to define what it is that doesn't feel right at the moment.A majority of this movie isolates you, which is a key component to building that feeling of uneasy anticipation.Coupled with isolation, the film also harnesses the power of silence -- a power so deafening that at the appropriate moments, even the faintest of sounds jolts you into a state of paranoia.In addition, this film makes great use of background action and imagery. While you generally pay attention to the foreground, there are moments where images and action in the background (if you are paying attention) can freak you out (a la the famous ghost boy in the background of a scene in ""Three Men and a Baby"") If you prefer your horror movies to affect you on a mental and visceral level than a visual level, then this is the movie for you.If you prefer slasher films, don't even bother.",,Anonymous,Horror

This Quasi Scary Movie Disappoints With Predictable Scare Tactics & Undeveloped Plot,"If your looking for a decent, scary movie that does not rely on gore and violence then it does the trick. The whole movie has potential with good acting and a spooky Victorian setting. As the movie progresses it never really shows any depth in the story and seems to only rely on jump scares to get a gasp from the audience. I found myself disappointed at the end of the movie even though it did its job of being a scary movie. There were multiple areas of the plot that could have been explored more.This is one of the few times I did not agree with the IMDb rating it received. It is a rental movie and not worth seeing at the theater.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Dimmly lit snooze fest, literally almost fell asleep multiple times","First off, this movie probably would've been more entertaining if Harry Potter was the main character. It's not like we weren't all picturing it already as we watched this, and honestly I would have rather watched the boy wizard romp around looking for clues to the ghostly mystery than watch boring Arthur Kipps try to. I was so excited to see this movie, as the trailers looked genuinely creepy, the set design looked spot-on, and I was intrigued by Daniel Radcliffe playing anyone but Harry. What I thought would be a dark throwback to the classic haunted house ghost stories of old indeed was just that, only a very poorly executed one. This movie really is just one big waste of a plot, a waste of the cast and crews effort, and a waste of my (and everyone else who went to see this snooze fest)time.The plot is an awesome classic horror movie plot. A young businessman travels to do business, and in the process discovers strange occurrences in and around the house in which he is saying. He soon learns of the history of the town, and sets out to put all the pieces of the puzzle together. Yep, I thought it sounded entertaining too. It first hit me about 20 minutes in, when I began to realize I had been watching Radcliffe walk around since I sat down. Yes, it really does take a good 30 minutes before anything remotely interesting happens. And from there, it only continues to drag along at a snails pace. The scares are effective at points, weak at others. I was genuinely startled only twice the entire movie, and had trouble staying awake for the duration of it. This was the result of a combination of the near pitch-black lighting of the film and the crawling, dragging, stagnant pace of it. Also, stick-in-the-mud Kipps might possibly be the most uninteresting protagonist in horror movie history.All in all, this movie is a waste. There is nothing positive that I can find to be said about this film. The only bright spot is the beautifully creepy house, the set design really as a whole is exceptional. Also, the movie shows that it is capable of inducing fear, but chooses not too in favor of jump-scares and quick disturbing images. The horror genre has reached a new era. The era is dominated by the found-footage sub-genre, and there has been a found-footage flick for just about every plot. I thought The Woman in Black would be the film that revamped the classic era, the era of straight up creepy ghost stories/haunted house thrillers. In reality, it was the film that made me lose almost all hope in the current state of the horror genre. The ideas are clearly running out, and I'm afraid that the genre might be on it's last legs. I hope I'm wrong, and that this film is simply a mishandled mistake and not an omen for whats to come for the genre. One things for sure though, The Woman in Black is a poor,poor film, and will soon be forgotten about and disregarded.Overall: 2.5/10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pleasantly surprised,"I'm not a fan of horror, but this was fantastic. I needed to watch this for work, and really enjoyed the plot, having seen this on stage, I knew what to expect, but the way it was delivered was creatively done. There are many sound effects and musical elements of this film that I'd love to explore, they really help build the tension and guide the scenes. The characters explore and deliver the text very well; I was left on the edge of my seat until the very final scenes. Very moving, very clever.Daniel Radcliffe has shown himself as a real talent in this film, taking away the previous casting of Harry Potter, this shows how he has grown as an actor.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Daniel Radcliffe Shines,"This movie felt like a test. I had to use up so much of my energy to not make Harry Potter jokes throughout. I failed. I couldn't help but hear EXPECTO PATRONUM echo in my head every time the dementor-like woman in black appeared. The very last scene of the movie is so similar to a scene in the last Harry Potter movie that I couldn't help but laugh.Despite the typecasting, Daniel Radcliffe did brilliant in his first big non-Harry Potter role. He also shows something that many of the Harry Potter actors have started to prove—they know which scripts to take. This movie would have been great with any actor. With Radcliffe in the lead, however, it gave a unique perspective on the story that made it much better than I expected.For a horror-flick, the director has to be good. With James Watkins, this movie was destined to be great. I lost count of how many times I jumped with fright. At first, they were cheap shots. As the movie progressed, however, so did the creepiness. The anticipation builds so well during several parts in the movie that you can't help but jump. I hate to admit that, just seconds before a terrifying moment, I couldn't help but close my eyes.The down-side of The Woman in Black is in the structure of the storyline. The setup and eventual conclusion of why the woman in black does what she doesdoesn't make sense. It works well for the effect of creepiness. But when you honestly look at it, it doesn't work. As the movie concludes, it only gets worse. The final scene leaves so much more to be desired.If you want a scary movie, this is the one for you. This is the best horror I have seen I some time. You will jump. You will regulate your breath with excited anticipation. You will be pleasantly surprised at Radcliffe's abilities as an actor. You may not be satisfied at the end, but the journey is more than worth it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Harry Potter and the Ghostly Drivel.,"Because of the excellent job she did with Kick-Ass, I'd forgiven screenwriter Jane Goldman for the absolute drivel that was Stardust, but The Woman in Black has just put her in my bad books again, a more predictable, pedestrian, derivative and utterly boring ghost story it would be hard to envisage. Likewise, director James Watkins, who impressed me so with his superb debut Eden lake, hasn't exactly gone up in my estimations.For those who grew up with Radcliffe as Harry Potter—a demographic most likely still fairly unfamiliar with the horror genre—this might succeed in coming across as both original and scary, but trust me when I say that everything in The Woman In Black has been done many times before, and often much better. In particular, I was reminded of Ghost Story (1981) and Dark Water (2002), although the tricks employed by Watkins to scare his oblivious young viewers have been pilfered from numerous other films. As for the dumb ending.... always hold on to a young child's hand when on a station platform—it's as simple as that!The fact that this nonsense was filmed under the Hammer banner makes me want to cry.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"If you want to watch a jumpy horror film, watch this","What a film. I went to see this 2 weeks ago with my friend, and to be honest it has to be the jumpiest film I've seen. The film itself is disturbing, there is one part where a girl set herself on fire. It has a lot of intense parts, and when the Woman in Black hovered over Radcliffe screaming her head off, I couldn't look.If you want to watch a jumpy horror film, definitely watch this.I don't think this should be a pg-13, either. There are disturbing scenes that I was even scared of.Overall, I would give this movie a 8/10, as this film is sometimes predictable but unbelievably scary and intense.",,Anonymous,Horror
This one is for Teenagers. My cousins LOVED IT!,"""The Woman in Black"" starts off by setting a mood, a Gothic mood, a creepy mood, a strange mood, but as you begin to understand just what is going on, you begin to let go of Harry Potter, and just allow the picture to entertain you.It is about a lawyer played by Daniel Radcliffe who has had a terrible loss in his own life. His tragedy has effected his performance at his work and is on his last warning. He embarks on an interesting journey to research the death of an entire family in a recluse house that hosts its own graveyard, and woods. The house is separated from town by an area that floods during the high tide and is also a murky, mucky, black, dirty, swamp of sorts. He is there to investigate the estate but soon realizes that the townsfolk isn't too fond of his presence. After this, the scares start to jump out from everywhere. If you love those sorts of movies and enjoy Pg-13 trillers, then this is a great movie. If you are looking for Daniel's escape from ""Harry"" then you may want to wait for a later film since this film doesn't really allow him to improvise because of the straight forward, linear, style of directing. The shadows are realistic, the lighting is dark and the picture is desaturated. The desaturation is a good choice, but in my opinion, I would have been more interested in this film if it had been done in black and white.There are some good memorable parts so I give it some credit for doing some things I have never seen before. Decent entertainment, but not for the adult crowd. I would take my 13 year old to it, but 17 and up might be disappointed because of the lack of horror.The acting by Daniel hits the mark, but the character he plays is just not that interesting, but he is on the other hand very good at being what connects the younger viewers to the scares. But where I think the film detaches itself from the audience is where it uses visuals instead of on screen emotion to scare the audience, let alone allowing the audience to put their own emotion into the film. The Gothic, semi-monochrome style of the film doesn't do much in the way of telling the story but does add to the dreariness of the setting. And that is where the film sets itself apart from others.Overall, don't expect much in the way of thinking here and it is really is not for the horror fan. Although I would recommend it to the teenage crowd looking for a scary ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Horrors of the Uncertain,"When it comes to horror movies nowadays, many fall into a deadly trap that has consumed and utterly destroyed the horror movie territory. In earlier years, horror was viewed as a distinctly frightening genre with the movies using slow-building tension and creepy athmosphere to make you scared of what's to come. Horror movie filmmakers have entered the Jumpscare territory in which this ""true"" horror is removed in favor of sudden noisen and views that negates all tension. Thankfully, despite its few shortcomings, the Woman In Black directed by James Watkins based on Susan Hill's 1983 novel of the same name manages to be a solid ghost story told with a bolt of efficiency.
Perhaps the single greatest element this movie offers is the lead performance from Daniel Radcliffe, an actor who was made forever famous in the Harry Potter movies. He needed to find a way to take off those glasses and move on and thankfully he delivers a bang-up performance that really made this movie a joy to watch. He is also accompanied with a pitch-perfect supporting performance by Ciaran Hinds who plays local landowner Sam Daily.
One thing i will also give this film is its disturbingly creepy setting that is litterally one of the creepiest horror movie settings we've ever seen. A house isolated on an island that is partially flooded and removed from land, surrounded by a graveyard and a killer bog. The house itself is a living example of a horror movie house, its large and nearly in ruin and has a dark history behind it.
When it comes to the scares themselves, this film is not short on fitting scares. Although there are a few cheap jumpscares here and there, this movie excellently builds up horror and suspense to make for a very unsettling and uncomfortable experience that really irches to the bone. The film genuinely feels like a horror movie.
The titular character herself is of course a solid antagonist, she is distinctly creepy, doesn't make many unnecessary appearances and has a great backstory to her that while meaningless gives some weight to her existence.
The music for this film is also creepy as all hell but freakin amazing, as it fits the tone of this film brilliantly.
When it comes to issues, this film isn't flawless. My biggest flaw is perhaps the final act of the film which seems completely pointless when you figure out the outcome of it. The story feels a bit uncertain on how to wrap up this film and inadvertently sets up a sequel in the end, which was released a couple of years later.
It does follow many horror movie cliches and isn't exactly the most orginal film in the world either.
But as a horror film, it delivers what it should deliver and is overall a solid experience.

Wasted Potential,"Overall I had a hard time fully enjoying The Woman in Black. Its atmosphere is fantastic, its set design and cinematography are lovely, the acting is solid, but the experience is brought down by few major flaws. Among them being a fairly well-tread story and some disappointing shots.To start, what The Woman in Black does extremely well is immersing you completely in its deliciously drab universe. The old mansion where Daniel Radcliffe's Arthur Kipps spends the majority of the film is dressed expertly with creepy antiques and a large helping of cobwebs and dust. The way the house is filmed as well serves to bring it to life in a big way.However, the life is taken right out of it when every single suspenseful shot and every spooky sequence is ended with an entirely predictable jump scare. When you know exactly what (and when) something is coming for you, there's not much left to really scare you. Moments of very clunky and expository dialogue can take you out of the experience as well.So I guess if you're in the mood for a beautifully filmed ghost movie, give The Woman in Black a try. Just don't go in expecting anything ground breaking or particularly scary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well done Asian horror... by the British,"If you take The Ring, replace the maltreated girl with a desperately insane mother and lose the whole tape/TV connection, you get something really close to The Woman in Black.The film started a little bit like Dracula, with the legal clerk coming to a remote village to put some papers in order. It appears that even ghosts hate lawyers, so it all gets messy really soon. The actors were decent enough and the film spooky, but the thing that bothered me most was the cheap scares: sudden loud sounds, screeching ghosts appearing in reflective surfaces, the really old and annoying ""something moving in my peripheral field of view"" and the ending. Not the ending ending, but let's say the few minutes before the ending. It felt so fake.Bottom line: a classic (and by that I mean filled with clichés) ghost horror, with Daniel Radcliff finally shedding that Harry Potter adolescent off his casting persona in the lead role. It's not what was in the film that made it average, but mostly what wasn't. So much potential and what they end up doing is an Asian horror with a British accent.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Radcliffe / Potter - more wooden then a forest of trees!,"Watching Harry Potter- SORRY Daniel Radcliffe I was reminded on the old spitting image sketch about Roger Moore.In it The Moore puppet's only facial expressions for all his emotions was either one or the other eyebrows lifting.It appears young Mr Potter / Radcliffe prescibes to the same ""method"" acting school of thought. The guy just CANNOT do emotion!!!With the sound turned down you cannot tell if he is happy, sad, angry, afraid, or indeed whether he needs the loo! To say his acting is wooden is doing an injustice to trees! I'm sure he tries hard but he simply cannot do emotion. He is trying to play a grief stricken widower, but you can't help yourself thinking 10 points to griffindor! He has made multi multi millions from that franchise, so will never have to worry about working again, which is just as well as from the basis of this pile of horse's business, he is going to find it hard to get work!

The revival of Hammer horror  production,I was very curious when I have read all the positive reviews here. Then the trailer promised an interesting ghost story too. The most important expectation for me was to see Daniel Radcliffe in his first adult role in a horror movie. He made a good job. The other reason was how the new Hammer house produced this creepy thriller. It was no doubt very convincing showing very original sceneries with chilling atmosphere. The haunted house was very mysterious. All filled out with outstanding cold colors. The script is okay and the running time just perfect. What I and my wife didn't like therefore was that children are shown in a very poor aspect. You will understand when you'll have seen it. Be prepared to a very unexpected end that I want not to spoil out here. The music from star composer Marco Beltrami was excellent. Don't miss it. 6/10 because my wife gave 4/10 concerning the children and me 8/10 .,6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A chilling old school horror,"So what this mostly will be remembered for is as Daniel Radcliffe's first post Harry Potter project. Which is a bit disrespectful to what is a, quite chilling decent horror movie.Based on a Susan Hill novel of the same name, the film follows a young widowed lawyer played by Daniel Radcliffe called Arthur Kipps, who is essentially on his last warning at work and travels to Eel Marsh House to look through the papers of the late Alice Drablow. he experiences resistance from the local and glimpses of a woman dressed only in black. Daniel Radcliffe is adequate in his role continually improving in all his films. As he was no acting child prodigy that's for sure. The film does feel very accurate to the time period. With the house used in the film being very creepy and suitable perhaps being the star of the show. Also because of it's inexperienced star the film very much does rely upon supporting characters especially good were Ciarán Hinds who plays a man in denial about the myths until evidence becomes to much to deny, and his wife played by Janet McTeer who is still grieving over a lost child, really competes with the titular character for creepiness.A couple of things that do work against it, is the film does not seem very original. with it's scares and story line seeming to be well trodden paths before. Also is very well telegraphed before it happens of how the movie will end lessening it's impact quite a lot.A decent horror with a adequate amount of scares. Which turned out to be a smart interesting choice by it's star.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
good old fashioned stuff,"its always hard to regain success after you played 10 years the same character. as Radcliffe did in Harry Potter.but Radcliffe does a pretty good job here, even its not really about him. Meaning the movie would be as good without him.cause the film goes more in the direction of old mystery horror movies. and thats what i liked about it. at least its a horror movie with scary moments, and not just bloody tortures as ""saw""....or such movies. And it doesn't has a typical Hollywood-ending.rest of cast, camera work and directing are good to very good.for me one of the best in that genre over the last couple years.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Make sure you have enough headroom for jumping out your seat!,"Personally, I hate Harry Potter, so it was with some trepidation I decided to see this film, but I'm so glad I did.It was very refreshing to see a horror film that went back to the old values of making us jump and avoided the more current trend of throwing buckets of gore at the viewer. This was a traditional horror that played more with our senses, expertly throwing something frightening at us in subtle ways that caught us of guard, so that even when we anticipated a jump to come, we were still caught out by the direction in which it came. This was mainly due to some expert direction in the cinematography, having different camera angles suddenly showing us something that a previous angle failed to pick up on even though it should have done.It takes a lot to make me jump, but there were at least two occasions where I shifted in my seat and uttered a profanity! Go see it... you won't be disappointed. :)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Harry Potter and The Woman In Black,"I was bored to death by this movie. If you have seen The Ring and The Haunting you have no reason to watch this movie because it has basically the same plot twists. Oh, and its another one of those movies where most of the dialog is practically whispered so you turn your volume up but then anytime a scare happens it is ridiculously loud just to scare you more. This is cheap and it seems more and more movies are competing to have the loudest jump scares. Just a regular old music sting has worked just fine for years, but these days it has to have a giant BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMZZZZZZ to be really effective. I have no idea why Daniel Potter chose to do this movie other than a paycheck and getting to hang out on the many cool sets. I must say though that it was beautifully shot. 6!",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Better than I expected,"'The Woman In Black' genuinely is a really good film, it's had a lot of publicity but for all the wrong reasons.It is Daniel Radcliffe's first film since the Harry Potter series ended and his performance is good, he doesn't stray too far away from Potter but there are interesting aspects of his character in this. For a start he is a father and is overall shown to be gloomy. I can't tell by Radcliffe's performance in this film alone if he will successfully distance himself from Harry Potter and be seen as a serious actor from here on. I think he will need to spread his wings a bit further if he wants to get rid of his type-cast. We will need to see some more future performances before we can tell. His and the other acting performances in this film were great.The acting is overshadowed by the frightening aspects of this film, the director and scriptwriter have done well converting this novel and play into a film. There are moments where it can be very predictable which is my main problem with this film, although there are points where you do not expect to be scared or to jump so the film can catch you by surprise occasionally.The ending is another problem I have but that is more to do with the story itself and is not really the film's fault so it's irrelevant. Overall, I would recommend this film if you are a fan of horror or thriller films and like films full of suspense. Don't watch this if you frighten easily and do not like films which make you jump.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Chilling and unnerving,"The Woman in Black as a book is one of all time favourites, a chilling story written by Susan Hill. For this adaption to be a success it had to stay true to its source, and for the most part it did. Watkins did leave out and tweak a few things, for the better? Im not so sure, however as it story it was still rewarding. As for directing, he managed to replicate many of the chills through atmosphere and general spooks. They were a little cliche but as good as it possibly could get. I thought Daniel Radcliffe did well in his role although not overly convinced. Without reading the book I feel this movie will come across as very generic and predicable but I felt it was still chilling and unnerving.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Unimaginative. Not worth watching,"The setting for the movie is a spooky old house in a very strange village. Yeah the atmosphere is good but that's just about it. The acting doesn't get any marks either, although not awful you can feel they just don't feel the dread... as you aren't either. But the plot is even unworthy mentioning. It's the old classic ghost story with a vengeance killing innocent children in the process because she lost her child. Really stupid plot that would be barely OK in the 50's not in 2012! Completely unimaginative with a couple of screams to shock the most fainthearted and that's just about it! You will find no suspense and no horror here and really not worth spending your hard earned money to watch it. I admit I am not going nuts over horror movies because mostly they are just plain stupid but I enjoy good one's. This is ain't one of the good one's!

A kind of good Horror Thriller,"Rating-7/10The Woman in Black is a horror film with bags of scares, screams and good old edge of the seat moments, maybe the scariest thing ever but still can send chills down your back(and that's just the bleak setting of this film). With a good cast that deliver it well to the story which seems like it would be so much easier to predict than it was, you can really enjoy this film to the max and if you kind of forget a little of what the more in depth stuff, it is enjoyable anyhow. I felt this was strongly a kind of good film and here is why below.The story is really quite well done with scenes being done well and the pacing never really picks which pace it wants to go at, but it works out well in any sense. I felt the plot is as said previously kind of one you feel will be easily predictable, now it isn't that hard but it isn't easy and makes for a good mystery story surrounding the going's on. I also did like the way the bleak setting makes the story even better, with a small village who's population know something is wrong, but have no idea behind the real truth of it all, just fun stuff.Daniel Radcliffe attempts to throw the cape of Harry Potter of his shoulders and start a new film career away from the series, and he does an OK job with a solid performance, not always good but a good start after such a long series for him. Supporting cast do a good job and with some lesser known faces involved, I commend the film for branching out with it's talent scouts. Ciaran Hinds is at his best as ever and although I felt could have been used slightly more in scarier moments, still manages a good performance here.Written really well with a script that sometimes can be the focus of times, the film isn't afraid to leave the more thrilling moments to pursue it's dramatic interests, and the script helps greatly with making them scenes bearable. I enjoyed the bleak locale with darkened houses and the sun never quite seems to shine, it sets up very well for the even darker house that Radcliffe finally encounters the Woman In Black, very scary looking indeed so commendation to the costume department indeed.The film does hold back when scary and sometimes isn't that that scary, it is however not too bad and mostly is genuinely frightening but some bits seem to obvious. You could say it just follows the plot of the similar horror movies we see and it kind of does, although as said hard to predict, the set up and even the ending are more staples in Horror movie film. Finally here I will say the film needn't not introduce Radcliffe's back story so much, and even though it isn't bad, it can take up vital scene time as the movie is quite a short one.Horror movie fans will enjoy this with it's scarier moments but may not enjoy the more dramatic scenes, but horror fans who like a deep and dark under story should enjoy this very much so. I have seen Harry Potter fans parents complain it is too scary, just a note, this is not Harry Potter and not near it, Radcliffe is simply hanging his boots up and moving on with his career, and he does a pretty good job here if truth be told.Overall I will give it a 7/10, a Strongly Pretty Good movie with not that much room to grow, but nevertheless the job it does it fine enough to make an entertaining piece. I did at parts feel underwhelmed and maybe wanted the movie to just finish, but once you firmly get your head into the plot, you can sit back and enjoy the story and horror. One last thing is that this movie is genuinely scary and will thrill you, so watch with your eyes glued to the screen for maximum scare factor.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Simple, quiet but creepy harshness to a classic horror","I went into ""The Woman in Black"" thinking it was going to be a dramatic thriller along the lines of ""Martha Marcy May Marlene"" or ""Take Shelter"". But it turns out to be a classic horror. Better than a Hollywood horror movie, at least it's a British indie. Set in the late 1800s in a haunted house, the film thrives on the austere harshness of the small town, the house and its inhabitants.We have one main hero, Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe), who has to leave his young son and travel on business to take care of the final papers of a deceased woman and her lonely old house. The house is literally haunted with shadows of disquieted ghosts and creepy deaths of young children. The overblown score will tell you when to get scared. Some of which were reasonable startles to have in a movie, but towards the end most thrills were visibly ridiculous.The only interesting direction the film takes is never having Arthur doubt himself. He knows what he is seeing and he's going to get to the bottom of it. The reason that character works so well is Daniel Radcliffe. He's good for the film, and the film is great for him. He has a very quiet demeanour and a very earnest, steadfast approach. This keeps the film simple and gives a power to the actors. One which Radcliffe competently displays.Everything and everyone in the film is haunted. The title tells us, and prepares us for, one of the illusions, which I thought was good. Most of the other-worldly hallucinations or actions were just to increase the creepiness factor but don't give any insightful interpretations. But then again, I don't particularly like horror movies; only when there is an element of reality to the thrill.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Successfully Creepy,"My expectations for 'The Woman In Black' were neither high nor low, and I was curious about Radcliffe's first non-Potter performance. He surely did a good job, might not be the best actor out there, but he did well in this movie. In addition to trying to keep us back from thinking about Harry, the role itself was another challenge for Daniel as it was mainly focused on his character and he handled it well, even during the several minutes when the film flows without one single word. His moves and expressions did the talking through those parts, if I may say so. Sadly, not many 'new' actors manage to use body language these days, therefore hats off to Harry -oops, Daniel, I meant. As for the movie, it's good. It doesn't necessarily make you sh!t in your pants, but keeps you concentrated and tense through the whole time. For a story adapted from a play, it has a perfect flow and makes sense overall, something that doesn't always happen with these kind of thrillers. It's creepy in a good way, contains almost all of the classical aspects without making it too cliché or boring. Most importantly, from first moment on it makes you feel like you're gonna flinch any given moment and this is done professionally, with the background music, the very successful movie-set and good directing. The ending is also good, and does not disappoint. All in all, The Woman In Black reminds us that ghost stories can be much more attractive than the recent blood-full, poor plotted so-called horror movies.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Wow, I am very impressed.","To sum this up in a really quick description I would say, this movie has the classic horror movie essence with sleepy hollowesque cinematography.I went into this movie with really low expectations. It was kind of a spur of the moment decision for a quick date night movie that I had to choose. I was browsing around Fandango and was immediately drawn to it simply because Daniel Radcliffe is in it. I was excited to see he was doing something else new and different from Harry Potter. There were definitely a few parts in it where I couldn't get past him being Harry Potter. Certain words he would say or a certain way he would look just takes you back to Harry. This however did not ruin the movie at all for me.I grew up watching the good classic horror movies with my dad. So, naturally I feel pretty desensitized from scary movies. This one however, had me really scared. Did it leave me with any sort of lasting impression, not really just some really weird nightmares the night I saw it.Daniel did an excellent job. Granted he isn't the best actor but you can tell he has grown up from his Harry Potter days. His use of body language was amazing and really helped to tell the story. The cinematography was wonderful. It really captured the time period and the foggy creepiness of England while also getting really beautiful shots to depict the English Countryside.Overall, I would definitely go see it again and buy the movie. It is definitely worth the $10 ticket. If you miss the classic horror movies go see it. Finally, a horror movie that does what it supposed to do. It wasn't lost in gore and blood. The simplicity really makes this movie amazing.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Enjoyable in part, but undermined by the end","I don't often watch horror movies, but this was an exception. I don't dislike the genre, I just prefer others. However I had heard good things about this movie and was able to watch it for free so I sat down with some friends and gave it a try. For the first act, I enjoyed it quite a lot. The lead character, played by Daniel Radcliffe, is by far the strongest part of the movie and as the entire first act was focusing on his characterisation I enjoyed it a lot. Daniel Radcliffe was perfectly cast in a refreshingly different role for him; he was realistic enough to believe and a well written character for the purpose of the story. My only gripe is that there were a couple of false notes in Daniel Radcliffe's acting which stood out once or twice, but nothing big. The rest of the cast is agreeable as well; the only other main cast member, Ciarán Hinds' Sam Daily was believable and did his job well, even if his character lacked an interesting enough arc.A major issue with this movie is that it is traditional and clichéd to a fault. The characters are very traditional to such a horror movie (there is of course the frightened locals and the sceptical rich guy who won't believe a word of ghost stories), and there are also the traits and clichés that you might find in any 90's horror movie. The third act is especially weak. It becomes unbearably traditional, in that it lacks originality. However the worst part of the movie by far is the extremely poor ending that not only undermines the rest of the movie but makes everything up to that point look weak. It's over the top, very predictable and perhaps even silly. Still, at least the movie doesn't bore.There are a few other ups and downs about this movie. There are some genuinely effective jump scares, and some good set pieces that work well to create the mood. The writing and directing is good enough, but nothing special. The soundtrack is good and sticks out in multiple scenes, and thus lifting the movie somewhat. Finally there is some poor editing (in particular in the sound department) that needs to be fixed, but nothing too big. In the end you will probably enjoy the majority of this movie, which is helpfully lifted by Daniel Radcliffe, but even he can't save some of the movie's flaws, in particular the very weak ending.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Do NOT waste your time!,"I was not expecting a milestone or impressive story/movie, but this movie is below the ""average"" level for me.The story line is shallow, the ""horror"" moments looks quite poor and cheap. I do not know how much they spent for the movie but they should not have!And also I have no idea why Daniel Radcliffe has accepted the offer after the series of Harry Potter. It is disappointing to see -let's say- a ""promising"" actor in this kind of amateur movie.Even though the director James Watkins had a great job in ""Eden Lake"" in 2008, this movie is not even remotely as original as ""Eden Lake"". I guess J Watkins is quite dependent to the book rather than creating his own movie. There was this movie he had written: ""My little eye"" in 2002, but that one was far more amateur (microphone was visible in some scenes)Now, I feel like I spent my 90 minutes for nothing.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
VERY disappointing - Don't believe the hype !!!!,"I gave this film a 3 out of ten and that is being generous for my standards. I don't comment on a regular basis but just had to say my piece 'out there' for people to see. Having waited months since seeing the first trailer I was so excited to get hold of this film and when I read the reviews on here - well I thought all my Christmas's had come at once........how wrong I was :(There is a slightly eerie atmosphere within the small village where events keep happening but as far as anything else is concerned I felt like I was watching a PG film. The few 'jumpy' scenes were predictable and there just wasn't enough to the film in general.........oh and it takes an hour to even start to get going.I feel very let down with this film, if you want to see something scary watch Insidious !!!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Harry Potter can act!,"This movie did not disappoint. It has been a while since I did the covering of the eyes while peeking through the fingers and this movie had me doing it! The story was unique, they took a haunted house and gave it a twist. The ending I think didn't really go along with the rest of the movie, it were as though they couldn't think of how to end it so they just went with a crowd pleaser. Still, overall the movie was thoroughly entertaining, good, clean, scary fun! As for Daniel Radcliff, I was curious to see if outside of his Harry Potter role how he would do and I thought he portrayed the lawyer very well. I was very impressed by the overall cast who all contributed to making this movie enjoyable.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another lousy remake. What else to expect.....,"There is a horrible disease running rampant in the film-world, and there seems to be no cure: The re-make virus. The absolutely disgusting recipe? ""We will try and fix that which isn't broken."" As far as I'm concerned, there has only been one necessary remake, and that is the first The Hills Have Eyes. Besides that, what the is wrong with the dimwits deciding to do a remake of films that in no way or form can not be bettered? The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?!! Ringu?!! A Nightmare On Elm Street?!! And the list and the madness goes on forever. And of course, some moron decided to do a remake of The Woman In Black, the original being in my book one of the scariest horror-films I have ever seen, genuinely chilling.This one? Ha, ha, what a joke of a film, lo and behold a big budget and zero scares, sounds familiar? Where the original had such a creepy sense of foreboding and doom throughout, not caring to explain every single detail ( I guess a moronic audience needs everything to be spoon-fed to them ) and thus leaving the mystery intact, here they have gone for cheap shock tactics, your run-of-the-mill dead children running about, a rewritten and overly fleshed out storyline, and last but not least an ending that is pure crap. And Harry Potter as Arthur? He still looks like he is 15, so no, not believable in the slightest. Bottom line; if you are 14 and your sad life as an idolizer revolves around everything Radcliffe does and says, and this is your first scary movie by all means, this is right up your street. Drool and **** your pants at the same time! If not, and you actually are a grown-up with a well-developed taste and sense for horror, watch the original. End of.",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good spooky  movie,"For all mystery/horror/suspense fans this would be very good flick. It has a lots of scary moments and was acted and directed well. The only think I may complain is a script. It could've been I guess a little bit better. Somehow a basic topic about ghost vengeance is too many times used in this kind of genre and recycling over and over again. Someone may think it was the point of this movie but where is originality? There are about 10-15 minutes in continuity without any spoken word as well but filled with spooky thrills. The end was maybe a little unexpected but I think it came too early. Whatever, give a chance to this movie and watch it and you may like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Gothic Ghost and Haunting Story, with Daniel Radcliffe","""The Woman in Black"" (2012) is a Gothic suspense-horror thriller, directed by James Watkins (writer and director of Eden Lake), that passes in the early twentieth century, in England: it is the story of a lawyer, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe), who lost his women in the birth of his boy, now age 7, and that are depressed ever since.After the death of an elderly woman who owned a secluded mansion in the middle of a marsh, in a rural English town, he has the job to arrange the paperwork, in order to sell the house and moves there to deal with it.From here begins the story that unfolds from the occurrence of sinister events, and the villagers strange reactions, who fear a superstition that curses the village.The film is well done, visually, has a sad and gloomy, dark atmosphere typical of Gothic-themed movies. There's no abuse of special effects or blood, and the film relies more on the atmosphere of suspense, until the end of the movie.I just noticed a inconsistency in the filming, when two characters are driving, in a open car, and the hair of the characters do not move - after that I noticed no other gross errors.The music, which only appears discrete and pertinently, and the sound effects are good, and helps to compose the general atmosphere.What stands out in this movie is the performance of Radcliffe, beginning to get off of his eternal role of Harry Potter: his acting in the movie are very good.The main story unfolds gradually as the secrets of the house, the legend and its ghosts are explained until the end of a film that follows and the Gothic style ending.Just as a note, the film is based on the book by Susan Hill, written in 1982, which has the same name, and has the same story, but with modifications in the sequence of events and the ending.Overall is a good movie to pass the time, being a good classic tale of Gothic horror-thriller, related to ghosts and haunting, but nothing that really stands out among the many films that exist.My score: 6.8 / 10.0.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Under rated & Aesthetically Pleasing,"Flashback to 2012, the Potter fandom was still dealing with the end of Harry Potter. Woman in Black came along as Daniel Radcliffe's next big movie. So as many other Potter fans, I just had to support him. I was still sensitive to the horror genre as I have become seriously desensitized since, so this new scary movie was exciting for me. And it did, indeed, scare me big time - scared of the dark, running to and from the bathroom if I had to go when I watched the move after 10 pm, the whole shebang. After over 10 years, does it still hold up?Actually, yes. The visual aesthetic of the film is pleasing between the lighting and colors. The set design and the costume design add to this as well. I could actually compare it tot the setting of Sleepy Hallow, just in a country-side-of-England version. The story itself could also be comparable to Sleepy Hallow through story as both tales have that local folk lore ghost story vibe that I love so much. The story of the Woman in Black herself is well written.And while I'm a bit stronger against silly jump scares and what not, I still think people can find this movie scary. Jump scares are effective and even the subtle creepy moments spook me still. None of those climactic scare sequences did much for me. But the all the scenes taking place in the Marsh House were mostly well executed. The music is excellent and Daniel Radcliffe as the main protagonist gives an emotional performance that I very much enjoyed to watch. Over all, I would say Woman in Black is a bit under rated and can actually fit well into any Halloween marathon.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
It's kind of what you expect.,"When you watch the trailer you get a feel, an impression, of what this movie is going to be like. Sure there are some creepy parts and a few gotchas that make you jump. However the connection to the story just isn't there.I know this was based on a novel, and like many great novels this probably was not translated into film well. Though I have not read it myself, I can strongly suspect that is what has happened here.There is a trend in horror movies as of late that is more disturbing than the movies themselves...they aren't scary. Just because you have a ghost doesn't mean that they have to resemble every knock off Japanese ghost from the Ring to the Grudge...and everything in between. We've seen those type of ghosts before. We need something different, something original. Perhaps Hollywood is all out of ideas. Perhaps they are all out of disturbing.I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because it was exactly what I expected it to be. It wasn't worse than I thought, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised. I like Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter. He is familiar and in time will be a better actor, but this wasn't the movie for him to show his acting chops.I guess to sum it up, my 7 year old fell asleep in the first twenty minutes. When I was 7 and watched a scary movie I was scared witless...I couldn't sleep and probably woke my Mom and Dad up throughout the night.It's what happens when they try to cram same ol' same ol' canned horror movie stuff into a PG-13 rating. If they had a rated R to work with it could have really helped by giving them something to work with. Alas, their philosophy is better to sell a few extra tickets than to produce a quality product.With all that said...the movie was OK...and worth a watch if you happen to catch it with a free Redbox code like I did.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrific and frightening ghost story,"Horror is my favorite genre and I've muddled through many more stinkers than not. The Woman In Black gave me more chills than any movie since The Exorcist. I watched it late at night by myself and I was hugging my dogs for security. Combat vet here. Very spooky and the scares are done right. The setting on the little island adds to the atmosphere of fear and loneliness.I wish that we were able to see a flashback of the the antagonist during her mortal life. If I recall correctly, we only hear her voice when the lawyer is reading her letters.The main character does remain abnormally nonplussed at times and the ending is somewhat saccharin, but I can forgive these perceived faults for an otherwise scary and thoroughly enjoyable flick.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A really good film. Don't let the 12 rating put you off.,"THE WOMAN IN BLACKThis is a very good movie. I fully expected to see it and think it was not very good, but it was a pleasant surprise.The movie is about a guy who has to go and sort out the paperwork at a house where the owner has died. The problem is, the house is haunted. Because he has entered the house, the ghost is taking revenge on everyone in the town.The trailer always interested me with this movie, and seeing as the legendary Hammer Horror company did this film, I had to see it. 2 things were on my mind when I went to the cinema to originally see it. First of all, the movie is a horror film but is only rated 12... how could it be a horror? It is very psychological. There is not much scary to see in the film, the whole thing is in the atmosphere in the movie. Secondly I thought, can Daniel Radcliffe get past Harry Potter with a career? Can he really act? Well, the answer to both questions is a big yes. Daniel acted very well. I thought he did a brilliant job and hope to see him in more roles in the future.The horror element obviously wasn't that scary due to it being a 12 rating, but I did like the woman in black character. She was very subtle in places and when she crept up on Daniel, it was creepy.The acting was great by everyone. The movie stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciaran Hinds & Janet McTeer.This film is best watched with all the lights out in the dark and the volume up high.The effects are very good. The ghosts looked great and were all very spooky looking.I will give this film 7 out of 10.""I believe the most rational mind can play tricks in the dark.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
"A Predictable, Overused Concept","The premise of this film and story is about a ghost with a score to settle, terrorizing all those who enter a Gothic, uninhabited mansion separated from the town by a lake where the tides cut it off from escaping from it at night. This is very much like the concept of the remote hotel located in the snow covered mountains, cut off from civilization by snowed in roads in ""The Shining"". Except Stephen King is a master writer and a master of horror story telling, which is much better than this film or story. This film, set in the early 1900's, even with it's macabre and evil setting, backed by grey skies and even greyer landscape, is nothing more than ""bump in the night"" predictability layered through-out the film. The expectation that the lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe) sent to this home to sift through papers left by the dead occupant to settle a last will and testament, is going to encounter some scary stuff is just what it is; some run of the mill scary stuff one can see coming a mile away. The horror is overt and placating. The mystery is missing. It's expected. The plot line is thin. A long dead woman whose son had tragically died in a sunken vehicle and been left at the bottom of a marsh, meandered through the dark hallways of the house and cemetery outside to threaten anybody in its path. As the story progresses, until the dead son is retrieved from the bottom of the marsh, the spirit cannot rest. The plot finally settles in on the lawyer attempting to accomplish finding the dead son, as a result of some very astute detective work, as one would expect, in establishing exactly what the problem was. Again, its predictable, its too long, and if you want a good film with this imitated concept, watch The Shining. Its a better bet for the money, and surely will scare the hell out of you.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Understated chills,"A laudably understated adaptation of Susan Hill's celebrated Gothic chiller, The Woman in Black tells a simple but effectively spine- tingling tale of disturbing events at an isolated village in early 20th C rural England.There has been criticism in some quarters of Daniel Radcliffe's presence in the central role as casting too young. I'm not buying this. In fairness he does have relatively little to do for much of the short running time beyond looking somewhat perturbed. But his portrayal of a young, but tragically bereaved husband, somewhere perhaps in his mid- 20s, is convincingly depicted with a gaunt, withdrawn look and meekly shuffling persona. The problem, I believe, is simply the difficulty that audiences are having in seeing past the familiarity of Harry Potter as an adult in any movie. This perfectly solid performance will hopefully be a significant step in gradually recalibrating audience expectations for his future career.Complimented by some pleasingly underplayed supporting roles, and top- notch production design, especially the deserted and overgrown manor house at the centre of the story; this self-consciously old-fashioned ghost story comes across rather like a particularly fine and visually lush BBC period literary adaptation. It won't break any new ground in the annals of horror movie making, but it is a solid reminder of just how satisfying understated chills and unsettling atmosphere can be.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Another vengeful evil spirit,"Even before J K Rowling started work on her last Harry Potter novel, questions were raised as to what lay ahead for Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. For child actors who grew into immense fame and fortune overnight, industry pundits have assumed that the trio would need more than a magic wand to woo audiences that are not Harry Potter fans. To his advantage, Radcliffe appears to be burning bridges between Hogwarts and the real world that exists beyond. For his first major role outside the highly protective dome of a $7 billion (global box-office) film franchise, Radcliffe may be on the right path to disproving the theory that child actors seldom make the transition from juvenile charm to crowd pulling adult stars.Set during the early 20th century in Edwardian England, Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer haunted by the tragic loss of his wife during childbirth. Struggling with this troubled past and stress from his law firm boss, Kipps is sent to handle the estate of the Late Alice Drablow. Before Kipps has a chance to recover Drablow's last will and testament, he is intimidated by townsfolk who consider his arrival as a bad omen. Sure enough, bad things start to happen, including apparitions of a woman dressed in black and the mysterious death of random children. Along with his only friend Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds), Kipps digs deeper into the unknown before arriving at a perilous yet shocking revelation.In keeping with the genre, director James Watkins' final product is nothing new with a central plot that appears to stem from a cross between ""Friday the 13th"" and ""The Ring"" – both horror films with a central theme of malevolent vengeance. That being said, pivotal to the fright factor is Watkins' use of perfectly timed suspense. Even so, predictability is on a tight leash, allowing the viewer little chance of preparing for a frightening moment. My only problem is that these moments, though scary, are few and scattered. Although this may have been intentional, it's fair to say that pacing and a darkening tone more than makes up with never a dull moment. The story is also engaging right from the very first scene and it soon becomes clear who the woman is black is. Central to the plot, and the mystery, is why she does what she does and the motive behind her evil vengeance.Shouldering the bulk of the story, Radcliffe is not exactly phenomenal, but neither does he stick out like a sore thumb either. If this movie is any indication, it's safe to say that Radcliffe has broken free of the Harry Potter mold with distinctive promise as an up-and- coming actor. On the other hand, as a horror film with a supernatural premise, there is more to be desired. For a remake adapted from Susan Hill's novel of the same name, this film offers some truly jumpy moments by trading chilling atmosphere in favor of intentionally pulling the rug under the viewer. Not to say that this film is completely void of a creepy atmosphere, its just that Watkins seems to have placed all his chips on fright tactics rather than focusing on making the entire film a disturbing experience for the viewer. This becomes evident right from the start and each time you jump off your seat, it's like hearing a prankster say ""gotchya!"" Towards the end, I was starting to get an unnerving feeling that Watkins intended to terrorize the audience more than central characters in the movie. Fair enough for a horror movie, but you'll get my point with the very last scene, echoing the words ""you're next!""",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good ghost creeper,"Ever since his introduction as Harry Potter from Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001), Daniel Radcliffe will forever be remembered as the child actor who grew up to play Potter all the way to adulthood. Since the finale to the franchise, Radcliffe has been working at his very best to lose that image. With that, he officially displayed this to the public with the release of this ghost story. Although it is not a far departure from the genre Radcliffe originally started with, it shows that he started gradually. The Harry Potter series was not horror related but it did have spiritual entities from time to time. This story is along those lines too but with a much darker intent.Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a widower of one son looking to keep his job at a tough law firm. When given one more chance to maintain his position at the firm, his task is to finalize the latest condemned house in a marsh. Turns out this particular house has a secret only the townsfolk seem to know about and do not like talking about it. For Mr. Kipps, it'll be an eye-opening experience he did not see coming his way. The only person kind enough to help Kipps is Sam Daily (Ciarán Hinds), one of the wealthy men of the area who provides what feels to be a foil to Kipps'. Kipps believes that spirits possibly exist, while Sam doesn't. Yet, even with their opposite views, they are both likable characters. This is where the writing succeeds in developing its protagonists thanks to Jane Goldman, who also wrote Kick-Ass (2010) and X-Men: First Class (2011).Plus, James Watkins' direction lets the characters explore other avenues of solving certain issues differently than normal. Also there's the chilling background about the house in the marsh. Its story is tragic and unsettling. And how about that set design and camera work? Both go hand in hand. Tim Maurice-Jones' cinematography looks authentic with its backdrops and every picture has a very gray look, which not only matches the time period of this story but also sets the tone. Every color looks drained and almost to the point of ill. Kave Quinn's set design for the house is just too good. The entire house is that of what would look like if you returned to a house after two or more decades. Dusty, full of cobwebs, rickety floorboards and strange sounds. I get goosebumps just writing about it.Marco Beltrami's score to the movie was also well thought through. Arthur Kipps had his own reoccurring theme and there was barely a track in the album that contained stings - which is nice for once. Frequently this is all the horror composers make in their scores and it gets not only repetitive but also tiresome. Beltrami comes up with some very creepy tunes. The only issues that arise in this movie are a few things. For one, pacing is a bit slow. This doesn't affect the overall flow but there are certain scenes that just feel like they drag sporadically. There's also continuity errors with which belongs to events that happened at a certain time. Specifically talking about how fast a body decays; the process of decay is slow but under certain conditions I'm sure the rate changes,...in this movie, it didn't seem to acknowledge that. Not too big of a deal, but it could make viewers curious,...briefly.When it came to the horror elements to the film, there wasn't much at all specifically because of its PG-13 rating. But even for it's rating, it did have some very dark moments that were intense. The Woman in Black is not any better than Mary Shaw from James Wan's Dead Silence (2007). Nooo. However, along with that came the most cliché of horror movie tropes - jump scares. There are several moments where these particular jumps happen. Some work, while others don't. As mentioned before though, composer Marco Beltrami didn't include the stings in his album and that's appreciated. For horror movies, directors have to come up with some type of way to be either more creative with their jump scares or not use them at all. They are really becoming overused. As an overall experience though, it is a well made horror film that should be scene for any fan of the genre.As one of the first movies Daniel Radcliffe doesn't play Harry Potter, he nails his part in this chilling ghost story. It has well-rounded writing, good music and even decent horror elements for a PG-13 movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fantastic Thriller/Horror!,"Fantastic movie all around, I was very impressed. Nearly everyone in the theater jumped right out of their seats. Daniel Radcliffe was very believable and great to watch. The Woman in Black is delightfully creepy and I will have nightmares for a few nights I'm sure. The movie gets right to the point with a great story and great characters. Not slow moving at all, I jumped and screamed like a girl nearly every 5 minutes. Not a cliché or stereotypical horror. The story was quite astray from most horrors and left a MUST SEE ending. The villain in this story is quite sinister and leaves a chill to the bone every time she appears. There was a serious, terrifying tone throughout the movie that never lost its touch. The movie setting was fantastic; every house, person, toy, or object was creepy and sinister. Some of the best characters I have ever seen in a horror movie. Also, horrifying sound effects were played throughout the movie, some that seriously bothered me and scared me out of my mind. To reiterate, Daniel Radcliffe did a superb job in acting believable as a non-Harry Potter character. Overall this movie is definitely worth the money to see in theaters, the experience is fantastic!

Frights that taste like antiquity,"The Woman in Black comes from the past, in any sense. From the best selling book by Susan Hill, written in the 80s, it tells a ghost story that accurately respects the ancient tradition of the genre. The attempt to bring to life this kind of novel, about ancient manors and ghastly appearances, might, at a first glance, seem rather risky and unnecessary. This is definitely true if we think of the nature of the movie that, in fact, does not bring any new innovation to the genre. Fortunately, if we focus on the way the movie is made we may find lots and lots of reasons to watch this movie.First of all, the 19th century atmosphere of the Woman in Black completely swallows you up. Many times, while watching the movie, I totally empathized with the protagonist. I cannot tell whether that's good or bad, as in many cases I was glad I wasn't really in the protagonist shoes. The whole setting (costumed people included) is so well-created that every time manages to make you feel anxious/worried/scared according to the circumstance. This is one of the greatest points of strength of the movie.Secondly, the movie knows how to scare you. I am not claiming that it will give goose-bumps even to the bravest man on the earth, but that it successfully manages to give you a general sense of sickness by an intelligent use of every detail present in the movie. And here we have scary dolls, frightening toys, spooky objects. All of them accurately created, aimed to make you feel uncomfortable and worried. Of course, this may vary according to the type of watcher but I really appreciated the way the fear was orchestrated.The most appealing feature of the movie is, undoubtedly, the presence of Daniel Radcliffe. Daniel's interpretation is highly satisfying and provides us with a great expression of his real talent. Along with all the other remarkably capable actors, he's exactly what we expect from a movie like this.Finally, even if you're not particularly fond of ghost stories, why don't you give it a try?",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Good movie,"In the 19th century came the novel ''The woman in white '' and in the twenty first century comes the movie '' The woman in black '' , and predictably its a horror movie---horror movies being the favoured flavour of the 21st century as much as suspense novels were of the 19th......But as if in tribute to '' The woman in white '' , there is a considerable amount of suspense mixed with the horror too......And to lift the lid off the suspense comes the hero---Daniel Radcliffe-- -from London to a small English village , as a representative of a law firm sent to handle the sale of a remote house situated in a marsh .His sheer presence in the village is unwelcome to the villagers , as he discovers.....and his trip to the remote house is even more unwelcome............For the house has been struck by tragedy , as he learns , and anyone who goes into the house is liable to encounter a mysterious woman in black there , who brings revenge-laced tragedy in the village anytime anyone sees her.......Dismissing this stuff as superstition , he goes to the house alone--- only to be confronted by the sight of that very woman , and also a series of mysterious happenings......Now I myself don't believe in ghosts , but I wouldn't dare go to such a remote house alone , and certainly woudn't dare to stay a full night alone there---especially after encountering such dreadful happenings......But nothing's gonna stop our intrepid hero---after he hears every mysterious sound , he actually follows it ; after he sees a terrifying sight or sees a shadow , he lights a candle and goes after it....... What would have left us breaking out in cold sweat actually rouses the curiosity of this young man as he searches the whole house going deeper and deeper into the mystery.............And as strange happenings and piercing sounds emanate in the ghost ridden house , we are left squirming in our seats cursing the hero for having the chutzpah to wander in such a terror inspiring place and increasing our blood pressure , when if confronted with such a situation we would have taken to our heels at the first opportunity.......But our hero's daring does pay off---though at terrifying cost as his sighting of the woman in black sets off more tragedies in the village . But he thinks he discovers a way of ending these tragedies as he gets what the woman in black wants for herself......So does the hero succeed in his self-appointed mission to save the village ?? Go and watch the movie for that---it does give you some real jitters along the way......But the ending is a tragic and a disappointing one---one is left wondering why the woman in black was not less rentless in her pursuit or revenge than she was , and why she was so cruel..... Why didn't she have some more womanly qualities ??---That of mercy , that of forgiveness...... Or maybe that was the mistake of the film's director.....Verdict---inspite of the flaws , its still a good one.....",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Nothing Special,"Ghost Stories have always been my absolute favourite sub-genre of Horror. On that account, I've watched dozens of them, any film I could get my hands on. Judging from my personal experience and subjective preferences - The Woman in Black had never had a chance of being anything more than ordinary, perhaps reaching to good.When it comes to portraying ghosts and apparitions, the Asians, who are the true masters of the field, have set the bar real high with their famous ghost stories such as The Grudge. In this field, I must say The Woman in Black has done an excellent job! The ghost is as horrifying as could be, the apparitions of the children are eerie and terrifying, and the jump-scares (while a cheap cinematic trick) are done just right.Unfortunately, this concludes all possible praises I could give the film, with the exception of Ciaran Hinds playing the role of Sam Daily in a more than satisfactory manner. Harry Potter (aka Daniel Radcliffe) can only be compared to Johnny Depp's character in Sleepy Hollow, and unsurprisingly this comparison doesn't flatter him. He lacks the charisma and screen presence of other actors of the genre, and his acting simply ""doesn't cut it"". The plot and script are mediocre at best, nothing innovative or original, no noticeable creativity, nothing out of the ordinary we haven't seen before in many other films. I don't know if this criticism is to be given to screenwriter Jane Goldman and director James Watkins (this is by far not the best work of either) or to novelist Susan Hill, but the story isn't profound in any way.All in all, I can't say I didn't enjoy this film. It's a fun watch, scary at times, and isn't altogether disappointing for those of use who don't get carried away to unrealistic expectations. You could find many better and many worst.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The ghost of Harry Potter,"Susan Hill's Henry Jamesian ghost story gets a bigger make-over than the stage version. The premise is more or less the same: young solicitor's clerk arrives in deserted house to sort out papers of deceased owner. Cue spooky goings on involving a dead child and its dead but restless mother.An audience weaned on the SAW series and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY was never going to settle for mild disturbances in the manner of The Turn of the Screw, so after a few scenes of frightened villagers lifted from any Hammer horror you care to mention we soon start to see dead people. A serious flaw in the direction allows the audience to glimpse ghostly reflections and manifestations in a rocking chair before Arthur does and before the CGI is cranked into overdrive. Helped by local landowner (Ciaran Hinds - with a full-on mad-with-grief wife who almost belongs in a Carry-on), Arthur thinks he knows how to placate the Woman in Black. But does he? ... Cue (loud) threatening music.The 'ghost' that really hangs over this movie is Harry Potter; the wiz-kid is going to take longer to get past than an incarnation of James Bond. Daniel Radcliffe tries hard to climb this mountain but he is not yet (will he ever be?) an actor of substance and here, as in the HP series, the special effects overwhelm the cast. There are a few make-you-jump moments in THE WOMAN IN BLACK and the marshy setting is a pleasing throwback to Roger Corman's Edgar Allan Poe adaptations, but this movie will not enjoy the shelf-life of Jack Clayton's THE INNOCENTS or Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING, two early Sixties spine-tinglers that are still tingly 50 years later.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Really?,"I saw this movie tonight and was kind of disappointed. There was nothing really new about it. It was filled with all the same old parlor tricks you've seen in every other horror film. The only thing i liked was the atmosphere. The acting was fine but there was no attachment to the characters. I couldn't care less what happened to them. I did feel that it had potential but it was wasted with overdone and over the top ""jumpy"" scare tactics. When i watch a good movie, it usually inspires me or somehow changes the way I feel when its over. This film didn't do anything like that.

Best remake I've ever seen,"The original movie made in 1989 was not really that scary, a bit creepy, but not very scary. This new version really takes on the scare factor. It does get the hairs on the back of your neck standing up. Daniel Radcliffe is perfectly cast in this chilling ghost story. I suppose what may come naturally to the viewer is that we are used to seeing him stare danger in the face as Harry Potter as he does in this film, except he's playing a much more mature role now. (Interesting trivia fact - The main role in the original version is played by Adrian Rawlins who plays Harry Potter's dad).The main problem with the original other than it was not really that scary, is that it did not make much sense. What the story was behind ""the woman in black"" was too subtle. This newer version is much more clear and true to the movie's title. It's essentially the same story with a few changes, but it makes for a much better and scarier story.If you've seen the original and that's kind of put you off seeing this one, then ignore that and see this. I'm not a big fan of remakes, but this one took a relatively dull movie and made it something great. Also, it has a completely different ending, which the movie is much more deserving of.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Cliché but enjoyable haunted locale opus,"Arriving at a secluded mansion to handle the sale of the building, a young lawyer finds the area haunted by the ghost of a vengeful woman the locals fear has ties to the area and tries to stop her rampage from continuing.Overall not all that terribly interesting or enjoyable though it does have it's moments where it really tries. The grand Gothic house on the moors that's routinely covered in dense fog, dark, endless corridors shrouded in darkness and a strange secret from the locals are a few of the typical clichés found in this but strangely they work in creating a fantastic atmosphere here that is wholly enjoyable and impressive, especially once it gets to the second half and is allowed to really take hold as the legend becomes clearer and the action intensifies with some rather fun moments from time-to-time. The main problem here is the absolutely tedious pace this employs as it manages to plod along in the beginning of him alone in the house without anything really happening and the low-key nature of it really takes a hold. Plus, it's an abundance of clichés which leaves it feeling like a pale imitation of greater works so overall this one is quite troublesome.Rated PG-13: Violence and children-in-jeopardy.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

the play is better,"Amazing to see Daniel Radcliffe mature into adulthood, and there's something about him that makes him very right for these period pieces. He stars with Ciaran Hinds, Roger Allam, and Janet McTeer in ""The Woman in Black,"" a 2012 film based on the novel.Having just returned from London and seen the play, this was a very different experience and not as good. I think the main reason is that you must see this film with an audience. That is how it's meant to be seen.The story concerns a young attorney who is sent to the remote home of a recently deceased woman to go through her papers and experiences strange and frightening happenings and runs into resistance from the community for even being there.The atmosphere is very spooky and dark, and the director, James Watkins, keeps the tension going throughout.The play is the second-longest running nonmusical in London, after The Mousetrap. It's a two-person production and scary as all get-out, with the audience screaming bloody murder in several spots.The story is basically the same except for the ending and the set-up. In the play, Arthur Kipps, as an old man, has hired an actor to help him dramatize the story, one he feels must be told. The actor plays the younger Kipps, and the older Kipps plays all of the other parts.A good story with strong acting and lots of scares - and really one to see at least with a group of people if not a full audience.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Gothic chiller with added goosebumps,"A Victorian-era chiller set in a gothic mansion that stands on a marshy shore, so grey, damp and dingy it makes Dracula's Castle look like a five-star hotel, this ghost story is not afraid to pull out all the traditional Hammer Horror stops.It is very strong at building a foreboding atmosphere, spiced with several effective jump-scares. It is slow and deliberate. The budget is low, the acting (especially from the large collection of British character actors) is stodgy, the cinematography stilted, often looking more like a TV drama than a feature film.Making his debut in an adult role is former child star Daniel Radcliffe as the central character - grief-stricken young dad Arthur, sent off from London by his end-off-tether legal firm boss on a thankless job to a remote village seemingly carved out of a rain-sodden swamp where things are not at all jolly and bright.The Harry Potter star is watchable but is given little to work with, and has little in the way of memorable dialogue thanks to a lack lustre, workaday script. His character starts off exhausted, depressed and still in shock from the death of his wife four years previously, and he drifts downhill from there before arriving at a very twisted sort-of-happy ending.Along the way he encounters (too) many supporting characters from in denial Sam, who is also in mourning, to a village full of surly, insular bumpkins: the country's least hospitable hotellier; the world's worst solicitor; history's most dreadful taxi driver. There's also a bizarre mad woman, and dozens of scary, seemingly suicidal, near-silent children.And then there's the titular woman in black, who may or may not actually exist but certainly seems very busy.An effectively atmospheric musical score helps generate a suitably eerie, spooky feel to the film that's so drab to look at it could almost be shot in black-and-white. Fog and drizzle, smoke and shadows are the visual flavours, and against that backdrop there are occasional stabbing shocks that give the receptive viewer genuine tingles and goosebumps. There's little in the way of gore, and the horror is more psychological or jumpscare focused, but these are not overdone or gratuitous.Overall, The Woman In Black is an entertaining, old fashioned film that will please fans of classic gothic horror without daring to do anything new or unpredictable.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Far from the masterpiece it could have been,"The all purpose point of a horror movie is to make you forget the reality around you, and make you buy into the alternate world it has created. It must do this using originality, or an improvement on an idea, because in a horror film, predictability is its worst enemy. It's is a deathly balancing act of reeling you in and terrorizing you, while not losing focus with the viewer. This is extremely difficult to do, and is the reason why there are so few horror masterpieces and an abundance of failures.You are presented with Arthur Kipp, played by Daniel Radcliffe, who is a young lawyer, still struck with grief after his wife died in childbirth. He is on the verge of being fired, and his boss gives him one last job to prove his dedication to the firm. This last job is filing paperwork for a recently deceased woman in a unkempt mansion. After immediately being snubbed by the locals, he begins uncovering a ghost story.Unfortunately, Woman in Black is a failure. It falls trap to the majority of horror movie clichés, making it anodyne and gimmicky the point of anonymity. It is a film defined by what it is ultimately capable of doing, and nothing more. And what it is capable of doing, again, falls short. You are hit with an array of boom-bang-scream scares, and plenty of disfigured faces, but nothing progressive.The storyline is definitely intriguing, but the shallow way it's carried out hints at budget cuts to increase the profit ratio. Daniel Radcliffe had his work cut out for him breaking the mold set by his decade long stint has Harry Potter, and the screenplay doesn't even give him enough time to flex his acting chops and show us what he's really got. It feels more like a showcase.Ultimately, greatness eludes this film. The story feels watered down, and the characters are dry and undeveloped with no clear motives behind their actions, leaving you questioning everything they do. Despite plenty of tweaks and trinkets to catch the discerning eye, this film can, and will be easily forgotten. With a fresh sounding story, the talent of Ciarán Hinds, and the ability to show the world what Daniel Radcliffe is capable of, this film wastes it all, and is far from the masterpiece it could have been.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well done ghost story,"The Woman in Black, is the best known version of a story which began as a novel and was made into a 1989 TV movie and a play, and has been followed by a sequel film. Starring Daniel Radcliffe of Harry Potter fame, and featuring Ciarán Hinds (Mance Rayder in Game of Thrones) and Roger (DI Fred Thursday in Endeavour,) The Woman in Black is an old fashioned Gothic horror story, set in a creepy house in a remote weird village, where the disconsolate ghost of a woman who had lost her child takes vengeance by killing the children of the village. Radcliffe plays a young lawyer sent to sort out the affairs of the house's deceased owner. The film is a mixed bag: the early 20th century atmosphere is very vividly realized, and the film gets its effect from well done continual menace rather than gory special effects. It's been criticized for going through every horror film cliché in the books -- mysteriously hostile village yokels, a haunted mansion, furniture moving with no one in it, etc. -- though these standard characteristics are very well done. My main dissatisfaction personally is that the film sets us up for a basically happy ending which it then fails to deliver.You'll want to watch this if you are a real fan of ghost stories. The CBS Films Blu-Ray disc is of excellent quality. Advisory: rated PG 13, the main caution is that some people (not everyone) say they find it genuinely scary.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Daniel Radcliffe it's not just a one hit wonder,"The woman in Black is a 2012 horror film that stars everyone's favorite wizard Harry Potter Daniel Radcliffe. This is also Radcliffes first film immediately after the conclusion to the Harry Potter series. The film tells the story of a lawyer who travels to remote village to put his recently deceased clients affairs in order until he finds out that the village is being haunted by a vengeful spirit.The first thing I have to say about this film is Daniel Radcliffe himself gives a decent performance, while not a bad performance and not a standard of performance it is a good performance as he plays a father who has lost his wife after childbirth and only has son left. He fits the role of a annoyed annoyed lawyer,As well as a grieving husband He doesn't wanna listen to any others nonsense about ghost or Hauntings.While the film has predictable jump scares the movie has a very suspenseful atmosphere to it, the longer he stays inside the Manor at night. The woman in black herself is more what you would expect from a ghost in a film like this. She suffers tragedy,haunts the town and she takes children because Of pretty obvious reasons. The woman in black overall an average horror film with a decent story and a setting that keeps the audience interested. itd doesn't do anything special with its primise to really shock the audiences.

Here's a movie that is watch worthy for the spooks. Don't go expecting too much of graphics in this one. Detailed review below.,"Here's a movie that is watch worthy for the spooks. Don't go expecting too much of graphics in this one. Detailed review belowPlot: The story is set in late nineteenth/ early twentieth century. A young father who's in financial stress, tries to take up an assignment of dealing with papers pertaining to an old estate that is now long vacant. To him, this could mean saving his job. The only problem is that, the house he tries to assess, and the village nearby is haunted by the Woman in Black.Effects: As can be expected in a ghost flick, there are quite a lot of frames that have been captured only to arrest the attention of the viewer; either with a subtle fingerprint appearing on a window or creepy noises, one is kept in the edge of their seat. Apart from this, there are also scenes, like that of a fire accident, that are very neatly done without too much gore. Whenever she appears on the screen, the ghost itself is made to appear extremely calm (except in the last scene) - something that is extremely unnerving for the viewer. The crescendo that accompanies the final time we see her in the mansion, makes it a really exciting watch. The set (mansion/ village) itself is quite brilliantly done.Cast and Performance: Daniel Radcliffe is the protagonist of this tale and has done quite well in his first movie performance since the Harry Potter series. His natural act does give away in moments where you expect more fear or action out of him. But this is probably good in a way, as it wards off his Potter series histrionics (that is still stuck in our mind). Roger Allam as Bentley is probably the only other actor who shares a good spoil of the screen time and does okay. The tale is probably too thick with the haunted scenes that one would probably not recollect the other minor characters in this film.Direction: The director (James Watkins) has stuck to traditional spooks to keep the audience entertained. This does extremely well, considering the fact that the whole tale is set in an era which may not mingle that well with too much of special effects. As explained above, he has made sure that Radcliffe doesn't keep himself in his wizardly shadows. Directing the sequence of events in a very straightforwardly manner probably meant that the intention was not to get the audience too preoccupied in piecing together a story, but rather enjoy the thrills that come with a horror flick.Read my full review at: http://blog.nrajesh.com/ review-woman-in-black",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Revenge without cause,"""Revenge without a justifiable cause,"" that's what pops into my head when I think about the movie, The Woman in Black. Though most post positive reviews, I must be more honest in my critique of this film. I guess to start, I understand how the woman in black came to literally hate her sister & the sisters husband. So haunting them to death; completely understandable. What was unclear however, was the actual reason for why the vengeance was inflicted upon the whole town & visitors to the town. The synopsis on the movie cover speaks of a murder that was covered up ""allegedly "" by the whole town, which was suppose to explain or justify the actions carried out by our woman in black; but again this ""alleged murder""fails us, if attempting to justify revenge against visitors to the town ""whom have nothing to do with what transpired before their visit."" Having stated that, well now, for me, the movie becomes illogical because I can't justify, with any stretch of my imagination, as to what poor, poor Mr. Kipps ever did to the woman in black, that explains how he was treated. Was this movie interesting? Absolutely! Was it scary? Heck yeah! Does it make sense, or does the plot hold? Nope. Because, outside of Mr. Kipps hearing what sounds like an accident when in the smog outside El Marsh house, nor during Mr Kipps reading of the letters & birthday cards, do we ever receive any insight of the so called ""murder that's covered up."" Being angry & murdering everyone for something that 2 relatives did to you, is illogical. Bottom line here, the covered up alleged murder needed to be addressed. Thinking my family killed my child and punishing the whole world for it; Really? I don't think the ends justified the means.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Effective supernatural horror movie.,"I really like how the movie is a homage to Hammer's gothic horror films.

The movie have a interesting mystery on who is the woman in black and why she is killing kids in the village.

Calling those who like Haunted Houses,"Having not read the book, I had no idea that I was walking into a supernatural horror movie that evoked shades of Tim Burton but went further in its implications. There was an evil vibe about this story, something cruel and cursed that you get almost immediately after Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) arrives into the village. Being eerie and dark, the hazy and bleak cinematography is what causes this vibe, making for a chilling movie, one that keeps you peering around the corner for the next major fright.The sets were perfect in giving their impression of 'Ye Olde England', but they are kept barren for a purpose which has your attention diverted toward the characters (and ghosts). There are junctures you get the feeling that the film is veering towards a gore driven slasher flick but it restrains itself suitably to deliver supernatural themed horror which is definitely frightening.Moving from fantasy to something far more adult themed, Radcliffe made the transition seamlessly and appeared to be more absorbed in his character than he ever did in 'Harry Potter'. Severe twists and turns are not to be seen in a film quite faithful to its source material but don't think you will be yawning in boredom. The intensity of the events give you no space to do so.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Uninspiring and not true to the spirit of the book,"I am a huge fan of the book but I must say that this film was not what it could have been. Cheap scare tricks, excessive CGI and a modified story ruined it for me...not to mention all the idiots in the movie theater who wouldn't shut the hell up and the groups of kids running up and down the stairs and in and out of the theater made it a damn circus. I waited a long time to see this and all the commotion was a major buzz kill. I'm never going to see a movie on a Saturday night again!This movie should have been shot indie style with no name actors; I would have loved to see what the Pans Labyrinth producer did with this story. Radcliffe did an OK job in the role and the acting was fairly solid all around but I left the theater feeling uninspired and definitely not scared. I know when I see a great ghost story because it sits with me for days. The woman should not have been CGI'd - she could have been just as terrifying and her screaming was absolutely retarded not to mention that lame final scene where she stared into the camera. The book was moody, atmospheric and chilling and it just did not translate into this film.I am yet to see the original but keep hearing great things about it and plan to watch it on you tube. maybe now it will finally be released on DVD.I give this a 6/10 at best",1.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Daniel did well, but as a horror title, this movie...sucks","I'm a huge horror movie fan and was looking forward to this title.Unfortunately, I got really disappointed with The Woman in Black for two main reasons: it's predictable, it uses tons of clichés.First, the storyline is reminiscent of so many other movies out there. The first few moments were quite original and I expected a few twists here and there, but as I continued to watch the film, I realized that I'm in for a big disappointment.Daniel does a good job in delivering his role, but the support characters are strange and out of place and the entire premise seems badly developed. The ending was quite predictable as well and to be honest, it could have been done SO much more interesting and scary.Second, all of the ""scary"" scenes are not only very easy to anticipate, but they were almost literally copies from other ghost movies. The mirror ghost scenes, the screaming face scenes and a plethora of others were all blatantly copied. Unlike intense psychological horror movies or movies that use anticipation and the fear of the unknown (REC, Exorcist, Paranormal Activity), Woman in Black employs cheap thrills with the excessive use of atmospheric music, sound and special effects.Overall, Woman in Black is not a horrible movie, but if you're a horror movie fan and have seen your share of films, you'll be thoroughly disappointed by this title.It's quite predictable, uses simple scare tactics and dare I say...boring?7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dan trades wands and flying broomsticks for a haunted house and the woman in black,"And the result is a near-perfect movie.So, the story here is that a young lawyer, played by Radcliff, goes to an isolated village where he is trying to sell a house known as the Eel March house (or something like that). When he gets there, however, he realizes that, not only do the villagers seem very unwelcoming, but he realizes that they keep their children inside the house for most of the movie. That is because they are trying to protect them from the woman in black, who is a ghost that is hell-bent on taking the lives of children, basically as revenge for when her own child died.The result is that of a great movie. I must say that this is the first time in which I went to a horror movie in the theatre. They scared me so much as a kid, that I did not want to watch any single one. Even the ""Goosebumps"" on television scared me. But, when I saw the preview, I felt that I should see this movie, even if it is just to see Dan in his first post-Potter role.Speaking of which, the acting is great here. Ciaran Hinds is great as Daily, the only guy who tries to help Arthur (Dan's character), whether it is to sell the house, or if it deals with the woman in black. Janet McTeer plays his wife, who has some scary moments of her own.But, I can't leave out Dan. Unfortunately, there was one aspect of him that made me deduct one point from the film, and that was the fact that he was a 22-year-old, playing a father of a four-year-old. He just seemed a little too young to be portraying that aspect, and so because of that, I was, like many others, reminded of Harry. Nevertheless, he is still able to hold his own in the film, and his character is actually someone that we care about.Speaking of which, what really works in this movie is the character development. We are immediately introduced to Dan's character; the movie does give us glimpses of his past, which is good, because we get to know him more that way. Same with the other characters; Daily is a really likable character, and the villagers are not so much angry as they are scared. It is great character development, and that is very much needed in a film like this, because in a lot of horror films, we just get the young kids who just like to party. Not here, though.And finally, the scares. This is a movie that doesn't rely on blood, guts, and gore; also unlike other horror films, it simply relies on chills and scares, which is a nice break from the horror films. And let me tell you; there are scares. I definitely jumped a few times, and if a film makes me do that... well, I give it props.Overall, a great movie. Rotten Tomatoes said that there may not be enough chills for viewers that are more used to the horror films that we usually see. I disagree; there are chills, and there are times where you will jump. Plus, the actors all did a great job, even though there were times that I couldn't get Harry out of my head, and the script and the characterization was well-done. A 9/10 for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

Great atmosphere but disappointing story,"After reading all the good reviews here a friend of mine and I set out to see this. In the mood for a good horror film we were expecting a dark, scary film that would really make us jump out of our seats or cover our eyes.This didn't happen as much as anticipated. If you've ever seen ""The Others"" with Nicole Kidman or ""The Innocents"" with Deborah Kerr you know what a good, old fashioned haunted house film can be. You don't need any fancy CGI or special effects. What you do need is a solid story that people can relate to. This film doesn't have that.We were disappointed. Yes, there are a couple of creepy moments but it was more like riding one of those carnival rides that the car moves through on a track with animatronic, robot figures jumping out in front of you with loud screeching sound effects.The sets are beautiful and I suppose the acting is OK although it was no stretch for Radcliff to play this role. I would think that people who don't like scary films would probably find this unnerving but for the rest of us this was a disappointment. The story just doesn't make much sense.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
amazed by such a good performance and story line,"It seems that Daniel Radcliffe has proved himself to be more than just Harry Potter. Bra-voo! Honestly it was such a good movie...such a good story...and the horror scenes were amazing. it's been a long time since i have watched a horror movie covering my eyes of chills. And the ending is .... speechless.I was very afraid that Radcliff won't do justice to this movie, and won't overcome his role as Potter. But yes, he is a very good actor and who was having second thoughts about that, i really advise you to watch this movie.If you like a good old ghost story, this is the movie to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good film spoilt,"I really wanted to like this film more than my score would suggest, and indeed I did. Radcliffe was excellent as was the ever-reliable Ciaran Hinds. The film looked great, and the location was well-chosen. The film built tension very well at the start, conjuring the sense of creeping dread found in M.R. James' scarier works; the script was deft, and I thoroughly settled in, looking forward to a good scare. Except...well...it all went a bit wrong. The overuse of jump-scares that really should be left to Youtube reaction videos was my first gripe, but the sourest note was struck by a deeply unsatisfying ending that seemed to arrive too early, and just left me hanging, wondering ""Was that it?""; my wife felt much the same. Overall, I was left with the feeling that a potentially great film had been missed.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
A paint-by-numbers horror movie,"The Woman in Black is a paint-by-numbers horror movie. You know what you're getting and you can see the scary coming from a mile away. It does have some fun jump out moments and some hair-raising creepiness, but it's nothing new or special. Daniel Radcliffe isn't out of his Harry Potter shadow yet (I kept wanting him to blast the ghosts with his wand), but this horror movie is a good start.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the play,"I was just taken to see this as a birthday present, and I must say that, although Radcliffe does some very good work in it, and the new ending they came up with was fresh and interesting (if a bit twisted), I really felt disappointed that the stage play, which I saw several years ago in an EXCELLENT local production in Los Angees, was so much better. Except for one moment in the middle (you'll know it when you see it, but you won't find any spoilers here), I didn't find it scary at all, and all of the interviews with Radcliffe have hopelessly built it up to be ""really scary"" (Radcliffe's words). It's not. The stage play made me jump SEVERAL times AND has the wonderful added layer of the actor being hired by the older Kipps to play his younger self (with the actor ultimately finding himself BECOMING Kipps in a never-ending cycle), which the movie completely dropped for some mysterious and unexplained reason. That said, the film does have some great cinematography and moody lighting effects, but nothing we haven't seen done to death (and better) in the ""Potter"" series of films.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Amazing Horror/Thriler,I was so excited when the woman in black came out. I watched it and I was so amazed about how good Daniel Radcliffe was in his first adult role. It's such an amazing suspenseful movie. This is the kind of movie which you can watch again and still get scared. I love horror movies and this was quite good but not really scary. It's a great horror/ thriller movie. I really did not know what was going to happen next. Some parts was kind of boring but some parts grabbed my attention as well.This is definitely a movie which I recommend for Daniel Radcliffe Fans and for Horror Movie fans. I will probably watch this again in the nearby future.,8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Better than Most PG-13 Horror Flicks,"Overall, ""The Woman in Black"" is not a great film, but it is a competently made genre film that succeeds in holding my attention from start to finish. Most of this film's thrills come from the atmosphere. The world of Eel Marsh House is dilapidated and poorly lit, the home itself is only accessible during low tide, as the road is covered by water during high tide, effectively turning the Home into an island (I kept thinking of the house featured prominently in Roman Polanski's ""Cul-De-Sac""). Curtains of gossamer hang from the ceiling, and candlelight does little to banish the encroaching shadows. Elements like these are staples of gothic horror (and Hammer films!) and this film is a treasure trove for gothic horror atmosphere if it's nothing else. I can almost guarantee in twenty years no one will really remember this movie, but it's entertaining enough that if you stumble upon it on Netflix or any other streaming service, it would be worth your time.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Vidiot Reviews...,"The Woman in BlackIt makes sense for the Grim Reaper to be female: the black robe is flattering; the clientele is predominantly male; and you're supermodel thin.And though the drably dressed apparition in this horror movie isn't death personified, she is taking lives.Assigned to the countryside to deal with the estate of a deceased client, a lawyer, Arthur (Daniel Radcliffe), comes face-to-face with terror.While working at the family manor, Arthur is vexed by the vile visage of a feminine specter that's reputed to appear before a child dies by its own hands.Soon enough, her appearance begets the death of a local girl, inspiring Arthur and a curious landowner (Ciarán Hinds) to investigate past occurrences.Ominous, with an unconventional ending, this Gothic horror opts to induce goose bumps instead of gag-reflexes.Incidentally, with Arthur's legal aid, the dead kids could mount a class action lawsuit against the woman in black.

Disappointing...,"The trailer was promising and it made me have high expectations. However, after watching the movie, I was very disappointed. I couldn't feel any connection with the characters at all - specially with the protagonist, Arthur. Daniel Radcliffe's expression was neutral the entire time, which is probably the reason why the movie was so unexciting. The plot could've been more explored and the end was too predictable, at least for me. However, it was quite entertaining. It had its scary moments and I jumped in my chair once or twice. The movie was not very good, but it wasn't too bad either. Maybe my expectations were too high...?6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Pretty good with nice twists,"I am somewhat disappointed lately with the horror / paranormal / mystery genre since the vast majority of the movies are not scary or doesn't do justice to the topic, this one was different.The movie premise starts OK, it's not flashy at the beginning, it builds up quite slow but a nice pace because it develops its characters and at the same time, the mood and atmosphere of the place.One of the best things about this movie is it's atmosphere, very nice and well done, Daniel Radcliffe excels in his role and I was surprised since, to be honest, I didn't liked him in Harry Potter movies.The movie spend quite a lot of time with Radcliffe character struggling with the troubled woman in black and when it does, the movie works, there are very few parts where we see more characters on screen but the best parts are when Radcliffe is alone with the spirits.Although there are predictable parts and some things could be done more polished, there are a few scary parts that are truly legendary (I will not say anymore).It's not a masterpiece, but is not bad, not even by a long mile. In the end, it's quite a good movie that dare to show a different picture at the ending, I really don't understand the complains about the ending, I did quite like it.Go see it, you won't be disappointed, it's a fine movie about ghosts.6 out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Finally a horror movie that isn't a found footage genre and it's scary,"Now I didn't read the novel this movie is based on but I sort of want to now after watching this movie. Now I seen scarier movies, mostly movies from Asian cinema. But this one did a pretty darn good job with the creepy eerie feel to it and the scares. The movie starts out pretty slow though and the build up is a bit boring with constant jump scares that doesn't build any tension. It almost seem more drama like than horror for quite some time but when the horror kicks in, it can get pretty scary. When the main character finds out what is going on, the tension starts to get pretty high and there is a lot of creepy parts to it as well. Which makes me wonder why they had those super creepy dolls for kids to play with but it does add a lot of creepiness from it. Although the camera seems to focus way too much on the dolls to the point the movie sort of feels like ""Dead Silence"" sometimes. So the plot is this during the very early 1900's Arthur Kipps(Daniel Radcliffe) wife dies from giving birth to a male child and after a few years later after that event, he leaves his four year old son to handle a estate at a very very creepy mansion. I don't know about the character Arthur but it would take me a lot of will power to stay in a mansion like that by myself. Daniel Radcliffe is pretty decent in this and fit right in this movie and his small and skinny stature adds to his vulnerability which makes it more tense when the scary moments kicks in. But he just didn't seem that scared despite the really scary stuff going around, he sees something really creepy and he goes to investigate anyways which doesn't make much sense to most people. But this is one of those elements that apply to most horror flicks so it's passable. But his character still should have at least shown a bit more fear to make it buy-able, even if his character might have lost the will to live. Lot of horror flicks use children and something about their innocence and naivety adds the creepy effect and it's done with it's close to full potential in this. Sometimes this movie reminded me of ""The Grudge: Old Lady in White"" and ""The girl in black"". Which is fine because those are pretty scary flicks as well. This is actually a decent movie after Radcliffe finished the Harry Potter franchise, this one will give chills and goosebumps. It did for me and I seen a lot of horror flicks, not the scariest movie I seen but this one does a pretty good job with the scares.7.5/10",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
A modern classic that stands out from the lot of the same genre..,"I must agree that I am not a big fan of horror flicks but this one compelled me to write a review. To begin with, the atmosphere of the movie right from the first frame holds up till the last, it being sombre with undertones of a dark humor. The plot is simple and conclusive without any added spices for the sake of glamor,the movie operates on creating an ambiance rather than utilizing grotesque sequences. The acting is fairly good, Daniel did a fine job playing a rational figure with a melancholic look on his face, his persona is quite credible, all the supporting parts are also well executed. The story unfolds in a somewhat methodical way enabling the viewers to grasp it rather than entrapping them in an intricate maze of subplots which most horror flicks immaculately succeed in doing. Not adorned with special effects which so often are relied upon to create the horror element. Overall, the movie is quite captivating and keeps one thinking about it for some time (somewhat of a personal moviemeter for me, good movies stay with me and become a part of the thought process). If i have to define it in three words, they would be; classy, intriguing, and mellow( something quite rare for a horror flick)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Below average,"Though I love most of Radcliffe's works, this film was his worst. Out of the two expressions he offers, vacant and terrified, there is little variance between the two.I'm someone who gets scared easily by thriller movies and this title bored me to tears. Sure, there were some moments when I was intrigued, but that feeling was quickly dampened by an overly long and monotonous scene.The 'triller' moments were uninspired and cliché of countless pre-2000's horror films.The concept may have looked good down on paper but the execution was lacking.

the woman in black2,"I have been waiting for this film for some time. Which I think goes to show that there is an appreciative audience and a great deal of planning and work involved in such a production. I also had a little apprehension at another 'version' of a very well known film.I suppose there must be some kind of insecurity abound when they decide to go along with a re-make, rather than write a new story. I would think that the first film could easily have inspired a different idea but perhaps that is a symptomatic of a general decline in innovation these days. Having said that, I did enjoy the film; the acting is good, plenty of suspense, atmosphere, visually good and a few shocks. A good evenings viewing. That is where I see a problem. I can't help feeling of condescension. The action element, reference to tried effect from other films and above all added 'plot', all place the film as good entertainment rather than memorable film.The added plot, presumably to attract a larger audience, becomes more apparent as the film progresses, and as a film often leads towards a lingering sense of thought, in this case it culminates in an easy, Dysney type conclusion. I can't help thinking of the way children would explain the story to each other, pointing out the signs along the way. I would recommend 'The Woman in black' as a good ghost film but not what it could have easily been. Which goes to show that although there is a tremendous talent in Britain for filmmaking, Innovation is suppressed in favour of the box office.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Women and Their Kids,"What is amazing about this movie is that there is nothing particularly dynamic, fresh or unique--but I still liked it. I think I liked it because it was done well, the story was nice and tight, and maybe because of the core element of the story: the lady in black and the kids.The movie starts off with three lovely little girls opening a second story window and jumping to their deaths. No, they didn't show splattered little girls on the ground but it was just so eerie how they robotically and in unison stood up, walked to the window, opened it and jumped. And that's what I think makes the movie captivating; the fact that the town wanted to protect their children.The movie was ominous and dark though it isn't one of the scariest movies I've seen. The woman in black is what you'd expect from a vengeful ghost, nothing more nothing less. There's not much mystery to this movie and they don't attempt to have mystery in it.

This movie blows...,"Before you write raving review for a movie, you should probably look at the film as a whole and not just give it a 10 because Daniel Radcliffe is in it. The plot is absurd - he's on a spooky haunted island, rustling up evil spirits so he can close a case he's working on? Really? And 90% of the movie is the same thing over and over. The main character is looking at the camera and in the background something creepy happens...LOUD NOISE! Why doesn't he just leave? If a REAL person experienced any of those things, they'd be like, ""F*** it, I'm going home."", but he never seems to be bothered. You can't have a realistic character that doesn't experience normal human emotion. It causes dissociation. Empty, ridiculously repetitive story. If you LOVED this film, you know nothing about storytelling. Watch it again, without thinking, ""Harry is so hot..."" and you'll realize the movie sucks. Why don't you just re-watch a Harry Potter movie, rather than wasting $8.50?",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A noble effort.,"In one of his first ""grown up"" roles, actor Daniel ""Harry Potter"" Radcliffe stars as Arthur Kipps, the young, widower father of a four year old son. His sorrow over his wife's death has put his job as a lawyer in jeopardy, and his boss gives him a last chance assignment. He is to go over the affairs of an eccentric, recently deceased lady who lived in an isolated locale known as Eel Marsh. Area residents, in the tradition of many a horror story, treat him with distrust, are very cagey about the tragedies in their past, and are quite superstitious. The only person who really makes friends with him is the solicitous Sam Daily (Ciaran Hinds).In this second adaptation of the 1983 novel by Susan Hill, director James Watkins (""Eden Lake"") does his able best to give us a traditional Gothic horror film. It's no surprise that one of the companies behind this production is Britains' famed Hammer Studios, as this kind of thing was their bread and butter for many years. This feature has got TONS of atmosphere - this viewer totally digs that main location, which can only be accessed by a long and winding road that gets flooded at some point every day. Marco Beltrami supplies a good music score, and Watkins & crew do well at creating some real tension.However, there are aspects to this that may simply not work for all members of the audience. The whole scenario seems awfully familiar by this point, at least for those who have seen lots of horror from all time periods. Also, much like the 1981 slasher ""The Prowler"" and the 2009 throwback feature ""The House of the Devil"", the running time is filled with perhaps a few too many sequences of a character exploring an old dark house. The use of visual effects isn't overwhelming, but Watkins goes the easy route a little too often with the use of jump scares. At least we never get too good a look at our restless, antagonistic spirit.Radcliffe is adequate in the lead, but is overshadowed by the wonderful Hinds and the equally strong Janet McTeer as Daily's wife. It's really Hinds that makes this worth a look.At the very least, the ending is one that some viewers may not see coming. This is competently made, and sufficiently creepy if never all-out frightening.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing New,"*******MAY INCLUDE SPOILERS*******Daniel Radcliffe gave an excellent performance in nothing more than a clichéd horror movie. Here he really does show his potential of building a career outside the 'fantasy' genre.In defence of the writers, I suppose that it is very difficult to be original in horror these days, as pretty much everything has been done before, but maybe this was best left on the shelf.This movie is nothing more than a run of the mill horror flick. The scenes are predictable, meaning that you know exactly when there is going to be a scary moment, the obligatory camera close ups, dark corners, footsteps etc. The movie does add one or two 'edge of the seat moments' but nothing much more can be said in terms of 'Horror'.Overall good casting, costumes and sets etc but otherwise VERY bland!!!4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

The story, however, not Mr. Radcliffe's fault, was rather difficult to follow, to discern, and understand. Apparently one is required to have read the novel, which is a bit too much like some of his other movies. I wish I had been given more of the story before having to watch the special features afterward, to understand it better, which they could have done for me, had they so desired. According to the commentary, however, it was intentional. The scenes, the sets, and the special effects, however, are quite delightful (pun intended).

As scary as a 'Ghost Train' ride ...,"At first sight, James Watkins' film looks formatted to please an audience thirsty for thrills and heart-pounding experiences, it stars Daniel Radcliffe, Harry Potter in a first adult-to-be- taken-seriously role (and as a matter of fact, I did took him seriously) and the title is perfect to convey both a sensation of fear or mystery, I wish it could have been more original than ""The Woman in Black"" but as an audience-pulling title, it's perfectly marketed.Now, reviewing ""The Woman in Black"" is quite a challenge as far as objectivity is concerned. As a horror film, it did one hell of a job because it truly scared the hell out of me, but as one IMDb user pointed out, there is a huge difference between making someone jump out of his seat and actually scaring him. By the way, I couldn't believe a veteran critic like Roger Ebert missed those tricks, so blatantly overused, well a bit too much in a film that tries to use some sophistication in an Edwardian English setting (I would have said Victorian until I noticed there were cars). ""The Woman in Black"" should have inspired a delightful to read cynical review, but he sounds satisfied then allow me to more bitter. It's not against the film, overall, it was short enough not to become quickly unbearable.The problem in ""The Woman in Black"" is that the film succeeds in creating a harrowing and haunting atmosphere, and Daniel Racliffe's performance carries the fears and the interrogation of the typical protagonist who doesn't know where he's putting his foot in but must do it because it's part of his mission. So, for a film that had all the technical predispositions to be a great mystery thriller, cinematography, directing, acting and editing, I couldn't believe it would go for so many cheap attempts to scare audience regardless of the context and the content of the story. On that level, ""The Woman in Black"" was as scary as a ghost train, where most of the frights and shocks rely on the surprise effect, as efficient as they are predictable, which cancels out the merit of the film.Indeed, watching ""The Woman in Black"" made me realize how it was easy to scare people, I can't count how many persons in the theater screamed and I almost had to cover my eyes at some parts of the film, not because I was genuinely scared but because I knew something was going to happen, yes it was scary but when you expect to be scared, the whole experience consists on not being surprised by a disturbing image that just pops up in the screen. It's just as if James Watkins, the director (so you can remember his name), took to its fullest the overused concept of some Youtube videos: a quiet and comforting moment and then suddenly, a screaming face appears to instantly increase your heart pulses, an idea already based on the 'ghost train' principle.And what's even worse for the film's attempts to scare its audience is in the setting of the haunted mansion, so full of weird and hard to watch objects, so ugly that it only takes a close-up or a sudden shot on one of them to perturb the audience. All the mechanical toys, dolls and automatons seem to belong to the house for the only purpose of 'appearing', nothing else justifies their presence, at one point, one appears inoffensive and then it starts playing drums so suddenly that again, we wonder why Watkins didn't trust his story's own material. Well, the monkey playing drums had its effect okay, but was Watkins so desperately eager to scare us that he needed to let one whole sequence relying on that.""The Woman in Black"" doesn't trust its own potential, and never gives enough credit to their characters, nor does it trust our intelligence. The film evolves in such an enigmatic atmosphere that we have no clue about what's going on. But it's part of the genre and we expect a mind-blowing experience coming near the end, until the protagonist, his name was Kipps (I had to check as I totally forgot about it after the film) enters the haunted house, and we start to make some vague correlations between the presence of a ghostly figure, a woman in black screaming like a vulgar subliminal Internet-prank image, and a series of disturbing children's deaths, and their deaths would be indeed efficient if the build-ups were not so overdone.Anyway, before this review starts to sound too cynical, I want to point out that anything beyond what I said worked decently. I was amazed by Daniel Radcliffe's photogenic look, convincing as a tormented soul with a wound in his heart, the atmosphere of the film have some reminiscent shots of ""The Shining"", like the long and tortuous road that lead to the land where Kipps had to work on the estate. And the hostility of the population nicely contrasted with his interesting friendship with a rich landowner named  whatever. Anyway, near the center of the film, the story started to be easier to follow and not uninteresting. A feeling that doesn't last unfortunately when it starts to scare for the sake of scares.Is it me or I feel like I'm repeating myself? Well, I guess it's time for me to conclude by saying that the film had quite a powerful ending that seemed to belong to another film. If ""The Woman is Black"" had the same gripping intensity than the last scene, it would have made so many cheap tricks like the overuse of shadows, the ominous music and the whole subliminal startling moments totally needless. ""The Woman in Black"" is not a bad film, but unfortunately falls too much in the category of exercises in style and  to use in my turn an overused line, with no substance.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Actors Were Too Good for this Movie,"I could not fault Daniel Radcliffe's performance. I was pleased to find that only minutes into this movie, I was able to forget any idea of him as a re-hashed Harry Potter. The other actors were also quite good.The problem was that this had to be one of the laziest, lack-luster excuses for a screenplay ever devised, coupled with crappy special effects. Tacky gimmicks such as volume-cranked creepy music were used in an attempt to build suspense. Then when the suspense music was at it's loudest--a cheap, cheesy apparition would fly out of nowhere, shrieking and flying at the camera. Said apparition looked like a rabid Muppet rip-off.To add to the pain of the whole experience was the unbelievably glacial pace.Do yourself a favor, and don't even waste time on this dreck once it comes out on DVD/BlueRay.",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Not spooky, not scary, not creepy, and worst of all, not interesting","Attempting a creepy vibe, this movie doesn't succeed. Instead of building the creep factor, it only manages to build impatience.In the first 10 minutes, the scene is set perfectly for a good old fashioned ghost story. And for some reason, the next hour is devoted to little except maddeningly tedious scene-setting ambiance. Blinking shadows, clattering mechanical toys, and faces in the window, during which the plot is not moved forward.Radcliffe is OK, but he doesn't really show the rising levels of fright, frustration, or anything really that might have made the sequences useful. A better actor (or more experienced, if you like) would be able to come unhinged at least a little bit and make the movie more interesting, even if just for those 40 minutes. The role calls for someone who can carry this movie alone, and he's not there.As for the ending, I'll just say this: the resolution comes all too easily and the ""plot"" seemed ultimately pointless, with the end a complete mushy letdown.

Don't get me wrong, the movie has some moments that scare you, but those are just too little in my opinion.What irritates me is that Radcliffe never gets scared during the movie, only at the very end. Every human being would be scared to death and run away, but Radcliffe just keeps walking through the house with one paranormal occurrence after the other.If you just want to get scared, don't care about the originality of the plot (which has one nice twist at the end) then this can be an entertaining movie, but don't expect much more...",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

Most horror buffs think horror flicks need to have blood, guts, and a crazy serial killer to be considered to be scary; this film has a little bit of blood, has a serial killer (not typical one), but no guts. What it lacks in gore it makes up for suspense and a great storyline.The acting is average, the setting and period costumes were great, and are dear Harry Potter has grown up to be a great versatile actor. The Woman in Black, was actually very creepy and the best character of the whole film was the Marsh where all of this took place, just the though of driving up that very narrow road surrounded by muck sends chills down my spine.So a 7 out of 10 is given for this film just because I personally wasn't afraid,but give it a chance and enjoy it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
Bone-chilling.,"This film tells the story of Arthur Kipps, a widower lawyer who has a son. In an effort to find a document in the home of a client who died, Kipps disturbs a mysterious and vengeful entity that kills children in the nearby village. From there, he will have to face the wrath of this supernatural force, the fear of the villagers and his own fear.Directed by James Watkins, this psychological horror film messes with what we consider more valuable: the children and their safety. This fact is important for the film to be as daunting as it is: no one wants to see an innocent child suffer. The main role is played by Daniel Radcliffe (the eternal Harry Potter), who manages to comes into our hearts by the ingenuity and innate goodness that his character shows. We can see that he doesn't realize what is happening and he want no harm to anyone. And like him, the audience only understands all the facts in middle of the movie. Curious fact: we never see the face of the ""woman in black"" long enough for us to fully realizing its features.This film has excellent visual and sound effects and a gloomy, hazy photography that just makes us even more nervous and apprehensive. The ambiance, decor, toys, everything should be welcoming in a family home is, in this film, used to enlarge our sense of discomfort. Do not see it alone.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Yeah its no different but it has its MOMENTS,"Yeah, it's no different, been there seen that kind of story. It involves the same mystery situations, the same shocking revelations but no conventional ending. From the suggestive title one can make out half of the story, thus the movie falls into the bucket of predictability. But if only were movies were weighed by the stories they showed, we would be in a swamp of identically similar movies. What matters after the story is it's treatment, helping us unfolding the colours of the plot. This movie scores in jumping their audiences out of their seats but also showing some stunning visuals.What I a m referring to is art direction. When the protagonist visits the mansion house, it carries a kind of eerie presence to it. The kind of detailing that goes in designing that house from interior is just plain astounding. The intermittent shots that shows puppets animated faces also brings out that strange feeling. The director has wisely used those shots to create the effects.The movie is lacking in areas with a weak screenplay, but overall it grips you. I loved the fact that all the main characters in this movie had some past baggage, a history that directly connects with the plot. When I first saw the ending I was skeptic of it, but then I read about it and was thoroughly satiated with the climax. It is to know that the woman in black doesn't win over Arthur, he denies he that right.Performance wise Daniel Radcliffe is good but could be better. His portrayal of much older man than he is fails too convince me in some scenes. But his prowess as an actor is tremendous, I will be waiting for more. Ciarán Hinds as Daniels compatriot in the move is exceptional in some scenes. he sometimes takes hold of scenes from Radcliff and gives his own touch. Rest of the cast does well in their appropriate roles.Give it a watch, you might be surprised with the kind of work being done. It's horror to the core and gives back a lot what it promises.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror

I wanted it to be better than it was; I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter franchise, and have found Daniel Radcliffe a superlative actor. This movie, however, fell a little flat. The story was simplistic but intriguing, but it was no where near scary enough to a horror enthusiast like myself. My American host family, who aren't fans of horror cinema were scared, but I found myself a bit bored. It did fake me at the end, and I loved the final scene. Other than that, it was a sub-par movie with sub-par acting I had better expectations for. Sorry, Harry. -V. Gyeong, out.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Smells like 70s,"""The Woman in Black"" (2012) is a captivating gothic horror film directed by James Watkins, who is set to return to the big screen with his latest project, ""Speak No Evil.""What makes this film particularly intriguing is not just the fact that it was written by Jane Goldman and features cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones, but also its ability to evoke a sense of antiquity that surpasses even its source material. This can be considered a triumph for the gothic/folk horror genre.The 1983 novel, adapted for television two years later, feels as if it were written in the very era it depicts.I also had the opportunity to see the Turkish State Theatres' stage adaptation of this book, which was another excellent interpretation.The film's DVD includes an interview with Turkish actress Wilma Elles and Daniel Radcliffe, where Radcliffe reveals that he never anticipated such a project and immediately accepted the offer.Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, and Janet McTeer deliver truly remarkable performances in the film. The film's box office success, grossing $190 million on a £15 million budget, can largely be attributed to Daniel Radcliffe's fame from the Harry Potter series. However, this doesn't diminish the fact that the film deserves its success.The film's gothic atmosphere is palpable, with the isolated Eel Marsh House serving as a chilling and foreboding setting. The cinematography captures the bleakness and desolation of the marshlands, creating a sense of dread and isolation. The sound design is equally effective, with creaking floorboards, howling winds, and unsettling whispers contributing to the film's eerie ambiance.Radcliffe's portrayal of Arthur Kipps, the young lawyer haunted by the Woman in Black, is a departure from his iconic role as Harry Potter. He convincingly conveys Kipps's grief, fear, and determination, making the character both sympathetic and relatable. Hinds and McTeer provide strong supporting performances, adding depth and complexity to the story.While the film relies on traditional horror tropes, such as jump scares and creepy children, it does so with a certain elegance and restraint. The scares are well-timed and genuinely unsettling, and the film's slow-burn approach allows the tension to build gradually, culminating in a truly terrifying climax.""The Woman in Black"" is a well-crafted and atmospheric horror film that successfully translates the chilling tale from page to screen. It is a must-see for fans of gothic horror and a testament to James Watkins's talent as a director.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
could have been cool but...,"...something went dreadfully wrong here. Daniel Radcliffe is the film's Achilles heel. He just doesn't have the heft to pull off the kind of nuanced role this movie demanded. It's partially that he's too young to pull off the love-shattered widower and partly that he's simply not a compelling screen presence. Imagine this film with, say, Fassebender or Mark Ruffalo or someone of that ilk and you'll get a sense of where this movie fails. The execution is also very messy. For a Gothic tale like this to work the structure has to be very sound; but this movie becomes a morass of cheap scares at the half-way mark and never recovers. On the positive side, the atmosphere is well established, the mystery of what it is, exactly, that's haunting the town is well done, and the conclusion was surprising and effective. But I still mourn for what this movie might have been.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very pleasantly surprised!,"I went into this film not knowing anything about it, and found it to be a very captivating; a beautifully woven gothic tale of horror and sorrow, reminding of such written pieces and film adaptions, such as Bram Stokers 'Dracula', and Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. The acting was done convincingly in The Woman in Black; I thought that Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, did a wonderful job with their characters. Janet McTeer, is worthy of a mention too, and Liz White. The musical score of this film was done so well and beautifully. The composer name is Marco Beltrami, and he does well to create an unsettling atmosphere, and create further tension. The setting of this film have been chosen well for this period piece, - very beautiful parts of England, very good use of cinematography have made it feel all the more haunting. As for the story, each individual will respond differently to it, but I personally thought it was strong enough in plot, and tied up (as well as acted) tastefully, beautifully, that I do think post script direction, this is still a very good film. One last thing I'll share; I actually found this film to scare me at some parts. Granted I did watch it alone in the dark, and I love an old fashioned ghost tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Made me jump out of my skin, and i think it should have a higher age rating to be honest,","First the good points:I came to see a horror to make myself jump, and boy did I do just that! It was the usual build up of how intense the scares where, easy reflections in mirrors to heart throbbing choking fits. Sadly for one woman in the cinema she screamed and dropped all her food at the first scare, which was not at all scary, i'm not sure how she coped through the rest. It had quite a good story line, not so original but it was nice to see Harry Potter on something other than ""Harry Potter"".

One of the worst movies in it's kind,Cheap tricks to make you jump and an uninspired script.

There is nothing unique about this movie and the ideas are stale. It's like watching a lame Youtube project but with a few million in funding to make it look nice.To top it all off: Watching Daniel Radcliffe compare it to The Shining in the making-off was ridiculous and at the same time very insulting to such a masterpiece.Avoid wasting money on this turd.,1.0,Anonymous,Horror

There isn't much dialog or action, just good old-fashioned spooky atmosphere. Don't let it fool you - there are some genuinely good scares and creepy moment throughout! The story is also endearing and so is Radcliffe's performance. The makeup and costuming as well as filming and cinematography are classically outstanding, and will hold up for years to come.

Scary but somewhat generic,"Produced by a resurrected Hammer Film Productions, The Woman in Black is a frightening ghost story in the gothic tradition of that studio's mid-century horror films. Although it trades the lurid colors of those earlier features for a bleak, subdued, desaturated palette, it mirrors their relatively high production values with solid art direction and lavish, detailed period sets and costumes. Effectively creepy, The Woman in Black relies heavily on sound to draw the protagonist into dangerous situations, and shock the audience with loud noise scares. In spite of this last generic and occasionally confusing tactic (it is sometimes unclear which of these latter sounds the characters can hear and which are part of the non-diegetic musical score) the entire soundscape does enhance the film's ominous atmosphere and allow for the substitution of images obscured by dark or fog for less mysterious or more costly visual effects.",7.0,Anonymous,Horror
creepy ghost story in a marsh,"This ghost story was pretty good. Lawyer, Arthur Kipps is sent to an English village to dig up dirt on a house that is up for sale.

He goes back to the village and witnesses a child die by drinking some lye. He's given a place to stay by Daily, the rich man in town, whom has also lost a child. He tells Arthur about the legend of the woman and that a child dies soon after she is seen, but Daily is not a believer. So the last part is about Arthur trying to solve the mystery. He finds out why the ghost has come back for revenge and tries to appease her. Frankly, I didn't see how he could stay in that house with all the noises and visions going on. That would be too creepy. And why don't the villagers with kids just move.Any ways, we get a surprise, satisfying ending.FINAL VERDICT: Pretty good, worth a viewing.",6.0,Anonymous,Horror

"For a British film, not excellent... Apart from 2 supporting actors","If the plot involves historical period in a distant British place with abandoned castles, old graveyards and tide waters, then you have a large part of a horror film already in place. And if all main characters have lost someone close, then their mind is willing to accept and see different gloomy matters. Such is the background of awkward and supernatural things happening to and around a poor lawyer and the widowed father Arthur Kipps - normally, but not splendidly played by the former Potter guy Daniel Radcliffe. The real gems of the film are Ciarán Hinds as Sam Daily, a local landowner and Janet McTeer as Elisabeth Daily, Daily's wife, who are really catchy to watch. Well, the whole film is more or less thrilling to watch, but I would have preferred some real evil involved, rather than spiritual phenomenon.

A classic story remade effectively,"In the modern time i struggle to find a genuinely terrifying and enjoyable film. This film is brilliant at creating with intense build ups and bone chilling scenes. As it follows the novel by the author Susan Hill, it gives its own twists to allow its own originality.So do not decline watching this film because you think you know what happens. CGI is used in many cases however it is not over used yet can look slightly silly in same cases. The figure of the woman was well portrayed as unknown and the pale scarred face was particularly sinister especially when it adapted into the environment of multiple scenes. The Gothic, Victorian theme gave it a constant feel of uneasiness and the atmosphere uplifted a very miserable emotion by using foggy,rainy weather and other atmospheric details. Daniel Radcliffe playing as the main character Arthur Kipps was a well developed character and showed great faces of fear and other emotions to analyse to you watching how he is feeling and also adds towards the extreme intensity of the film. At some point i do feel as if the music was slightly over the top especially to uproar jump scares.To conclude this, i believe this to be a very thrilling and scary movie which is unique in many ways. I would definitely recommend this to a horror or Gothic enthusiast.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

It is good to see Radcliffe trying other things post 'Harry Potter'!,"'THE WOMAN IN BLACK': Three Stars (Out of Five)Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) stars in this supernatural thriller about a lawyer who goes up against an evil spirit at a remote village in early 1900's England. The film is based on the book of the same name by Susan Hill. It was written by Jane Goldman and directed by James Watkins. The film is slow paced and light on thrills but effectively moody and Radcliffe is decent doing something other than Potter.Radcliffe plays Arthur Kipps, a young lawyer dealing with the death of his wife. He travels to a remote village for work in order to settle the estate of an English manor owned by a recently deceased woman. The locals want him to leave but he refuses and he soon finds out the reason why. The manor is haunted by the ghost of a woman in black, who preys on children.The movie is extremely slow paced and I found it very hard to stay interested in what was going on. The mood and look of the film is sufficiently spooky though and when something does happen it's somewhat creepy and frightening. It is good to see Radcliffe trying other things post 'Harry Potter' and he's adequate here. Hopefully his star won't die with the end of his popular franchise because he does have talent and hopefully he'll show it off in better projects than this.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fii0IC2l7o",6.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Good for some thrills, but that's about it","What can be said about Daniel Radcliffe's first movie role since Harry Potter's conclusion last summer? Well not a whole lot. There wasn't a lot of depth by any of the actors involved. Mostly not a lot of opportunity - which makes sense when for the majority of the film he's in a mansion isolated from all the other characters. He can either talk to himself, the dog, or the ghosts that pop up constantly (prompting shrieks from the 14 year old girls who are sitting directly behind us, causing us all to have to plug our ears and me to question if before the end of the movie whether my ears will be bleeding from the trauma).This movie is based on a novel which I never read, or even knew existed; It's another vengeful ghost story, with lots of scares that everyone sees coming. But this one doesn't entirely make sense. I guess the writers figure a ghost or spirit doesn't have to be rational. But the vengeance The Woman in Black was taking seemed unrelated to her personal vendetta, and therefore petty.The atmosphere set this movie up for some good scares (mostly ruined by everyone in the theatre), some delivered better than others. It did get a little repetitive after a while, which is sad for a 95 minute film. Daniel Radcliffe's character must not scare easily either. I never got any sort of read on his emotional state for most of the movie. He mostly just looked nonchalant, occasionally mildly surprised or curious. Not nearly the right reactions for the circumstances.I blame the producers for this lackluster suspense They are probably guaranteed to make money, as most scary movies make more than they cost, and most people will tend to go to anything with Daniel Radcliffe. With the exception of maybe a couple of the secondary actors, it is clear that the cast did not require serious acting skills and were probably paid accordingly. But hey, they made a movie with Harry Potter; they can tell their kids that some day.This movie is good for some thrills, and that's about it. If you're into that sort of thing, then by all means, check it out.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Old fashioned spooker delivering on its perilous period promise.,"Old fashioned spooker delivering on its perilous period promise.The Woman in Black is directed by James Watkins and adapted to screenplay by Jane Goldman from Susan Hill's novel of the same name. It stars Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer. Music is scored by Marco Beltrami and cinematography by Tim Maurice-Jones. Plot has Radcliffe as young London solicitor Arthur Kipps, who is sent to the North East village of Crythin Gifford to clear up the affairs of deceased woman Mrs. Drablow. When he arrives he finds that the memory of Drablow, and her remote house of Eel Marsh, holds the village in a grip of fear, particularly those who have children.....It's fitting that that bastion of British horror, Hammer Studios, should be behind this delightful period ghost story. For this positively oozes old fashioned values, harking back to all those wonderful spookers set around a creepy village that featured an even creepier castle or mansion at its core. More presently, the film has kindred links to the likes of The Orphanage, The Others and The Changeling, while the vengeful spirit acting out of Eel Marsh House is pumped by J-Horror like blood. So clearly The Woman in Black is not a fresh arrival to the horror splinter where the ghost story resides. However, great period ghost story films are in short supply, and Watkins' film most assuredly is a great entry in the sub-genre.Propelling it forward is Watkins' (Eden Lake) excellent sense of mood and crafting of palpable unease. Quite often the better ghost story films are better because they operate on a what you don't see is what scares you more level, Watkins has managed to keep that aspect of his film whilst also giving us enough of the truly terrifying spirit to jolt us in our seats; often showing her to us and not to Radcliffe's Kipps! When the shocks come, and there are many and they are bona fide underwear soiling, they act as merciful releases from the built up dread, but then when Watkins doesn't deliver a shock, we are left waiting uneasily, darting our eyes all over the expansive frame, searching fruitlessly for a glimpse of something troubling. Did that wind up toy move? Is that a pallid face we just glimpsed in the shadows? That damn rocking chair is the scariest there has ever been! And on it goes....A film such as this is only as good as the production design and setting for the story. Thankfully Watkins and his team have nailed it there as well. Eel Marsh House exteriors are Cotterstock Hall in Northamptionshire, perfectly foreboding, while the beautiful village of Halton Gill in the Yorkshire Dales gets a Hammer Horror make over to become Crythin Gifford. But it's with the interior of the house where the makers excel, an utterly unforgiving and upsetting place, brilliantly under lit by Tim Maurice-Jones for maximum scary effect.On the acting front the film rests solely on the shoulders of Radcliffe, and he comes up trumps. Initially its awkward accepting him as the father of a young boy, and once he gets to Crythin Gifford he is dwarfed by all the other adults who live there, but once the Victorian setting envelopes him the awkwardness evaporates and the characterisation becomes more realistic and easy to sympathise with. The character is changed from the book, meaning Radcliffe has to carry inner torment as well as exuding an outer coat of trepidation blended with stoic fear. It should be noted that for much of the picture he is acting on his own, reacting to the house and the overgrown gardens and marshes, in short he is terrific and it augers well for his adult acting career. In support Hinds and McTeer are pillars of professionalism, with McTeer's Mrs. Daily a creepy character in her own right, but it's also another neat meditation on grief that sits alongside Arthur Kipps'.The ending is also changed from that in the novel, and it's already proving to be divisive. How you react to it, and it is up for a two-fold interpretation, may dampen your overall enjoyment of the picture? Personally I have no issue with it, I was still sunk in the cinema chair breathing heavily at that point! The certification and the presence of Radcliffe ensures that a teenage audience will flock to see it, many of whom will not get the ""horror"" film that they are after. Hopefully the word will get out that this really is only a film for those who love a good boo jump ghost story of old, that's its target audience, and that's the people whose reviews you should trust. 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

I would say he acted better in this than he had done through out Harry Potter (certainly the early stages anyway!) Even when he wasn't speaking his body language was perfect.Not only did some of the actors impress me but I also enjoyed the fantastic camera work. It kept you on edge, waiting for that moment when something was going to appear and make you jump, then just when you thought may be nothing was going to happen something did happen and really caught me by surprise.The romance in it was also very believable and the twist at the end was very touching and unlike some horrors, I thought it worked really well.One thing I must say is that for a 12A this was very scary indeed, I would have put it at a 15 for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Gothic Ghost Story,"Hammer Films returns to classic Gothic Horror with a ghostly tale of revenge and regret. The film is based on a book by Susan Hill written in 1983 about a ghost that only appears just before a child dies. Hammer Films is best known for their beloved Gothic Horror classics from the 1960s and 70s with such titles as The Horror of Dracula and The Evil of Frankenstein. Hammer Studios churned out numerous classics before having to close up shop in the 1980's. The film studio returned last year with Let Me In, the remake of Swedish film Let the Right One In. The Woman in Black has that Gothic Hammer feel that fans of the classics will love. It delivers lots of thrills and scares with loads of atmosphere. This movie is in no way a remake of the 1988 TV movie version of the same story. The film is dark and scary and reminded me most of one of my favorite Ghost storiesThe Changeling. Daniel Radcliffe is fresh from filming the hugely successful series, Harry Potter. He plays a much more serious role in this film as Athur Kipp, a young widowed Father and Lawyer. His employer sends him to a small English village to complete the task of sorting through an estate left by a woman who lived in an old haunted mansion on a remote island. The townspeople do not welcome him except for one eccentric couple. No one is willing to take him out to the abandoned house for fear of the evil on the Island, but he does eventually find a ride out to the house. As soon as he arrives at the Mansion, the Ghost appears and starts to cause serious problems for the small village. The only way to solve these problems is to unravel the mystery of why the Ghost appears and how to make her at peace. The Woman in Black is essentially a classic Ghost story in a haunted Gothic Mansion. The set design of the house is very realistic and detailed giving the film loads of atmosphere and character. The story is gripping and tragic with one of the scariest ghosts ever put on screen. This movie would be the perfect choice to introduce a non-horror friend to the Genre. It is beautifully shot and has the goods to deliver the scares. Seeing that Gothic movies, ghost stories in particular, are one of my favorite types of Horror movies, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and am looking forward to what Hammer will be releasing next.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror

Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent on a mission to a foreign village (The Causeway to Osea Island, Maldon, Essex, England.)

"Yes it used every trick in the book, but....","Yes this movie did use every trick in the book, but I have to say in this case they worked. I was jumping with every shadowy figure that crossed the screen. I was slightly afraid I wouldn't be able to see Daniel Radcliff as anything other than Harry Potter, but I had no issue separating the two in this film. He did a wonderful job embodying the character! All in all I have to give this movie 10/10 stars because despite the cliché tricks, I was actually frightened because the movie drew me in and made me feel like I was in the creepy old house with Arthur, feeling the same terror he was feeling. A great movie, that made me feel satisfied after seeing in a theater. A must if you like a movie that makes you jump, and gets your heart pounding.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Haunted House is Back - but that's all,"Reading some of the reviews by people who highly rated this movie, I could conclude only that they came from people who grew up on Harry Potter books and movies, because this is a very poor ghost story and even weaker horror movie. I tried to suspend my overriding feeling that Harry Potter had grown up to become an estate agent (US: real estate guy), but it was hard to shake because Radcliffe is so typecast by being the main actor in the ELEVEN movies based on J K Rowling's novels about a school where kids learn magic.The movie had good production values, but the haunted house is the best thing in it. I couldn't rate it higher than 5/10, because the script is predictable, the dialogue is cliched, and the acting is middling - except for Radcliffe, who drags it down to amateur level. His displays of emotion are often inappropriate for the scene - he doesn't look scared when he should but does look scared when he shouldn't. He often seems too stiff and flat to be credible, and he needs to learn to relax his arms so we aren't feeling his internal tension about performing. OK, he was just in his early twenties when he made this movie, but I haven't seen an improved performance in any of his latest movies either.Radcliffe is not as annoying as a Hollywood nepo baby, but neither is he far away from such a status, either. I'm not sure if another actor could have rescued this mess of a movie, but Radcliffe clearly couldn't. Maybe if he makes it up with J K Rowling, he can appear in the twelth Harry Potter movie: Harry Potter and the Deathly Acting.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Exciting and thrilling.,"A thrilling movie from start to finish. The props in the movie play out in the movie as part of the story and not just their sitting in the background. In the first scene you get a hint of where the story will go, but then it makes a turn and keep you guessing till the end. The camera angles and cinematography outstanding. Its good to see Daniel Radcliff in such a dark role in a movie a big difference from his you harry potter days. Exciting and suspenseful.It kept me jumping in my seat from start to end. I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to get out and see a thrilling dark movie.It is definitely a great date movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
All Atmosphere; No Substance,"Scary movies are supposed to be scary; this one is not. There are more holes in this story than a large portion of Swiss cheese. It does get an A for production values, however. Harry Potter gives us his best efforts, but he cannot possibly escape his child personna with his average acting ability. Three children suddenly commit suicide and that is the basis for beginning this tedius, (and sometimes boring) tale of supposed horror. I have had haircuts that were more horrible than this film.
The supporting cast is stilted and pretentious. Some of the scenes are stilted and pretentious as well. It was a good try at Gothic horror, but it clearly fails to deliver the goods. Harry is supposed to be a failing lawyer. He also has trouble paying his bills with the not so subtle scene of his bills in his suitcase. The film reminded me of a much more expensive version of The Blair Witch Project; another piece of contentious kaka, that would possibly only scare seven-year-olds; just like this one. As for an adult movie-goer, you would be well-advised to see Snow White and the Seven Dwarves as a rental rather than this tedius attempt at horror. ""That was a scary one, eh kids?""

The woman in black,"Having watched this film 3 times in the cinema, i would like to think i am in a good position to review it. I am a big fan of horror movies and recently i haven't seen a good horror film that is generally creepy since last years insidious. The reason this is a great film is not just that it's creepy and jumpy but it's got good diolouge and a interesting storyline. One complaint i would have is that i could have done with more scares, all the scares were bunched together in small bursts which were over within a matter of a few minuets. A big question that people want answered would be,''is Daniel Radcliffe good in a different role?' well, yes, he is. Not once in the film did I think of him as harry potter, maybe because of his beard and lack of glasses. He was very convincing and I hope to see him again. As for people critisising the film? Well what did you expect? It's a horror movie made to scare and entertain, and on that front it definitely delivers. I would recommend this to anyone 13 or over.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Daniel Radcliffe Exploitation Show,"How much you will enjoy this movie will rest heavily on how much you would enjoy looking at Daniel Radcliffe for two hours. For the entirety of the movie, he is either on the screen or a few seconds away from being so. Daniel Radcliffe is a handsome man; great posture, very well-dressed and the sideburns give him a completely new look that is far and away from Harry Potter. But half an hour into the movie, I'm already sick of looking at him. If it was Emma Watson for two hours, then that'd probably be good entertainment for me but I suppose there are lots of movie goers who would prefer Daniel Radcliffe and this should prove good entertainment for them.The movie plot is a ghost story but really is an excuse to get Daniel Radcliffe alone inside a house where he cautiously walks from room to room with sudden jack in the boxes frights. We get long shots of him cautiously walking towards something and then BAM! something pops out and then we have another long shot of him reacting and adjusting. A large portion of the movie is spent simply looking at Radcliffe. I remember a few such movies where we spend half the movie looking at beautiful female leads but here looking at Radcliffe isn't as engaging for me.As a horror movie, it's around par or slightly below par. The low budget really shows through and the unimaginative use of the limited budget really makes the movie grind. The scares are cheap and as the movie goes on, it only increases in frequency rather than in scale and so, the movie really never takes off instead just plodding along. On the other hand, by not being one of those digital camera horror movies, it has some clear beautiful shots but again, somewhat wastes it by staying indoors and only using glimpses of the beautiful setting and outdoors of the location. However, in my book, its biggest fault is that it is simply without many new ideas, if follows the horror genre recipe to the tee and becomes rather predictable.The focus, the center, the star and the reason for the movie is Daniel Radcliffe and unfortunately, there is not much more. This is probably a good enough reason for a lot of movie goers. However, I found the movie dour, risk-averse and unimaginative.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nostalgia-Inducing gem,"When I was 12 years old I had watched ""The Woman in Black"" in the theater and was scared to death, but it was also etched in my memory. Today, ten years later, I went with my dad to watch the new version, excited to see how Daniel Radcliffe had done, as I have followed his career since his first Harry Potter role.At first I thought that he is too young to be playing a father and a widower in this movie, but 10 minutes into the movie I was only seeing the character, which speaks for Radcliffe's ethos and ability as an actor. I felt proud of him as a fan of his to see him playing his role so well. He uses his face and his body in a very effective way, carrying the plot gracefully and convincingly. This is definitely a success story for Mr Radcliffe.Apart from the acting, which was all great, the cinematography is simply amazing. The site chosen for the house in the movie is simply perfect, so old and majestic it can hardly be separated from the landscape, which has a road leading to it which is very appropriate for Susan Hill's novel.Also, the soundtrack is interesting, often contributing effectively to creating the horrific illusion.All in all, this new version of ""The Woman in Black,"" is a beautifully made film, as well as very loyal to Susan Hill's excellent story. It is a breath of fresh air from other, overtly violent horror films, as it is one of the few truly mysterious and atmospheric stories of our time. It is a beautiful story, yet quite sad, but leaving the theater today I was feeling more in touch with myself, which I believe is what a well-told story does to one.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Daniel Radcliffe has decided to end his career early...,"This is honestly the worst film I have seen in some time. I don't generally watch films that I think won't be great, so by general standards it's probably not that bad...Key weaknesses are : - A plot reliant on consistently irrational behaviour by several of the characters, particularly Kip. I know scary films aren't really about the plot, but this just doesn't make sense in places.Serious lack of dialogue - The average sentence length must be under 20 words, and whole scenes pass in which Kip and everyone else are silent in circumstances that would almost certainly lead them to say something. Maybe this is meant to be 'moody'.Really over-done soundtrack. This starts with the preposterous thundering roar from a tap being turned on, and continues. You don't need to do this to be scary, just go watch the Shining to realise that.Having said that, there are some high points : - Excellent period setting, very carefully researched, very few inconsistencies or anachronisms.Beautiful camera work in places. The aerial shots over the causeway leading out into the sea are just breathtaking.Strong performance by Ciaran Hinds. His portrayal of the tormented, yet hospitable country squire puts Radcliffe to shame.In a recent interview Danny boy said that to interest him the plot had to be strong, and that he wouldn't do film just for the sake of it. So the question is was he drunk when he signed the contract or did he do this film for a bet?",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant,"Film was brilliant, good story line, some of the moments was really scary. All the time of film could feel the tension and some of the times i hold my breath. The end was unexpected.

It was my first horror film I watched in cinema, but never ever again going to watch a horror film in cinema. Who let the kids in films like that?!!!!

TOO much suspense can be disappointing...,"I give The Woman in Black a 5 out of 10. Watching the trailer and being impressed; I expected a lot from this movie! With an incredibly intriguing beginning, it most definitely gets the audience interested. It leaves a lot of unanswered questions which we are keen to find out in the rest of the movie. A little slow paced than some other movies of the same genre; it takes a while for anything incredibly gripping to take place. There is an incredible amount of suspense which takes place in this movie, maybe...a little TOO much. We see more suspense than action. Suspense is good but not when it turns into the audience actually 'wanting' something to happen. A lot of suspenseful scenes end with an abrupt cut; leaving a slight disappointment. Due to all the scenes not being clearly defined; if not explained to the audience at the end...I'm not sure 50% would get it if we walked into a cinema not having a vague clue about the storyline. The positive? The time period of this movie is definitely felt through the direction, scenery and use of language in the film. The crispness of the sound and the slight cold chill in the cinematography is good - helping us to understand the fear in the characters! As for Radcliffe, it is a little hard to shake off that 'Harry Potter' character he is known for. He does do a OK job, however, cast too young for such a strong character. Some actors can play all sorts of roles and some should maybe just stick to one kind.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Magnificent Ghost Story,"I enjoyed the original movie this one is based on a great deal and went into the theater hoping that the producers had remained true to the feeling of the original movie. For once, I was not disappointed. This is an excellent adaptation that changes just enough of the elements to make the movie reach a more modern audience. The updated special effects are done subtly so that they don't overpower the plot and mood of the movie.The mood is what makes this move so unique and the way it builds up. Daniel Radcliffe is the beginning of that mood doing an excellent job of portraying a man who is already melancholy for personal reasons. He comes to a village that seems to be shrouded in a miasma of fear and superstition. The dark mood builds steadily unfolding at just the right pace to create and maintain tension to the movie's conclusion.There are jump scenes in the movie, but they add to instead of destroying the tension. The acting is excellent. The story is solid and compelling, the characters are ones we can sympathize with. The setting is magnificent, the house and grounds and village all have their own unique personality. Even the use of color is carefully manipulated to create a sense of place and contrast of mood. The movie as a whole is a beautiful piece of art.This is the best ghost story I have seen in a very long time and as a fan of horror, that is saying a great deal.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror

Every Scary Movie Trick Possible. Yawn.,"If you're a fan of horror flicks, this movie will eventually annoy and bore you. It's like the directors or whatever movie-powers-that-be just decided to throw every possible haunted house scary movie trick into this movie, pretty much all into one or two major haunting scenes, and then called it a day. Shadows that move? Check. Wild flying bird or rogue grounds-keeper rushing into the shot unexpectedly to induce audience screams? Check. Appearing and disappearing figures in the distance? Objects moving on their own, bumps in the night, sinister screams from the great beyond? Check check check. And YAWN. There was also not an original aspect of this plot, the ""what's the point?"" behind this woman in black. Not a one. It's going to be exactly what you suspect.Now with all that said, there are a few (stress, FEW) things the movie handles pretty well. There's a LOT of darkness and silence in this movie which enhances the goosebumps of anticipation. That's good. Also the way the movie began and ended was satisfactory. You think you know what's going to happen at the end and you do. But when you REALLY get to the end, you're like ""oh, well that was unexpected and kinda cool."" But that's it. Just kinda cool, not even pretty cool and definitely not really cool.Plenty of people left the theater declaring how awesome this was and how it's about time someone made a ""good scary movie"". Those same people also screamed at EVERYTHING all the way through. So I suppose that means if you scare easily, you'll like it. Otherwise, wait for redbox or something.AustinInWonderland.tumblr.com @AustinFlowers",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Genuinely spooky ghost story - very well done a must see,This is an excellent adaptation of Susan Hill's novel about a young man who goes to settle the affairs of a recently deceased woman in an old spooky house where he sees a woman in black. People in the village are scared and it involves the children. It's so refreshing to watch a ghostly horror story instead of a gory slasher movie like Nightmare or Friday etc. A real ghost story is more frightening and much more entertaining in the end. A single ghostly apparition is more scary than all the CGI and shock tactics that many modern movies use. Daniel Radcliffe's face is older and he suits the role. His short stature isn't obvious. He acts well and his facial expressions are good. He is versatile. Looks like he has a good grown up career ahead of him after Harry Potter. Supporting cast like Janet McTeer and Cirian Hinds are good too. The production is very well done. The eerie house (where did they find it?) and village are very authentically recreated. Well captured atmosphere and good photography. I saw the stage play in London and this movie is much better and grander. For those who know the Hammer productions this is much more big budget and beautifully filmed. The story is consistent and makes logical sense in its own supernatural way. in The ending is in the Hammer tradition. A must see.,10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Does justice to the book and earlier film. Scared me witless!,"As an ardent fan of the 1989 TV film, I had very high expectations of this big screen adaption. And I was not let down.It scared me witless!What I really liked about this version was that they embraced the woman in black throughout the movie. You see her throughout the movie which keeps her always in the front of your mind. Every time they had a shot of Daniel, I found myself concentrating on the background. It was really un-nerving. Some others have said she is seen too much, I disagree. The suspense was awesome (luckily, I downloaded this movie and could pause for 10 minutes every so often to get my nerves back--OK it took me 5 hours to watch this 90 minute flick!) Although the end was different from the other versions (book and earlier film), I still think it maintained the character of the book. She would never forgive except perhaps right at the end.Overall, very watchable and very enjoyable. One of the best films of 2012 so far (OK it's only February).",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Predictable jump scares around an overused plot,The Woman in Black isn't a bad movie. It's just average. Extremely average. I don't take average as bad though and I enjoyed watching this movie. Radcliffe does a great job in the movie but his character isn't anything special. He just plays a simple man who really acts a fool around sketchy stuff.My main gripe with the movie is how almost all the jump scares are predictable and the ones that aren't don't add anything to the movie or establish the ghost in any way. Makes it feel more like a haunted house attraction than an actual scary movie.What is great about the movie is the acting that I've already mentioned and the amazing cinematography. Many of the scenes would make for a really nice poster or wallpaper and I really enjoyed the scenes we get to see.Overall it's an average horror film that's very predictable in both the plot and the scares. Tries to throw in a twist ending but it didn't hit home for me at all. Pretty movies though,5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Woman in Black is gold,"For someone who has read the book, watched the stage play and briefly seen the TV adaptation, I had high hopes for this movie as soon as I knew it was being released. Wasn't sure about Radcliffe but I was willing to give it a chance, and I am now prepared to say I was wrong to doubt him. He carries this film extremely well and I totally forgot he was Harry Potter in former life. Fair enough there were a few 'wooden' moments but in all, his expressions and acting was faultless. The movie itself was at just the right pace. An eerie slow burner, making the audience tense and always looking for when the next scare will be. There were a fair few jump moments that many people criticised but for me, they were needed in a film like this. There were plenty of eerie spine chilling moments too that didn't need the use of a jump scare, so they evened each other out.It was pretty loyal to the book, apart from a few minor details, and of course the ending is totally different. But the premise of the movie stayed the same. The ending for me was a good idea, but it lacked the shock factor that I believe it needed for my 8/10 to rise to 9/10. It left me feeling a little disappointed.The sets, scenery, acting and the house especially were fantastic. The woman also doesn't disappoint. When seen, she got the whole Cinema screaming, something I have never seen in a Cinema ... Even Paranormal Activity 1 & 2.Overall, the movie was very good. Didn't scare me, but it certainly made me jump and gave me the creeps. Disappointed with the ending, but there were plenty of well done scenes (Rocking Chair moment especially) to make up for it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A great British horror thriller!,"I recently watched this movie, with a couple of friends. We all decided to watch it after hearing that it was really scary. They weren't wrong. This film had the whole audience screaming in fear. This film had many scares and jumps thy scare you. What I also like, I that you don't see most of the scares coming.The plot is about a young man, Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) travelling to a village where he meets a terrorising killer ghost ( the Woman in Black). This ghost is probably one of the scariest ghosts in all of film mainly because it kills children. It doesn't just ""kill"" children, it forces them to kill themselves in brutal ways. Another thing, I felt, was that the ghost was in most of the scenes, even though it shouldn't really be there, I found this mysterious and creepy. I enjoyed watching the character Daily (Ciarán Hinds), who doesn't believe in the ghost. I felt that he was a warm kind character who was pleasant to watch. Another thing I loved were the creepy antique dolls that felt alive and watching everything happen. By the end of the film I didn't know whether to feel happy for Arthur or sad.This is a great British horror film that will make you jump and has plenty of scares and shocks. I hope this film gets great reviews and you should watch it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as good as the book,"After my wife and I saw this movie more than a bit disappointed and confused. A lot about the story didn't make sense. I decided to read the book... a really short read...

I have been reading ghost stories since I was a child in the 70's and this book ranked way up there for me. I don't know why Hollywood insists on rewriting stories for the screen as though they think they know better than the author did. I understand that sometimes a book can't be fit into 90 minutes but that would not have been the case here. Please... watch the movie, but then read the book.

"Typical atmospheric horror, without anything truly great in it.","This movie turned out to be a bit of a disappointment. It was being far too formulaic with its approach and story and it was lacking any true great creativity or originality. It besides is even a lackluster one, with only just a couple of false scares in jump scares in it, that really shouldn't surprise any of the horror fans out there.I really don't like it when a horror movie gets stretched out, by not telling you anything, for the longest time. The viewers are being left in dark for too long by its mystery. You have no idea what is going on or at what direction the movie is going with its story. In my opinion this all is just a lame excuse and a cheap way for the movie to be filled with as many jumps scares as possible, before finally revealing its twist and reveal what its mystery was all supposed to be about.And when the movie finally reached that point, I had already lost interest in it. I just wasn't taken at all by its story, or any of its characters. Perhaps if the movie had some more excitement and originality in it, it could had still interested me and that way I could had also enjoyed this movie more for what it was; a typical atmospheric ghost-story.The movie now instead came across to me as all buildup but without a decent enough payoff to any of its buildup. It really all makes ""The Woman in Black"" a disappointing watch.It's also sadly miscast. I'm not saying that Daniel Radcliffe is a bad actor but he was obviously not the right choice for his role in this movie. He's far too young to play a convincing enough widower, with a young son. It just doesn't feel and look right, seeing him interacting with other adults, that treat him as equals, while they are obviously all, at the very least, twice his age. It worked far too distracting for me and often took me out of the movie, especially when he's doing scenes together with Ciarán Hinds.Now, the only thing that does make this movie somewhat watchable is its good and dark atmosphere. It's a good horror atmosphere really and it also still handles some of its horror well. I only did wish that the overall movie was a bit more exciting and original, that way I would had liked this movie far better.Really a horror you can easily skip on.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

Fantastic,I can not believe what some people are saying about this film. It's a very good horror film period. There are jump scares in a every single haunted house film. There are supposed to be.

I at least thought the fear and horror in the movie was the redeeming point when I checked out the poster in front of the theater, but I made a huge mistake. I didn't expect the plot and the horror bits to be so predictable. If you've seen many horror movies back in the 1980's-90's that's exactly the type you'll be getting.

A very enjoyable scary movie,"First off I am not the biggest fan of scary movies in general, but I wanted to see Daniel Radcliffe in his first role outside of Harry Potter. I was really surprised and impressed by the movie. Even outside of Dan Radcliffe the rest of the cast put on a really strong performance, especially Ciaran Hinds. It manages to scare you and build up great suspense without the use of blood and gore. It has a really strong plot unlike most scary movies these days and it feels complete by the end of the movie.

Therefore has a very weak plot line.There is also terrible direction in this title, as every single moment in the film that is meant to be a jump scare, or just a scary moment in general, is easily predictable and obvious at every turn.This film is also very boring. I feel it just drags on and on and on without really getting anywhere.

HORRIFYING horror movie,"The woman in black is a truly terrifying film to watch. This movie definitely is not one of those run of the mill stupid cheesy horror films, this movie scared me to death in almost every scene. Daniel Radcliffe is very affective as the lead, and did very well in my opinion, he was very believable. The movies setting is very affective and has an eerie feel to it. The costume design was spot on, and so was the script! The scares are genuine and very bone chilling! They don't resort to the stupid cliché over used and ineffective jump scares. The film is also beautifully shot, it looks very slick and well directed! The storyline is very interesting and intriguing. The characters are creepy and perfect for this type of movie. The woman in black is a very eerie, frightening, and creepily effective film with very good acting. 10/10 for the woman in black.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror

Hammer returns,"Hammer Films is best known for a series of Gothic horror movies in the '50s and '60s. The studio was out of the scene for a few decades but restarted a few years ago. It has now released one of the most impressive horror movies of the millennium. Daniel Radcliffe in his first post-Harry Potter role plays a lawyer given the job of selling an abandoned manor. But this manor has a whole history with which he should have acquainted himself.The movie is not at all about cheap scares or gore. It's more psychological, resulting in some truly tense scenes. Seriously, they know how to make you jump. There's even a little surprise at the end. It's one movie that I really recommend. I will be eager to see what kinds of other roles Daniel Radcliffe goes on to play.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A bump too far in the night,"I had not seen this film before and I thought on the darkest night of year, December 20th I would at last watch this. I found it unremittingly morbid and lacking in any sense of humanity as I know it. I have no idea if it is meant to be taken seriously but as it has no sense of even black humour ( watch ' The Bride of Frankenstein ' for that ) I assume it it is. For me there were too many bumps in the night and the body count of children was nauseating. I respect Susan Hill's early work, but I do not respect this. It also has a shock ending that I found gratuitous and pious at the same time - not a good combination. It is deeply pessimistic about revenge which I also found unpleasant. Daniel Radcliffe was not very good, but then there was nothing here to extend his talent. As for the cut out paper thin characters the less said the better. I also have no idea why it has been such a success, but then shallow sensationalism often is. It was like a ride on a Ghost Train and an unwanted visit to the House of Usher at some kind of horror park afterwards. The visuals were not that convincing, and afterwards I returned to the real horrors in this current world that sadly I could relate to more. A generous 3.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

"full of clichés, slow and greatly miscast","I am really sorry to have to reduce most of my review about this film to the fact that it all starts with a bad casting choice, but it's really very hard to see past Daniel Radcliffe portraying a father of a four years old boy. I mean, how can I possibly buy into it when the DVD of the latest Harry Potter film is plastering every single window of every store in town right now? It doesn't matter how much facial hair Daniel is growing to disguise his baby face, or how far away he's trying to take his new character from the 'boy who lived', or even how little dialogue he speaks in this film (because let's admit it, it usually all falls apart as soon as  he opens his month), I am just NOT buying into it! A grown man (A lawyer in fact!) who's been married, widowed and has a child of 4? That is a big leap of faith...However I was willing to take the leap and I did really try my best, despite the film itself doing virtually nothing to help me and convince me otherwise: there was not a single mention of his young look from any of the characters and we are just supposed to take it all from granted. At some point in the beginning there was even shot of what looked like the Hogward Express, running through the British landscape, with steam and all the rest (I was expecting to hear John Williams' tune at any point!).Radcliffe himself does try his best to restrain his usual trade-mark heavy breathing. The film-makers made sure he spoke as little as possible and wisely they even avoided having him standing right next to any other cast members (so that it wouldn't show how short he is which would have made it even more laughable). But unfortunately all this is just not enough and his presence, instead of making the film better, holds it back..It's probably not very fair to criticise a movie just for his main lead, even less fair to compare it to previous movies the same lead starred in, I agree. But even when you take Radcliffe out of this film, you're actually left very little else.""The woman in Black"" wants to be a film about ""mood""  and ""atmosphere"" more than ""action"" and ""twists"". It's more about the expectations of the ghost in a looked room at the end of the corridor than the actual reveal of the ghost itself. In a way, it's an old fashion ghost story: it's all about those creaks in a old house, the thick fog hiding a secret and those eerie shadows that should make your skin cold.On paper all this sounds great and I am all in favour of an old-style good ghost story... If only it was all building up to something... Alas the pace is evenly slow and Daniel is alone for most of the film investigating strange noises around the house for what feels like an eternity; so much so that after a while it all gets rather repetitive and tedious.James Watkins was probably aware of this and in order to ""jazz it all up"" decided to pepper it all with several ""fairly predictable"" loud stabs of cheap scares. I say ""fairly predictable"" because as an average horror fan I could see most of those ""jumps moment"" coming from miles away. Of course some of them are quite effective, but I don't think that should be a mark of a good horror film. It's certainly not difficult to scare people with a loud crashes and bangs in the middle of a very quiet scene.I couldn't help feeling there was nothing in this film that I had not seen before... A haunted house, rocking chairs moving by themselves, spider webs, locked doors, ghosts appearing in windows, a graveyard at night, thick fog and quicksands, old fading photographs ... No cliché was left untouched. Oh look, Daniel is reflected in a window! How long will it take until a ghost appears in the reflection. Not long, believe me.As for the plot itself, it really feels rather dated, like a story that belongs to a different era, which in theory should be fine, but 10 minutes into the film I really get the feeling that I have already seen it all.I haven't read the original story, nor seen the stage play, but by watching this film alone I do get the feeling that this is a short story stretched to its limits. Probably OK for a twilight Zone episode, or maybe even or a theatre stage, but as a film, aside from some interesting visual imagery, there was just not enough to keep me intrigued for the length of the film and by the time the ending came I just did not really care who lived or died.Very very very disappointing. In fact quite laughable. Full unedited review on MovieGeekBlog.com",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
The Woman in Black is an old-fashioned horror film with a well handled suspense.,"Summary: The Woman in Black is an old-fashioned horror film with a well handled suspense. 82/100 (B+)The Woman in Black is directed by James Watkins and it's a remake of the eponymous 1989 movie based on the book by Susan Hill. Moving on, the opening scene is strange and creepy, I liked it. Anyway, I have to admit that the first act was kinda slow and a little bit boring. Surprisingly, the second half is more violent, intense and suspenseful. Also, I liked the performances, Daniel Radcliffe performs a single dad called Arthur Kipps and another standout performances were from Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer. I also loved the old-fashioned style of the film, it has a splendid selection of period furniture and costume design.The Woman in Black boasts an impressive level of terror, the atmosphere of the film is frightening and most of the scares were unpredictable. Also, the sound effects were terrific and so well done. It has no gore, but instead of that, it delivers so many effective scares, I almost died! There was enough originality on its surprises. Even though I have to admit that this horror movie is more of the same crap, I mean: the loud noises, things moving by itself and creepy shadows; still scary as hell! Yeah, it doesn't offer something new to the horror genre, but still terrifying. Also, the stunning camera work increases the dread at times.I'm glad that Watkins decided to use practical effects instead of cheap CGI. The Woman in Black is a movie that does not look crappy or cheaply done. In spite of its modest budget, the production was splendid. Moving on, as I said above the film counts with a very creepy sound design, the loud noises are constant but they came at the right times and efficiently. I saw this film in the morning and it scared the crap out of me, my point here is that it doesn't matter if you see it during the day or at night, it will scare the hell out of you. Watkins proves that he is a talented director and I just hope to know more about him soon. What a horror flick!On the upside: the ending was strangely awesome, the house is creepy as hell (the rooms and empty hallways add some spookiness to the film), it has excellent performances and the production design was great. On the downside: a few jump-scares were unnecessary and the first 30 minutes are boring as hell. So, in conclusion, I recommend it for horror fans and non-horror fans. Woman in Black is an audience pleaser and the perfect film to watch with some friends at night. Although it doesn't offer something fresh or new to the genre, it keeps the tension for most of the time and there's a very scary sequence at the first 50 minutes. (B+)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Not as scary as you've been lead to believe.,"The state of horror films these days is quite poor, as nowadays horror films are less about build-up, good characters and true scares and rather hateful teenagers, jump scares and poor plotting. Would this film, with it's healthy budget, acclaimed source material and the newly reformed Hammer backing it, break this mold? Unfortunately no, as despite positive critic reviews and great box office, this film is quite poor with poor production and nothing vaguely scary.The plot is that a young lawyer called Arthur Kipps has a new assignment: to try to sell a house that has been abandoned for some time. The problem is that the village around the house starts acting strangely when he arrives and the house is haunted by a ghost who curses those who enter with a terrible fate. While the plot does sound creepy initially and there are occasional moments in the film that take advantage of this (mainly the brilliant opening scene), these moments are few and far between, and there isn't much interesting material in between these moments that make the film worth watching.One of the reasons for this is the lack of any originality in the film's setting. I understand that both the film and the book that it was based on is meant to be told in a manner similar to a traditional Gothic tale, and I can respect that. The problem is that it sticks too close to these roots and because of this offers nothing new to this genre. This is highlighted with how the aforementioned haunted house is literally an amalgamation of every haunted house cliché in existence. You have the chairs rocking on their own, family pictures with the eyes scratched out, very dark rooms, a graveyard containing the villain's coffin, the list goes on and on. It honestly feels very derivative, and it ruins any atmosphere that the film wanted to make.Other reasons for this are in the screenplay itself. Outside of the haunted house clichés, there are many other problems. One of these are the major plot holes which undermine the story's serious tone, with the main ones being why no-one is leaving this town if it is cursed by a ghost who kills their children and how Arthur doesn't depart also, despite how everyone is acting weirdly towards him and acting like they've got something to hide, similarly to how the people of Summerisle act towards Police Sergeant Neil Howie in the original Wicker Man. However there it made sense why Howie didn't leave: he was a police officer on a murder investigation, however Kipps is a lawyer trying to sell a house. Not very comparable is it?It also isn't very scary, as the title villain isn't in the movie much , and even when she is, her moments of glory are very brief to the point that if you blink, you'll miss it. For most of the time, exposition tells you about her and what she can do, which isn't very scary at all. I understand that what you don't see is scarier , but in order to make her somewhat threatening, show us what see can do, don't keep telling us, as after a while, it gets pretty boring as you're essentially being lectured about the monster rather than being terrified by it. It is honestly one step away from reading the bleeding book.It isn't enough to say that this is build up either, as good horror films may not show much of the monster through a lot of the running time, but they gave you enough to reward your patience but still keep you curious, and at least showed you the monsters by the end in their full glory, whereas this film doesn't even give you that luxury. At least in Alien and Cloverfield, the monsters at least had an original and interesting design, which made you feel rewarded for your pateince. This film's villain on the other hand is a woman in a black wedding veil. Fail. All of this reduces any menace that the villain has. Considering that it's victims are mainly children, that is quite an astonishing feat.All of these script problems are surprising, considering how great a writer Jane Goldman is as shown by films like X-Men First Class and Kick-Ass. It does show a lack of experience for her, which is excusable considering that this is her first horror film. This inexperience is shared by director James Watkins, which is far less excusable considering that he has worked in the horror genre (director of Eden Lake, writer of The Descent Part 2) before. Sure, he gets good performances from his actors but the film is poorly directed, from the lack of menace from the villain, the fact that the kills get less and less scary as the film goes on, poor atmosphere and the fact that many scenes are very poorly lit (I know the film has black in the title, but this is just ridiculous). Sure, it's not as bad as Monsters, where vital scenes are shot in pitch blackness, but it does recall Spinal Tap, as you ask yourself: ""How much more black could this be?"" And the answer is none. It is honestly a horror film so shoddily made that it makes the low budget horror film Creep look like a professional job by comparison.Overall, this is just a badly made & badly written horror film. Sure it isn't as poisonously bad as The Village and Paranormal Activity, but it is still pretty poor and gives the British film industry a bad name. If this is one of the newly reformed Hammer Studio's tent-poles, then they have clearly lost their way from their much better 50's-70's days of horror.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrifyingly gothic and dark,"Playing out like an old Hammer horror film, perhaps because it is a Hammer horror film(!) this masterpiece is one I've watched many times. The phrase old fashioned gets thrown around a lot but for once it completely applies here, the film could be ripped straight from the 1960s, given a lick of paint and easily called a remaster.Daniel Radcliffe straight off Harry Potter stardom gives it his all here and we're also treated to other veterans like Ciarán Hinds and Janet McTeer. The actual story is similar to the book, but controversially I much prefer the film version.

"""Don't go chasing shadows, Arthur!""","Daniel Radcliffe gives a memorable performance as Arthur Kipps, a London solicitor (attorney) and widowed father of a 4-year-old boy who is on thin ice with his firm due to non-productivity because of grief over his wife's passing. He is given one final chance to prove his value to the firm and keep his job: Go to the remote village of Crythin Gifford and settle the probate affairs of the rambling, secluded mansion of Eel Marsh House, whose tenants recently died. He soon discovers and becomes immersed in the macabre secrets of the house and village in this carefully told story.THE WOMAN in BLACK is the sort of thing I didn't think could still be done these days, a Gothic horror story about a haunted house with a clever, original plot and mythos, disturbing images but no schlocky gore for its own sake, and above all, genuinely frightening qualities. The question of whether or not Kipps will keep his job adds to the suspense. The cinematography is first-rate, with bleakly striking views of the English countryside and village. The early 1900s time period is captured most convincingly. Excellent acting by everyone else as well, particularly the various child actors and Ciarán Hinds as local resident Sam Daily.

Really nothing new. It's a standard ghost mystery with obligatory startles.,"The movie's story line wasn't really anything new or memorable after i left the theater. The only thing believable was the setting and time it took place (I have to give proper compliments to the art direction responsible for the settings, environments and special effects crew). The screen play and build up to the climax wasn't anything to get thrilled or scared about for me. If you have seen The Grudge or The Ring, its easy to find the Woman in Black as just a matinée movie or a movie you can borrow from some one else who owns it.As the story developed to the point when I fully understood why the unfortunate events were unfolding, I still couldn't even feel bad for majority of the characters who had encountered the Woman in Black. I simply could not bond with them. The only character that actually appeared to be a real person was Ciarán Hind's role, whom i actually was curious how his character played in the story. For the supporting character, he drove the movie for me to actually wonder why and how events were unfolding for the brief moments it captured my attention. As for Daniel Radcliffe role, it was not a very likable one for me. Majority of the time he was honestly just walking a slow pace TOWARDS the danger with a candle that never melts in practically 1/3 of the movie. The only thing positive about his role was that i didn't see him as Harry Potter, but this not a break out role for him either. The scenes of him walking in the house were painfully long for me while expecting the traditional violin notes played to build the tension and then BAM!......a cliché something jumping towards the camera. Like i didn't see that coming. Sigh.The only that was surprising was the ending as it was different FOR the movie, but not anything you will take home and feel different about.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Absolutely Terrifying.,"I just finished watching this, and it might be the creepiest movie I have ever seen. It is a fantastic movie, and the acting was good. The only problem I can think of (for others), is that there isn't a lot of dialogue. But, in my opinion it is better that way. This does a great job at being extraordinarily terrifying without any unnecessary blood or guts. It had me screaming the whole time.

Another Below Average Supernatural Horror,"Woman in Black is another supernatural horror movie that looks far better in the trailers than what it actually is. Don't get me wrong, it's not an awful movie, but it's definitely nowhere near as good as what it is made out to be, and it was definitely a disappointment. It is a much slower-paced film as well, which I don't mind as long as there is enough to keep my interest, but there wasn't and it ended up feeling a bit like a chore just to get to the end.Like I said, it's not an awful film and it is watchable, but apart from the odd few jump scares, sudden screaming ghostly faces (which is really becoming a huge cliché now), and a pretty decent creepy atmosphere, there wasn't really anything noteworthy about this film. Yes, the story was there and some decent acting was there, but the film lacked any real tension, originality, and moved extremely slow. These days, a horror movie can only rely on the plus points I mentioned for so long before it gets kind of boring and tedious as it lacks imagination, and Woman in Black falls into that category. The clichéd scares mentioned can be good in a film, but not when that's all that's relied on to carry it.I did mention decent acting was here as well, but unfortunately not much of it came from Daniel Radcliffe as his performance overall was a bit wooden I thought. I don't mind Radcliffe at all (and I'm not afraid to admit that I enjoyed the Harry Potter films), but here his performance was just void of any real depth and was just a bit wooden, like I say.The story was OK (which is one you have to pay attention to as well as you can become lost if you don't), but it wasn't really one that gripped you, or left you sitting on the edge of your seat in anticipation. Like all the other plus points, it was just OK.Woman in Black is watchable and I'd recommend it if you haven't got anything else better to see and want to while away an hour and a half. Just don't expect anything that great is all.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

Daniel Radcliffe sees dead people...,"Mercilessly slow and derivative thriller has a young widower lawyer in London traveling on business to a remote village on the muddy marsh to settle estate papers on a deceased client; turns out the whole terrified town is helplessly under the thumb of a suicide's ghost bent on revenge. Handsomely photographed in a gloom-and-doom manner--much like ""The Others"", which, I'm guessing, was purely intentional--this haunted mansion vehicle for a grown-up Daniel Radcliffe begins well but quickly flags. The pointless story, adapted from a novel by Susan Hill, treads too-familiar territory, while director James Watkins paces the proceedings like a funeral (with 'scare' music cues to add intensity). Radcliffe is a sturdy lad, but his face holds no mystery, and his voice doesn't command attention; he spends most of the picture reacting to ghostly comings-and-goings with his eyes wide and his mouth partially ajar. The finale, which would appear to wrap the plot up satisfactorily, is given a last-minute twist which is neither scary nor moving--just confounding. What will it take the appease this woman in black?

SCARY,THIS FILM WHICH STARS DANIAL RADCLIFFE IS DEFINATLY NOT FOR THE FAINT AT HART,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
These are the sort of windows faces look in.,"'The Woman In Black' is a tribute to the Victorian revival of Gothic-style ghost stories. Thus it concentrates on atmosphere and melodrama. Susan Hill's plot from her novel has been altered for the film to give Kipps (Radcliffe) a back story that creates more audience sympathy toward him. A movie that relies on atmosphere to build up the scares, it falls back on the clichéd 'scared villagers' and 'abandoned house' when it should have concentrated on tighter direction and better camera work. All the scares are of the 'boo, made you jump' variety. Nothing gets under the skin or lodges in the mind to unsettle or disturb the audience, which is strange given that the ghost preys on children and could have been played for those angles. Performances are uneven. Radcliffe doesn't have to do much apart from looking depressed and scared, his character is never fleshed out but that is the fault of the script rather than Radcliffe's acting. Mrs. Daily (Janet McTeer), is unintentionally comic when she's channelling spirits. I found myself actually starting to giggle when she was carving pictures into the table whilst in a trance. Overall, the film is like bread made without enough yeast, it fails to rise or fill out. The relentless use of obvious CGI for the ghosts starts to irritate as well. See if you can spot the blooper where Kipps and Daily (Ciaran Hinds) are shown driving along a modern day tarmac road.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror

The Verdit Is In.......And It Ain't Good For Harry,"For all the Harry Potter fans out there that are saying this was the scariest movie they've ever seen... Well, I'm not surprised. I mean really, since the Harry Potter series was written for kids, it doesn't surprise me that a bunch of 12 year old girls that have a thing for Harry thought this was terrifying. What does surprise me is that they all have IMDb accounts and have no shame in throwing 10 star ratings around like pink glitter and Tootsie Pops... But as much as I love insulting ""the youth"", lets stay on track and go over exactly why this movie blows.The one thing you would think that a period piece like this would have going for it would be atmosphere, right? London at night in the early 1900s with the fog and gas lamp lit streets. Perfect setting for a scare, right? Well, think again dummy. The director manages to get NOTHING from this absolute gift. And even though the production is good and the surroundings look creepy and authentic... It is truly mind boggling how devoid of atmosphere this film actually is. And making matters worse, there's practically no music throughout the movie to set the mood properly either. Instead we are treated to an array of sound effects you would most likely hear at a cheesy haunted house at Halloween.On to acting and dialog. Harry himself isn't that bad, but the writing and the direction is, and he and the rest of the cast suffer because of it. There is little-to-no chemistry between the actors and everything is rushed. Scenes start mid-conversation without characters ever having been introduced and interactions between them that should be creepy and unsettling are over within seconds in stupid 'shock value' scenes leaving you to just chuckle and shake your head in dismay at all the missed opportunities.So, unfortunately for Potter fans no matter how many times you polish a turd, it's still a turd. And that's exactly what this film is: a big stinker. If you're hard-up for this time period I would recommend ""The Others"" which is much better than this mess.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

Back to this movie, I thought the acting was good not the best acting but it gets the job done. Now I don't get scared very easily but I did jump a couple of times. The last 10-20 mins is the intense and scariest minutes in the entire film and that is how the last 10-20 mins in any horror film should be. There will be a lot of people who wont like the movie because there is no blood or gore in it, but that is OK. You don't need blood and gore to make a horror film scary, blood and gore can take away form the story because that is all the filmmakers care about these days. Is this movie worth seeing? Yes I saw in the theaters and normally I don't see horror movies at the theaters because I am just wasting my money, but this movie looked like it would be worth the money and it was. I am surprised that the rating for this movie is at 6.7 I think it should be at least 7.7 but thats just me.

"One or two ""Boo! Haha, scared you!"" are more than enough, thank you.","This film has terrific ambiance, very creepy and gloomy. I'll give it a point for that. I'll give it another point for the fact that it does not fall into the ridiculous modern error of confusing Halloween-like effects of gore and blood with the genuine and time-proved cause for real: the unexplainable and the unknown.Those are the only two points I readily concede. What ruined the whole thing for me and made me lose patience was the old, tired and tiresome hah-made-you-jump effect that occurs seemingly every five minutes in the film. Used once or twice the trick can be effective. Used more often than that it becomes annoying and, as others here very accurately pointed out, just a cheap carnival, haunted-house-ride type of scare tactic. What are we, five?A bloody shame the director and writer decided to go the cheap, childish way. This could have been a great ghost film.

A one-trick pony.,"""Never forgive.A young lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe), widowed from the day of his child's birth, leaves his young son for a few days in London in order to handle the sale of a house in a small village. The villagers are less than welcoming, and the more time he spends there, the more he learns a the tragedy that has and continues to befall the children of the village... and the more he may be putting his own son's life in danger.The Woman in Black is a frustrating movie. For every interesting story turn, there's an irritating flaw that keeps it from being as good as it could have been. My biggest peeve rests on the film's over-reliance on jump scares. They're used so often and predictably that they mostly ruin the effect that the creepy environments manage to muster. It just destroys the immersion factor in a movie for me when there's a loud bang and something suddenly appears in the frame over and over and over.On the positive side, the period setting is a nice change of pace, the story does unravel in an interesting way, and Racliffe does a decent job (though a lot of the time he's just gazing somberly off in the distance or resolutely investigating a suspicious noise, on the way to his next jump scare).The Woman in Black isn't bad, it just doesn't do enough to make itself stand out amongst a dozen supernatural thrillers, and it relies far too much on scare tactics that annoy me far more than they spook me.

The 12a Certificate guaranteed that the auditorium was full of giggly, squealy kids, all taking precious time out from checking their texts to sigh 'Oh my God!' and other suchlike things over 'all-growed-up-Harry-Potter' Daniel Radcliffe.Not that it spoilt the film much. As has been pointed out, the acting was wooden, the 'jump' bits were all so clichéd that you could see them coming a mile off, the structure was a shambles... and it was boring to boot.Even the always-interesting Ciaran Hinds was out of place.The upsides? The cinematography was good, the direction was competent, and the Gothic atmosphere was convincingly created.It was just a shame that the story and characters weren't a match for them.2 out of 10",2.0,Anonymous,Horror
"""What did they see?"" A review on The Woman In Black:","ACTORS: Daniel Radcliffe, Ciarán Hinds, Janet McTeer, Sophie Stuckey, and Liz White.PLOT: A widowed lawyer (Daniel Radcliffe) is assigned to handle the affairs of an old estate, unaware of the dangers it has to offer, and the vengeful curse it has on whomever lays eyes on the woman in black.ACTING: Startling and intense. Difficult to see Radcliffe play a character outside of the Harry Potter world, but manages to subdue our urge for him to lash out an ""expecto patronum"" spell.SCRIPT/PREMISE: Loosely based on the novel by Susan Hill (from my knowledge). Original concept, but somewhat of another familiar ghost story in vain of ""The Ring"" and ""The Haunting"" (only set in the early part of the 20th century).TONE: Dark, a mood piece getting its uneasiness from its gloomy atmosphere, haunting imagery, unnerving silences and frightening moments of ghostly encounters and ""cheap"" scares. Achieves a great deal of eeriness without the use of instrumentals a rarety nowadays.PROS: Scary and eerie. Intriguing and mysterious. Terrifying visuals. A good length. One of the better ghost movies to have been made.CONS: Some may not enjoy the amount of silence in this film. A mood piece not all will appreciate. Too many close ups of ""the woman in black"" risks making the film lose its edge. Some ""cheap"" scares.VERDICT: I personally enjoyed the film, it was mostly refreshing for its genre, and haunting. If you like ghost stories or are into mood pieces, see this film. Otherwise you may not appreciate it.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunted House Flick,"Somewhat typical haunted house movie, creepy old Victorian era home, cobwebs, noises upstairs, everything is there. I enjoyed the movie being in a different era, makes it just a bit more interesting than if it wasn't. In general though the story was a bit weak and the scares mostly cheap jump-scares. This movie suffers from the annoying choice of turning down all the volume and maxing out the jump-scare sound effects to unpleasant levels. Which just results in a worse viewing experience.The performances here were good, though nothing stood out as great. Overall it was quite flat and plain. Directing was fine, not super creative, it has your typical haunted house scenes, someone standing in the yard, behind the window, in the mirror.. you name it.The make-up, set design is done well, the dolls are downright creepy and the dead child looks disturbing. The lady in black sadly looked the worse as it was just a combination of poor lighting and a mix of CGI.The story was imo unfulfilling, I'm all for dark endings but in this case it wasn't really earned and let a big part of the movie kind of be a waste. Also the backstory felt lacking, needed much more, also the town needed more backstory and interaction.Overall it was just fine, not even a horror persé, just a thriller/scary movie but there is no gore. Mediocre thus forgettable.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Thankful for a Good Horror Film!,"I am a fan of the horror genre. However lately, American horror films have really deteriorated in quality, either they are rip-offs of Asian horror films or more of violent and gory ""Saw"" or ""Final Destination""- type films. As the poster and stills of this film promises a return to the old fashioned Gothic horror film, I made sure I watched this.Set in Victorian England, ""The Woman in Black"" is about a young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) who had been assigned to a remote village to fix the papers regarding a certain estate. However, Kipps notes that many children are dying mysterious deaths, and the people seem to blame him for it. Are the deaths of the children related to the mysterious abandoned estate he is working on or the ""woman in black"" he sees lurking in its shadows?From the ominous first scenes, we know this film would be special. I am pretty sure that a word that many reviewers will use to this describe this film is ""ATMOSPHERIC."" The creepy atmosphere that director James Watkins successfully achieves for this film is excellent. It will completely absorb you and bring you into that haunted village and house right along with Arthur Kipps. Yes, there were the usual jump scare techniques, but they were used to great effect. You will gasp in spite of yourself. The use of porcelain-faced dolls and wind-up toys may be old, but still very effectively used to further enhance the scariness of the scenes. Daniel Radcliffe does very well here. I did have a hard time accepting him as a young father at first, as his Harry Potter persona is still very fresh in our memories.Overall, I liked this film very much. I thought I was already jaded after all those horror films I had seen before. This film still succeeded to give me genuine chills and jumps. The gloomy weather, desolate marshy location and antique set design were on point for creating the perfect atmosphere for dread. Okay, this is not at the level of ""Sixth Sense"" or ""The Others"", but it is definitely a step in the right direction as far as the horror genre is concerned. Despite a few illogical scenes (what ghost story film isn't without them?), I will whole-heartedly recommend this film for horror movie fans.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Average,"Daniel Radcliffe, of obvious Harry Potter fame, portrays a young lawyer at the turn of the century, sent to the curiously named Eel Marsh House to put into order the affairs of a dead woman. There, he runs into opposition from the superstitious, distrusting locals and run-of-the-mill supernatural threats, in the form of a malevolent spirit angered by her separation from--and the subsequent death of-- her son.In true Gothic form, The film is dark and atmospheric, making great use of it's gloomy setting, it's slow, steady pace, and lots of creepy old toys. However, the film unfortunately wraps up with an ending that goes from spooky to ludicrously hokey within seconds.Formulaic and highly predictable, the film is still one surely to be enjoyed by fans of the supernatural thriller genre.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
A Hammer Horror Hit,"I had high hopes of this film, having seen the stage play in London a few years ago which was genuinely a very chilling experience. The film didn't disappoint and although Jane Goldman's screenplay alters elements of the original story the overall feel of the film , dark village , misty atmosphere, unfriendly locals , things that go bump in the night certainly kept myself and a packed cinema on the edge of our seats for a roller-coaster ride of horror thrills and chills.Daniel Radcliffe does well and is ably supported from actors more known for TV work in the UK like Ciaran Hinds and Janet McTeer.Lighting is used well throughout the film and and the encounters with the spirits and spooky events are genuinely hair-raising and jump out of your seat moments.This film also proves that you don't have to over do the gore content to have a scary film and much of the suspense and fear for the audience is created in the mind , or from a glimpse of what you see.One of those films where on leaving the cinema you are half expecting to encounter a spooky spectre on your way home !!!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A good old fashioned scare,"I was slightly concerned that this film would turn out to be Harry Potter: The Period Drama, but thankfully, I was wrong.Despite his youth, Daniel Radcliffe manages to pull off his character fairly convincingly and leaves the Harry Potter alter ego at Hogwarts.The film itself is the latest adaptation of Susan Hill's original novel of the same name and marks a triumphant return to the age old classic ghost story format. Although slow in places, Watkins keeps up the suspense throughout and manages to deliver a few unexpected jumps, even for a horror aficionado like me.A great night out at the cinema that will leave you hiding behind your popcorn.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Here comes the woman in black,"To start off, i will say that this film is beautifully shot. Set design and atmosphere is created wonderfully. Now, all we need to make you pee your pants is a truly frightening story. It is a common ghost story; a story i love so much but i can't put in words how much i was bored in the delivery.After viewing, the film leaves you in a baffled state of mix emotions. Do you cuss and throw your arms in the air at the hallow execution or do you shrug your shoulders and appreciate the visual treat the film had provided you. That, or just laugh at the miscasting off Daniel Radcliffe. Him attempting to play a father is like Glitter trying to pull off a loving father role.Daniel isn't a very good actor sadly and his role consists of him strolling the hallways with a lantern while looking perpetual depressed. As hard as it is to make people frightened today, it doesn't unlock the over-usage of jump scares on the audience. Cheap and tacky; only helps to downgrade the film into another rubbish modern horror film.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Brilliant & Well Acted.,"The Woman in Black is utterly brilliant, well acted, well preformed and a good horror film! I disregard the BBFC Rating as I personally think this film should at least be a 15, even if it was cut by 6 seconds; however it was still brilliant! I can not criticise one second of it. Daniel Radcliffe preformed mearly well; and it was a big jump for him after the acclaimed 'Harry Potter.' This is easily one of the best films I've scene and will ever see. It is a good Horror and very jumpy with disturbing parts. It is not suitable for young children; regardless of the rating.

Daniel Radcliffe Is Startled: The Movie,"If you ever wanted to watch basically an hour and a half of Daniel Radcliffe slowly walking up to objects in a spooky house and then getting jump-scared, this is the film for you! If your looking for a legitimately scary film, keep looking. I would have given this film a lower score, but I genuinely like Radcliffe as an actor and enjoy seeing him in movies (even if he wasnt given much to work with here) and the set-design and cinematography were actually pretty great. The old house Radcliffe wanders through is really convincing and creepily imagined. Outside of that though there really isnt anything compelling enough in this film to recommend it to horror fans. The story is bland and predictable and leans too heavily on standard horror movie tropes and jump-scares to be effective in any capacity.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Waste of time.,"I just felt like I wasted my time on this. It was not good at all and I would not recommend it to anyone. I literally went ""Is that it?"" when the credit showed up on the screen. I didn't even get the meaning and there was really no action. It was a depressing environment and no good effort in the acting part. The end will just disappoint you. So do not watch it. I repeat. Do not waste time watching the movie. And also, I didn't really get if it was supposed to be a horror movie, because if so, it didn't work. It didn't scare me, my mom or my sister even a little bit.

"Excellent, Finally a Proper Scary Movie, but Why Is It Rated a 12?","No word of a lie, i was scared before i even sat down to see this high anticipated movie. As far as i was concerned i thought that if i hadn't seen the actual play, i wouldn't understand it. This review will be my most thorough to date, reviewing every square inch of this movie.Firstly, CASTING. Before going to view The Woman In Black i took some time to read other peoples reviews in local newspapers, and the thing that really stood out for me as a criticism was the fact that nearly every reviews mentioned Daniel Radcliffe not being right as the main part, saying he was too young to be cast as a long term father. I went to see if these critics were just out there to criticise Radcliffe and i discovered that i felt he done a great job as a major lead role, obviously having enough experience from blockbuster film series Harry Potter. I did see the critics point, but i did think they were a tad harsh. 9/10 Secondly, PLOT: Personally, i thought the plot was clever, yet quite easy to follow. Apparently, according to friends, they had changed the ending. I observed that, yes, the ending was different, but it didn't bring my overall rating of the film down at all. It was still spine-chillingly good. 10/10 Thirdly, SETS/LOCATIONS: Loved them. Thought that the ideas gone into where each scene is set were exquisite. No criticisms. 10/10 Lastly, EXPECTATIONS: I truly expected the best from this film, and the best is what i got. It was a tense, scary and overall brilliant affair. Throughout the movie you could expect at parts something was going to jump out and make us gasp, but i couldn't predict exactly when, and even though i knew it was going to happen, i still jumped in shock. The film exceeded my expectation and was well worth the money i paid. 10/10 5 STARS *****",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gothic drivel!,"Well Daniel Radcliffe had to do something after the Harry Potter series ended didn't he?But low and behold he has opted to take his first steps into mediocrity; ""The Woman in Black"", truth be told, is a rather boring Gothic ghost story, the likes of which I have seen too many times before.It's boring, pure and simple, it wallows too much in jump scares particularly towards the end of the film, yet the beginning of the film is slow and boring..., I wanted it to be so much more, but it simply fizzled out after spending so long trying to get stated.The ending is predictable, and that was probably the best part of the film, which says very little for the rest of the film, all in all Radcliffe seems to be already suffering from a hangover after the success of Harry Potter, and his career post-Potter doesn't seem to be very bright.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

It looks awful.,"Yesterday I read the novel, the 200 pages in one afternoon. It is intriguing, it has atmosphere, it entertains. It just feels like a classic Henry James ghost story from Victorian/Edwardian times.Now I've just seen the trailer of the film here, and what a disappointment. It looks terrible. They tried to do a horror period piece by recurring to every cliché from a modern horror film. It sucks, really. Daniel Radcliffe looks totally miscast, I guess they meant to make him look like an adult Harry Potter. And why do they insist on using trendy camera shots -tilts, zooms, exaggerated tracking shots- to film a period story like it is a modern one instead? I had enough.

made in the spirit of a true Hammer,"The plot is simple, the narrative uncomplicated, and while never likely to really be a contender for any major awards, this is a movie that really embodies the greatest spirit of what a Hammer film is.Dark and foreboding, surprising and suspenseful, while not overtly macabre, chilling, compulsive, and definitely cerebral.While Daniel Radcliffe, will always have the spectre of Harry Potter over him, which is certainly nothing to be ashamed of, It could be considered odd that this outing was in some way in the same field? Mystical and supernatural, yet he ably puts the audience's preprogrammed expectations to one side as he admirably fills the role of the meek and personally troubled lawyer.With a mesmerising supporting cast, outstanding writing and direction, this is a simple yet outstanding film.Put plainly, a quality film, well worth watching.

Hammer is back!,"The first British horror film to bear the ""Hammer"" banner in 35 years doesn't disappoint.It's a masterpiece, but not by exploiting sentimental, schlocky nostalgia or by trading on a once great name in the hope of appealing to rusted-on fans of the original Hammer Films. This is a trend-setter in it's own right.Radcliffe pleasantly surprises. I assumed he'd be typecast as the perennial schoolboy from the Potter films before witnessing his unexpected ease and charisma in this production. So believable as an anxious father - effectively relating the primal fears of any parent - I had to google his age to assure myself he wasn't older than I'd thought!He makes it, but a classy supporting cast adds lustre. The child actors deserve acclaim for their unsettling stillness; accented by their pallid makeup and costumes.And as for the setting itself, a formula as old as time comes across as fresh as paint! But there's nothing fresh about this eyesaw - a once grand house at the end of a snaking causeway and periodically cut off by tides and sea mists, the stately but decrepit pile offers a widescreen, HD wonderland of dark nooks and crannies, dusty drapes and brocade dressing screens. Production designer Kave Quinn has gone to town with the creepy Victoriana, and whoever was in charge of props deserves kudos for the marvellous selection of eerie toys alone --cymbal-clanging monkeys, leprous dolls, a sinister zoetrope -- that populate the abandoned nursery.As Radcliffe's character Kipps settles in for several nights of terror, despite warnings from the believably terrified local villagers, the shocks are duly delivered with a perfect sense of horror timing, accompanied by huge jolts of discordant noise.All the Hitchcock tricks are dusted off and polished to perfection.The special effects are more than adequate, but they aren't nearly as impressive as the perfect sense of horror timing and the truly unsettling blend of shadows and light. I approached the whole film with an air of cynicism, solely because those hoary old chestnuts - haunted houses and all the stock characters that we find within and around them - have been done a thousand times over, and often badly. Had they been one fraction out, what was a highly effective unsettling viewing experience could have descended into laughable schlock. They weren't, and it didn't.Only shot-by-shot analysis can reveal whether there really are figures and faces lurking, barely seen, at the edge of the frame, which contribute very subtly to the atmosphere of unease... or are just figments of the imagination? The more obviously visible spectres, meanwhile, including the titular Woman in Black owe a particular debt to recent Asian horror movies, (especially Hideo Nakata's ""Ringu,"") in the unsettling, fast-gliding way they move and appear.It's a film to be viewed on the big screen, and more than once to be fully appreciated.

Depressing rather than frightening,"I haven't seen the 1989 film or read the Susan Hill book, but had the the wits scared out of me in a quite hammy theatrical production a couple of years ago (my daughter and I screamed and grabbed each other - but took great pleasure in seeing the three 'too cool to be there' teenage boys in front of us shrieking like girls and jumping out of their seats at points ) I didn't know what to expect of this - much of the terror of the play is through suggestion, and I wondered if the film (with the possibility of special effects denied to a theatrical production) would be too literal or hackneyed. As the film started I was quite disappointed and wasn't sure if Daniel Radcliffe was right for the role: I was quite cynical and critical through much of the film - but then realised the hairs were standing up on the back of my neck, despite myself.I think, overall, it is uneven - some bits work but it lacks the sustained and inexplicable tension and true 'leap out of your seats' horror of the play .",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric and scary,"This is scary, most certainly, and it had members of my audience screaming out loud at times. It's very atmospheric and almost totally visual which is unusual in this age of loud noise on the screen. Is this a new trend, with 'The Artist' also being (almost) silent? This quiet challenged me more than the usual noisy films do as really had to watch carefully. Blink and you miss it.There were some oddities though: I couldn't quite work out the time of year it was supposed to be as sometimes it looked like late autumn and other times quite summery. Another thing was the certificates: the adoption certificate stated Ms Alice Whatever - this title would not have been used in the late 19th century in England. Also there was way too much information on the death certificate - poetic licence, I suppose, but these details detract a bit from the whole.Daniel Radcliffe made quite a convincing young father and is well on his way to saying goodbye to Harry Potter.

An important  horror film.,"Out of everything that was trendy or popular in the film world, the Harry Potter movies were a favorite for me. Part of it was due to the original plot. Maybe because it was series that never let up and kept you interested from the first installment. Maybe because it was a series that knew how to use it's action, effects and atmosphere to it's advantage. Regardless, I always loved Harry Potter movies mostly because of the main actors. Director Chris Columbus used the approach of getting unknown child actors with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Girn and Emma Watson to put in lead roles for the eight films.After the success of the Harry Potter series which ran for over ten years, the main stars of this series were left in the awkward position of where to go with their careers. Really with all the money the actors made between them, none of them needed an acting role again. Girn has not being seen much and Watson has some big roles including Noah, The Perks of Being a Wallfollwer and Bling Ring. For now though it's Daniel Radcliffe who has the most interesting career away from the Harry Potter films. Going straight to theater, Radcliffe showed his passion and heart for acting. He also proved that he can take a risk by taking the lead role in the horror film Woman in Black for his first role after Harry Potter.There are many reasons why the Woman in Black released in February of 2012 would be a risk. It's not like Radcliffe had ever done horror and horror seems unpredictable in terms of money and reception. A February release is never is the most busiest time of the year in terms of movie sales. Everything that could have gone wrong with Woman in Black actually went well though.In the 1800's, lawyer Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) heads out to collect the papers of a dead woman Crythin Gifford and help start the sale of her house. Once Kipps comes to this English town, he sees it is a town full a scared locals of all ages. Crythin Gifford's house is filled with odd noises and we start to learn the real history of Gifford. This is an old school ghost story that feels something out the 60's and 70's.For a horror film, this has all familiar elements. It has creepy kids and a town threatening a visitor. Also there is a big and creepy house out in the middle of nowhere. It uses all the elements we've seen before but in a risky and interesting way.The most important elements is the house itself. The house is something that sets up everything from jump scares, atmosphere and the plot. The scares aren't really anything special but they are creative and will be enough to scare the Harry Potter fans who are here for Radcliffe. The plot is thin and is sketchy on details. The plot also reminds me of Insidious from the same year. The atmosphere uses old British styles with a town that has similarities to the The Crucible from 1996.The next biggest factor of the film is Daniel Radcliffe. Using a laid back style with good acting, Kipps comes off as very likable and also very caring about his child Joesph ( Misha Handley) who turns out to have bigger role then expected. Radcliffe carries this film through all it's acts and brings depth to the character which is really more than expected.While providing a strong ending that takes a risk, Woman in Black is an impressive horror film for many reasons. It is a film that helped Hammer Film Productions get back on the map and most importantly put Radcliffe on his career path after the Harry Potter films. An important horror film.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Can't fault it. Mind blowing.,"I watched this film today with a group of friends. We are aged 13 - 14 and a lot of us were screaming all the way through it. I found it scary and perhaps even worse than scary. The plot was thoroughly thought out, it was very clever and very unexpected. It had every viewer on their toes. The music contributed well to the scenes and there was a time when Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) walked in and the room screamed thinking it was the woman in black. The film was fantastic and I can't think of a better actor to play Arthur than Daniel Radcliffe. He played the part extremely well and filled his character with heart felt emotion. The plot had a deeper, darker side to it which made the story even more scarier. It was tragic in the end and I'm still shaking with sadness and fear. I recommend it to everyone who loves horrors but it's not for the faint hearted. I can't fault it. I hope to see it again and I hope to see other films like it. :)",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
A rather pointless film that didn't need to be made.,"If you have never seen a single horror film in your entire life, then perhaps the Woman in Black is for you; however even the average film goer can identify this is tired, worn out, done-to-death story we've seen hundreds - - if not thousands - - of times before.The story is simple. In the superstitious turn of the 19th Century to the 20th Century, a solicitor/lawyer/whatever has business with a scary old house that local village people fear and believe to be haunted. It turns out the house is very much haunted by a ghost, a woman in black, who inflicts murder and grief upon the village folk because of her sons death at the house as Daniel Radcliffe's character discovers by snooping through desks and drawers whilst staying at the house. The plot escalates quickly, which leads one to believe a large portion of the script had been removed in the cutting room floor. Radcliffe's character catches on and becomes cluey all too soon into the story.The only problem with this film that writes it off as a success is that it is so, so, so very unoriginal. I can't imagine how many times I've seen this type of story before; maybe I'm just neck deep into horror films but as previously suggested, even someone with the slightest idea of horror and thriller knows this textbook ghost story. There is nothing original about the film, which I could overlook if there were redeeming characteristics like a uniqueness in film making, musical composition or script writing but the Woman in Black falls flat in all aspects of this. Furthermore, the jump scares and attempt to create a sinister, spooky vibe are some what embarrassing.With the overall film being taken into account, it isn't actually bad. The style is superb, with brilliant cinematography and quality acting (not so much on Radcliffe's behalf) and what I really liked about this movie is its location setting – the swampy causeway leading to Osea Island and the general countryside of Essex set a lovely and gloomy mood for the remaining hour and thirty minutes.I would never recommend or even bring this title up in conversation, as I can think of plenty of other classic ghost story titles at the top of my head that are far more interesting than this brilliantly developed, but unforgivably run of the mill story.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Clichéd, dull and sadly miscast","Daniel Radcliff has become synonymous with Harry Potter since its transfer to the big screen. Understandably, now he's too old for the part and the franchise is over, he's looking to move on to other things and shed his 'boy wizard' image. In The Woman in Black, he plays a young lawyer in the nineteen century who comes a cropper with some nasty ghosts.First of all, well done to the film-makers for getting Daniel Radcliff in the film to begin with. I hear he doesn't come cheap. However, this is the film's main selling point, i.e. yes it's Harry Potter not playing Harry Potter for the first time. Unfortunately, competent actor that Daniel Radcliff is, he just comes across as too damn young to play the part.Although, if that was the film's only let-down, I could probably suspend my disbelief and just go with it. But no. The film's main problem is that it's simply not scary. There are a few bits that will make you jump, but that's about it - 'spooky' comes in the form of (normally) inanimate objects suddenly moving, i.e. a rocking horse, a music box, a children's stuffed toy and so on.It manages to borrow bits from other horror movies, like The Ring, but the fact is, it's very slow and not particular interesting. It's not really Radcliff's fault - a fair portion of the story involves him spending his time just wandering round empty buildings looking scared. During these scenes, he has no one to play off and you just find yourself waiting for whatever is going to creepily move to do so and offer the 'scare scene.'Good luck to Radcliff in shedding his wizard image. This film will go some way to showing he can do more than just ride a broomstick. Trouble is, he's in a scary film that's just not scary.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good scary non-gory ghost flick!,"I don't personally like reading too much about a film giving lots of it away, just briefly what others think so I tend to do the same.I'd been waiting for this since the advert about 9 months ago and it didn't disappoint! It's scary... I jumped, screamed and choked on my popcorn a good 3 times! Definitely one to watch in the cinema for the sound effects which I personally like and make me, well, choke on my popcorn more!I would say it's probably too scary for the classification they gave it (12a). I understand in this classification the threat should not be frequent which in this film it was. Dangerous imitable behaviour is possibly borderline. Some kids, probably about 12/13, left the cinema, I heard some shrieks coming from where they were sat then they didn't come back! Go and watch it and see for yourself, any film with overall good reviews is worth watching if the genre fits your liking.Maybe don't watch it too late at night if you are easily scared ;)",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
A very great scary film that will stay with me for a while yet.,"When i saw the trailer of women in black, i knew i had to watch it. Being a massive fan of Daniel Radcliffe in Harry Potter,i was always skeptical of him being able to portray another character completely different to Harry, but i have to fully admit, he was brilliant! He took on a brand new character and he nailed it brilliantly. For such a young actor to portray an older person in role he was certainly better than most actors i have watched in large movies where they have to take on a role that is very different physically to themselves. The movie itself was fantastic, the director made a smashing fear movie with great scenes that will take your breath away. One scene which i will not say to much about due to readers that are looking to watch the film, but i will say that one scene that contains a car, a small child and Daniel Radcliffe diving under mud defiantly gave me a chill that will not go away for a few weeks or least a few days. In a short line, this film will be one of the best on my DVD shelf.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Felt like I went to Chills R Us!  An excellent remake.,"8/10. This film surpasses the original 1989 version even though IMDb ratings indicate otherwise. As in the original, an effective creepy atmosphere and setting is portrayed. The camera angles and composition were outstanding, including excellent use of background, objects, and shadows to reveal the supernatural. The music was pretty good, but did not seem to have a significant role. The use of sound to produce jump scares was perhaps over used or exaggerated, yet effective. The movie's pacing may be slow for some and dialogue is sometimes minimal as Kipps is mostly alone. This isolation combined with the plot and setting create an intense feeling of dread. The film could have used more action based suspense, but would have required more deviation from the book and original movie. The cast worked for me on all levels, even though Radcliffe seemed stoic at times, I don't think it hurt the film. This period piece treated me with five strong chilling moments, and sixteen in all. This is a great movie for fans of atmospheric horror and the supernatural.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
disappointed,"I was really looking forward to seeing Daniel Radcliffe as something other than Harry Potter. I was seriously disappointed in this movie. The first 45 min or so was so slow and boring I almost got up and walked out. The tone of the movie was extremely dark, as expected. There was some effort to lead up to the impact points, but the intensity wasn't maintained. There was about 20 min of actual ""scary"" and suspenseful. The scary parts were really scary, though. I jumped out of my seat several times. It was true suspense, not just blood and gore. However, there were actually times when the audience laughed out loud at overly contrived efforts to make things seem creepy. At the end, it was like... really? That's it? Overall, the good parts weren't worth sitting through the rest. It would have been better to watch this sitting at home in the dark with a group of friends.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Old Skool horror,"To be fair I wasn't really that bothered about seeing this film which usually puts me in a good unbiased place.I like to keep my reviews simple and short, so hear i go.Radcliffe, only saw him as Harry potter for about 5-10mins so that didn't get in the way,, but I do think he needs a few more years under his belt before he can play the role of a father.No cliché English country bumpkins unlike in warhorse, frankly that was embarrassing.To put it basically, it ticked the boxes of the hammer horror genre. It will make you jump and if you've got a Mrs she will probably be hid behind your jacket for most of the film..Deffo worth £7 and a bonus if its orange Wednesdays!!!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Nothing Novel - Jump Scares and a Creepy Atmosphere,"The plot itself is decent but not detailed enough to make the vengeance of the spirit make enough sense. The film itself succeeds in giving the thrills the audience seeks, but does so in a typical manner (not unlike the recent Insidious, though I felt that the first act of Insidious was comparatively superior to that of this film). The atmosphere however, was well established and dreadful from the very start. With regards to the acting of the actors, Radcliffe's response to the situations within the film (like most other horror movie mains) are rather unrealistic (but obviously, necessary for the progression of the film), other characters were not well illustrated to be worthy of any discussion.Overall, a movie ticket? Nah, just get the DVD put your speakers on high and you'll feel just the same.5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Bland, familiar horror story with a few good elements","Beautifully haunting to look at, but a dreadful bore to watch at times, The Woman in Black is about as generic as they come- focusing on jump scares and atmosphere without little to any depth. Although I didn't really enjoy the film, it was far from horrible. The actors are all decent throughout, all put their most into their performances, and it's certainly nice change of pace from Radcliffe's usual roles. The cinematography is very well done, some beautiful shots throughout, and some haunting imagery as well which isn't perfect- but is one thing the film seems to have going for it most of the time. What is so crucial about this film though, is the ability to squander its plot and story with every dull antic imaginable. There are so many predictable moments throughout the film, I didn't even need to try to guess what happened next. The pacing in the film is incredibly slow, slow to a crawl at times, and the first half an hour exclusively is just filler for the rest of the film (literally a third of the film in its entirety). Some moments are also just a bit too ridiculous to take seriously at times, or funny when they are supposed to be scary (the jump scares especially)- just because of how hard they are all trying to make the film work and it just doesn't. In the end, The Woman in Black is a forgettable and bland horror film with some forgiving moments, but hardly enough to lead it in the right direction or to anything unique or memorable.My Rating: 4.4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror

A Ghost Train That Fell Off Its Tracks,"This movie started out promising but the longer it goes on, the more confused you get, the opposite of proper story-telling. Is this a horror movie? A supernatural thriller? A period-piece drama with supernatural elements? What the hell is going on? We get some occasional spooks but mostly just the director toying with ambience for most of the film while we feel like there's a mystery that is supposed to be uncovered, but falls off by the end where we are left wondering how any of it connects in the first place.Perhaps being familiar with the source material fleshes out the rest of the movie, since it definitely feels like the audience is missing key information.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Mediocre story but grippingly scary,"The Woman In Black is a visually stylish and authentic ghost story with a haunting atmosphere and a solid acting that is set in the early twentieth century in an isolated British village.Even though the story as well as the ending of the movie are rather predictable, they are so well designed and acted that this doesn't disturb the entertaining enjoyment of the movie. The movie still has still some very gripping and memorable scenes even if the story itself is not the best one that could have been chosen as a remake.This movie will definitely put you on the edges of your seats and is nothing for weak-heartened people as it is really scary at some points. It's probably the most intense horror movie since ""Insidious"". The movie works a lot with light and especially sound effects so you have to watch this in your local cinema to fully enjoy this picture.In the end, after a rather disappointing second half of the cinematic year 2011, this new year starts in a very satisfying manner with movie highlights such as ""The Grey"" or ""The Woman In Black"" that make me look forward to discover a bunch of other movies within the next few weeks.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Too long,"This film could have easily shaved 15 minutes off its run time and you wouldn't have missed anything. There are far too many horror cliches of the main character sensing something around the corner or behind him. The same goes for the music stingers that in many cases could have been dispatched and made the mood of a scene even creepier.The concept sounds good, but the execution, unfortunately, results in a bore.Daniel Radcliffe's performance is fine, as are the performances of the supporting cast. The sets and the color grading complement the story. But it's the execution of the story that drags this film down.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Classic Haunted House Story is a Pleaser for This Horror Lover,"I really enjoyed this movie. After several years of badly done horror movies (with the exception of Insidious), I can honestly say I go into the theater with very few expectations. I usually leave disappointed after an hour of plot-less, cheap hacking and slashing. The Woman in Black however, was a pleasant surprise. This creepy haunted house story set in a desolate marsh during the turn of the century, built suspense throughout the movie, giving you just enough glimpses of ""the woman"" to keep the audience on the edge of their seat until the truth is revealed. The costumes and set are very well done, and the acting is excellent. I suggest this film to any true horror fan.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Atmospheric but bland,"The 1989 television movie made for ITV was creepy and compelling.This remake has a muscular performance with a youthful Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe.)

He is raising his young son with the help of a nanny.His employer sends Kipps to deal with the affairs of the late Mrs Drablow who lived in a small troubled village.Kipps sees the mysterious woman in black. She claims the local children by having them take their lives as she lost her own son.This is a moody, British gothic horror. It goes for atmosphere and chills rather than gore. I did find it all too predictable. The film is not as good as the 1989 version and Radcliffe did not sell it to me, he was just too young in the role. Maybe if Ciaran Hinds had the lead, it would had been different.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very scary!,"I'm not a horror enthusiast-I can say the suspense and tense moments got my adrenaline pumping. Almost had to turn the movie off!Great production values: dark and shadowy Victorian era. Thrilling percussion at points. Daniel Radcliffe does a good job as an unusual, persistent protagonist. Cairan Hinds also plays good supporting role as the spouse of a woman broken by her child's death.Perhaps the movie plays on some horror movie tropes like the child's jingle. But overall quite an original ending I thought, not comic in the least as some reviewers suggest.The movie doesn't preach any sort of values but instead makes one reflect on the damage caused by a grudge taken past the grave. I thought it makes a good ghost story and cautionary tale. Actually looking forward to watching part 2!",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Gothic and ghostly but frustrating,"British Edwardian society was not a great time to be alive. A lot of people died. In fact, much of what we regard as the paranormal has its roots in the spiritualist movement that grew up in the late Victorian era in which the film is set.What we have here is a traditional gothic ghost tale with an element of the modern procession horror thrown in for good measure.The traditional big creepy house, old animatronic toys, faces in windows and dark shadows are all here. Yes it's all familiar territory and to be honest it gets a bit repetitive.There's a bit of creepiness, some woman stands around a bit, there's something to do with kids being killed but it's not clear why any of this is happening. In fact even the tragedy of child death starts to wear a bit thin as senseless as they are, the plot doesn't seem to include even a supernatural justification for their passing.So we have a solicitor who goes to a house and for some reason arranges to meet his 4 year old boy there. This more or less establishes a timeline along which the plot bible along with the occasional scare.This is a mildly entertaining film with the occasional jump scare but the plot gets so muddled that it loses the sense of foreboding and threat it sets out to achieve. Is the house and the ghost connected? Who is the woman in black? What's going on with the procession? There are too many loose threads that ultimately get packed into an inconclusive conclusion.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Lol,"I think that this movie was very good, it was extremely well paced. The storyline is fantastic with lots of twists and turns. I love the setting and the town. The actors are good and help with inciting fear into the viewers. From the beginning of the movie you can feel the mood of the ton and the setting of the movie which is great. It would have got 1 more star if the scares had more diversity. I really like this movie and think it is good , because it is good and i enjoyed how all the characters were so different. I like when i get scared because it is funny. I also enjoyed the scares because they scared my mum. My dad did not like this movie as much because he is big strong and tough.

"A lot of bark, not much bite","""Meh"" was the feeling I was left with at the end of 'The Woman in Black.' ""Meh"" to the story, ""meh"" to the acting and even more ""meh"" to the attempted frights throughout the film. There's not a lot of good stuff here. The last 10-15 minutes raise the bar a little (at least on the scare front) and then a questionable ending finally seals the fate on this one and we are able to finally turn it off.Daniel Radcliffe gives a very average performance. It feels like we are watching a boy playing a man's role. Taking on a horror movie first thing after the 'Harry Potter' series seemed a strange decision to me. One reason could have been very few lines for him to learn, which may have sounded appealing after some quite long editions to the 'Harry Potter' series had him working long hours to learn them all I'm sure. It takes you to the about the halfway point to realise there really isn't a lot of dialogue and that that there is is quite clunky and poorly written especially for a period piece.The biggest annoyance this film provides however is the countless amount of attempted scares (mostly on Radcliffe's character) which come to absolutely nothing. Soon nothing becomes frightening in the least because all this ghost seems to have in its armoury is trying to scare people. Of course it's revealed it can do a little more that, but more of a focus on this and less screen time with Radcliffe would have benefited this movie immensely.As I said the last 10-15 minutes pick things up a bit and do some redeeming. The ending is to each there own. Personally I was reasonably neutral over it, but if I had to lean one way I'd say I didn't like it as much. There are much better, more atmospheric and effective horrors out there at the moment (especially 'The Conjuring' if you haven't gotten around to seeing it yet), but if you feel like you've seen them all and choose to give this one a go just don't expect anything too special.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Great Horror Film!,"I went to see this film with mixed expectations. Mainly interested to see Daniel Radcliffe play a new character, I also heard the Theatre production is very good. However with this film being a 12A I wasn't exactly expecting a scary film. I was wrong. Some bits I couldn't even watch because it was just so intense. Maybe it was just the atmosphere in the cinema, but either way it will keep you gripped throughout. Great story, greater acting and what I loved most about it is that they used the sense of atmosphere and clever cinematography to make it so effective, non of this gory bull**** that other film makers believe make a good horror film. Go see this film! A great watch, however it should be rated a 15 at least, there are disturbing scenes that I don't think a 12 year old should really watch. But thats just me :)",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Simply ... OK,"What can I say, the movie is just OK and nothing more or less.For the ones who want it a bit clearer: it has a straight storyline, the main character developing is satisfying, there is even periodical suspense/mystery, some good scary effects and a reasonable ending without too much pathos. But: that's what I expect of every good movie! Only thing that really surprised me was, that it's good to see Radcliffe can do more than Harry Potter.Maybe I would watch it a second time in a few years, but for most people I think it's enough, to rent the DVD/BluRay on a rainy day and watch it with your girl/boyfriend.And don't forget a box of nachos and your favorite soft-drink to make the evening complete ;-)",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Best horror film in ages!,"The thing that is in everyone's mind when Daniel Radcliffe first appears on screen is Harry Potter! I personally think that Radcliffe has one of the hardest challenges an actor can ever face, which is trying to get out of being typecast, or perhaps never being cast at all because of his huge involvement in the Potter franchise. But I am pleased to say that he excelled in The Woman in Black (Dir. James Watkins, 2012), providing a believable performance as Arthur Kipps. Only at the beginning did his act falter; as Radcliffe seemed nervous around the boy who was supposed to be his son.I'll briefly mention that this film flows particularly well, and gives off a high degree of verisimilitude, thanks to the talented supporting cast. Ciarán Hinds and Shaun Dooley are two actors that are worth mentioning as they play Mr Daily, a character who becomes the only friend for Kipps, and Mr Fisher, the innkeeper who attempts to drive Kipps out of town so as to protect the children. Both their performances are strong and they create a fantastic side-kick and a great minor antagonist.Apart from what I had gathered from the trailers, I was unaware of the story of The Woman in Black when going into the cinema, having not seen the theatrical production or original TV film. The Woman in Black has a strong and interesting narrative, something that isn't common for many horror films within the last ten years, and provides plenty of scares, jumps and horrific moments. The most intense and captivating scenes within the film occur at the manor in the marsh. Fear excels to a new level when Kipps decides to stay in that house over night.Creepy toys and terrifying dolls are continuously visible throughout The Woman in Black establishing a strong concept of fear within the secrete village. As well as perhaps symbolising that the woman is always watching Kipps, no matter where he is. There is a shot where Kipps walks past a toy with a candle, the candle is reflected in the toy's eyes making it seem like they are moving and following Kipps.The only really disappointing aspect of the film was the conclusion. All I can really say without spoiling the plot is that there should have been a cliff hanger instead of the plot being resolved.This was by far the best horror film I have seen in a long while, mainly due to the decision not to make it a hand-held documentary. The director uses diegetic and non-diegetic sounds to create suspense, which again takes the film away from the silent ""jump"" scenes over-used in modern horrors. I hope that more producers watch this film and realise horror films don't all have to be exactly like Paranormal Activity (Dir. Oren Peli, 2007) to terrify audiences.If you enjoyed this review, check out my others on my blog: http://dalelawsonreviews.tumblr.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
"Slow, Boring, Unscary Horror","I went into this movie knowing that the ratings were good, but hearing that it wasn't that great. Unfortunately, I found next to nothing enjoyable about this movie.The plot is, although interesting-ish, rushed and never fully developed. Despite the beginning of the movie being incredibly dragged out, it was dragged out with absolutely nothing. There was next to no content in the first hour of the movie. You might as well skip the first hour, you'll probably like it more and understand just as much.The characters are below average. Like I said, this movie is very rushed. So along with the plot being rushed, the characters follow. There's some forced in back story stuff at the beginning, but the characters are incredibly stale and flat. Nothing special.The movie as a whole is just boring, especially the first hour. Sure, there are some things that could qualify as 'horror', but they were so unbelievably unscary that the whole movie ended up feeling more and more like a failure over anything else. 'Fear of the unknown' was used during this time, but none of the fear was known to the main character, so I was never tense or scared for him at all. He didn't know he had reason to be afraid, and in the end he didn't. They made that clear early on.After the first hour the horror actually becomes good...for about ten minutes maybe. I actually enjoyed those ten minutes and had hope for the movie suddenly, wondering if this would be the rest of the movie. Nope, I was wrong. Afterwards it declined into boredom once again with several cups of stupidity thrown in this time.Overall The Woman in Black is just really boring. Nothing happens. Ever. Sure, it was good for about ten minutes, but the other 85 minutes were just a waste, and I had to spend an hour getting to those few precious minutes. Sure, it wasn't impossible to watch, but it was pretty unpleasant to. Somehow the movie manages to move too fast yet be extremely boring. In the end there is no way I would ever recommend The Woman in Black.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Really good film,"The film ""The Women in Black"", in my opinion it was really good. The film is about a young lawyer who goes to the village to sort out the papers of a woman because she died, but in the village weird things happen. The director refines every detail to make the film in Victorian era. The actor Daniel Radcliffe (Mr.Kips) does a really good job. He doesn't have to say anything and I know how he feels. The film in some moments is engrossing. The body language was really good. The colours were dark and music makes it more scary. The other actors play very well. When I watched the film I felt like I was in a different era. I would like to recommend this film if you like horrors.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"scary, but not suspenseful","This movie is scary enough to grab audience attention for a while, which is not bad for a scary movie. The movie set is also very good, and it worth to look at them more than once. And that's it...I can't come out with any other pros. Solely being scary is not a qualification for being a good scary movie, there needs to be some suspense, and this movie has no suspense at all. Probably I saw too many good scary movies? The story is pretty bad, and the main character is full of flaws. It might seems ridiculous to someone, but I find it to be a major problem that in most movies, actors (and actress) play a much younger role than themselves, and for some older-looking ones like Nicolas Cage, playing a older character is more often. But Daniel is not that type of older-looking guy, and I think he is even a little bit younger-looking. He was about 22 years old back then, and he looks like 22, or even a little bit younger than 22, and he plays a lawyer with a wife and a son who can walk and speak to his father. It seems like at least 30 years old...I actually like Daniel Radcliffe's performance in some other movies, but for this one, he is not only too young for the role, but also has a very average performance.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror

What was all the fuss about?,"'The Woman In Black (2012)' is relatively faithful to its source story. The changes it makes are usually only to shorten its timespan or to make things more overt, especially when it comes to its scares. Something was certainly lost in translation, however. The constant first-person perspective of the book isn't portrayed anywhere near as strongly on film, and the simultaneously in-the-moment but ultimately reflexive narration isn't carried across at all, which is somewhat natural but still unfortunate. These elements may be missing due to the change in medium, and are actually common casualties of adaptation, but they could have been smoothed over with some slight tweaks to the story and its presentation. I'm not suggesting that narration would have been a good idea, but the flick needs to communicate the inner thoughts of its protagonist more clearly (via whatever means feel natural) in order for it to be truly engaging. The book is written in the style of nineteenth-century 'gothic horror' and, as such, has subtle psychological horror as opposed to overt scares. It relies on the fact that we're always in the head of the 'hero', as most of the scary stuff is only scary because of the way it affects him. It's the kind of story where an ill feeling, a bump in the night and a barking dog provide all the horror necessary, leaving us with a PTSD-ridden protagonist barely able to recount his tale. In this movie, none of that really comes across. While it isn't necessarily silly, most of the spooky stuff is far too 'on-the-nose' and, frankly, clichéd to really work. It leans on 'jump scares' and the same 'face-in-the-background' gag to get its audience going, but it's never really frightening, to be frank. There are some creepy plot elements, though; a specific choice, which changes the way its antagonist interacts with her 'prey' (so to speak), is quite disturbing or, at least, challenging, if slightly superfluous and 'edgy' for the sake of it. When it gets going, it's not bad. It's just that most of the piece is actually quite boring. Radcliffe creeps around looking decently freaked-out, settles down and does a bit of paper-work, comes across a bit of exposition, gets haunted by a ghost and then gets shunned by the townsfolk. This repeats a few times until a third-act that feels off-brand and unearned. The ending is also strange, mainly because of a market-tested addition that aims to make it 'happy'. Overall, the picture lacks the interesting themes of the story that it's based on, even though the plot is more or less intact. Of course, an adaptation can change things (such as the ending), for better or worse, but the end result should still hold up. Here, the deliberate changes actually do less damage than the accidental ones. Regardless of the reason, this ends up as a dull and uninspired horror that isn't scary and isn't actually all that interesting, either. It just feels like a poor man's 'The Conjuring (2013)'. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Terrific Horror Movie,"Oh, oh, oh this is a great horror movie. It is so simply an old fashioned horror movie that from the very beginning I was looking for the moment I knew that it would be terrible, but that moment never came. This is what I liked about it: 1) The scary part didn't come from some super natural devil/alien/psycho killer possession/revenge etc.2) The scary part came from the old fashioned idea that a terrible wrong had been done to a poor innocent and when she died she couldn't rest and worked diligently at getting her revenge.3) The ghost is an actual character, scary, mean, vengeful and present.4) Daniel Radcliffe is very awesome.5) Daniel Radcliffe's character is awesome.6) It exceeded my expectations.7) Not everything happened the way that I anticipated which made the movie not predictable, but enough things did so that it was actually logical.8) The end was spectacular - again old-fashioned, not predictable, but logical so that you didn't leave feeling like it was dumb and would never happen in the course of events in the movie.

It's not awful but If u want to watch a haunted house movie then the conjuring is a better one. If you want to see an old fashioned horror movie in a dark haunted castle then just watch the others. I also really dislike it when people give this movie a 10 out of 10 and say it's ""a smart and unique phycological horror movie classic"" but then they say that hereditary and the babadook are uninspired overrated "" horror films"".
Those movies r far better but even at that this movie was still acceptable",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
Well made but dull,"A poor choice by Hammer's execs to choose a sleepy Victorian ghost story with which to return to the big screen. Radcliffe and co. fine, special effects and costume dept. all very good as usual. It's competent but not that compelling. Not a bad finale but I'd lost interest way before it came. To put most of the excitement factor in the final third after a dreary two thirds is a big mistake, in my book. The story itself seems only suited to book form too.The script is frankly dull, the story even duller. Ghost stories have their place in horror but not in Hammer Horror, imo. There was much growing psychological menace but this was never Hammer's thing. It's closer to Hitchcock than Hammer but I couldn't imagine AH making such a dull film. A waste of a big movie budget, I can't imagine what such a flat copy of a film already made would bring to anyone. I do not know how this choice of movie project got anywhere near a commission.",4.0,Anonymous,Horror
If you love classic ghost story you should watch Woman in Black,"It's been a long time since I watched a movie that made me scream and scared like this. The plot is solid, the story is creepy classic, and Daniel Radcliffe acting is awesome. The way he show fear and curious at the same time lead the audience to feel the same way. After I watched Woman in Black, the image of ghost woman with black dress in this movie pops into my head every time I go to dark places.For first 20 minutes, the movie goes very slow. There is no scary scene at all, don't get bored. Just pay your attention to the story. If you scared by ""silent hill"" ghost story type, then you will love this movie. I recommend you to watch this movie alone in theater, so you could feel the thrill.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
Dark and Sombre,"Brilliant almost a one man peromance by Radcliffe. Kieran Hines was also very good.Effectively shot using excellent location, a dark atmosphere and excellent score
Cinematography was on the money with heavy contrast and really deep blacks. A spooky story line which moves along smoothly.I'm not one generally for horror movies, and find the slasher stuff predictable. This is far more sophisticated, unexpected and I felt a classy cut above the norm. Tension is built effectively and there are several 'hairs on the back of the neck' standup moments very effectively shot.I watched this 10 years ago and thought it was high time for a revisit.",10.0,Anonymous,Horror
Good acting,"The acting is good by Radcliffe and company, but that's pretty much all that is good.",3.0,Anonymous,Horror
Fabulous!,took my daughter (who is 14) to see this - we both thoroughly enjoyed it - she loves scary films and we both agree this is by far the best one we have seen yet - Daniel Radcliffe was just brilliant in it - and a very surprising ending - not at all what i thought was going to happen - which is rare in scary films!!!! The screenplay was fantastic - i loved the images of the ghosts - so scary - i was jumping out of my skin in the cinema NS I m glad to say so were the row of young men sat behind us ! I loved this story line - had me captivated from the beginning - me and my daughter sat cross legged the whole way through - we darent leave to go to the loo in case we missed something - thats how good it was! if you haven't seen it yet - you simply must!,10.0,Anonymous,Horror
"This isn't the first remake by HAMMER, and it certainly won't be the LAST.","This is a remake of the 1989 made for TV film which was adapted by Nigel Kneale from Susan Hill's Novel of the same name.This film involves the ghost of a woman which haunts Eel Marsh House. The local villagers say that when anyone espies her, trouble will befall in the form of the death of a young child (or children).Enter Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe a.k.a. Harry-likes-to-go-potty!) young solicitor who lost his wife during the birth of his son. He is now raising his boy with the help of a nanny.He is assigned to handle the estate of Alice Drablow, who owned an English manor known as the Eel Marsh House, where she had lived with her husband, son Nathaniel, and sister Jennet Humfrye (Liz White).At Eel Marsh House, located on an island in the marshes, Kipps repeatedly hears footsteps and sees a woman dressed in black. From then onwards, events occur that finally helps him to unravel the mystery of the woman in black.Overall this is the sort of movie which will try scare you with its sound-effects. Visual effects are as usual C.G.I. imagery. But if you have watched films like The Grudge and The Ring, this film will be nothing new to you. Bottom line: an average horror film and some even say the 1989 film was better.I am seeing in my minds eye a lot of top Japanese, Korean and Chinese horror film directors laughing their asses off!Well in closing: DEAR HAMMER FILMS, CONTINUE MAKE PLENTY OF ""DUMB"" REMAKES TILL YOU HOPEFULLY WIN AN Oscar OR A BAFTA. GOOD LUCK CHUMS!",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
Very Good,"This film was a very good watch. However it is rated 12A which surprises me as i have watched 15 and 18 rated films a lot less scary than this. So Therefore i wouldn't recommend this to 12 year old probably 15+..That aside this film was very good, The look and settings was really good and fitted the film well. The lead actor played a brilliant role, as so did the rest of the cast. As of meeting its genre, it done this very well. I was glad to go and watch a horror that actually matched up to its genre..All round a good film, storyline was good and not a cliché and the ending was very good and unexpected.",8.0,Anonymous,Horror
Haunting Gothic Horror but . . .,"I just didn't enjoy it. I tried to like it but honestly Its just not my thing. It's not that it done anything really wrong and I appreciate the direction it was going on with the whole gothic atmosphere. But the pacing to me was just so mind bogglingly slow. But at the same time for what the movies going for it couldn't of been done any other way. It very well may be enjoyable for classic horror buffs but I believe if that's not your cup of tea then this movie is not going to change your mind.Normally I dissect the plot, characters and direction but I'm not going to because as stated I don't think the movie really had to change much. I'm just not the audience it's aiming for.What I will say which was enjoyable for me was seeing that Daniel Radcliffe doesn't have to be stereotyped to his infamous Harry Potter character. It was good to see him out of his comfort zone. In conclusion classic horror fans and fans of classic ghost stories may find this a fresh of breath air away from all the slashers, blood and gore of modern horror but if your expecting ghost stories similar to 'The Conjuring' you may be left disappointed.",5.0,Anonymous,Horror
One of the most creepiest movies I have ever seen......,"thoroughly enjoyed this movie and its a long time since I've seen an audience jump the way they did here. Grown men ashamed at the way they got sucked into the chills! And that's why the film is so effective, it plays on a constant sense of dread as the films unfolds which is why the shock moments (and they keep on coming!!)are so effective. Extremely creepy and atmospheric from the outset with great use of the period.I actually completely forgot the fact I was watching the ex-boy wizard! Very assured performance from Mr Ratcliffe leaving us in no doubt that he has left H Potter esquire behind him.",9.0,Anonymous,Horror
