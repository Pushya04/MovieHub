Depressingly Beautiful,"For every icon, there is an unknown predecessor who paves the way. Before there was Kurt Cobain, there was Ian Curtis, lead singer of the post-punk band, Joy Division. 27 years after his tragic death, Curtis' incredible contribution to music is finally being recognized in Anton Corbijn's film, ""Control."" It's only fitting that Corbijn serve as director since it was his early photographs of Joy Division that reflected the band's dark, introspective songs. Corbijn went on to photograph and direct videos for such musical greats as U2, David Bowie, Depeche Mode, R.E.M. and Metallica.With his first feature film, Corbijn avoids the pitfalls of many music video directors who inundate us with flashy and unnecessary edits and camera angles. Instead, he lets the stark black and white of the film tell the story of a lead singer tortured by epilepsy, guilt, depression and suicidal thoughts. The use of black and white also captures the factory town of Manchester, England in the late 1970s, a city crumbling under industrial and economic stress. Manchester has since rebounded and is once again thriving.Curtis is played by relative newcomer, Sam Riley, who's quiet and unassuming approach portrays an artist inspired by his heroes, David Bowie and Iggy Pop. At a chance meeting following a Sex Pistols concert, Curtis bonds with three fellow musicians to form the band.As Joy Division begins to flourish, Ian's relationship with his young wife, Deborah, continues to distance itself. Academy Award nominee, Samantha Morton plays the confused wife trying to understand her husband's depressed soul. The film is based on Deborah Curtis' autobiography, ""Touching From A Distance"", so it comes as a surprise that Morton's character does not have more scenes in the movie.The key to Control is understanding Curtis' depression, which the film accomplishes to near perfection. As he battles epilepsy, the young singer lives in constant fear that his next seizure will be his last. His only option is to swallow a daily cocktail of prescription drugs with side effects so terrible, that most of us would rather tempt fate than endure the aftermath of the pills.Ian's spirit is also tortured by overwhelming guilt brought on by an extra-marital affair with a part-time journalist, played by Romanian-born Alexandra Maria Lara.The most telling scene comes when Ian records an in-studio track for the song ""Isolation."" While Curtis stoically sings into the microphone, his band mates are distracted with the normal banter that typically occurs in a studio.""Mother, I tried, please believe me. I'm doing the best that I can. I'm ashamed of the things I've been put through. I'm ashamed of the person I am."" The lyrics seem to fall on deaf ears except for those of the sound engineer who refers to it as ""genius."" But Ian's brilliance is also a desperate cry for help ignored by everyone in the studio.The 27-year-old Riley does an excellent job of capturing Curtis' aloofness on stage. Singers such as Jim Morrison, Kurt Cobain and even the early years of Michael Stipe would often drift into the moment of the song. But when Curtis performed, he immersed himself into his own world where the music simply served as the soundtrack. Riley skillfully draws us into Ian's dark world with a range of subtle head movements and facial expressions to a whirling explosion of arm gyrations that came to personify the singer's stage performances.Overwhelmed with grief, shame and depression, Ian finally succumbs to his demons at the young age of 23. He left behind a wife, a child and a musical legacy that is finally receiving its just rewards nearly three decades later.For those looking for a story solely about Joy Division, Control may not be for you. But for those seeking an intuitive perspective into the anguished spirit of one of the most influential alternative bands in history, you will certainly find it in this depressing but incredibly beautiful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Careers in a tightly controlled arc, where music biopic meets cinematic excellence","Control, a biopic about a band from Manchester, is getting serious attention from around the world. Starting with an award in Cannes. That's maybe more than you might expect. Joy Division, a respected band of the 70s, are hardly a name on everyone's lips. And films made by ex music video directors about yet another load of rockers rarely raise eyebrows. So why is this different? Joy Division, for non-initiates, were a post-punk Manchester band of throbbing guitars and dark, doom-laden lyrics. Recognition in the music biz (especially by other musicians) was perhaps even greater after the death of lead singer, Ian Curtis. Control covers a period from his schooldays to his end in 1980 (aged 23). It is based on the biography of his widow.Control uses Curtis' love of poetry, as well as the more familiar songs-that-tell-a-story device, to provide at least scant insight into the music. ""I wish I were a Warhol silkscreen, hanging on the wall,"" he muses. But what is dealt with in much more detail is his growing sense of isolation, coping with epilepsy as the pressures of touring build up, and the distraught domestic relations he is embroiled in with wife Debbie (Samantha Morton) and romantic-interest-from-afar Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara). ""It's like it's not happening to me but someone pretending to be me. Someone dressed in my skin,"" he says.In a telling scene when he is under hypnosis, the camera revolves around his head as we hear voices speaking to him. ""Ian, let me in, love,"" says his wife, ""there's room to talk."" Responsibilities as husband and father. A mistress who is also in love with him. A band and fan following who want more than he can give. From warholian, carefree screen-dream of youth, he has arrived at a place where he doesn't want to be. Drugs and their side-effects no longer a schoolboy's recreational laugh. Prescription bottles grip with morbid fascination. And the knowledge that doctors don't have a cure.The film carries viewers away with blistering intensity. Relative newcomer Sam Riley plays Curtis with alarming energy. With Samantha Morton, it's not what she says but what you see going through her mind. She contains her expressiveness for the camera to pick up (rather than thrusting it on us). We want to cry inside for her character. As a feat of interiorisation, Control puts her as a contender in the shoes of Meryl Streep.Supporting cast members come through with believability and sincerity, sparkling with well-honed contrasts. Toby Kebbell, fast-talking manager Rob, lifts us out of the depressive mood with wisecracks enough to make legless monkeys jump. ""Where's my £20?"" asks a hapless stand-in as Rob deals with an emergency. ""In my f*ck-off pocket!"" he barks back. Craig Parkinson is record producer and late TV presenter Tony Wilson (to whom the opening screening at the Edinburgh International Film Festival was dedicated). He demonstrates fine shades of teeth-gritting tolerance, explaining to the band, seconds before their first live TV show: yes, 'large dog's c*ck' counts as swearing, and would mean the broadcast is pulled. Established Romanian actress, Alexandra Maria Lara, succeeds in making Annik far more than the two-dimensional bit-of-fluff that would have been an easy course. As potential home-breaker, it is tempting to hate her, yet her character is shown with the intellectual appreciation and chemistry that Debbie can no longer offer.Morton, in the Q&A after the Edinburgh premiere, links the film to Saturday Night and Sunday Morning. It is the kitchen-sink, downtrodden existence that her Debbie inhabits. Cinematography is also reminiscent of this period, with its careful black-and-white observation of working class streets. I watched it a second time, enjoying careful compositions and suggestive mise-en-scene. But director Anton Corbijn is typically modest. ""I really wanted you to look at the actors on the screen and only afterwards at the look of the film."" While Ian, in Debbie's eyes, might be the licentious and 'angry young man' of social realism drama, the Control scenes from which she is tormentedly absent show another side: the world experienced by her husband (a reference in the film likens his isolation to Brando's character in Apocalypse Now).""And we would go on as though nothing was wrong. And hide from these days we remained all alone.""Riley takes on manic expressions as if marching away from an impending epileptic fit while singing Transmission. It is such a potent, almost frightening feat, that we have to shake ourselves to remember he only got the part when he was stuck for a job. ""Not a lot was going on in my life before this, so I was appreciative  for the work and the money,"" he tells the opening night audience. ""I imagine this will have opened doors for you,"" I had said to him earlier; he smiled like a man who still can't believe his good luck. But the 'luck' is very well deserved. His 'Ian' is physically and mentally complex. When I had managed to stop him on the Red Carpet long enough to congratulate him, Mr Riley explains that he had a friend who was an epileptic. ""I witnessed an attack often enough to be able to copy it.""Although the film has a driving energy that takes our breath away, it drifts a little towards the tragic conclusion. We know the ending and it is a case of waiting for it to happen. And although it features plenty of excellent Joy Division tracks, any music biopic will never be good enough or accurate enough for some fans.Fortunately this is not just for music fans but for serious film fans as well. It careers in a tightly controlled arc, where music biopic meets cinematic excellence. Why should you see it? ""Some people visit the past for sentimental reasons,"" says Corbijn. ""Some people visit the past to understand the present better."" Control is not in the sentimental exercise category.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Style and Romance,"I saw this film last night then I went home and read a lot of the comments here. I think some things have been missed between the glowing reviews and the bitter disappointments.First, it is a truly beautiful film and I found the acting uniformly excellent. That has already been said plenty of times.More interesting to me are the comments about this not being an accurate or fair portrait of Ian Curtis and those around him. I've read plenty of accounts that characterize Ian and his band-mates as relentless practical jokers -- the book Torn Apart by Mick Middles and Lindsay Reade is full of these anecdotes. But I also think it's naive to expect a film like this to be anything close to a fair and objective telling of anyone's life. This is a dramatic interpretation, not a documentary.In addition to the multiple meanings the title has for the characters in the film, this film is itself an exercise in CONTROL: Deborah Curtis's control over her husband's legacy; the surviving band members' control over the public image of Joy Division.No, the film does not show the laughs and good times the band had, but this is in keeping with all of Joy Division's work. Their entire output as a living band was highly stylized. Almost everything they issued was in stark black and white; their imagery was overwhelmingly bleak and funereal; and they certainly courted controversy with their name and imagery. All of which was very consciously and tightly CONTROLLED by the band and the people at Factory. They gave few interviews and preferred to let the work speak for itself.My point is that this film simply continues that project. It is yet another highly stylized piece of work in the Joy Division canon. To paraphrase the Tony Wilson remark that has been cited elsewhere in these comments -- when you have the choice between the legend and the facts, go with the legend. Their work has always had an epic, legendary quality. This movie is absolutely in keeping with that aesthetic.I think it's also worth noting that Corbijn was a participant in shaping the Joy Division legacy from the very start -- his photographs of the band helped shape their image and his video for ""Atmosphere"" set the tone for how their legacy would be preserved. CONTROL is simply another collaboration with the band and their music. An extension of that original project.I think that ultimately this film is an excellent piece of work. Just as Joy Division produced music of astonishing beauty and resonance out of the misery of life in post-industrial England, this film turns personal pain and loss into a powerful piece of art.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An extremely moving experience,"Days away from embarking on a long dreamed about tour of the United States, Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the band Joy Division, hanged himself on May 23, 1980 from a rope in the kitchen of his apartment. His suicide not only ended his promising young life but also the dreams of a generation. Twenty seven years after his death, the eulogizing continues. Last year saw a documentary by Christian Davies: Joy Division: Under Review and this year has brought two more films: Joy Division: The Last True Story In Pop by Grant Gee and Control, the winner of the Camera d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Based on the 1996 memoir ""Touching From a Distance"" by Ian's widow Deborah Curtis, the film follows Curtis' life from his teenage years to his tragic death at age twenty three.Unlike conventional bio-pics like Ray and Walk the Line with their star glamorizing propensities, Control delivers a three-dimensional portrait of a real human being and how his troubles affected the people closest to him. The film is directed by photographer and video director Anton Corbijn, a celebrated photographer who took some of the most recognized photos of Joy Division. Because he knew and worked with the band, the emotional connection to its subject is palpable. The film is shot in black and white and the choice underscores the grayness of Curtis' home town of Macclesfield, England and the grim mood of much of the work.The major reason for the film's success, however, rests with lead actor Sam Riley who eerily recreates Curtis in appearance and voice. He performs all of the band's iconic songs such as Atmosphere, Love Will Tear Us Apart, and Twenty-Four Hours himself, using Curtis' robotic hand motions on stage to great effect. Another outstanding performance is that of Samantha Morton who plays Deborah Curtis, Ian's loving and patient wife who is overwhelmed by her husband's success and her new responsibilities as a mother of their daughter. Married at a very young age, both husband and wife lack the strength to make a go of it especially with the pressure of Curtis' epileptic seizures growing worse, and Ian's on again off again affair with Belgian journalist Annik (Alexandra Maria Lara).Though the subject matter is melancholy, Matt Greenhalgh's script provides a light touch filled with trenchant one-liners from the group's manager Rob Gretton (Tony Kebbell) and witty remarks from band members Joe Anderson, James Anthony Pearson and Harry Treadaway. Although Curtis has become one of rock's most mythologized figures, Riley plays him simply as a very innocent, down to earth young man whose talent was much greater than his ability to handle it. Control is an extremely moving experience whether or not you have foreknowledge of the events of Curtis' life. It is a film that has the power to touch and leave memories that are indelible.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Walk in silence, don't walk away  in silence.","For me personally writing a comment for Control has proved to be a very difficult thing, my love of the band Joy Division has stayed with me from the very first moment I listened to the Unknown Pleasures album back in 1979. I remember Ian Curtis's death like it was yesterday, and no matter how many years roll by, I still feel an immense sadness when listening to the bands poetic beauty. I was mightily relieved after reading Deborah Curtis's book Touching From A Distance, for I found it refreshingly honest, and certainly it helped people get in a bit deeper to just what a troubled young man Ian Curtis was. So here we are in 2008 and the film adaptation of that book has arrived with truly brilliant results.I have found it hard to write a comment for it because I have to cast aside my biased love of the band, but hopefully I've managed to view it objectively with both my head and my heart. Control is a film about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the band Joy Division, people expecting an in-depth film about the band will be a little disappointed because this is the story of their lead singer, a troubled young man who just couldn't face it anymore. Filmed in black & white to perfectly capture the essence of the man the film is about, director Anton Corbijn has stayed loyal to the source material and crafted a haunting piece of work that lingers long after the final credits roll.We follow Ian Curtis from his humble music leanings in the early 70s, here he meets Deborah who is soon to become his wife, a married man at the age of 18. We watch him join a group of Manchester lads at a Sex Pistols concert, it is here that the roots of Joy Division are formed. Then it's on to the formation of Factory records and the influential Svengali Tony Wilson. As the band start to make waves Ian Curtis becomes ill with epilepsy, and it's here that Corbijn crucially shows that the doctors involved really didn't have a clue how to treat him properly, trial and error with cocktails of drugs indeed.Deborah and Ian become parents to Natalie, but Ian is away on the road for many days and nights, and it's here that he yearns for love from another quarter, and it's here that his infidelity will hang heavy on his already sunken shoulders. The band are set to make it big, their manager announces that they are about to tour America for the first time, this only adds another fraught string to Ian's already fractured bow, the pressure of fame a lethal bedfellow with Messrs epilepsy and infidelity, and then? I can't praise the work on this film enough, Sam Riley {relatively unknown outside of his hometown of Leeds} is simply brilliant as Curtis, dragging the viewer in completely on this desperately sad journey. Samantha Morton as Deborah is immense, she nails the emotional see-saw role with professional aplomb, and I would also like to raise a glass for the performance of the criminally undervalued Toby Kebbell (Dead Man's Shoes, Wilderness) his turn as Joy Division's manager Rob Gretton is down pat. Director Corbijn clearly had love for the project, and thankfully he was sensible enough to not over do the sentimental aspect of the troubled star. What Corbijn has done is perfectly frame the bleaker side of the story with old terraced houses and monstrous looking high rise's, they scream out as dank and dreary statements in black & white, yet they are overlooked by rolling hills to serve as a reminder when Curtis was at his happiest during the courtship with Deborah. Some scenes are unforgettable, such is the power of the emotion on offer, look out for the stunning appearance of heart tugging song Love Will Tear Us Apart, a crucial and poignant scene, and of course the film's tragic outcome hits like a sledgehammer. To which I thank Corbijn for giving us a very tasteful conclusion to this sad sad story.So there it is, was I biased? I like to think I wasn't because I honestly feel that one doesn't have to be a fan of the band to get much from this movie. The film has won many awards, and I'm happy to report that Control has brought renewed interest in the beautiful/haunting work of one of England's greatest ever bands. Remastered CDs, reissued books, and even T-shirts are selling well in the shops as I type.Control is a very sobering experience for fans and newcomers alike. 10/10RIP Ian Curtis, you are very much missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
the enigma of Ian Curtis,"It's 1973 Macclesfield, England. Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) is a quiet enigmatic student. He marries Debbie Woodruff (Samantha Morton) in 1975. He works as an employment agent. On June 4, 1976, they attend a small Sex Pistols concert. Also in attendance are Bernard Sumner, Peter Hook, and Terry Mason. Ian joins them as their lead singer. They call themselves Warsaw and eventually Joy Division.There is a sense of disconnection from this movie and a mystery about Ian Curtis. Sam Riley's performance, the long takes, and the black and white photography all make Ian an enigma. It's a slow burn but compelling. The tone is sad and respectful. It's very fitting of the band and its music.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A stunning and moving portrait.,"Making the leap from photographer to music video director to film director, Anton Corbijn's feature length debut 'Control' is quite simply stunning. Shot entirely in black and white it tell the story of Ian Curtis the lead singer with Manchester band Joy Division but its also much more than that it also tells of one mans journey into the heart of darkness (Apocalypse Now is mentioned in the film) a journey of fear, paranoia, illness and depression. Curtis has been played in films before but only as bit parts (24 hour party people etc) here he is portrayed breathtakingly by Sam Riley who played Mark E Smith in 24 hour party people and when he first appears on the screen I have to admit I wasn't convinced but as Ian the person grows so too does Riley into the role and at times he has him so down to a tee its hard to imagine its not the real Curtis up there. The rest of the band are pretty good as well but are only really second fiddle to Riley but you have to give them credit for learning all the songs and playing them live rather than mime. Samantha Morton is great as the put upon wife Deborah and Craig Parkinson is convincing enough as Tony Wilson but apart from Riley's stand out performance its Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton who has some of the best lines and has come so far since his role in 'Dead Man's Shoes'. The cinematography is a visual feast for the eyes, being shot in black and white adds to the mood and gives a haunting feel that echo's the music and lyrics of the band, it also means (and I guess its Corbijn's photography background) that so many of the shots in the movie could be still images they are framed so well. Although never really explained in terms of answers, Curtis's illness from the seizures to the depression and the hopeless sense of falling apart reminded me of Catherine Deneuve in Polanski's 'Repulsion' another black and white film that deals with madness. I guess that treating mental illnesses was still in its infancy in the seventies, yes we'd stopped electro-shocking people but medications were still being developed and trialled. It seems it was very easy for Curtis to reach a certain point what with juggling home, life on the road, his condition and the pressure of increasing fame but when it came to helping him out he really was on his own and did feel a sense of 'isolation'. But with a story that has a widely known end point its more about the journey and here Corbjin punctures the narrative with some truly witty moments while leading up the incredibly moving and inevitable finale. Handled brilliantly by all involved this is another example of a great British film that deserves all the accolades it is receiving and if this performance is anything to go by expect Riley to be very big indeed.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A strangely ordinary man,"About a third of the way through watching Control, it occurred to me: if this film were about somebody who wasn't famous, it would be absolutely dull. As depicted in this film, Ian Curtis was a very uninteresting person. Besides being the lead singer of Joy Division (and I will take nothing away from the music) he did nothing extraordinary with his life. Nor was he an extraordinary person. He displayed no feats of courage, no wit, he didn't stand for anything, was indecisive, lacking in charm, passionless, an atrocious father, rarely smiled, and possessed no ambition. I can see why he killed himself.So the question remains: why are we watching this film?I have the feeling that there was a lot more to Ian Curtis than nice cheekbones, intense stage presence and epilepsy. And if not, then a point should be made of that. Is this the story of the shy kid who wanted to be David Bowie but then couldn't handle the fame? Was it just the pills that sent him spiraling? Is it a comment on just how normal he actually was? This film has no angle. The acting is excellent. The black and white photography is lovely. The sound design is superb. But all these components are masking the fact that this is simply an astonishingly banal script. There were scenes and dialogue that left me scratching my head, thinking why did we have that? It feels like a first draft. There is no drama in most scenes - for example, the exchanges Ian and Anook are incredibly lifeless.In spite of all this, the film is utterly convincing. It's just also utterly uninspired. I think I will read a Curtis biography now and find out what really made him tick.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Rise and fall of a rock legend in evocative black and white,"The first thing that strikes you about 'Control' is its silence, and the chilly beauty of its black and white images. As a still photographer first-time director Anton Corbijn photographed Joy Division in black and white during their short existence. He knows how to get the remorselessly grim feel of the north of England in the late Seventies. (The boys came from the outskirts of Manchester. Joy Division formed in 1976.) This film (there's a documentary just coming out on the band too) is loosely based on a memoir of her marriage by Deborah Curtis, lead singer Ian Curtis' young wife, who had a baby girl by him and then tragically found him after he'd hanged himself in 1980, two months short of his twenty-fourth birthday, just as the band was to tour America for the first time.'Control's' strength is a certain recessiveness. In the English style, it's offhand and avoids huge dramatic crescendos. That's refreshing. And besides the images and the restraint, the film is worth seeing for the concert sequences. The cast actually plays the Joy Division music live, and Sam Riley, who plays Ian Curtis, not only closely resembles him, but is a riveting and intense, almost at times scary, performer. When he says the public doesn't know how much of himself he puts into his performances, we know what he means.The film is excellent at showing Ian's dilemmas. The band is a sudden success. He has an attack in their car as the band returns from a gig. Doctors tell him he has a form of epilepsy. He's given a fistful of pills to take every day and told to have early nights and stay off the booze. How faithfully he takes the pills is unclear but he suffers from their side effects in various ways, while late nights and booze are essentials of his existence. It doesn't seem that the English doctors knew very well how to treat him, and he was so busy performing he didn't take the time to go to specialists and have more extensive tests.Ian had gotten married to Deborah (Samantha Morton) early--too early. On the road he meets a Belgian part-time journalist, Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), and they fall uneasily in love. He's not strong enough to decide between the two women. Fear that his disease will only get worse hounds him, and the fits go on. Riley is fascinating to watch as he undergoes an increasingly visible meltdown. Other cast members are cyphers, though Joe Anderson, who has the role of Max in Taymor's Across the Universe, is the lead guitarist. Morton has a drab role but Deborah's unfortunate situation is present as a constant counterpart to Ian's story. The two other important characters are the Manchester music guru Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson) and the band's wise-guy manager Rob Gretton (Toby Kebbell).The creative inspiration of the band, the nature of their songs, the cast of their lyrics, the reason why Joy Division is a cult band today when it only existed for four years--these are matters the film is unable to elucidate. Watch it for the cool visuals, for the tall, soulful Sam Riley, and for the terrific live performance scenes. Enjoy the understatement, and the silence. Don't expect more.Harvey Weinstein has chosen both for Control and for the soon-to-open Todd Haynes Bob Dylan film I'm Not There to have a slowly-unrolling distribution system, and hopes to bestow early cult status on both films by having them premiere at that temple of cinephilia, Film Forum, in lower Manhattan, New York City, and wait for the buzz of the cognoscenti to multiply and spread. It may work. But both films are tough sells. But A.E. Scott of the NYTimes has said Control is ""enigmatic and moving, much in the manner of Joy Division's best songs."" And that's a good send-off.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Pretty surfaces, shallow depths","I'm reminded of why biopics generally fail when they attempt to present some objective truth about their subjects based on the subjective impressions of people that knew them: the inner lives of others, even that one person we are closer to than anyone else, remain mysteries to us. Control's Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) is composed of the recollections of his widow, Deborah Curtis, who shares co-writing credit and served as the film's executive producer. Like Hari in Solyaris who is incomplete because she's only a manifestation of Kris Kelvin's impressions of her, there appears to be nothing more to Ian than what Deborah believes to be the truth about him.While Ian remains incomplete, Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), the third party in this love triangle, is reduced to a cipher. We know nothing about her, and she appears to know nothing about Ian. Months into their relationship she implores him to open up by telling her his favorite film and color. That this conversation is the most intimate that they have beyond a clichéd marrying-young-is-a-mistake confession within hours of meeting, demonstrates how completely the deck is stacked against empathy for Annik and by consequence against understanding Ian's interest in Annik. The conclusion Control would have us draw is that Ian's tryst with Annik was the product of little more than base sexual desire muddled with repulsion at the banality of life with Housefrau Debbie Samantha Morton) and baby. This does a disservice to Ian, Annik and, ultimately, Deborah.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
stunning piece of work.......,"Anton Corbin has created a film that perfectly showcases both the music of Joy Division and the short but fruitful life of Ian Curtis. The choice to film in black and white was the right one. It sets the tone perfectly for Ian Curtis' gray and lifeless hometown of Macclesfield in 1973.Corbin as a first time director excels utilizing his visual and technical skills from his previous life as a music video director. Thankfully Control is not just a beautiful looking movie but a perfectly pitched study of the rise and tragic fall of the tortured Ian Curtis. The intensity of the live music performances in the film are as visceral as those of the real band. It is a credit to the actors that they played everything live on screen, it serves to create memorable performances.Sam Riley delivers a towering performance as Curtis. The first time actor is a name to watch. He is surrounded by a great cast but the film is carried on Riley's shoulders.His inner turmoil is conveyed with great humanity and realism. The audience was still and quiet for quite some time after the credits rolled at the screening I attended.There are some very clever and touching uses of the music in the film. Corbin uses the intensity of Curtis' lyrics to help paint a biographical picture of the man. The use of 'Love will tear us apart' in the movie was particularly inspired giving the context of the scene it was played in.

"Beautiful movie, depends who's watching","Control, the story of Ian Curtis, singer of British alternative band Joy Division. The film is made in black and white, which adds a certain edge to the film. There isn't much drama or fast-paced scenes (until the very end, I guess), and that seems to be what everyone criticizes about the movie. Why do you think the director wanted it black and white? If it had been a sincerely boring film, why release it?Of course they made up some aspects of Ian's life, but the fact is that Ian was a dull, depressed human being. He couldn't handle love, or fame overall. He doesn't show signs of emotion in the film, and doesn't speak much at all. Truth is, black and white was exactly what he saw, while he was spiraling towards the end of his life.The acting is incredible. Absolutely spot on. Very very noteworthy.I enjoyed Control, but that's only because I love indie films and rock and roll movies. If you're looking into this movie expecting some delicious drama and edge-of-your-seat thrills, just don't watch it. It's about a man who gradually fell apart, who gradually lost control. And if you can't see that in the film, it's definitely not worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprised that it was so good,"I read the reviews of this film and decided it was worth a punt. I have to say that although I was in Manchester during the 1970s I was not a fan of Punk music. This film is beautifully made - almost like a 1950/60s kitchen sink film of the gritty north (there are worse places than Macclesfield, believe me!). I don't know Joy Divsion's work but the acting in this film by the major players was excellent. Sam Riley as Curtis is very very good as is Samantha Morton as his downtrodden wife. I thought the guy who played the manager was a bit OTT. What a shame that Tony Wilson died before this was released. My reaction to it was much like the one I had to Trainspotting.

Great cinematography!,"Like everyone else, I loved the look of this movie. Beautiful, very artistic, Black and White shots were a joy to behold.The story was good too, riveting in parts, although kind of predictable, well if you were a fan of Joy division, you know the story. LOL.Not the Savior of British cinema as everyone is making it out to be.But sumptuous (sp?) visuals, and some good acting elevates this above the average movie, what more do you want?Well worth seeing, but don't expect a ground-breaking film and you will enjoy it immensely.",,Anonymous,Music
Just so telemovie ...,"Control - as other people have said - did look great. (Although the black and white, while arty, made it seem like world war two. Wouldn't late 70s colour capture the era better, like in their wedding photos?)But, more importantly, it was just so telemovie.First, like lots of mediocre bio pics, it was 'this big event happened, then this big event happened ...', in chronological order, so it was clunky and melodramatic.Secondly, we had no emotional connection with Curtis' distress. Clearly Curtis couldn't talk about his pain in any enlightening way - yet the movie relied on him *explaining* why he felt this way! So it was basically being popular meant there was pressure. Or something like that. No sense of anything more profound. We did see he wanted to sleep with two women at once. And he took medication. But that was it.Disappointing!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent biopic,"Having been on a roll with watching music biopics recently (this, 'Sid and Nancy', 'What's Love Got To Do With It', '24 Hour Party People', 'Great Balls of Fire!', 'I'm Not There', 'Notorious' and 'Nowhere Boy'), 'Control' of those films was the best.Like most of the films mentioned, 'Control' is a divisive film, most loved it while others disliked it. As said, personally was one of the people who loved 'Control'. Not going to say that 'Control' is perfect because it isn't. It does drag and lose momentum in the final quarter and it did run out of gas at the end in terms of pace and drama where things got predictable.However, 'Control' is an excellently made film, every part of the cinematography and images beautifully framed. There is a real evocativeness of it all. The music is absolutely exceptional as to be expected.Enjoyed the surprisingly earthy humour, while dramatically there is a lot of heart, affecting intimacy and humanity. Those elements that director Anton Corbijn brought was a huge part of the film's appeal. Corbijn directs very strongly.Sam Riley is utterly convincing as Curtis, a multi-layered and moving performance that balances Curtis' hyperactive stage persona and tortured personal life without a qualm. Matching him every step of the way is Samantha Morton in a poignant and resilient turn that one can really relate to.In summary, excellent and the standout biopic on viewing music biopics recently. My favourite biopics ever are 'Amadeus' and 'The Elephant Man'. 9/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best films I've ever seen,"""Control"" is one of my favorite contemporary musical cinebiographies ever made, ranking next to ""The Doors"" (1991) both going for a certain accuracy in terms of presentation of events, their great poetic sense in presenting their main characters and without surrendering to sensationalism, exaggerations (although Oliver Stone's film flies away with some imagination but it's good anyway) . Cinematically speaking, the film offers a view on things that are close to the object investigated, through a careful cinematography that recreates style, the period, the way we perceived the life and work of Ian Curtis and Joy Division. It's art in its great state. Most important, the man moving the whole show is Anton Corbijn, video clip director close to the Joy Division, he knew them all, and he makes of this work his film debut. He couldn't pick anything better and more appropriate for a promising beginning.For the challenging role of Curtis, Corbijn has on his side the newcomer Sam Riley, who is one of most amazing talents to rise in the last years. This marks his first screen credit after a few TV movies but he stands firm on the ground by singing, acting and being Ian Curtis, the late vocalist of Joy Division. There's no one like him, so impressive, so young and already acting like a veteran. His performances carries the whole film, going through so many different stages, depressed, angry, shattered, afraid of going to the stage, romantic. We follow Riley/Curtis (gotta make this association) from the moment of start of the band, the first meetings, then writing lyrics from the things he personally felt and seen (example, how he came up with ""She's Lost Control"" after seeing a girl having a seizure on the floor at the hospital he worked), the recognition and attention the band got from Tony Wilson (Craig Parkinson), the first gigs, the success and eventually his fall, and the band's dissolution (turning into New Order and the rest you can follow on ""24 Hour Party People"", which is blasé compared to ""Control"").There's also room for Curtis love relationship with Deborah Curtis (played by Samantha Morton), life in family, and his love affair with journalist Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara), that seems to be used as an indicative of how things got messed up for the man. From the beginning we know that he's a man with many problems, suffered with depression and seizures that often ruined his performance on stage. His lyrics evoke and paint things in a darker, sad way. Just take a look at their most famous song ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"". Real artists who make genuine art must reflect themselves, in one way or the other. Curtis was all that. I'm wonder where did Riley took it all to compose his melancholic portrayal of the man.""Control"" shows the dimension of Ian's problems but it leaves the real reasons for suicide to the perpetrator. Pressure, difficult in dealing with fame, the problems at home, his medical condition, the depression, addiction, who knows? All we know is that on May 18, 1980 he listened to Iggy Pop's album ""The Idiot"", watched one of his favorite films Werner Herzog's ""Stroszek"" and hang himself, leaving everything behind, becoming a rock n'roll icon, eternally remembered by his fans. He just lost control and ended all. It's not our task to judge him. A note I make to the film's great accomplish is by not showing this final moment. We see the ritual (and I want to know how all of this become a fact, with the album and the movie), he enters in the kitchen and the rest is seen through a distant shot of Deborah entering in the house. It would be too painful to see that, we like Curtis too much to see a shocking moment like this.With no lost moments in it, ""Control"" is full of so many great scenes that is difficult to select just one to say that this movie is special. Walking down the streets with a jacket that says ""HATE""; the confusion during a performance where Ian couldn't go to the stage, replaced by a uncharismatic lead singer singing ""Disorder"" and booed by the crowd (the song's inclusion is not an accident); the conversations between Ian and Annik; ""Atmosphere"" for the conclusion was perfect and the band concerts, amazingly played by actors Joe Anderson, Harry Treadaway and James Anthony Pearson playing respectively Peter Hook, Stephen Morris and Bernard Sumner. Outstanding musical numbers!I don't know how much of it was legend or fact or condensation of both, but the true thing I've seen here was epic and it looks and sounds completely real and believable to me. Curtis would be proud of this. 10/10 RIP Ian.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Overrated, falls short of expectations","If it weren't for the music, or if this movie wasn't about Joy Division, it would probably get a 6 out of 10. It's true, it's got some great black and white shots, quite nice use of music, both Joy's and Bowie's -though ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" was too obvious- and Sam Riley's and Toby Kebbell's performances are also good. But that doesn't make a great film.Go watch ""24 Hour Party People"". This should get you in the whole Manchester mood. It seemed to me (a Greek music lover far from the Manchester scene both locally and chronologically) a much much more enjoyable and honest film.Conclusion? Not a bad movie, i recommend it so you may have your own opinion, actually made me shiver in one or two occasions... But that's because it was about Joy Division. The bad news: soulless, skin-deep, in fact a non-existent script (haven't read Deborah Curtis' book to compare), everyone's characters but Ian's are poorly portrayed... Copycating older footage doesn't make you a director.7 out of 10 solely for the music and the live performances",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful and haunting.,"Making an auspicious feature film debut, Anton Corbjin brings the same wonderful sense of essence and truly understanding to his subject matter in ""Control"". What I've loved over the years with Corbjin's work as a photographer is how he manages to capture the essence and spirit of his subject matter whatever it may be. He does this to a remarkable degree in ""Control"".""Control"" is a biopic/portrait of Ian Curtis, lead singer of the Manchester band Joy Division. Just as the band was beginning to build a name for itself, Curtis took his own life in 1980. He was only 23 years old.With any biopic where the central character is deceased, there lies the inherent problem of maintaining audience interest when the conclusion of the story is known. Corbjin does this beautifully via a number of things he does in ""Control"". The very striking cinemascope black and white photography has a very warm and tactile feel to it. It sounds like a cliché, but one feels that time and place that the film depicts.The extraordinary cinematography is combined with a strong, sympathetic script and wonderful performances from a largely unknown cast. Sam Riely is an absolute revelation as Ian Curtis. Having only seen this actor in a small role in Michael Winterbottom's ""24 Hour Party People"", which covered some of the same ground that ""Control"" does, Riely really holds the screen as Curtis. While not physically identical, he absolutely manages to capture Curtis' feeling of displacement and depression. Definitely a young actor to watch.The only 'name' actor in the film is Smantha Morton, who plays Ian's wife Debbie. An exceptional actress who doesn't disappoint here. The actors who play the other members of Joy Division are quite effective and bring a welcome sense of humour and gravity to what is, at times, an intense and depressing story.Highly recommended. My pick of 2007 so far.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Visually bleak, yet moving and honest Biopic","Use of Black and White is sometimes used unnecessarily, and can sometimes come across as a little pretentious. In Control I'd say it was essential. Every shade of black to grey to white is used perfectly to bring life to the film, but always reminding us of the bleak character we are dealing with. The ending I found to be particularly moving, the thick black smoke from the church lifting our antihero into the skies around the fields of Macclesfield.The film also manages to convey very accurately all the events from his short life from a teenager up until his death without passing judgement or making rash statements about his character. It presents the facts and allows us to make up our own minds as to why he behaved as he did. Sam Riley was terrific, especially in any scene involving Joy Division's performances. He really nailed it. The use of music as the soundtrack with no additional scoring seemed to add to the bleakness of the quiet dialogue sequences.I was also quite fond of the portrayal of Rob Gretton by Tony Kebbell, who weirdly played alongside Paddy Considine in Dead Mans Shoes who in turn played Gretton in the Factory Records themed film ""24 hour party people"". He added a little touch of humour which, without it would've made the film unbearably depressing.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"The short, sad life of Ian Curtis ... but the music's great","Joy Division passed me by. I was never much into bands being a singer/songwriter kind of guy, (give me Joni and Mr Dylan any day). Then I heard 'Love will tear us apart' on an ad of all things and I was hooked. Of course, I knew who Ian Curtis was and that he had committed suicide and that like so many rock stars who had died young had gone on to become something of a legend to his followers. I knew less, (zilch, in fact), about Aton Corbijn, the photographer who had chronicled a number of bands, (most famously, U2), in his photographs and whose links with Joy Division were formed long before this movie.This is Corbijn's debut feature and he has made a fine job of it. The film is unremittingly bleak as it follows Curtis and the band through the initial throes of success to the depression that would finally claim his life and like the photographs with which Corbijn made his name it is in black and white. (It has the grimy feel of the kitchen-sink movies of the sixties). The gloom is lifted by the expressive music of the band, here brilliantly recreated by the cast and in particular by the extraordinary performance of newcomer Sam Riley as Curits inhabiting the role as if to the manner born, apparently, both on stage and off. I doubt if fans will be disappointed.Likewise the chameleon-like Samantha Morton perfectly encapsulates the role of Curtis' wife from star-struck teenager through an unstable marriage to motherhood and it is on the book which Deborah Curtis wrote that the film is based. It is a dark film in every sense but Corbijn and Riley imbue its hero with a real compassion which makes the tragedy of his short and talented life all the more moving.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Love tore him apart,"Ian Curtis had suffered more than any man should. Like most depressives, he was difficult to be understood by those around him. A teenager living in a Manchester suburbia turned post-punk rocker--lead singer/songwriter for the now infamous Joy Division--married at a young age, father to a child and dead by hanging at 23.Despite ""Control"" being made by the stunning music video director and photographer Anton Corbijn, and inspired by the memoir ""Touching From a Distance"" who was written by his widow Debbie--who also found the body--there is a feeling of distance and isolation to the character. Perhaps his way of keeping people aside was his greatest legacy. Alienation and mystery elevated to an art form without him even trying.Pretty-boy newcomer Sam Riley also portrays him in a very passive way. His performance might seem effortless, but there is a subdued discipline involved. He is economic with words, the entire movie seemingly happening around him almost independently of whatever he was doing--and let's not forget he is the main character. I am tempted to praise Corbijn for this touch but I feel it came natural given Curtis' absentee nature.But let's just make this clear--his character is not underdeveloped--on the contrary, Corbijn and Riley fully embrace the enigma of a man who, as this movie efficiently showed us--was not that complicated. He married young, like any teenager swooped by adolescent love. So, it was not surprising when he fell for a Belgian journalist who came to interview the band. Annik Honore (Alexandra Maria Lara) is only there to be his mistress. But she doesn't need to be anything more. Curtis had one of those rare qualities you find in people that they can impress simply by being in your presence--an aura of fascination personified again brilliantly in Riley's subdued discipline.Love tore him apart. He loved both Debbie and Annik. His inability to choose might've been due to his young age yet due to his depressive nature he gave away an illusion of wisdom beyond his years. Don't get me wrong--the man was a genius. Too smart for his own good, yet he pushed life too far and too fast and soon enough life pushed back. In one particular scene, Annik asked him what everyone was wondering: ""I don't feel like I know you"". She then proceeded to ask him what his favorite movie was to which he responded with ""The Sound of Music"" to her surprise--not to mine, though. It was so apparent that Curtis did not care for the rock'n'roll life. He was a simple man who loved music so of course that movie would seem appropriate. He hated playing for the people, debauchery bored him and his ""epilepsy dance"" wasn't as much of a rock statement as it was him embracing the aforementioned condition of which he suffered heavily from in confusion.In the end, I must confess that Joy Division was a band I respected more than I actually loved. Their first album was good and a great introduction to rock's potential of catharsis and introspection, yet I loved their second one more. In both, though, Curtis manifested pieces of himself through minimalistic lyrics and his tragic suicide only serves to accelerate their and the band's legendary status.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Portrait of the artist as a confused boy,"Anton Corbijn's film 'Control', about the death of Joy Division singer Ian Curtis, challenges some of rock and roll's most enduring myths. Before Curtis was famous, he went down the employment office, not to sign on, but to work he went down the employment office, not to sign on, but to work; he got married as a boy and when he subsequently took advantage of his growing fame to attract an additional admirer, the consequent moral strain drove him to despair; and the drugs associated with his suicide were anti-epileptics. After his death, Joy Division became New Order, and famously owned a nightclub; but according to Corbijn, Curtis' life was resolutely homespun. As a tender portrait of what it's really like for a young band starting out, the film works well, and Sam Riley is great as Curtis. But some of the film's choices are less clearly correct, such as the portrayal of Curtis' birthplace of Macclesfield as the archetypal grim north, or the casting Samantha Morton as his wife; whatever her skills as an actress, she's too old for the part, and she strains too hard to convey girlishness in an apparent attempt to compensate. I'm also not sure why the film is shot in black and white. But it's certainly much more real than '24 Hour Party People', another movie about the same time and place.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Slight Justice to a Mighty Figure,"You'll see, Im a huge fan of New Order. And by consideration I learned some things about Joy Division, the group that led to New Order. Joy Division was led by Ian Curtis, a young singer with an integral soul, a poet, who sang stories of alienation, loneliness and devastation. He was a poet in the wrong bounds. His life was truly interesting. Just read the delicious songs of him and learn what lied behind him.But what have we got here? I believe that if you presented me this movie bluntly, without saying the word ""Joy Division"", I would have not seen Ian Curtis in the film, just another biopic of a forgotten musician. The essence of the derailing, the soul that cannot keep with it's underling pressures and it's final blend: fame, drugs, and sensibility is not presented in an emotional, understandable way. Yes, sensibility. Ian Curtis was a sensible man; and the movie does a light, poetical justice to him. ""Love Will Tear Us Apart"" is a fine example of his insightful and paradoxical sovereignty over his feelings, that later would collapse.First of all, black and white panoply unnecessary, as if the distraction for colors was utterly needed. It gives the film a pseudo-intellectual look , something that was disposable. Later, some theatrical, elaborated scenes took away from the film the simplicity I expected. Then Samantha Morton, Ian's wife. I don't see a character, a persona: I see a 35 year old actress dressed as a youngster. Maybe that's my own problem, but I can't get over her empty looks. The essence of Ian Curtis is somewhat inconsistent, making me feel uneven. Sam Riley does a nice interpretation, just nice. His demeanor and expressions wave me some despair, but not as in solitude, as in awkwardness. Some scenes jump to fast to their conclusion, without their valued insight: they marry too fast, they get into the band too fast. He lived to fast yes, but I guess that's no excuse.I felt the movie entirely as if they did just a basic research over Curtis. Maybe I feel a blinding passion for his work and life that prohibits me to see further onto the movie's terms. You will like it, I believe. But Im explaining this as a review over Ian Curtis' life, over Joy Division, that I felt I ought over my consideration for him.Anton Corbijin may be a good photographer, and he uses his working tricks to disguise this into an artsy film. Why is it that every biopic that comes out has to be deep, intelligent and the main has to get great credits? Im standing against ""Control"" to say this: -Could have been way better.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Atrocity Exhibition - Too Easy to Watch,"Well...to be brutally honest, it was terrible. The film was really very weak and didn't entice in any way. The thing looked quite nice, all black and white monochrome photography, but even that was only good in spurts.Full of rock biopic cliché's, it was simply too easy to watch, a factor that jarred considerably with the dynamic that made Joy Division (and Ian Curtis) appeal to such a vast amount of people. This dynamic, typified by eerie and haunting atmospheres(excuse me) which seem horribly alienating at first but ultimately draw you in with the accurate depiction of the depths and despair of the human mind, is something that sets the band apart from the crowd. They created their own unique sound that transcended boundaries and created a new strand of punk music. This film was an opportunity to apply that ethic to another medium, to truly realise the essence of the man and the band.The line (paraphrasing): ""It feels like its somebody else, just wearing my skin"" is indicative of the films outward appeal and its mainstream tendencies. In fact, the film is far more malignant and sinister than Curtis' own dissolution.A travesty. The good bits(or the bits that weren't really bad), which were mainly the parts where the band were playing gigs, only served to make you feel horribly let down at how good the film could have been and how much of an injustice the source material had been paid.The casting seemed good on paper, having an unknown playing the main part and giving Samantha Morton a supporting role as the suffering wife. But it just didn't work. Morton was a cliché of the down-trodden and doting wife, all watery eyed and desperately attempting to put their problems out of her mind, and Sam Riley was far too much like a certain more modern 'punk icon', Pete Doherty. It was bizarre, I couldn't get him out of my mind, the big drawn eyes, the wiry gangly frame, the cocky charm, the theatrically wistful stare, it was ridiculous... And from what's been written, nothing like Ian Curtis; he wasn't attractive, he wasn't likable; he was an ugly, cold, self-involved person, and knew it.I won't mention the rest of the cast, as I feel I may just sound like an angry Joy Division fan. Suffice to say, the earlier comment about rock biopic clichés applies.I was so disappointed, thought it was going be good and it just wasn't. Simple as that. And I hate it when films try to condone suicide, its such a pathetic thing to do, the guy had plenty of people who cared about him, but still he screwed them all over. Some would argue that it doesn't condone it, it simply shows it, but this I would disagree with.Saying that, go see it, the songs are played well for the most part(the band who play Joy Division are actually a Leeds band in real life, and actually play the songs), and there are one or two really nice shots of Maccelsfield(!), particularly towards the start. One in particular of the couple sat under a tree just before he proposes sticks out. You may like it, I don't know, it seems plenty of people do for some reason!I appreciate that many will disagree with my opinions, which is fine, but just know that I care very much about cinema, and am very worried and disturbed when films such as this receive such acclaim.",2.0,Anonymous,Music

P***ed me off,"I just saw it. I was equally saddened and angered by it. It is an unfair portrayal of Ian Curtis and an unrealistic one of everybody around him. Style/photography was good and music was brilliant, of course. But as biographies go, this is a stinker. The dead demand our respect and fairness because they cannot speak for themselves.I can elaborate. In brief. Black and white for realism is, well, fair enough, but some realism would also help. Throughout the film the one guy who comes across as a morose arse (to the ignorant) is Ian Curtis. Everybody else is loving/caring/friendly/pat on the back jolly life-loving people and what is wrong with Ian unable to cope with all this love and attention? Nobody will ever know what happened between the late Ian Curtis and his widow. But a film supposedly on a dead music legend, which is based mostly -if not solely- on his, well, it's fair to say ""scorned"" widow's book is doing neither of them any justice.I saw some romance (they were, let's face it, kids) and living in boring Macclesfield but I hardly saw anything about the way the band came together and how they interacted and developed musically. Which is, basically, what I expected, a bit. And not to mention aspects of peoples' relationships that have been widely ""speculated"" but were never even mentioned. But if the people involved are alive, I suppose telling is gossip and bad manners.And then he kills himself. I cried mostly because Mr Curtis deserved better. I'll say it again: the beautiful dead deserve our respect and fairness.",,Anonymous,Music
Not as good as it could have been 6.5/10,"This film largely will appeal to a small niche group who know and like the Joy Division music and already knew the story. The film itself is a reasonable attempt, but it is a bit drawn out and uninteresting in parts, it is no masterpiece and is not worthy of an 8+ rating, a 6-7/10 is closer to the mark.Currently nearly 58% of the vote is rating this as a 9 or 10, I smell a ""ramp job"" as is the case with so many new movies on IMDb these days.I also feel that the movie failed to capture the facts as well as it could have. Curtis came across as weak & indecisive and it almost seemed as if his epilepsy was an unfortunate aspect of his life that just added to his feelings of depression. Rather it was a debilitating condition that caused him immense embarrassment and feelings of guilt, self loathing and ultimately lead to deep depression. The degree of impact that his seizures had on his life were understated in the film. Some of the more interesting parts of Curtis's life were omitted or only touched upon in favor of some fairly bland sequences, the book ""Torn Apart: The Life Of Ian Curtis"" took a much more personal look at his life.Also the part where Tony Wilson ""signed"" the band to his label in his own blood is a well known myth/publicity stunt.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Emotionally Mangling, But Unmissable","Well, it's all been said in other reviews right here.The first words that pop into my mind when thinking of this film are: ""Oh my God"", and that's because this is an awe-inspiring piece of work, made in the European black and white super-realism tradition of the 1960's, and so masterfully done that you feel like you are watching a documentary made just the other day.It's painful; it's sad; it's powerful; it's riveting.Sam Riley delivers a masterful performance as the doomed, sensitive, depressed Curtis (and you really do feel that), Alexandra Maria Lara is superbly gentle yet distant (hard to believe this is the same actress from Downfall) and Samantha Morton is brilliant as ever.Yes, the direction does teeter a little on the edge of being self-important, but this is a hell of a movie that draws you in to being emotionally involved almost despite yourself, and the ending you already know is heading down the line remains shocking and very very sad.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Anton Corbijn hasn't lost Control,"Black and White images of the life of Ian Curtis. David Bowie's songs in slow motions. Smoking cigarettes in depressive bars. Here are the young men, the weighs on their shoulders. ""Control"" is an esthetically portrait of the lead singer of Joy Division, from the day he meets Deborra, his future wife, to the day he dies. It's from her eyes that the story of his life is told, and this subjective and personal point of view gives coherence and strength to this touching movie.Useless to say that the photography of the movie is beautiful, and carries a real artistic point of view on this biopic. The construction of each frames of the film reinforces the solitude and loneliness of the character, by isolating him in one part of the screen. Only when he's with Annik Honoré, he's paradoxically allowed to be completed. The music is also beautifully played and interpreted, and the actor Sam Rilley's made an impressive visual as vocal work as Ian Curtis. His version of ""She's lost control"" is for instance almost better than the original one.The only reproach I can make to this very well done movie is maybe a little over-interpretative uses of Joy Division's music. Every songs has to means something in Ian Curtis's life. ""She's lost control"" is a direct reference to his epilepsy or ""Love will tear us apart"" is a statement about is the failure of his couple. This constant references to Curtis life trough his song gives a rather unoriginal and predictive use of them, that culminates in the last song of the movie, ""Atmosphere"", that is exactly use as in Witterbottom's movie ""24 Hours Party People"".But besides this ""Walk the line"" aspect of the movie, that can be considered as the week point of every biopic about a singer, the movie is very touching, honest and beautiful. All in all, it's an excellent cinematographic translation of Joy Division's musical universe. One last transmission ? Listen to the silence, let it ring on Eyes dark, relentless, frightened of the sun, we would have a fine time living in the night Left a blind instruction, take away our sight !",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"subtle, well-acted docudrama","""Control"" is a biopic about Ian Curtis, the lead singer of the 1970's British rock band Joy Division, who killed himself in 1980 immediately before the group was to embark on its first American tour. The movie chronicles Curtis' early days in Manchester, the formation and rise of the band, his unhappy marriage, his serial philandering, his uncontrollable epilepsy, and his lifelong battle with depression.One might be tempted, looking at the bareboned detailing of his life, to ask if there is really anything new here. And indeed, Curtis' story seems to follow a fairly standard arc for the lives of artists in general and rock musicians in particular (though there doesn't seem to be a whole lot of illicit drug use going on in this case), and as such the movie doesn't show us much of anything we haven't already seen countless times before in similar works. Yet, ""Control"" is so cool, understated and restrained in its handling of the material that it succeeds in drawing us into the lives of these characters in spite of the over-familiarity of the tale. The conflicts are real and the emotions raw, particularly when dealing with Curtis' rocky relationship with his wife, Deborah, who loved Ian unconditionally but could never get him to reciprocate those feelings, partly because Ian had fallen in love with a Belgian fan he met while on tour.In a beautifully controlled and thoughtful performance, Sam Riley poignantly captures the sadness that seems to lie ever present at the core of Curtis' being, while Samantha Morton conveys the almost desperate state of a woman too much in love to realize, until it is too late perhaps, that she isn't receiving love in return (the Matt Greenhalgh screenplay is based largely on Deborah's memoirs chronicling their time together). Much of the anguish Curtis went through in his life served as source material for the lyrics to many of the group's songs, a number of which are used to provide a running commentary throughout the film. The movie also makes effective use of voice-over narration to try to figure out what is going on in that troubled head of his.For his impressive directorial debut, photographer Anton Corbijn has wisely chosen to shoot his film in artful black-and-white, the better to capture the starkness of the scene and the state of his character's mind. Joy Division purists may object to the fact that Corbijn has had the actors themselves perform the songs rather than dubbing in the originals, but they do a fine job overall in interpreting the pieces.Whether Curtis, in the long run, had a harder life than many who don't wind up committing suicide is not for us to determine. What the film does make clear, however, is that once he felt he was losing control over his life (symbolized by his constant and seemingly incurable epileptic seizures) and had pretty much made a mess of things as a husband, a father and a lover, his purpose for continuing in the struggle seemed to have disappeared. What a sad conclusion to come to, especially when one is only twenty-three years old. With subtlety and insight, ""Control"" movingly distills the essence of that sadness.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sam Riley astonishes, and moody late 70s Manchester is convincing...","Control (2007)The first thing that should strike someone familiar with Joy Division's music, and with movies about rock bands, is how low-key and unglamorous this film is. Instead of plowing into a bunch of music clips, or dwelling on drug use and brushes with early fame, Control focuses on the lead singer, the charismatic and troubled Ian Curtis. This is a movie about a bunch of ordinary seeming kids, each with their small quirks and sometimes rather small (but sufficient) talents, and about how they get through that first series of layers toward becoming a successful band. Shot in gorgeous, crisp black and white, and centered in a middle class Northwest England (greater Manchester) in the late 1970s, it is both serene and gloomy.Sam Riley is undeniably the core of the movie as Curtis (the more famous Samantha Morton plays his wife well, but has a smaller role). We vaguely know what will happen by the end, so it doesn't just parade facts as the band wins fans and gets bigger gigs. It peers into the mind and actions of a gifted songwriter and idiosyncratic punk and post-punk performer. Riley manages to recreate the aura of Curtis, especially in these scenes early on where they are playing in obscure places with small crowds, and this is really hard to do, since pop music stars become legends in part because they have some special presence in the world, some quality that makes them stand out. But Riley manages even better to show the brooding, lyricist side of the singer. It's a must-see performance, subtle and convincing and singular.Is this a way to learn something about Joy Division's music? Not really. And that's just as well. Go to iTunes for that (their first two albums are the core of it). The movie isn't about music, but about relevance, and how to take some ability and quiet drive and break out of the doldrums of life. It dips into the era with such believable and restrained simplicity it's a revelation. Yes, it sometimes flags, and sometimes seems to have only the one long, complicated thread, with a given outcome, and so it isn't an inventive, swirling work of fiction (the facts have it trapped) nor a masterpiece of ensemble acting (which it isn't trying to be). But it's about as good as movies about music and musicians get, and it's a beautiful, remarkable journey about one man caught up in it all, and in his own struggle for decency and significance.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Gorgeous To Look At But Doesn't Do Ian Justice,"Cinematographic wise, this film is beautiful. Nearly every shot is picture perfect. The acting is great too. The actor playing Ian Curtis really took the time to learn his mannerisms/movements and it shows. It also helps that he looks like him. The actresses for Deborah and Annik look like them as well. I was reading that the decision to make the film in black and white was a last minute decision, as the director thought it looked better that way; plus the director is a photographer as well, which may have influenced the decision as well. I think black and white was the perfect route to go with when it comes to telling Ian Curtis' story. The music matches it perfectly and, I think, it perfectly matches his energy. There was always a grey gloom to Ian Curtis, a sad aura manifested by his severe depression, plus most of his photos are in black and white. The film is like seeing those candid photos come to life, so it's aesthetically pleasing.When it comes to the story and how Curtis is presented, this is where the film doesn't do so well. The synopsis claimed that the film follows his days as a schoolboy up until the tragic end, but they only spent what seems like 15 minutes exploring his schoolboy days. We get that he had humble beginnings, idolized David Bowie and was a sensitive, artistic soul from the start. They briefly show his abuse of over the counter drugs and quickly jump into his relationship with Debbie. The movie is 2 hours long, there's really no good excuse for why they'd rush through important plot points that would help people understand Ian's overwhelming depression and powerful demons. The way the movie is set up makes it seem like the main thing that caused everything was his infidelity to Debbie. It shows his battle with epilepsy, how he couldn't handle the fame and expectations that came with the success of Joy Division, but the movie's main focus seems to be the love triangle between him, his wife, and Belgian reporter Annik Honoré. While I'm sure this further deteriorated his mental health, I don't think it was at the center of his downfall like the film seems to imply. The movie doesn't paint him in a favorable light, of course, I'm aware he wasn't perfect. However I don't think it's fair to show him as being solely this disloyal, selfish guy. I feel like showing him this way really does no justice to having people understand his depression. The guy's problems were there long before he married Debbie or found success with Joy Division, if the film wanted people to better understand Ian Curtis, then they should have spent time fully exploring his life like the synopsis promised. It's brief in the moments that matter and fully focused on the love triangle.The movie is based on a book Debbie Curtis wrote and that makes sense of why the film focuses on his infidelity, but in that case they should've said the movie was about Debbie's experience with Ian, instead of selling it as the story of his life. I don't think it was right that he cheated on her, especially right after she had just given birth to their daughter, but he was really young when they married. He seems to have been an impulsive individual and if the movie explored his inner world more, then he wouldn't come off as this cruel, selfish guy. As gorgeous as it is to look at, the film doesn't do Ian Curtis justice. There was more to him than the film shows, there were more things that caused his problems and I wish the film explored that. He was more than the depressed, cheating husband. Maybe in the future, he'll get a proper biopic.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very , very , very ' thin '","Corbijn is a Photographer.He likes Black and white atmosphere's. That's about the only thing I could ' enjoy ' in this honestly extremely meager film.An assumption Corbijn himself must know , is that to be a Filmmaker takes a totally other discipline (IMO) than to be a still photographer. This Film lacks a lot of elements that make it interesting. Anton Corbijn is no film director.He did'nt succeed to put any depth into the character of Ian Curtis nor in any of the others.... Corbijn did not succeed in enfolding the mystery of Curtis's struggle with life.He doesn't get beyond atmospherically sketches , which might work in a photograph , but which do NOT work in this film. I am amazed by the positive way this pic.is received. Anton Corbijn certainly did not put any dept in the existence of the great music by the Joy Division. IMO it would have been better to have left that story to what is was.I honestly cannot see what extra load has been put to the sad life and death of a seriously depressed person , who happened to be a Cult Singer and who decided to end his , in his view , miserable life.ps:even the 'darkness'of Ian Curtis's life has no layer whatsoever in this film.utterly hollow and thin.I mean Corbijn does certainly not succeed in showing us the conditions as to what drove Ian to his death. I mean , Ian was very depressed ,but nowhere in the film ,apart from 2 or three occasions where a voice-over tells his ' dark ' view at the world , does this fact become eminent.I could enjoy some of Anton's frame compositions , his photographic view , but that's about all that.If mend to be an Ian Curtis character study....a total failure.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautifully tragic,"In the 80s I was as rabid a Joy Division fan as there ever was. I owned their complete discography going back to their Warsaw days, including rare bootlegs and limited pressings given away in British music magazines. I was also utterly floored upon hearing the news that lead singer Ian Curtis had committed suicide, hanging himself on the eve of the band's scheduled departure on what would surely have been a ground breaking US tour. So it goes without saying that had director Anton Corbijn's biopic Control been released back then, I would have flocked to it as only a fan can do and likely loathed it for peeling away the veneer of myth surrounding the singer.Jump ahead 27 years and time has proved to be a great leveler. The fan-boy enchantment I once held for the group has been replaced by a continued respect for their music, and a more realistic view of the man who capitulated to his inner fears and demons, and left behind a loving wife and young daughter at the precise moment when a world of opportunity was about to open.Corbijn's Control manages to capture that disconnect between the mythic Ian Curtis of fandom, and the real man who repeatedly strayed from the medication prescribed to control his epilepsy, turned his back on a devoted wife, and ultimately robbed his band-mates of what should have been their shining moment.Based on ""Touching from a Distance"", Deborah Curtis' 1995 account of their marriage, Control's centerpiece is the performance of Sam Riley, who brings to the role such an uncanny resemblance to Curtis that he almost appears to have been cloned. Curtis' on-stage mannerisms, tics and quirks, all of which can still be viewed thanks to YouTube, are all there. So is the music, but only as a backdrop to the actual story. Corbijn, who was initially reluctant to helm this project for fear his reputation as a rock video director would unfairly label the movie, casts the story in the fitting downbeat mood it demands. Filmed in gritty black and white, the film captures the bleakness of northern England and, in its own strange way, forces viewers to narrow their focus on the story being played out rather than being enchanted by the music scene of the day.It follows Curtis' life from pre-band years spent working in an employment office and aiding seniors at a nursing home, through his teenage marriage to Deborah and the birth of their daughter a few years later, to Joy Division's sometimes turbulent halcyon days with Manchester's Factory Records - it's all there if you've followed the band's story, and therein lies the movie's only problem. I'm not sure how well Control would play out to anyone who wasn't a fan. It's not that the movie requires the viewer to possess background knowledge to fill in the gaps, because it doesn't, but its impact and magnitude of the tragedy wrought by his death likely won't be the same. In fact, Control is yet another testimony to the breadth of stupidity and selfishness of Curtis' suicide as Deborah's loving book upon which it's based, as well as her assuming the mantle of the film's co-producer, continue to serve as an indicator of her love for the man who was conflicted in his emotions for her and ultimately took the poetic coward's way out of his family's life.Much in the way Curtis' band-mates managed to find closure by morphing into New Order, Control provides Deborah Curtis and Ian's legion of fans a way to look back in silence and walk away, even if it leaves you shaking your head at a life, love, and opportunities lost.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
All the monochrome Manchester clichés,"""Tell me about Macclesfield..."" (spoken in sensuous Belgian accent)A reasonably strong film, this; Corbijn adopting an appropriately gloomy naturalism. For a richer understanding you will also require Paul Morley's side of the story (""Piece by Piece"", his 2007 compendium of writings on the band) and a familiarity with the collected works of JG Ballard, Franz Kafka and Werner Herzog. However, this is worth watching all the same - unfolding from the perspectives of Deborah and Ian Curtis, mainly being drawn from Deborah's memoir, ""Touching from a Distance"" (1995).There is some sense of the rich cultural terrain of Post Punk Britain; ""Radio On"" was clearly an influence and the soundtrack includes the Kraftwerk and Eno, to place Joy Division in their rightful context as European forces of nature (and machine). Curtis is portrayed as a self-educated working-class intellect and instinctive European who is constrained by, and yet drawn back to, his Cheshire roots. Perhaps Owen Hatherley is correct when he describes the film as a hagiography of Curtis - it does perhaps fall into the trap of many biopics that make things a bit pat and obvious. His character seems a bit simplified and reduced; perhaps due to the adaptation of a book written from one person's perspective. This is avoided in ""Nowhere Boy"" (2009), with its portrayal of the flawed young John Lennon; that film also has a more robust sense of the social context than this film.Riley and Morton give expert, if predictable performances, doing their best with what they are given; as do the bit-part strollers playing the visionaries and jesters of Post Punk Mancunia: Toby Kebbell as Rob Gretton, and Craig Parkinson as Mr Manchester himself, Tony Wilson. Hooky is played as a Neanderthal and Sumner as a sensitive sort, powerless to aid Curtis. Alexandra Maria Lara is competent enough as Curtis' Belgian mistress, perhaps straining for the Euro-ennui of Lisa Kreuzer in ""Radio On"".Overall, this has a certain power on first viewing, though a lot of this is due to its careful assimilation of so many cherished post-punk tropes. It is too perfectly crafted to upset any boats - a kind of English Heritage simulacrum of our formerly alternative culture.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Haunting...,"This will be a short, hopefully concise review. I did not know Joy Division's work even though I was in my early twenties when they started to ascend. I always have loved music yet find stuff like The Cure and Depeche Mode not to my liking since it is darkly obtuse-that may explain my being unaware of Joy Division. That said, this movie seems brilliant in the way one becomes immediately drawn under the spell of both Curtis and Joy Division's music. Ian, though seemingly unaware of the audience, keeps the audience rapt. The music, though depressing, is very well played, the lyrics direct and as a result connects. We all had some of the same feelings, and not just as young adults. Unfortunately we have seen the effects too many times. Therefore it is relevant I'd say on some level with us all. As stated the movie brilliantly portrays what happens when mental illness and guilt derails the person. Nothing, short of addiction, is more insidious than mental illness and this is a sad document that should be seen as it pulls no punches and is truly haunting.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Classic,"What I most enjoyed about this beautifully shot film were the ways it elevated the somewhat typical life of a rock star into a more classical realm. The choice of black and white lent the film an almost archetypal quality--showing a trajectory we have witnessed time and again throughout the history of music, yet pushing the viewer to watch in the way Antonioni's masterpieces do. Although Corbijn charts a somewhat well-hewn path, his background as a rock photographer shines through, rendering clear, sleek B&W that compels long gazing. While the film is wonderfully acted, I'm not sure the actors should have performed the musical material. Watch the actual Joy Division videos, included in the bonus section, and the difference, energetically, is salient (as are the strikingly different spirits of Sam Riley and Ian Curtis). Curtis had much more of a wispy softness; Riley appears more addled and robotic, as if he's trying to convince us that he's about to seize at any moment. He is not the soft, Bowie-loving poet. However, this aside, the film is well worth viewing for those who love rock and rock photography, even if they are not specifically Joy Division fans.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Tedious. But the cinematography is perfect,"A suitably stark and serious account that follows a straight line and plays fair with the viewer, although one is left in the dark as to much of the creative influences or processes of Curtis who apart from his health problems remains something of a blank cypher. This is otherwise a subtly stylised work eschewing gimmick and trickery despite an air of reverence which is never quite substantiated.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Disappointing: a ""stop motion"" movie","I do not know why this movie gets so much critical acclaim. There is just no flow. No development. Things are just happening one after another. A series of long lasting photographs. Almost every shot is beautifully arranged, but so still and 'floating'. The Characters I found not very convincing. No development and true interaction (I know in Ian's case that's to be expected). Also the timing of songs like 'Love Will Tear Us Apart' and 'Isolation' in the movie is rather........eh.... cheesy.By the way, the band playing live works really well. And Corbijn is a great, great photographer.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Behind a name,"It's surprising what a name can hide, what a word defines and what it leaves out. ""Control"" brings some light to late vocalist Ian Curtis, the man itself, behind Joy Division.What is often spoken is that he had a tragic death at the age of 24 with a suicide that ended a rather complicated life. Not being a true fan of J. Division and not knowing what it was about i was surprised by the young boy hiding behind that name, trying to find out his way through live the best he could. His youth mirrors every aspect of his life, from the impetuous choices he made to the early marriage and fatherhood or the passionate/silent relation with Annik. That's the center key for the whole movie, watching a young man trying to shape itself, trying to grow, coping with life, becoming aware of choices and trying, just trying, to be in control. All of this with a troubled personality. The black&white cinematography works perfectly to portray the dismayed dormitory cities in England's 1970's, pure urban voids where nothing interesting seemed to possibly grow; and surprisingly the background for cult bands of that time. It seems he never left those places.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Sad movie...,"why does great talent die young ? only 23 and had yet to live a full life. good movie, however it was depressing, and enlightening at the same time. it was a bit slow paced for my tastes. Overall, I was only familiar with one of their hit songs that was played relentlessly on the Radio here in Seattle. The problem I think during that Era is that everybody was overshadowed by Kurt Cobains, ""Nirvana"" . When Kurt hit the scene, music that resembled that genre, either pre or post Kurt were judged by his Benchmark, which in mainstream music is a tough one to compete against.So in retrospect, I barely heard of the Joy Division music cause the Seattle scene has left a major mark on Music History and anyone else fell by the way side.I liked the movie, though depressing and sad. Reminds me what real genuine talent will sacrifice for pure art. Something you won't find today. todays musicians are formulated pop teenybop no talent having moneymaker music whores. They all sound alike. something you can play in an elevator.Ian Curtis, was the real deal. The Genuine Article. Real Talent. The truth and passion expressed through his art, which is why we love music in the first place.",,Anonymous,Music
"great film . . . believable, probably true to life","This film was great. Sam Riley really got into the role and communicated it in a very believable way. My only criticism (and this is truly nitpicking) is that the story is told exclusively from the point of view of Deborah Curtis (Ian's wife). Yes, she wrote the book on which this film is based, and yes, she co-produced the film. Perhaps seeing Ian as a poor father and husband makes him more real than if we could have seen more of the misunderstood genius. But there is very little attention paid to Ian's creative process, not enough paid to his influences/inspirations, etc. Ian's family life is portrayed as being clearly separate from his professional life. It seems strange that someone so determined to portray herself as ostracized would go so far as to co-direct a film about a character whose notoriety stems from the very thing she was ostracized from. But maybe I'm looking into it too much.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Pretty and Careful,"This biopic by famed photographer Anton Corbijn about the late Ian Curtis, lead singer of Joy Division, looks sharp and is likely to please fans (it already has an 8.3 out of 10 on IMDb). Though ostensibly based on his widow's memoirs, it delves into many areas of the singer's life that she never gained access to, such as his life on the road and an intense love affair therein. CONTROL, unlike the Corbijn-directed music video for Joy Division's ""Atmosphere,"" made 8 years after Ian's suicide, doesn't seem to want to push the myth of Ian Curtis further, but merely to photograph it. Corbijn, known for snapping some of the only photos of Joy Division, has said that he was a smitten, impressionable fanboy at the time--and this movie clearly grew out of that experience. It is as if the only way Corbijn could feel artistically in charge was to shape his actors in to veritable band members (the actors play and sing and dance Joy Division's songs themselves) and then simply photograph them like he would U2 or Miles Davis or, well, Joy Division. The effect is good-looking, but the movie isn't so much about the music, or the band playing it, as about Ian's troubled life off stage: epilepsy, booze and the consequences of an early marriage and fame. Due to a lack of pathos, the movie often seems to be merely glamorizing doom, and if we can't be there for the music, we are apparently supposed to be entertained by suffering.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The awful truth,"I'm an American from Baltimore who used to be a rock critic for my Pennsylvania newspaper back in the eighties. I read an article in the New York Times by rock critic Robert Palmer (not the musician) headlined ""Truly Compelling Rock and Roll."" It discussed two bands, Joy Division the the Feelies.I immediately bought records by both bands and was blown away. (The Feelies deserve a special article of their own and this is not the place).Ian Curtis' sepulchral vocals immediately struck me on ""Closer."" I didn't even know he was already dead. I read in the Village Voice how he had hanged himself and was absolutely baffled. How could this voice be gone? I consider ""Decades"" the greatest accomplishment of a British art band. And I'm a fan of Bowie, Roxy and Peter Gabriel.Watching this movie, I see all the stuff that crushes rock. I did not know Ian Curtis had a seizure condition. I did not know his conflicted romantic situation. I did not even know how much his personal life played into his music.British vs. American rock. Where do you fall? False dichotomy. Are the Brits an echo, a mirror, a copy? No, they are an enhancement, a different vision. They return the favor.Samantha Morton as Ian's wife. Wonderful. One of our great actresses. Check her out in ""Minority Report.""Rock music is about a special kind of talent. It has little to do with actual skill with an instrument. It is democratic. It is shamanistic. Ian Curtis had it.RIP, Ian.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Devastating and Brilliant,"If Ian Curtis were a fictional character, he would truly be one of the most tragic anti-heroes of all time. He is a man whose romantic youth had been very foolish and had led to his sense of being completely trapped with every avenue of escape turning sour. The fact that he was a real person makes this story devastating. This is not a film for a rainy afternoon, but it is absolutely brilliant.The strength of this film cannot be pinned down to one single area. Matt Greenhalgh's script is intelligent. Corbijn's direction is interesting. The soundtrack is electric. The look of the film is stylish. The cast is superb. It is an all round impressive piece of work emphasised by the fact that it is able to overcome its failings, which mainly stem from the pace. Whilst it is nice to see a film that is prepared to take its time, there are times when the speed begins to drag. However, it is worth working through the slower moments.There are moments when the film is absolutely gripping and electric, but at all times it is interesting. Corbijn brings style effortlessly to this film. The monochrome cinematography may seem clichéd but it is completely apt and wonderful to look at. His cutting is fascinating: there is always something going on. His choice of music is brilliant and the soundtrack is an absolutely terrific collection of songs. It is an astonishing effort from the debut director, who actually photographed the band when they were in their prime.He is supported by a pitch perfect cast. Sam Riley, in essentially a debut performance, is magnificent. He completely holds your attention and is sympathetic despite his character's human failings. He is assisted by a wonderful supporting performance from Samantha Morton. When the pair of them are on the screen together, they create genuinely touching scenes. From playing the happy young lovers right through the lows of their relationship, they are utterly believable. The rest of the ensemble, especially Alexandra Maria Lara and Toby Kebbell, complete the sense of the world of late seventies and early eighties Macclesfield.However, despite the brilliant direction, the superb sound and the wonderful performances, the reason why this film will last for many years is the central story about a young man trapped by the accident of birth, his mistakes and his misfortune. It isn't uplifting and it isn't heroic. It is utterly heartbreaking. It is utterly human.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A fitting and worthwhile tribute,"As a fan of Joy Division and also hearing so many positive things said about this movie,it was with some trepidation that I watched 'Control'.So often it is the films that you really look forward to that can disappoint the most.I am glad to say that this movie is very well made and a fitting tribute to the life of Ian Curtis.Filmed in black and white,this gives the film the atmosphere needed for the subject matter.While we may all know the outcome,the ending is done with subtlety and handled in a very professional manner.The movie never tries to gloss over the darker phases of Curtis' life but there is never the slightest hint of sensationalism and you get the feeling that the story of his life is being told in an honest and accurate way.As for the acting,it is uniformly excellent throughout.Sam Riley gives a very good performance as Ian Curtis especially when he is on stage.He truly becomes the troubled singer and deserves the plaudits that he has received for this film.He could have a pretty good future ahead of him.Samantha Morton is as reliable as ever as Deborah.She shows the torment but also the love she felt for Ian Curtis in a convincing way and it is to her credit that she manages to portray a woman quite a few years younger than herself in an always truthful and honest way.I was also impressed with Toby Kebbell as the manager of Joy Division Rob Gretton.He brings humour and a touch of cynicism to the role and almost steals the movie.Actually,there aren't really any dud performances in this film at all.This is a fine film and captures the spirit of the time perfectly.Well directed,beautifully shot and a very good script.Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
No thanks,"I thought this was a dreadful film but then I've never liked Bio-Pics because they can never capture the charisma of the original performers. I did like the Glenn Miller one and the Buddy Holly Story but even with that, Holly's wife said their courtship was laughably inaccurate in its portrayal. So what's the point? Is this social realist/ kitchen sink drama? In which case, why all the inaccuracies? I remember us all listening to that EP where Joy Division first appear (I think as Warsaw.) We kept playing the opening: ""You all remember Rudolf Hess?"" over and over again as it sounded so dodgy, what with the band's alleged ""reputation"". I'm pretty sure the song that follows is ""A Later Date"", not ""Leaders of Men."" But maybe that wasn't the case in reality. And I seem to remember the bassist telling the story of how Rob Gretton became their manager and it was nothing like the macho confrontation depicted. Just the opposite, to an amusing degree. And the band confessed the ""blood letter"" was apocryphal. Does any of this matter? Well, according to the critics you would think ""Control"" is the second coming of Tarkovsky. But there is no such poetry here as the director is a photographer turned director. Film is another discipline altogether, and the crucial failing is that Joy Division arguably have that mysterious mojo called ""artistic talent"", while the director's lack of it sticks out like a sore thumb on the screen. Why did he want to make this film? I was left none the wiser, and I heard yawns around me.Do we need art? Is it in any way essential? Maybe the film is not interested in the question. The really uncomfortable aspect of ""Control"" is we know the outcome, and the songs are merely box after box to be ticked as they bring you ever closer to that event. Really quite dreadful to sit through. The whole minute by minute depiction of the tragedy was unpleasant and unnecessary, at least to me. Yes, it was sad but is this helping?The final shot was particularly repulsive and seemed to allude to the controversy of their name and image, hardly touched upon in the film itself. Sadly, this is a trite little film and definitely made by a fan.",,Anonymous,Music

"For fans and newcomers alike, a riveting portrayal of a young life falling apart","Anton Corbijn's film Control charts the life of Ian Curtis, the lead singer with Joy Division, who committed suicide aged just 23. Curtis is introduced as a confident, Bowie-aping, Wordsworth-quoting teenager. Very soon he is a young married father and has joined a local band, first known as Warsaw and then as Joy Division. The pressures exerted on Curtis by performing with the band, his deteriorating health and an extra-marital affair lead to the unravelling of his life and mental state. The music, the drugs and the marriage that had once brought contentment become sources of anxiety and despair, culminating in his tragic death.Sam Riley is remarkable in the role of Ian Curtis. His acting successfully spans from cocky teenager to tortured young parent, and his performance of Joy Division songs in clubs and studios are uncannily like the real thing; his singing voice and his dancing are spot on. The performance of 'Transmission' on live television is an electrifying experience and one of the high points of the film.Sarah Morton is excellent in the role of Deborah Curtis, Ian's wife, whose memoirs formed the basis for this film. Ian's betrayal of his faithful wife and young daughter is often painful to watch. The other band members of Joy Division, who went on to perform the band New Order after Curtis's death, are convincingly portrayed, from chirpy guitarist Bernard Sumner to surly bassist Peter Hook. Curtis's band-mates try to be supportive of him as his condition worsens, as do the music industry types surrounding him, including Rob Gretton, the band's sharp-witted agent, and Tony Wilson, the ultra-enthusiastic head of Factory Records. But the real tragedy here is that no one really understood what has happening to Ian or how to help him.Photographer-director Anton Corbijn renders the film's settings in striking black and white. Much of the film is set in Macclesfield and the monochrome imagery plays upon Curtis's growing boredom and disillusionment with his hometown. Corbijn succeeds in creating a music biopic that is accessible to newcomers; I came to this film with little prior knowledge of the music and story of Joy Division and came away with much, much more. The film is adept at drawing connections between Curtis's life outside the band and how this fed into his lyrics and performances, notably when his relationship with his wife begins to sour and he responds by penning the words to 'She's Lost Control.' This is a superb film for fans and newcomers alike and certainly the best British film of last year.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

It's not just love that tore him apart,"Perhaps I'm extremely biased because I'm a big fanatic of the British New Wave music founders – and Joy Division in particular – but ""Control"" is truly one of the best and most astounding biographies I ever beheld! This movie had me staring at the TV-screen with my eyes, ears and mouth wide open from the beginning till the very end of the closing credits. This film does not only describe the regrettably short life of Ian Curtis, singer and songwriter of the influential band called Joy Division, it completely also plays like his life: modest, depressing, anxious, sober, careful and saddening. ""Control"" is primarily a portrait of a struggling man instead of an aspiring band. The prompt and relatively fast rise of Joy Division is merely a footnote in the story of a talented young man who seemingly never had the ambition of becoming an international music star. Ian Curtis' life differs tremendously from all the other musicians in the world. He proposed to join a struggling band named Warsaw as a singer simply to help them out. He wrote songs about the things he saw happening around him (""She Lost Control"" is a beautiful example) and never even intended to quit his day job by his own initiative. Whereas all his fellow band members and young manager are trying to make the name Joy Division known and famous to the public, Ian Curtis married his teenage love and had a child. The increasing success of Joy Division is inversely proportional to the downwards spiral of Ian Curtis as an individual. His continuous anxiety causes the condition of epilepsy, he becomes dependent to heavy medication, loves two women at the same time and he can't bring himself to enjoy his newly obtained fatherhood. Ian Curtis committed suicide one day prior to the band's very first scheduled USA tour and without ever leaving behind a farewell note or a cry for help. His life story was a tragic one, and Anton Corbijn's film is a perplexing re-telling of the barely four years of vital events that brought this talented young man down.Of course, Anton Corbijn very much knew what he was filming about. This native Dutch director started out as a music photographer in the 70's and developed into a music video director for acclaimed bands like R.E.M, Depeche Mode and Metallica. Apparently the band Joy Division fascinated him since the beginning and nearly 30 years after Ian Curtis' death, he finally realized his much ambitioned biography project with the help of the memoirs of Curtis' widow Deborah Curtis (depicted in the film by Samantha Morton). ""Control"" also largely relies on brilliant casting and dedicated performances. The actors do not only look a lot like the original Joy Division/New Order band members, they also actually learned to play the Joy Division songs themselves. And extremely well, I may add, as illustrated through clips of ""Transmission"", ""Digital"" and ""Dead Souls"". Sam Riley, a relatively unknown actor from West Yorkshire, truly gives a tour-de-force performance as Ian Curtis and too often it really felt as if I was watching archive footage of the real Joy Division singer. Anton Corbijn creates the exact right atmosphere through long sequences of silence, moody black and white photography and rudimentary set pieces. The soundtrack contains works from other music geniuses like David Bowie, Roxy Music and Iggy Pop. A must see movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Joyless revision,"I'm not greatly into the whole Joy Division / New Order musical trip, finding the music too grim and never forgiving the Nazi-chic of their deliberately chosen band names. Plus I remember at the time reading in the music press of the day the legend ""Ian Curtis died for you"" and dismissing it as sheer hyperbole. After watching this movie, I still don't believe the latter but do have a better knowledge of the man behind the myth as well as a better appreciation of the band's music.Unsurprisingly shot in black and white by the celebrated monochromatic rock photographer Anton Corbijn (later associated with his iconic images of Depeche Mode and especially U2), the film is thus rendered bleak and grey, the proper background for the depressed Manchester and Macclesfield locations that were the backdrop to Curtis's life as well, of course as his turbulent life and the group's doomy, powerful music.The movie eschews the traditional celebration of the rising success of the group to the extent you're hardly aware of their popularity at all. All the way through, Curtis lives in run-down houses and freely moves in everyday locations with hardly any admission of his growing celebrity and increasing musical significance. Instead, the film concentrates on his epileptic illness and growing surliness together with his relationships with the two women with whom he had lasting, if difficult relationships, his wife Deborah and his lover, Belgian Embassy attache Annik.I struggled somewhat with the relentlessly downbeat insight into Curtis's life and at times struggled to see how he could attract the attention of the two women who struggle for his attention. A largely absent and disinterested father and husband he cheats on his wife and yet returns to her, lacking the courage to do the honourable thing and move on to let her live her own life. In the end, his depression at his personal conflict, his debilitating illness, addled by his medication and drinking leads him to his final act of self-destruction and of course the debate as to whether this was a heroic or cowardly act.If lacking life and drama (and humour) in the story-telling, there's no questioning the power of the band's music and the recreation of Curtis's hood-eyed, ""lost control"" whiplash dancing style by Sam Riley is spot on. The acting in support was solid, with an empathetic performance by Samantha Moore as the long-suffering wife and in particular, though relegated to the sidelines, the actors paying the individual Joy Division band members, who as well as looking the part, also convincingly recreate their emotive music.Curtis's story is certainly one worth re-telling given his posthumous elevation to post-punk icon by the music press in the UK in particular. That said, the film didn't exactly move me and never seemed to really get under the skin of its subject, which given the prior knowledge of the inevitable conclusion, lends a slow-motion car-crash perspective to the story's progression.No film about the artist's life here was ever going to be a joyous and uplifting experience, but Corbijn largely treats his subject with sympathy if little real insight. In the end Curtis remains an elusive subject , which may just have been the point of the film in the first place.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"So this is permanence; love-shattered pride. What once was innocence, has turned on its side.","I enjoy musical biopics even when I have no idea who the person is. I am not into the type of rock Ian Curtis sang. he would be better enjoyed by those who are emo fans, as he is credited with being the father of that genre. But I was captivated by listening to the lyrics, especially as I saw his life unfold.He married too young, was not ready to be a father, and really didn't understand love. So, what makes him different from the rest of us besides the fact that he fronted a band for a short time? Really, nothing. He shares the same problems the rest of us have, save one. He developed epilepsy in his early twenties, and had the fear of a worsening disease on top of all his other problems.You could hear it in his music. He knew that he was losing all control over his life and he wanted to take final control. You could feel his pain and know that maybe you were a little lucky with your problems in that you can still have some control, but you also could know that maybe he was a little lucky to have his star shine even for a brief time.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Great musical performances. Fantastic reminiscing. Mediocre film.,"Being a child of the Madchester music scene, viewing Control seemed almost essential. Never did 'get into' Joy Division, but New Order were my introduction to all things Madchester, so the legends & legacy of all things Joy Division/Ian Curtis/Factory Records always have some fascination for me.Dead rock-stars instantly get Legendary status. Ian Curtis is one of them but I actually knew very little about him. Two hours of ""Control"" and you still don't really feel you know him particularly any better, except to say that he seemed incredibly self-centred & immature. Maybe we don't know him better because if the portrayal is accurate he was incredibly withdrawn and insular. He was obviously a 'tortured soul' but if the film is at all an accurate reflection then he doesn't really elicit much sympathy. Most of the torture is self-inflicted. The only thing in his defense was that he was incredibly young with some of the additional pressures of fame - so no surprise that he was a bit stupid & selfish. Real sympathy must go to his wife and fellow band mates. Though the credits reveal that the film is based on the memoirs of his widow so maybe a little jaundiced.The film itself is over-long ... lots of long, arty scenes of Ian smoking! Lots of swearing which maybe accurate [... though reading a review by his daughter reveals that at least one of the characters never swears so profusely in real life!] but still grates. But the outstanding thing has got to be the performances of the band characters - seem to have got all the mannerisms & nuances down to a tee. And the music itself is a treat.Sad to discover that Tony Wilson died just days after the film was completed. What an interesting character Tony was!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Extraordinarily Dull,"If it weren't for the fame of this band, why would anyone be interested in making a film about Ian Curtis? There was little about this film or the subject that had any life to it. Was that the point? To show how utterly dull and lifeless he was off the stage floor? How inward and unable he was to communicate much real feeling to any of his friends or family? I feel sorry for the people in London who have to shell out almost 10 quid to see something like this. And, there was little in Anton Corbijn's cinematography to inspire artistic ooh's and ah's. The jump from photographer to filmmaker is not necessarily a natural one. This is not my idea of an interesting film on any level.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Closer,"Much debate was had at the time as to whether Joy Division's second album ""closer"" was pronounced with a soft s, as in; nearby, or a hard one as in; the end. Of course the latter won through because of the inevitable consequences of Ian Curtis' life.I was a ""fan"" of Joy Division at the time, being of an impressionable age (IC died on the day of my 18th birthday) but I was nowhere near as influenced by them as I was by Hooky and the boys when New Order took over. Indeed Blue Monday is probably my seminal song of all time.So, I didn't go into the movie theatre all agush.If anything, what I might have gushed at would be Anton Corbijn's cinematography, because I was more in awe of him as NME's seemingly resident photographer than I was of Joy Division.However, for the first two acts of this movie Joy Division rose above my love of New Order because this was Joy Division - not a Joy Division tribute band. It was Joy Division because Anton caught them as he did in 1979, albeit a little less grainy. No question.Their music rocked, but more importantly rolled. Joy Division's drumming is often overlooked because Ian Curtis took centre stage so powerfully, but make no mistake, Stephen Morris was an integral part of the Joy Division sound.So, to the film. Anton Corbijn you would hope/expect to cinematograph well, but direct? Oh yes.Oh yes he can direct.He does of course have the talent of Samantha Morton at his beck and call and she has guaranteed a BAFTA for this one. She is brilliant.At the start of the film she is a dippy love-stuck teenager, and believable with it. As the film progresses she deals with the disintegration of her marriage in about as understated and believable way as you could possibly imagine.Now, Sam Riley, as Ian Curtis looks the part. That is well documented. But he also plays the part. It would be so easy to go OTT in this performance, but he controls it (perhaps a clue from the movie title).His performance is quite simply, immaculate.As act three and the real point of the film unfolds we lose Joy Division and we find the Curtis' and the Belgian lover of Curtis in a true love story. It is moving, beautiful, sad and nailed! Totally nailed. And for a movie bio pic to do that one can do no less than award 10 out of 10.Stunning.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
disturbed by why/how/where he committed suicide,"if the movie really shows what led to ian curtis suicide, if that's how it all happened then he was some egoistic asshole, not much more. in my opinion not even worth having a movie made about him. i hope that some important parts were missing or shown wrong or else the story of ian curtis would really just drag me down, wondering how someone could be so self-centered, ignorant and selfish. with all his compassion, sensitivity, talent(?) only circling around himself. entirely wasted, channeled all wrong. to me this movie is just shocking, sad and leaves me completely disturbed and wondering why someone would make a movie about a suicide that doesn't make you sad for one split second. only angry. or was that the purpose? if he was a great singer this makes me everything but interested in his work.",,Anonymous,Music
Not As I Imagined It While Reading Deborah's Book,"Having just finished the book I decided to check out the movie. ( was thoroughly disappointed. I was expecting a grandiose film capturing the emotions of confusion, sadness, and helplessness throughout the second half of the video when things start going downhill for Deborah and Ian's marriage after he encounters Annik, but it felt rushed and slightly comical at times. None of it felt sincere it at all, the movie didn't immerse me into the myth that Tony WIlson and Ian built for the small but impactful time Joy Division was active. Such a shame, I was expecting a movie that truly captures the reason why people love Joy Division so much. Not only that, but they didn't even get the first TV appearance of Joy Division correctly, they played Transmission instead of Shadowplay.Save yourself some money and buy Deborah's book instead, it's the closest you'll ever come to knowing how things actually went down, and with great detail and sadness, as seen from the perspective of the one who understood Ian the most.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Perfect Performances,"I thought this movie was simply wonderful. It was very engaging. The performances were very strong from Sam Riley and Samantha Morton! The rest of the cast shone off each other. Toby Kebbell as Rob Gretton was fun and brought a lot of the humour to the film, a lot of the laughs came from what he said! I thought he was given great lines, very witty.Last year in July I myself was lucky enough to have met both Samantha Morton and Toby Kebbell! I got their autographs and I picture with Samantha Morton! Both actors seemed like very nice people and it was a pleasure to have met them! I was so exited when I finally saw that Control would be released on October 5th. I knew I had to be there on the opening day, and of course I was.I recommend this film to anyone who loves their movies, it was such a good watch.It was amazing. You just have to see it.Rose(Liz Finch)!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"CONTROL (Anton Corbijn, 2007) ***","The haunting music of Joy Division transcended the band's minimal output and modest cult status among British indie bands to become a highly influential sound. Shot in color but desaturized to be shown in black-and- white, CONTROL is a carefully-made biopic of their troubled singer Ian Curtis who, at just 23 years of age, tragically took his own life to become rock's first celebrity suicide. Although I had thought that this fateful decision was taken mainly on account of his debilitating epileptic condition, the film reveals that this had more to do with the fact that Curtis, being clearly unwilling to embark on Joy Division's impending first U.S. tour, had lost control of the band he fronted for (hence the title) and, more importantly, was deeply conflicted about the two relationships he had going on at the same time  with his wife Deborah back home (who had also borne him a daughter) and a Belgian amateur journalist/groupie that followed him around when performing. Based on Mrs. Curtis' memoirs, the film by necessity concentrates more on his personal than creative life; besides, director Corbijn, a former music video helmer, knew the band members personally and creates a remarkably straightforward and affectionate portrayal of Curtis' life and times. Apart from Samantha Morton (as Deborah), the cast is virtually made up of unknowns: at first, Sam Riley did not seem to me to look much like the real Ian Curtis but, before long, he had effectively inhabited the character (down to his awkward moves during Joy Division's stage act); the lovely Alexandra Maria Lara (whom I had actually already watched in DOWNFALL [2004] and YOUTH WITHOUT YOUTH [2007] as Curtis' Belgian girlfriend, Annik Honore') and Toby Kebbell (as the band's overzealous manager Rob Gretton) also score in the acting stakes. Furthermore, the extraneous music is well-chosen: apart from the well-documented fact of Curtis having watched Werner Herzog's STROSZEK (1977) and listened to Iggy Pop's ""The Idiot"" (1977) just before hanging himself, we also have The Velvet Underground (another band whose musical legacy ran a similar course to Joy Division's), David Bowie (ironically, Curtis is seen listening to the chameleon artist's own crossover album ""Aladdin Sane"" [1973], written during his first U.S. tour!), Roxy Music and The Sex Pistols.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
What Ian Curtis was all about,"There are two things a successful rockstar biography movie needs: 1) A well balanced mix of music and story telling and 2) an actor who can do the real musician justice. ""Control"" has both. Even though Anton Corbijn has said in advance that people looking for a movie about music would be disappointed by his film about Ian Curtis, I think he exaggerated a bit. Almost all of Joy Division's greatest songs can be heard here. The band plays them live in front of an audience, in TV studios or in a recording booth. By ""the band"" I mean the actors, and that brings us straight to Nr. 2. Like ""Ray"" and ""The Doors"", ""Control"" is another one of those movies where you wouldn't believe that the leading actor is actually doing all the vocals himself. Sam Riley doesn't only look like Curtis, he also sounds exactly like him. And he's a great actor. Had someone else played the part, Curtis might easily have come of as a self-pitying wimp (which he was to a certain degree), but Riley showed us the inner struggle of that man and made us understand why he eventually committed suicide. Samantha Morton must be mentioned, too. She plays the heartbreakingly betrayed wife of Curtis who would later write the book that this movie is based on.What makes ""Control"" special, though, is that director Anton Corbijn actually knew Ian Curtis personally and it shows. What we see isn't the story of a rock star, but of a person torn between what his heart and his head tell him. Corbijn has spent almost three decades making music videos and photographing bands. His work has influenced the aesthetics of rock music as much as the ones of advertising. Although that alone didn't mean he could make a good movie, Corbijn proved that he can. ""Control"" is a well-balanced, beautifully shot movie with contained direction. The look fits the mood perfectly and there was really no one else who could have done the story of Ian Curtis and Joy Division justice as much as Corbijn did.One thing another reviewer mentioned rings true though: had Curtis not been a famous musician, his life wouldn't have been very interesting. He was just a regular guy. Real regular. At least the movie makes him out to be, since none of the depths that might have been within Curtis besides the epilepsy and his love affairs are explored. That's the one beef I have with ""Control"".",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't let me get me,"I recommend ""Control"" as partial detox for ""Lost"" addicts. Everybody looks and talks exactly like Charlie. Gosh, I can't wait for season 4. My second favorite thing about this movie is Sam Riley's on-stage dancing. Staying more or less in one place, he flails his fists about pretty wildly, like he's extremely mad at someone, probably himself. There's more Adam Green than Joe Cocker in the way he moves, but also more aggression than playfulness. Like he's trying to beat himself up. Did Ian Curtis really dance like that? Fine performances by Samantha Morton and Toby Kebbell. Alexandra Maria Lara, in the part of Curtis' Belgian girlfriend, is almost as bad as English plumbing. Don't get me wrong. The skinny jeans and the trench and the bangs all look good on her. I just wish she would keep her mouth shut. And didn't smile so much. Half the time, it's the affected coquetry that ruins her performance. The rest of the time, it's her sheepish smile which she, obviously, has no way of controlling. It seems you rarely get good looks and good acting in the the same person. Yeah, I know, like that needed proving.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A Must-See,"Sam Riley gives a great haunting performance, singing songs by Joy Division a lot like Ian Curtis himself. The story of Ian Curtis is told in an absorbing and realistic way, making you understand what this great singer and poet went through to commit suicide at 23.Ian Curtis' wife, Deborah Curtis (played by Samantha Morton), is one of the producers of the film, which is based on her book. Taking that in mind, it is strange that her portrait is very sad, unfavorable and a lot less attractive than what the real Deborah Crtis looked back in the 80s judging by pictures. Conversely Ian Curtis' lover, Annik Honoré, is portrayed by German actress Alexandra Maria Lara in a beautiful and dreamy way, making this character much more attractive that she actually was, again judging by pictures.Another one of the producers of the film was Tony Wilson. Unfortunately, he passed away a few months before the release of the film. He had cancer but ironically died from heart attack.""Control"" shows some really beautiful images of lonely estranged industrial Macclesfield in the 80's, accompanied by the great songs of Joy Division. This gives enough space and room for thought.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the few Films of Anton Corbjin the great,"Even though I always knew how the story ends, and I like Joy Division, I have to say that I don't see any point in shooting the entire movie in black and white, or showing people having sex.Despite all my objections, Control is one of the few films directed by the great Anton Corbijn; Depeche Mode's music video director, photographer, graphic designer, and artist; (almost a member of the band), he is also competent as a movie director.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great Soundtrack, Boring Movie","Ian Curtis made some excellent music with Joy Division but the story of his life doesn't really make for an entertaining or exciting film. Joy Division fans and most music fans will know Ian wrote emotional and dark lyrics, had a unique dance style, had epilepsy, cheated on his wife and hung himself this movie portrays all this but is very boring and doesn't really do much else. If you want to see and hear his music on film or check out the dance moves just type in Joy Division on Youtube. The black and white did suit this movie and the acting and soundtrack was superb (it'd be pretty damn hard to make a film about joy division and have a bad soundtrack anyway)but the story is just so uninteresting. The film about factory records 24 Hour Party People is much better. Even though Joy Division make up a small part of the film and the actor doesn't really look like Ian as a movie it is a lot more entertaining and interesting.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Striking,"This was easily the best biopic I have seen in a long, long time. Anton Corbijn has been one of my favourite photographers for a long time, but I had no idea that he had this kind of cinematic beauty in him as well. There are images here that are simply striking, and incredibly memorable, (such as the long shot of Ian's back with his newly-made ""HATE"" jacket); things that I am not likely to forget anytime soon. In addition to Corbijn's camera work, the acting talent here is top notch. Riley plays a convincing Ian Curtis and gets everything about the man--including his spastic march-on-the-spot stage movements--down almost to eerie perfection. Fans looking for a touching ode to Ian Curtis may want to steer clear, as its brutally frank and honest depiction of him may leave some feeling as though he was placed in a negative light, but fans looking for an earnest portrayal of one of the 20th century's most tragic pop music figures should find plenty to hold their interest.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Haunting Cinema,"The tragic life of Joy Division's Ian Curtis comes to life in the bleak black and white 'Control'. Anton Corbijn's debut film places a microscope over the singer's short life, and it's a perceptive and significant entry to the biopic cannon. Bolstered by a fantastic and even haunting performance from Sam Riley, 'Control' is a difficult but admirable effort to shed light on one man's mysterious life.There's a quality to 'Control' that almost forces its viewer to watch from a distance, and I feel this was an intentional choice. Ian Curtis, by today's standards, would be labeled as one of those introspective emo boys. There seems to be a fiery passion underneath, but he's almost shut off to the rest of the world. Riley's tremendous performance at times comes off as frighteningly realistic, but through all his personal torment, he comes off as a distant and detached person who's difficult to read.One may almost feel empathy for Curtis' situation in life. He is at once being pulled between two very different worlds. Life with his wife and daughter or a promising band on the brink of international stardom. The script, co-written by Ian's real-life wife Deborah Curtis, portrays the singer as an increasingly unhappy man. Trapped in a life he can't seem to escape either which way, a life he has no control over. His own selfishness and health complications hurt those who loved him most, and Samantha Morton's performance as Deborah is a painful and heartbreaking thing to watch.Photographed in black and white, the absence of color seems fitting. 'Control' doesn't intend to explain or rationalize Ian's decisions in life, it is what it is. His eventual suicide at 23 is one that leaves us with a pang of emptiness but not surprise. 'Control' is a tragic story, and a profoundly difficult piece of work. It doesn't look for the light at the end of the tunnel, it's a picture that comes to a screeching halt as the life of another ends. There are no Hollywood fix-ups, no glamor.It is such a realness that makes 'Control' difficult to judge. One knows after watching that they have witnessed something very special, no matter how brutal it may have been. Art isn't always beautiful, 'Control' certainly isn't. But it is art.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A little too controlled,"There's no doubt that a dead singer will do wonders for a band's reputation. Just take Joy Division. Yes, they produced some excellent music, but quite a bit of it was incredibly mediocre. But because their lead singer killed himself they've obtained a glamour and an allure that they never would have possessed had they continued to make music under that banner.And part of the reason why Joy Division are so well regarded is because people can claim Ian Curtis as an example of the tortured artist. He's a man who suffered so much in life that death was the only answer. But that would be an incredibly shallow way of looking at things. Curtis was certainly a talented artist, but he wasn't peerless. And for all of people's romantic notions about Curtis, his suicide could have a rather simple explanation  maybe he had a negative reaction to the medication he took for his epilepsy.And I think that would make his story more tragic. To have someone's life and career wasted because of something as banal as a chronic condition or a combination of pills is a lot sadder than someone taking their life because they were selfish and self-absorbed. Because that's what Curtis is. He's a man who marries his childhood sweetheart, who fronts a successful band and who later has an affair with an attractive Belgian artist. If he wanted to grab it, he could have everything. But instead he wallows in self-pity. He feels like his band is getting too big. He loves his wife but she stifles him. And he loves his girlfriend but she's too adoring. Therefore it's kind of hard to feel sorry for this man. But despite his cruelty, there's still a part of you that feels for him. Life is never as simple as 'you should be happy with what you've got' and people's feelings are often beyond their control. And with Curtis this is made worse when he has to suffer from seizures and the side-effects of his medication. He's a bastard, but deep down you feel there's a decent guy struggling to get out.The end of the film suggests that it was Curtis' epilepsy that pushed him over the edge. We see him have a seizure and then he wakes up and kills himself, apparently unable to deal with his condition. But of course we'll never know what exactly happened that day. And we also never really know what Curtis is thinking. But this isn't a fault of the film. It's mainly to do with the man. For all his songs and all his writing, you get the feeling that nobody is ever really able to penetrate the surface.But although you can't fault the film for not providing more answers, it can certainly be faulted for being too timid. The film doesn't tell us that Curtis briefly flirted with fascism, that he took his first overdose at 15, that he dictated to his wife what she could and couldn't wear and that he threw wine over her when she danced with another man at their engagement party. It's a watered down version of Ian Curtis.The film can also be faulted for never really capturing the excitement of the band's performances. The film is beautifully shot, but the musical sequences never really take flight. And this can't be attributed to the actors, who do a great job. Instead it's a fault of the direction. It's too static.But while the filming style doesn't benefit the musical sequences, it works for the rest of the film. It makes you feel like you're looking at images in a magazine. You're part of this world and part of this story, but you're removed from it too. It's real but it's unreal as well. After all, Macclesfield only looks this beautiful on film. And that's the way we want it. We don't really want reality to conflict with the images in our head  we want some part of the myth to remain; that our heroes come from a different world, a world we can see but that we can't really touch.My favourite image in the film is the one at the end. We see smoke rising out of a chimney in a graveyard  Curtis is being cremated. He's being liberated from the life he felt he couldn't deal with. And although it maybe romanticises his death too much, it finally provides a level of emotion that was lacking elsewhere in the film. The man who existed in real life wasn't a particularly nice person, a man who sometimes treated his wife abysmally, but he was also a man occasionally capable of scaling heights of creativity. And it's that talent that you end up mourning more than the man.However, although the subject matter would suggest that the film makes for grim viewing, it's also quite funny in places. In particular I like the scene where the Crispy Ambulance frontman has to replace Curtis and face the wrath of the crowd. And that reminds me of how much I like the band's manager, Rob Gretton. When he introduces himself to the band he plays it big. But then in the next scene we see him in his underwear, answering a payphone by saying, 'Rob's Records'. It's a nice way of showing how ramshackle the whole scene was. And of course you have Tony Wilson signing his contract with Joy Division in blood. But although all of this is great, it did remind me of how much better 24 Hour Party People is. Yes they're different stories, but Winterbottom's film, even in the brief amount of time Curtis gets in that movie, manages to scale higher levels of emotion and invention. I just think Control, as good as it is, is a little too conservative, something Curtis wasn't...even if he briefly was a Tory voter.",,Anonymous,Music
"Less joy, more division","There are so many movies out there - you can't watch them all. Literally can't - there is not enough time. And yet you sometimes wonder how you could have missed something - something as depressingly beautiful as this right here that is.It begins innocently enough and especially because I had forgotten this was about Joy Division, I thought the control part was more about substance abuse. But what good artist/musician hasn't done some? There probably are a lot ... at least some, right? Anyway that is not so much what the movie is about.It is about Joy and Love. And the ability to control certain things. But if you are unable to control your own emotions, how are you going to be able to control somebody elses? Throw in the epilepsy (I am not too familiar with the private life of anyone in Joy Division, let alone the main singer) and you have another factor that is out of control (no pun intended).A very interesting look behind the scenes, that even though we know what happens in the end ... well it still hits quite hard when it actually happens ...",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice,"Very enjoyable movie if you´re a Joy Division fan like me, it shows some interesting details about the band and some scenes just give you a good sensation.Now, talking about cinematographic value, I think this film doesn´t stand out among other rock and roll biographic films. I feel like the director could have known better where to cut or to keep filming a scene. The sentimental scenes could have been a little bit more powerful, and generally, the film had the potential to be more than it is. All things we see are superficial and I would have loved to see a more deep perspective about Ian mental problems, but it´s not bad as it is and I enjoyed it while watching it",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Liked it...,"Shot entirely in black and white I found this film very atmospheric and it also had a gritty realism about it. I thought all the performances were excellent with both Sam Riley and Samantha Morton taking top honours. I also have to give a mention to Toby Kebbell who totally stole a couple of scenes with some great over-the-top one-liners. The story is primarily told from Debbie's point of view and as such we get a very interesting look at the life of this enigmatic soul. This film inspired me to go out and buy a Joy Division greatest hits CD and it's music that's always been close to my heart. I should mention that all the live performances portrayed in the film were performed by the actors and so hat's off to them for making it real. Whether you were a fan of the band or not I'm sure you'll get something out of this one.

Ian Curtis and Joy Division...,"""Control"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the life of Ian Curtis and his path to become the singer of Joy Division. We also follow him through his personal and professional problems that changed the lives of many people.I have to admit that I was not sure what to expect from this movie and I was really surprised by it. I liked this movie because it is based on the life of Ian Curtis, the plot was very interesting and the music was simply beautiful. The direction which was made by Anton Corbijn was very good and I believe that he did an amazing job. Regarding the interpretations, I have to say that both the interpretations of Sam Riley who played as Ian Curtis and Samantha Morton who played as Debbie Curtis were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Alexandra Maria Lara's who played as Annik Honore and Craig Parkinson's who played as Tony Wilson. Lastly, I have to say that ""Control"" is a nice movie to watch and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that everybody has something to gain by watching it.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent!,"Astonishingly well acted film, so much so that it seems unfair to single out any of the performances. Mr. Lawrence's camera sense is as sure and unobtrusive as his feel for acting. The movie just seems to happen, to grow out of the ground like a thorny plant, revealing the intricate intelligence of its design only in hindsight. As a JD fan, I thought it was done in a way that even non-JD fans could enjoy it. All of the actors playing the JD band members actually played their instruments and performed those songs... it wasn't just Reilly overdubbing vocals over original JD recordings! That is something that really impresses me about the skills of the actors chosen for the band. True, Curtis was a genius, but he was also human... I felt this film was grounded in reality without trying to evangelize/make a martyr out of Curtis.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Way too much control,"The movie is well written. I can see why some reviewers have questioned the B&W format. Maybe artistic. Maybe pretentious. Sometimes a little slow moving and static. The emotional trauma suffered by Ian Curtis that ultimately led to his suicide is not expressed very effectively. In the film his character is occasionally a bit tearful. But utter brutal depression and graphic hopelessness is what I believe should have been depicted towards the end. His desperate emotional decline just wasn't communicated. The film could have benefited from greater expression of feeling. Just a little too much control here, in my view.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"A dull, clichéd movie","Let me start out by stating that I am a fan of Joy Division.

Strangely enough I usually avoid watching films solely because they concern themselves with interesting true life stories, this is because they are usually badly done. The director feels as if s/he needs to tell the story in a particular way with particular motifs. They are usually badly paced as a result of trying to stitch together a real story whilst having to artificially give prominence to certain events, which the fans expect to see not just included but emphasised. And they generally lack inspiration as works of art in themselves, far too often feeding off the legend that surrounds the subject matter rather than actually adding anything new in terms of creativity or insight. This film is guilty of all these things and will only further entrench my reluctance to watch films about interesting true life stories in future.How does this film get it wrong? Well first of all Corbijn comes across as uncreative and uninteresting as a directorial presence. His pacing is poor, there are far too many uninteresting, drawn-out scenes, particularly the one with Ian and Annik alone, which should never have made the final cut, it was so dull I thought I might go into a trance. He also fails to provide the right pacing for us to understand why Ian goes from being a bit insular but basically a pretty balanced and ambitious guy to a confused, ill, depressed, whining, self-destructive maudlin presence. It's almost as if he has a personality transplant halfway through the film, and is just one example of where this film is actually jarring. Let me also mention the cinematography. I'm not one of those people who has a problem with black and white films in any way shape or form. Films like Europa, Manhattan and Raging Bull are wonderful examples of black and white cinematography used to fascinating effect. But this film is an example of when black and white photography is a completely redundant and, yes I'm going to say it, pretentious exercise. It added nothing to the film at all, no mood, no aesthetic quality, nothing. In fact it serves to disengage the viewer from the time period which is early 70s through to 1980. You know how ridiculous the decision is when Ian's watching Stroszek, a film released in 1976 and filmed in colour, in black and white, it just adds a layer of confusion that shouldn't be in the film, we should be connecting not unnecessarily visually disconnected from the story.I could talk about the lack of character development the mediocre acting from Sam Riley, the complete and utter lack of insight that we get into Ian Curtis' character, Joy Division the band and even the Manchester music scene of the 70s but I'd be here for a long while. In short there is very little that is interesting or of value in this film, a documentary on Ian Curtis and Joy Division on youtube would serve as a much better investment of your time.3/10",3.0,Anonymous,Music

"Black, Bleek, Beautiful: A compelling insight into depression!","This film is simply brilliant. It explains a lot to the viewer of the isolation and confusion of depression which is an issue not talked about in society today. Whether you are a joy division fan or not this film is a must see because of the heart rendering story of a lost soul called Ian Curtis. There is so much to say about this film that the only way to really understand is to see it!It has to said that Sam Riley's Performance as Ian Curtis was breath- taking! It was like watching Ian Curtis on stage, and as well he done the singing which was just like listening to him.. so credit where it's due! Samantha Morton who played Ian's wife (Deborah Curtis) was fantastic, she acted really well and gave a real sentiment to the film.The direction was very good, using the lighting of black and white to create an ultra depressive feel to the movie which was very relevant and gave a real substance to the movie!It's a film that can't be forgotten because of its content and powerful acting. Something special that captures the situation perfectly, and truly is a compelling insight into depression and how it effects a person and people around them.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"I normally don't like biopics about people who committed suicide, but this really struck me","Being a Joy Division fan, I wasn't crazy about seeing a film about someone whose talent I'm a huge fan of committing suicide. I was intrigued, however, by the director Anton Corbijn who was the man responsible for many of the photographs that we've seen on the band on stage. This is his directorial debut, unless you count his music videos, and I'm always interested to see the films of first-time directors.I wasn't expecting the film to really tell me much about Ian Curtis or Joy Division, which is fine. All I really wanted was the film to tell a story. I didn't want to watch anything like WALK THE LINE, which, despite being a well made film, is just a plot less tribute piece that nobody can really enjoy unless they're a Johnny Cash fan. That was the main thing I was afraid of when sitting down to watch CONTROL. Needless to say, I was not disappointed in the least.There isn't really much to say about the film in terms of what it's about. It pretty much details Ian Curtis's life and the rise of the Joy Division band from the perspective of Ian Curtis before depicting his complete disintegration and destruction all the way up to his suicide. To keep things interesting are the many people in his life which is what develops the plot.Samantha Morton, in particular, is the main driving force in the life of the film as well as the voice of reason and she is the sole witness to all the pain and horror that constantly overshadows the film. His band members are also depicted much the same way, though without as much of the witnesses. They understand that he's in much pain but due to Ian Curtis's attitude they don't allow it to affect their lives as much which is what leads the band to a sort of semi-downfall, though they would later pick up and become New Order.The thing is, the film is as much an art-film as it is a biopic. There is much attention granted to the visuals and the editing that gives the film a rather haunting and dreamlike quality, yet at the same time it lends the film a kind of gritty and uncommon sense of dread and sadness that makes the film feel a lot more personal and intimate than you would expect.It's terrifying to watch at times knowing that it's based on a true story, but that was the aim of the film obviously. What struck me more about the film was how it didn't sugarcoat the cons of being part of that kind of lifestyle. I think because of this the film allows more humanity to shine, which is ultimately very much needed in this story. The film comes off truly beautifully because of this.I think what a lot of people dislike about this film are the more artistic moments in which the film just lets things unfold naturally. There are a lot of really long takes and close-ups of many meditative moments. This doesn't make the film boring in the slightest because the tone of the film is so fascinating. The film is extremely slow-paced, but it helps to allow the viewer to digest the atmosphere of the time period so that you can really get into the story.I think the other thing that a lot of people dislike about the film is the way that Ian Curtis and the band is depicted. It's not a very positive depiction, but I wouldn't call it negative either. Just, very human. I think people need to remember that this isn't a documentary, it's an artistic reinterpretation. It doesn't have to go by the facts because if it did there wouldn't be as much to appreciate in terms of human interaction. In addition, the film already is intimate enough.This isn't a film for everyone. It's extremely depressing and gut-wrenching at times. It's a very bleak film and it really doesn't make you feel good about life. It's a very quiet and simple film and I understand that a lot of people want there to be a lot of depth with this kind of story when there really isn't any depth to it. Ian Curtis had some serious problems and when he couldn't take it anymore he committed suicide.The film is unflinching and ultimately one of the most powerful biopics I've seen. So what if it doesn't have a good detailing of all the events of the time period like Michael Winterbottom's 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE? Even though I like 24 HOUR PARTY PEOPLE more than CONTROL, though I still love CONTROL. CONTROL is a powerful and very moving piece of film-making and I, for one, and very happy that I saw it.",,Anonymous,Music
Not my cup of tea,"When you are a photographer of popstars with the ambition of becoming (also) a director of films, what would be more logical than choosing a biopic of a popstar as the subject of your first movie? This choice became even more logical because in the years before the biopic had become a quite successful genre. Think of ""Ray"" (2004, Taylor Hackford, abou Ray Charles), ""Walk the line"" (2005, James Mangold, about Johnny Cash) and ""I'm not there"" (2007, Todd Haynes, about Bob Dylan).Despite all this, ""Control"" about the band Joy Division and its lead singer Ian Curtis didn't get a grip on me during a single moment. This can mean one of two things (or both). In the first place it is possible that the story of Joy Division and Ian Curtis wasn't very interesting to me. Another option is that Anton Corbijn had not yet mastered all the tricks of the director's trade during his first film.Beginning with the first possible explanation I must say that Ian Curtis was not the tragic figure I thought he would be. Most of his problems are self made, even to such a large degree that in the end it started to irritate me.In his directorial career since ""Control"" Anton Corbijn did not realy manage to move away from the pop scene. On the controry, most of his feature length films since then are live registrations of Depeche Mode.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Brilliant,Not Knowing much about the life of Ian Curtis I approached this one with no expectations and it blew my mind. The utter tragedy of his life set in dreary black and white 70's England is captured to perfection in what is an awe inspiring piece of modern cinema. The Characters are played perfectly and you cannot help feel sorry for nearly all of them. What was really rammed home to me was how much the cocktail of drugs he was prescribed for epilepsy affected his state of mind. Also the band and record label never took his illness seriously and saw it as a hindrance to them. The way the film intertwines the songs he wrote with his life experiences makes it all the poignant to watch. Not uplifting but i guarantee you in the final frame where you here Mrs Curtis's plea Somebody help me after finding his body you'll want to reach in to the TV and do just that.

Control or lack there of... you decide,"I was not privy to Ian Curtis or joy division prior to watching this movie, but I am now.
The start of the movie was a yawn, but I was more intrigued as it went on. The Dim lit, slow, minimal angle style worked for this, and becoming a fan of their music since, realise now worked perfectly. We don't need no Hollywood-esque, big ticket box office smashes to depict a musicians life, we much appreciate filming it how it is, or perhaps was.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
absorbing portrait of a talented but torn individual,"Before Morrissey and The Smiths, there was Ian Curtis and Joy Division. Their music was already retro by the time I was old enough to buy my own records; I had a vague awareness of Love Will Tear Us Apart as a decent track by a band I wasn't particularly enamored with. Although scenes of Joy Division performing and recording are copious in this film, the good news is you don't have to be a fan of the music to appreciate this assured debut from photographer Corbijn.Fine acting and subtle helming make this an above-par cinema experience. Samantha Morton is spell-binding, utterly convincing as a teenage schoolgirl fumbling her way through relationships with sulky, spotty boys. A 30-year old seasoned actress giving such an utterly convincing portrayal of pubescent naiveté and guile is quite a triumph. Sam Riley encapsulates the ill-fated Curtis. The problem with biopics is we often bring our own knowledge and intimacy with the subject to the performance, daring the actor to try and push that aside. In recent years, we have seen some take up that challenge magnificently (e.g. Ali, Capote, Ray, The Queen), while other have fallen short (Goodbye Bifana). I came to Control unencumbered by any emotional attachment to, or photographic memories of, Ian Curtis, but I believed in this portrayal of a talented, poetic, troubled, conscientious lead singer of a 70s band. I do have visceral memories of 1970s Britain that the film evoked wonderfully. Ford Cortinas, flares, record players, boys in make up... Corbijn fills the frame with stark geometric lines (most obviously in exterior shots of council house high rises), conjuring up the bleakness and isolation of the times. Jim Callaghan and the Winter of Discontent are never mentioned, but they permeate every shot. There is a deft economy in dialogue; marriage is mentioned, and then happens, Ian talks about joining a band, and then sings at their gig. Given Corbijn's CV you would expect competent framing; that he is able to handle shot flow so well proves he is as good a director as he is photographer.Joy Division and Ian Curtis are iconic figures in 70s and 80s Britain, pioneers in the Manchester sound and an indispensable part of the soundtrack that defines those times. The film pays off as a thumbnail portrait of one aspect of Britain's recent cultural history. More importantly, it succeeds as cinema, offering a nuanced tale of one man's demise that will resonate with audiences non-cognisant with the UKs musical heritage.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

"Great acting, well shot but dull","Being a fan of Joy Division I was really looking forward to seeing this movie. I did not get to see it on the big screen, as I had hoped. Maybe I was expecting too much based on all the great reviews but I was disappointed by this movie. It had great acting and it was well shot but the pace was just too slow for me. In particular the scenes involving Riley and Lara really dragged. Shooting it in black and white was a great idea. I also did not have a lot history of his life, so the movie did answer lots of questions for me. I was surprised to see he was a civil servant. If only there was a better script this movie would be a classic for me. But maybe on a second watching I will see more.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"A powerful study of a disturbed, creative genius. Really worth watching.","This was a truly outstanding film. Granted I am a huge fan of this genre, period, and feel that some the music that came out of the UK in the 1970's and 1980's was hugely influential, important, and absolutely timeless. Of course, there is no arguing the influence Joy Division had, and their subsequent follow up act, New Order. Curtis was able to evoke such emotion, such power, more than likely due to his state of mind, and the chaotic emotional state he had to endure.Shot in gorgeous, classic black and white, the Ian Curtis biopic doesn't seem to care if you like Joy Division, the influential post-punk band Curtis fronted. It simply presents a taut, emotionally wrenching narrative. And I never really got the post punk genre title. Is that the best they could do? How about pre-electronica? Or crazy inventive. Or mind numbingly stupendous?Joy Division released only two proper albums in its short history, but the group disproportionately influenced the music that followed. Fans will enjoy the re-creations of seminal shows and recording sessions, staged with authority by director Anton Corbijn, who photographed the band and its peers in the '70s and '80s.But even non-fans will appreciate the cinematography and note-perfect performances, which seem to evoke a certain dread of 1970s working-class England. We see young Curtis, played with appropriate understatement by Sam Riley, worshiping David Bowie, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed in his bedroom in Macclesfield, England, in 1973. He tries on makeup, smokes endless cigarettes and carefully organizes his darkly poetic writing into binders. Who knew what an extraordinary songwriter he was to become?Riley's performance immediately sets the tone, his giant, uncertain eyes rejecting our sympathy and attempts to reduce him to an archetype. He marries his high school crush, Deborah (Samantha Morton), at age 19 as his band (first called Warsaw) slowly ascends.Curtis' inner life, rendered through rich, stifling close-ups, is wracked with guilt and self-doubt, whether it's for cheating on his wife with the beautiful French gal Annik Honoré (Alexandra Maria Lara) or dealing with his worsening epilepsy and obsession with mortality. He is obviously in a lot more pain that we know, and does a reasonably good job of showing it.The film is a quiet study. It is ponderous at times. But, in the end, it is a strong, self assured film, that really hits the mark.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Unremittingly Bleak Biopic,"As an offering for the converted ,this is a fine piece of work, beautifully filmed by Director, and devotee Anton Corbijn. As a stand alone offering it is fatally flawed.Ian Curtis is not a great artist or singer.Joy Division were not a great band.They did not have a great song list, had one popular hit, and a minor repertoire of cult classics. Nor were they a great live band.As the years have progressed their ""legendary"" status has grown, but time has not been kind to them. The films ""raison d'etre"", therefore, starts shakily.Despite these reservations the film did have a chance.Pop stars who die young always have a fascination for what ""might have been"",and Curtis's story does have the potential for an Everyman tale, but it does not succeed.New Order, the phoenix incarnation of Joy Division were far more successful artistically, critically and popular after Curtis's death.There has been little posthumous positive re evaluation of the Curtis period. It was raw, the ingredients were there for a successful band, and they subsequently made it big. And that is about it.So this is no ""Doors"" or ""Thin Lizzy"" tale.Instead, it is a bit boring and unremarkable.Sam Riley provides a convincing performance as Curtis, the black and white photography is atmospheric and strangely lush, the contemporary soundtrack and Joy Division music authentic.Yet it is a soul less film. Written by his widow Deborah, we never really understand what is inspiring this tortured being. Sadly, suicidal individuals rarely bare their soul to the world, and I suspect that Deborah simply doesn't know. Inevitably her treatment of Ian's Mistress, Annik, is circumspect.Visually attractive (played by Alexandra Maria Lara)her characterisation is wafer thin, offering little insight into the attraction, or relationship.Joy Division and Curtis mythology centre around the ""tortured young man"" image of the lead singer. This is faithfully represented. Yet young men in bands invariably enjoy themselves too, any ""joie de vivre"" is notably absent robbing the script of light and shade.In order to emotionally feel the lows, you need to have been lifted a bit as well. Here we start low, and get lower.Corbijn is superb at capturing a verite sense of moment and time.Deborah Curtis offers a convincing sense of narrative.But ultimately the subject material is not strong enough to carry a 117 minute running time for the casual or uninformed observer.As an homage for the die hard fan it will no doubt be essential.For the rest, it proves to be inconsequential.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Collapse of a talented musician is happening before our eyes.,"Film has been waiting for so long for me to watch it. Finally the time has come. And you can't call this time was wasted. Control tells the story of seven years from life of Ian Curtis, Joy Division's vocalist. Film was directed by the photographer of the band, Anton Corbijn and the script is based on a book of Deborah Curtis (Ian's wife) - Touching From The Distance.We need to start from this, that black and white vision was a really hit idea. Colours would only disturb in giving back the climate. Film starts from appearing the Ian's adolescent experiences. Thank to this observation, a spectator can get to know him and the environment he's living in very well. We meet his family and his mates (inter alia, future co-members of the band). Then, we melt more and more into the life of the main character, which makes us his friend, someone who knows him best. Bitter, stretched in time collapse of a talented musician is happening before our eyes.We're witnesses of a range of emotions which Curtis is living, just in the first minutes of the film. Historical events (the band arise) are made with us, we participate in Joy Division's concerts and intimate moments of the character when he's alone with his own thoughts. All Curtis' feelings and reactions affect us. We experience and survive with him. As spectators, we're sucked inside. We're not only the watchers but we upgrade to the rank of co-heroes of the action. The fact that music isn't only a background but also a story, help us with it. Songs are perfectly fitted in plot and every frame is deeply emotional.Watcher which doesn't get the context and is not familiar with the band's music, simply shouldn't watch it. He has to be soaked (at least a little) with the conception and post-punk seventies. Film is worth something more than being watched by ignoramus who just won't understand it.Every frame seems to emanate depressiveness and this specific climate which I'm associating with Joy Division's music. I have no idea how come film creator made it but I'm enormously grateful to him for this. I enjoyed the band's work long before watching the film but after this (or even during this) I fell in love with it even more. It was awesome to hum songs during the seance and to meet the owner of this wonderful voice better. I don't know about you but I don't need more to admit that Control became, indisputably, the next one of my favorite films.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Torn apart by love and epilepsy,"A story about a tormented young singer committing suicide on the verge of stardom is bound to have a certain appeal. However, the risks of falling into melodramatic or morbid are high. Corbijn avoids both, directing this minor masterpiece with restrain and respect for all those involved.I loved the B&W photography. It recreates the atmosphere of those years, which seem long gone, the bleak but bubbling music scene, and the excitement about the new wave just about to explode. Youth having everything and not realizing how fragile life is.Ian Curtis was a particularly fragile creature, both because of his epilepsy and his problem with communication. A confused boy without guidance, who wrote some of the most depressing lyrics ever, he still has a huge following. Maybe because his anguish is universally understood.I am not a Joy Division fan, nor was I particularly shocked by Ian Curtis early departure. However, this movie is so well made that made listen again to their music. After more than 25 years their songs sound even more claustrophobic and depressing and I wonder how Curtis would have developed as a singer.Had he lived, I doubt he could have transitioned easily into the light-hearted pop atmosphere of the late 80's. By checking out so early he became unforgettable. Even more so, with this sober but poignant movie celebrating his short time on earth.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Cruel, difficult and somehow alone despite being constantly surrounded by band members as well as Debbie and Annike, Riley's Curtis cuts an enigmatic figure who you cannot take your eyes off.Over its 122 minutes, Control sets up the final scene with aplomb.

It felt 45 minutes too long, which would have made a very short film indeed, so clearly, more needed to be happening on screen.

Raw and highly personal journey through stardom and depression...,"A raw, intense film about the life of Ian Curtis (lead singer of Joy Division). While I have, of course, listened to Joy Division, I never really knew the story behind the band or the suicide of their lead singer, so I didn't know any back story at ...(read more)all which made everything in this film quite new to me.That said, I found this film very moving and quite personal and real. The situations Ian found himself in are so true to life, and it really is a shame he had to die so young and have such a confusing and depressing love life. But at the same time, his creative genius helped drive Joy Division to the brink of stardom (which it earned shortly before his death, and gained even more so afterwords), and it also helped to inspire a musical trend in several other artists.I think a lot of people are looking to this movie as a story of the music of Ian and Joy Division, but anyone who has watched this can see that is entirely not the point. This film is about Ian's life, music just happened to be a large part of it. So although it does focus briefly on segments of their performances and songs (which, by the way, Sam Riley did a fantastic job of replicating), most of the movie deals with his relationships, his depression and his epilepsy.I am glad they chose to film this in black and white, I think it added a lot to the character of the film and also made for some spectacular shots.

""Closer"" was Joy Division's Magnum Opus yet only one track ""Isolation"" was played in the film (Although they had small bits of some of the lyrics a couple times). Most of the songs on Closer are extremely dark / somber and I kept expecting them to come into play around the last 1/3 of the film, when Ian was starting to feel despondent / depressed about his situation. I was disappointed that the producers didn't seem to deem them worthy of inclusion... The songs ""Passover"", ""A Means to an End"", ""Heart and Soul"", ""Twenty Four Hours"", ""The Eternal"" and ""Decades"" were all left high and dry which was an ""Atrocity Exhibition"" in my opinion. All of these songs were the obvious choices for tracks to play during Ian's suicidal descent in the latter part of the film. I don't think the producers of this film were big Joy Division fans or they would have known the the perfect songs for the ending of the film were the songs Ian and Company were writing / recording at the time the events portrayed in the film were happening.

Better to Burn Out Than To Fade Away (?),"This is one of my favorite films of all time about one of my favorite bands of all time. I heard about Joy Division randomly, through the inter-webs when I was a few years younger, and when I found out Control was in the film festival circuits, I got pumped and anxiously awaited. Awaiting anything tends to raise expectations, and I tend to disappoint easily. This movie did not do that in the remotest, to my utter surprise. This movie is beautifully shot (black and white being an amazing choice for such a bleak story set in a bleak town/time) and amazingly acted/written/scored. The band really plays well together on screen, and Riley kills it as Curtis - especially with the dancing. It was very haunting to watch, having seen docs on Ian and comparing them in my mind. He probably deserved a little more recognition than he received. Just like this film.This is one of the best and (sadly) most realistic biopics ever made. It is extremely depressing, but I believe that is because Ian had the knowledge that few of us gain at such a young age (I can especially relate as I am 23 at present) that the pursuit of more, usually only leads to more sadness.On the brink of super-stardom, he realized that celebrity is just another invention of distraction - a method of control, and Ian was certainly someone who had enough control in his life.I think there are plenty of ways of handling depression better than Ian does, but who am I, or anyone really, to judge how he lived his life? The sad truth is, his pain comes out in his 2 albums of art so beautifully that the music doesn't even seem sad at first listen, but a quick glance at his lyrics will show you, few artists in the spotlight have ever been in more pain. RIP Ian - and major props to Anton Corbijn, a true photographer (how else could his shots be so deliberately composed?), filmmaker and Joy Division fan.According to IMDb, he mortgaged his house to pay for Control - so thank you to Mr. Corbijn for having courage in your art!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

As someone who has lived in Manchester and worked with up & coming bands, the weight of Ian's legacy weighs heavily on the city to this day with places like the Roundhouse still showcasing talent whilst reminding people what they lost in May 1980. It has gone into my top 10 of all time for the first time performance of Sam Riley who really brings Curtis to life on the screen.

A Modern Masterpiece,"I can't stop thinking about this film. From the great use of suspense and minimalist dialogue, to the amazing camera work such that every single frame of this modern masterpiece (yes masterpiece) could be taken and hung on a wall in an art gallery, I love everything about it. It has been criticised for focusing too heavily on Annik Honoré and Deborah Curtis as the sources for Ian's spiralling depression, and in that sense only gives us a narrow snapshot of his short life, but I think Corbijn never strove for more than that. To me one of the superb merits of this picture is its sense of isolation which is created by such a very selective approach to its content. I feel certain, given Corbijn's access to Curtis's wife and Tony Wilson as co-producers, that Control could have told us the full, unabridged tale of Curtis's demise, yet Corbijn didn't and it is this exercise in restraint that renders his riveting film so artistically pleasing. Moreover, Riley's uncanny resemblance to the great man himself (and I feel, rather eerily, to Pete Doherty) makes it simply impossible to tear your eyes away from the screen. Jaw-droppingly good.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Control - Unmissable,"I went watching it last night and i've got to say, it was absolutely brilliant. If you are a fan of Joy Division, it is unmissable. It tells the story of Ian Curtis and Joy Division, in fantastic detail. The casting of the film is awesome and Sam Riley who plays Curtis, gives an absolutely flawless portrayal of Ian Curtis. The whole film from start to finish was immaculate, the music......... well, if you like Joy Division, you'll understand. The way the film is put together with the music, you can see, Curtis' state of mind through the songs, as well as the visual side. Ultimately a tragic ending, i had tears rolling down my face as the film closed to ""Atmosphere"" Absolute Classic. I've read the whingers comments, but if you want a total ""reflection of life"" movie, this is it. The detail is absolute quality. Anyone watching this who know nothing about Ian Curtis or Joy Division, may well not feel the Magnitude, of the film and the ABSOLUTE QUALITY (regardless of what anyone else says) of the the casting. I think they got the casting as good as digging up Ian Curtis and animating him. Sam Riley is faultless. It must be the best performance of a character role i have EVER seen. Thanks Sam! If people go into this film with preconceptions, they should leave them at the cinema door. This is the closest story of Ian Curtis' life i could imagine. Brilliantly researched. Brilliantly Casted (Possibly the best actor casted in a role in Sam Riley, FLAWLESS) The monochrome filming........ well what can i say. I think colour was invented too soon; this film has shown what movies are all about,:and how they should be. Don't let the B/W context throw you, it is filmed in BW because it suits the film. Ian Curtis was not about singing from rainbows.A film of a love story between his wife, his band and his mistress. Thats how i see it. Ian Curtis, though ultimately tragic, comes out of the film a hero. Absolute classic. It has,........ AND WILL CONTINUE TO.......win awards.IAN CURTIS, genius and inspirationMB63",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wow!,"Control is the best film I have ever seen.Joy Division have remained my favourite ever band over the last 27 years. I have lovingly appreciated Anton's videos and photographs since that time. The film was simply superb and immaculate and exquisite. I did not feel that I was watching a film; I felt I was there. As indeed I was.I lost control ten minutes in, and continued crying to the very end.I have never watched a film that moved me as much as Control.It is an excellent work of art. Absolutely magnificent. And produced with such loving attention to detail. The film brought my memories of those days cascading back. The way the film addressed the complexities of Debbie's marriage was astounding, also.And John CC. How cool is that! I only wish that Ian, Rob, Tony and Martin were still around to see how much we love them everlastingly. This film will go on to reap great rewards; such a shame they won't be there to share it with us.Thanks most of all to Debbie, Natalie and New Order. And Anton. A work of genius.Classic line - Rob to Ian: Well, it could be worse; you could be lead singer of the Fall.Love to Macclesfield and Manchester from a lily-livered Londoner.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Love will tear us apart, againControl","Anton Corbijn has finally joined the ranks of his contemporaries Spike Jonze, Michel Gondry, and Mark Romanek in directing his first full-length feature. No one could have been a better choice than this still photographer and music video director of cutting edge bands like Depeche Mode, Echo and the Bunnyman, and, of course, Joy Division themselves with the video for Atmosphere (albeit eight years after the death of frontman Ian Curtis). Corbijn has the sensibilities to craft a gorgeous study of a man on the cusp of greatness and the humanity of himself, which keeps him from taking that next leap. The cinematography is glorious in its stark, high contrast, black and white, the performance scenes feel realistic and genuine, and he gets some monster performances from every cast member. Just a few hours ago I was once again mentioning to a friend my apprehension and dislike for biopics, and then I am treated to Control. Not only a biography that seems to truly capture the subject at hand, but also a superb film to stand alongside any genre out there.Joy Division's lead singer, as portrayed hereI will admit to knowing next to nothing about the band before viewing, possibly enhancing my pleasure as there were no trace of annoyance when something didn't mesh to realitywas not your run-of-the-mill rockstar. Ian Curtis was an everyman like you and me, a fallible creature, both confused and naïve in his young age. Marrying so early in life, Curtis had a child, a day job, and a gig fronting one of the hottest bands of the time. What started as a way for expression, however, soon becomes another slice of trouble in his already crumbling life. When diagnosed with epilepsy, a condition for which he once tried to help afflicted gain employment, he begins a regiment of medication concoctions, hoping to find a combination to alleviate the suffering. Mixed with his late night shows and high alcohol consumption, both frowned upon by his doctor, Curtis maybe the only star I know to have fallen into his psychological descent from prescribed drug use. Ever more depressed as his love blossomed between his wife, child, and mistress, Curtis could never find the balance to deal with the fame and the fans. After all he gave in life and onstage, they just had one answer for himWe want more.Truthfully, Sam Riley is quite a find. Whether his talent is real or just catered perfectly to this roleI'd like to believe the formerhe is amazing. Totally embodying Curtis, Riley's face is never shown with a shred of ""acting"" noticeable. His blank stares, the weak smiles, the crying, and the pain of his seizures all come across as though we are viewing a documentary. Complete with Curtis' unique dance style, it is like watching history as it happens. Credit the rest of his bandmates for adding to the realism in each performance sequence, as well as the supporting cast. I was a bit unimpressed at first with Samantha Morton as his wife Debbie, but that feeling quickly went away. What appeared juvenile and trying too hard to play 20 years old eventually came together as a pretty solid piece of work. Always great, Morton shines when the world begins dissolving around her, but her love for her husband never wavers behind the tears and anger. Besides her, mention also needs to be made for Toby Kebbell as manager Rob Gretton. Starting as comic relief, his character plays a tremendous role in Curtis' life. While the band seemed to be unable to deal with their singer's affliction, Kebbell stays by his side throughout, doing what he can to try and keep him together.Control is a remarkable achievement that succeeds by adhering to the one aspect I like in biopics, keeping it simple. We are only shown a few years in his life, the meeting of his wife and bandmates and the short-lived tenure of what was Joy Division. This capsule in time is allowed to evolve and flesh out all the emotions and turmoil that went on. From the highs to the lows, the comradery to the adultery, Curtis is always portrayed as the tragic hero he was. Everything his music did for its listeners, all the power and hope it instilled in the fans, came at a steep price. Draining himself of life and confidence and love, Curtis was never going to be able to keep the ride going into the US. Corbijn gets every moment correct, straight through to the inevitable conclusion. Never trying to shock us, he treats the ending with immense compassion and love. Subdued and heart-breaking, Curtis' demise is allowed to be as beautifully touching as the rest of his ever-so-short time on earth.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Is this the best rock biopic ever?,"I am a Joy Division fan, but I knew little about Ian Curtis' life until I saw this movie. It is a genuinely touching and beautifully shot portrait of the lead singer from one of the bands whose sound defined the 80's, and which is still being mentioned as an influence by today's bands. I was familiar with Anton Corbijn's work from the U2 albums and videos, and I was genuinely surprised with the quality of the end result, considering two things: this is his debut feature and another, not so obvious - he is a Dutchman and yet he captures perfectly the atmosphere of 70's north of England. No mean feat, I would say. As almost every English teenager in 1973, Ian Curtis wanted to be David Bowie. Then he meets Debbie, whom he married when he was still barely out of his teens. Pressures on family life, work, playing in a band and epilepsy eventually take its toll on Ian Curtis. If there is any justice in the world, this will do well at the Oscars - Sam Riley and Samantha Morton are superb in their roles and deserve nominations. Also the photography and soundtrack should be nominated, which would get Joy Division's music finally recognised in the United States by the wider audience which it deserves. I cannot honestly remember of a recent rock biopic which has been shot with such sensitivity and brilliance. Even for non-fans I would recommend this film. Johnny and June is also a fine movie, but Johnny Cash was no rock singer (even though he had he attitude and lifestyle of one). Oliver Stone made a real mess with The Doors - I wonder what Anton Corbijn would have done with that material, considering that there were some similarities in both band leaders - they were both charismatic, into poetry, and tormented with their demons. In short, I highly recommend it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Control,"Lots of time without much fanfare some movies are released, and amidst all the new movies  lots of time they get lost. It requires special skills to keep your sense open to read reviews from papers and friends to identify and be aware of some good movies are running. Control falls into that category.This is a true story of British iconic signer Ian Curtis (Sam Riley) who is young, ambitious and dreamer. At tender age of 17-18 years gets involved with his friend's fiancée Deborah Curtis (Samantha Morton), and marries her. Parallel to that his career builds up as a lead singer with a small group called Joy Division. Years pass by and Ian gets involved with a journalist Annik (Alexandra Maira Lara) who comes to interview the rising stars. Ian troubles increase when he faces the terrible epileptic attacks. He is under pressure to deliver professionally  something new every time he is on stage. He does not feel the same passion with increasing commercial pressures. Ian remains confused and is not able to decide between his wife Deborah and his lover Annik  to both he hides his emotions and starts telling lies. In that depressed state  he starts drinking (which is bad for an epileptic) and feels falsely rejected and hated by everyone around him  finally leading him to get miserably drunk, and after a severe epileptic attack, commits suicide by hanging himself.This movie is co-produced by Ian's wife Deborah Curtis, who has also written a biography Touching from a Distance  on which the movie is based. This is Dutch still camera photographer and music video maker turned Movie Director Anton Cobijn debut movie. He has done a marvelous job as a Director. The movie is shot in Black and White by cinematographer Martin Ruhe (I thought Anton would shoot the images himself). But the screen canvass is wonderfully shot  each image looking like a post-card perfect picture.A special mention of the musical score used in original of Joy Division band. It is reminisces of 70's era and music.Sam Riley digs deep into the psyche of Ian's character and one can not imagine Ian being any different from Sam. Brilliant role and performance which is well supported by all the other cast! Sam has already won 1 award for this role and the movie gathered 7 awards totally, and I think there would be more to come.Hats off to Anton Cobijn to delicately handle this difficult subject of a singer's 4-5 years short life with such finesse!

wow.,"I knew a little bit about the band before watching this. definitely not a lot or enough...OK well i knew they were and 80s...well now i know 70s-80s...emotionally charged punk band from england. who was very well known for there song ""love will tear us apart"" and also knew that a favorite band of mine Thursday wrote a song with singer's name as a title. i always wanted to try to get into em , but i barely know anyone who loves them enough. so i went in with that knowledge..and i was astonished at the quality and how beautiful the film was....I'm proof that you don't need to know or lovvvee the band to be touched and amazed by this film. the acting was great. I almost would recommend Riley for an Oscar or something. i will def be looking for the DVD and not to mention the fantastic soundtrack...if anyone knows if they are putting one out. let me know! i hope this review was helpful.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Good but doesn't really get inside the focal point of the film in the way it needed to,"Ian Curtis works at an employment exchange in Manchester where he deals all day with the unemployed and perhaps unemployable. An off-beat and quite cold character, he does have a creative side and it is this that ultimately leads him to become the lead singer for a band called Warsaw. This happens at just the right time as local television presenter Tony Wilson starts promoting local music and a local promoter becomes the group's manager. Joy Division (as they are now called) are born, sign to Factory Records and start getting bigger locally and nationally. However Ian's challenges with depression and epilepsy become greater as he feels his life slipping out of control.I came to this film with two conflicting things in mind. Firstly that Control had been praised by most reviewers but then, secondly, I don't know much about Joy Division as my age put this just on the wrong side of my interest in music and popular culture. So in some ways I was perhaps protected from some of the criticism of the film but then conversely I was not exposed to weaknesses in the material that I would not have known. When it came to watching the film itself I found myself perhaps shielded in this regard because I didn't feel the lack of parts of Curtis' life mainly because I was not informed enough to spot omissions. However there is no denying that there are omissions and that perhaps the film doesn't deliver that well even within the bounds that it sets itself.For me everything I know about the period and the band has come from documentaries on Factory Records and from 24 Hour Party People so for me I didn't really want or need another film that covers the period, hence my interest in Control. So focusing on Curtis himself was a good move but it does then mean that the film needs to engage simply on a character that will be real to some viewers but not to others. For me I found enough of interest but never really felt like I had gotten to the heart of Curtis in regards his conflicting and contrasting character traits of needing but yet pushing away, depression, fan pressure and creativity. It does well at certain points but mostly we are on the outside, seeing Curtis as difficult without really getting past that. The music adds appeal to this approach while the character of Deborah adds passion and emotion that is surprisingly lacking in much of it.The city of Manchester has been noted as being absent but again, having never been there, this wasn't an issue for me as it was for others. On the contrary I thought the locations were fine even if I didn't really get a sense of period (although all the right cars were sitting around the streets). The cinematography blesses it all with a crisp black and white look and Corbijn's direction was solid without being particularly flashy. Since Riley has already been praised there is no pressure on me to heap it on him as well. He is convincing (speaking as someone seeing his character as just that  a character) but I never got inside his head. Morton for me is better mainly because of how much of a lift she gives the film  her performance injects energy and gave me somewhere to put my emotional interest in the story. The supporting cast are good with turns from Kebbell, Parkinson, Naylor and others all solid and enjoyable.So as a fresh pair of eyes Control is both strong and weak. Without any knowledge of Curtis beyond documentaries I was less protective or critical of a portrayal but yet I was left on the outside of his character  which is a problem considering he is the film. The events around Curtis, the period and the emotional core in Deborah help carry it, allowing the good aspects of the portrayal to come out but not to the point where the weaknesses were totally covered. A good film, but perhaps not as brilliant as the British media (understandably) hyped it to be.",,Anonymous,Music
A tribute to the fallen angel in all of us,"Simply put, a beautiful film about the young man who had so much potential. The details of Ian Curtis' dark side are best left to the movie, but without spoiling, all I can say is I hope this film will win over new and future fans of what I believe to be the realest rock band that ever existed.Going black-and-white is a big choice for a film being released in an era of CGI madness, when movies like Beowolf are topping the box office, but you get none of the played-out legendary thematics and sci-fi fairy tales with this film. This is a movie about the postmodern human condition, first and foremost.Joy Division, unlike previously described, were not a punk band, but classified as Post-punk for several significant reasons. While the Sex Pistols thrashed and screamed and swore their way to fame, and while they are accredited with inspiring Joy Division and a number of other bands that eventually signed to Factory Records, they lacked something that Joy Division searched for in every one of their songs--a deeper meaning. The melodies of Joy Division's music evolved, and in only a few years, beyond even what most bands today are capable of producing. More importantly, the lyrics were never swept away by the distortion and echo-filled guitar and rhythms.To the contrary, they cut through the guitar's industrial opacity and reach deep within to the fragile mortality in all of us.See this movie, spread the word, and learn how some things aren't meant to be beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Being involved with an independent record label nightclub , radio show and many other (concert) projects for almost ten years gave me the opportunity to experience a bit of that part of our world. This movie is one of those which gives a correct representation of what I've felt and saw around me. Not an over the top rock 'n roll movie but honest and with great consideration for what was really important.I would recommend this movie not only to all music-lovers over the world but also to those who like to be moved by true feelings and inner conflicts than can lead to sad decisions.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Ian's Lost Control,"Anybody who ever grooved on the music of Joy Division (and their later reincarnation,New Order)as I did back in the day (and still do)should drop what they have on & flock to whatever cinema is screening this gem. The story centers on Ian Curtis (played to perfection by Sam Riley)from the time of his rather unamazing adolescence (Curtis mostly hangs out in his bedroom,smoking & listening to David Bowie,Iggy Pop & others),until his untimely death at the age of 23. Despite being the lead singer in Joy Division, his life was pretty much the antithesis of the whole bohemian experience (he married way too early in life). Despite this,Curtis's rather humdrum life does make for a very good cinematic experience. The film,although shot on colour stock, was processed in a glowing black & white that looks stunning on screen. The music is to die for (all of Joy Division's music is actually played live by the supporting cast,all of which are musicians). I'm now hoping for film bios on some of the other bands that recorded for Factory,back in the late 70's & early to mid 80's (Happy Mondays,Duruti Column,etc.)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A poorly made editing of a poorly vision,"Ian Curtis is definitly one of the greateast and surely a controvesial figure, people have many diferent visions of who he really was, the young death holds the fault for that but in this special movie i could only see a hollow Ian. You won't know him for this, you won't see a portrait of a real men, you will just see time jumps into important stuff that have no importance if not told into the right way, with emotion and calm, thing that this movie seens like to never had, it's looks like more a compilation of pretty people doing odd stuff in black and white.If you really like Ian and Joy Division don't judge their story by this movie.

"Great rock biopic, one of the best","Great movie, dealing with a complex subject. I am a Joy Division fan, and have read the book on which the movie is based (""Touching from a Distance"" by Deborah Curtis, Ian Curtis' widow), so was very glad to see that the movie does his life justice, warts and all.Great direction by Anton Corbijn - filming in black and white was a masterstroke, setting the right mood for the movie. Great acting too, especially by Sam Riley as Ian Curtis.Only negative thing I have to say about it is that the pacing was bit slow, esp in the latter half to quarter of the movie.Another great movie to watch re Joy Division is ""24 Hour Party People"". This covers the Manchester music scene of the late 70s to early 90s, as seen through the eyes of Tony Wilson, the founder of Factory Records, Joy Division's record company. Bands covered include Joy Division, New Order and Happy Mondays, amongst others. Rate that movie even higher than Control, from a music history point of view.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"It maybe myth, but it's some darn fine film making","In ""24 Hour Party People,"" the character Tony Wilson quips that when it comes down to choosing between truth and legend that the legend makes a better story. Many Joy Division fans (and from news reports, members of the band) felt that Control bought into the myths surrounding the band: The contract signed in blood, that Ian Curtis was this dark mysterious figure and perhaps that the whole Joy Division story was depressing as their music.So while 24 Hour Party People was a kind of fun, tongue in cheek take on some of the era, Control is something of the antithesis of that. It may also be a little biased as some of it was based on Ian Curtis's estranged wife's book. But Corbijn's camera is so focused that truth or not, this is a fine movie.Anton Corbijn's film reminds me of indie films of an era past. When Jim Jarmusch started making movies he used black and white, long takes and stark looks at the film's characters. That's sort of what Corbijn does. It's not a stretch from his photography. Control is a portrait of Ian Curtis, possibly more as myth than actual man, but a portrait nonetheless.Sam Riley has a lot resting on his shoulders in this performance, as he plays a man who is somewhat getting lost in his own world, growing distant from the world around him, often at a loss for words in every part of his life, but his music. He sees something that moves him, like a girl going into an epileptic seizure, and gazes at it and writes about it. That this film will be a blip on many US audiences' radar is a real shame because this performance is golden.Control is emotional without being melodramatic. There's a simplicity in the style of the film and performances that allow emotions to flow all over the screen. But they are sad ones. If I have a complaint about the film it's that it lacks any sort of real humor. That maybe the problem with buying into the myth, but I guess with Ian Curtis's story you can't be wishing for happy endings.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent Portrayal,"This was such a beautifully sad and real film. In the better understanding of the ins and outs of Ian Curtis' inner conflicts and self judgments, this film explains some of the apparent weight behind the amazing music of Joy Division. From deep and despondent looks to the intensely passionate emotion and body movement,Sam Riley seems to have precisely tapped into Ians spirit and portrayed him ideally. The details and background make you have a real sense of the time and place of Manchester in the 70's. Thank You Deborah Curtis, Anton Corbijn, and everyone involved, this film seems to have done Ian, music fans, and film fans great justice! I highly recommend to everyone.",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"This Is The Way, Step Inside","In a day and age full of bloated and nostalgic musical biopics Control is a welcome breath of fresh air that proves the genre is still capable of producing films that are both artistically and aesthetically inventive. Anton Corbijn's feature length debut takes an intimate look at the short life of the ill-fated Joy Division front man Ian Curtis. Based on the book Touching From A Distance written by Ian's widow Deborah Curtis, Control tells Ian's tale without falling into sentimentality but rather investigates it.Control premiered at Cannes in 2007 to a warm reception by critics and overwhelming praise of then little-known actor Sam Riley, the film went onto be the winner of the festivals Director's Fortnight. Riley's portrayal of Ian is so hauntingly natural and close to Curtis as a person that it gives the feeling that you are watching a stylized documentary. Corbijn whose photography career got a boost after shooting the original Joy Division in the late 70's knows his subjects closely and attempts to examine their lives and choices rather than just solely empathize with them. Corbijn believed so much in this film that he even decided to put down half the cash himself in order to produce this multi-million dollar film.Aside from Riley's outstanding performance another highlight of the film is cinematographer's Martin Ruhe stark and brooding photography of Macclesfield, England is understated yet powerful. His images are crystal clear yet dark, isolated yet full of life, youthful yet mature. The film's pacing is tight and doesn't fall into the conventional traps that usually bog most biopics down. Corbijn's debut is a poetic ode to a man whom shares fated parallels with Corbijn and has been a source of lifelong inspiration, complete with an unforgettable final metaphor as poignant as it is beautiful.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A work of art a heartbreaking look into the mind of a broken genius.,"I currently think that this movie is the most lovely to watch. It mesmerises the way I think about love. What people think inside cannot be defined by love. A man sees the most stunning things in the world when he looks at her. We turn like crazy individuals when we are unable to see our girl. I adore you for who you are as much as for who I become when I'm with you. I adore you for who you are making me into as well as what you have made of yourself. I cherish the aspect of myself that you bring out in you.I'm happy because of this movie. It significantly altered how I view love in my opinion. Anywhere and at any time, a man can fall in love. A girl you love cannot be abandoned. In your opinion, she is irrational. She is sensitive. This movie is amazing. I am unable to always express my feelings to you. Every scene dismantles the constraints of love.Every character seems untrustworthy because they seem so genuine. They don't act; instead, they merely play the games they play in real life. Ian is excellent. I get goosebumps listening to him. You'll feel at peace with your mind after seeing it. Every character is calming, just like a wind. A plant that can harvest grains.The director is doing his job perfectly. Every moment he takes with demand and beauty The location he chose is astonishing. Music creates peace of mind.

After watching 24 Hour Party People - which is a fun if flawed take on Ian Curtis and Joy Division (at least in part) - I guess I was wanting to gain a deeper ""insight"" into Ian's life. This movie is so po-faced and serious, it actually squeezes every bit of fun and wonder out of the Joy Division mythos without granting any perception -- and as a disclaimer, I must admit that I've been a fan since the '80s. Control offers nothing deeper than a Smash Hits-era recounting of Ian's dark journey. I've read so many accounts of this tale that I found myself saying, 'Hey, that didn't actually happen!' more than once. Stark b&w photography adds to the gloom. This is a depressing and boring movie.

"A beautiful, emotive, and uniquely realistic biopic","Let me preface this review with a fact: I do not like biopics. I think that they are (more often than not) cash grabs, taking a real person's life and turning it into a melodramatic and biased account of their legacy.Control, however? This film is a work of art. From the monochromatic picture to the natural dialogue to the well-researched depiction of seizures, epilepsy, and depression, it is difficult to find anything wrong with it.Being based on the biography of Deborah; Ian Curtis's widow; the writing gives the film a realistic portrayal of the domestic life of the Joy Division singer, thankfully avoiding the romanticised 'tortured poet' narrative that appears to have been pasted on to so many now-deceased celebrities (think: Kurt Cobain, Amy Winehouse).I could write about Control for hours, but I will force myself to be succinct. This biopic is human. It shows both the good and bad of the real people involved in Joy Division's short reign and - as an epileptic who has taken the same (awful) medication as Curtis - is brilliantly powerful in its sincerity. Presenting a life changed by seizures and suicidal ideation with tact is near-impossible and very rarely seen in media. Control, however, hit the nail on the proverbial head.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

The tragic beauty of the beholder. Ian is a magician and his simple reverbs of the soul seem complex but still beautiful. A leader and creator and poet of the souls.

Since the film is about an artist, I want to hope that the film will also be artistic, I don't know if that should be a pity or a good thing, but the best and most memorable artistic decision in the film is the practically black and white color palette, which clearly reflects feelings of Ian Curtis and the band's songs that were born from those feelings. Probably the most perfect thing in the movie and without it I can't imagine how I would rate the movie the way I did. Great cinematography, acting, nothing to comment on, the film is light, should be enjoyed by anyone who is not even a fan of the band. But up to 10/10 it lacked something more to say or something more interesting than it was here. A fairly standard biopic, nothing out of the ordinary or very memorable, but certainly a very interesting film for me as a Joy Division fan.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Just Finished Watching This Fine Film,"Wow! Such noteworthy performances by all. This movie that was perfectly filmed in black and white made me feel several different emotions. Sadness for both Ian and his wife, anger at Ian for some choices he made, a need to pop a Prozac at the beginning, middle & end of the film :-), such utter feelings of hopelessness poured from the TV screen. When Ian sang, he put all his emotional and physical being into each song, it is no wonder of the outcome. I felt such sadness for Debbie...helplessness. I hope her and her child are doing well today. I think Ian needed to be committed for help with what really seemed to be a very serious mental illness. Hopefully, this movie will teach some up and coming musicians that being happy is more important than fame and fortune.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
For the love of Joy Division,"I don't know if it's one of the best movie ever made but I gave it a 10 for the love of Joy Division.I think the movie is so beautiful and depressing (almost everything that I found beautiful is depressing), the picture is really great ...but most of all it's about the life of Ian Curtis and I almost cried when I saw Sam Riley moving his arms like Ian.If you love Joy Division, how could you not love this movie ???What about you ?Astronaut__________________Tyler Durden: Where'd you go, psycho boy? Narrator: I felt like destroying something beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Brilliant Legacy,"***I posted this review also as a posting on a general thread.***Though I was somewhat aware of their music and of the band as a whole, Joy Division, always existed somewhere at the periphery of my consciousness.Then, a few weeks ago I walked into a record store (yeah I still enjoy buying CD's/albums) my eyes fell on ""The Best Of Joy Division"", and that was that. Ever since I bought it, I cannot stop playing it. I can't describe the music, the one word that comes to mind is amazing. The sound is so mesmerizing and engaging, the instrumental arrangements, the lyrics, Ian Curtis's voice, the rhythm, beats,the talent of each band member, Stephen Morris, Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner etc. etc. etc.Joy Division is like a drug, and the more you taste the more you want to taste, thereby creating an insatiable appetite that cannot ever be satisfied!Though Joy Division was active only for a short time, (1976-1980) and their body of work is quite brief and not as voluminous as other bands that came together during those years, the influence and impact of Joy Division on music is in my opinion groundbreaking, monumental and unique.I think that even during those days their sound was so complex and ahead of its time, that most people did not know what to do with it. People were unsure of the music of Joy Division, could not peg it to a style or classify it! Even now their sound is far ahead by leaps and bounds, and the sheer complexity of the music will assign a timeless and immortal quality to it, which will in turn ensure an always vibrant continuity to their musical legacy.The influence of Joy Division is so deep and far reaching, that it is sometimes hard to quantify and qualify. It extends from Tears For Fears, Depeche Mode and The Cure (as well as virtually every band which comprised the post-punk New Wave movement) to U2, Coldplay, Keane and The Killers who also incidentally contributed their version of Joy Division's ""Shadowplay"" on the movie's soundtrack and their own compilation ""Sawdust"". These are but a few of the bands and musicians that can attribute their inspiration to Joy Division. At least Bono and U2 are graceful enough to acknowledge how much they owe to Joy Division (read the group's biography ""U2"" by U2).Honestly, looking at some of today's musicians and bands (I shall not name any out of respect for Joy Division), they should be ashamed to call themselves that, they should kiss the ground the walk on a give thanks to the heavens each and every day for their existence, because when compared with Joy Division they are nothing but a bunch of talentless hacks!!!!I wish Joy Division had more time to evolve, grow and reach the full potential that the band could have. Still even with the bits and pieces of their creativity out there, the brilliance of what hey achieved is unmistakable.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Torturous viewing,"I'm sure this is probably fairly accurate to the reality of what happened, but for a viewing experience is was utter torture.At some point a director has to realise that ultimately he or she is trying to produce something that is at some level entertaining and is enjoyable to watch. This is not.It leaves me not wishing to know anything further about Ian Curtis or Joy Division.Pretentious film noir with reasonable cinematography does not a good film make and even the excellent as usual Samantha Morton who plays Samantha Morton can't rescue this dirge.I wanted to bail on this film about a third of the way through. But I stoically kept going for the sole reason I would not at a future date forget how bad it was and give it another shot.Watch it if you want, but know you have been warned.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Overlooked movie. Fantastic,"How did this guy not win an Oscar for this portrayal. Didn't even get nominated. I've seen plenty of ""Oscar winners"" who aren't a patch on this amazing performance.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
He lost control of the film ...,"Given the fact that I am a lover of the band Joy Division , there are things that are absolutely out for a deliberately ""essay film"" as this movie wanted to be:1)Disgusting scene of farts before one concert; 2)Apart from Ian Curtis, the rest of the band is portrayed as a mass of idiots and useless pricks; 3)It is very obvious the influence of Ian Curtis' widow who wrote the book on which is based the movie, in addition to being a co-producer . Everything takes place under the widow's point of view:it is symptomatic that none of the alive members of the band is involved in the production crew. 4)Anton Corbijn, the always sought-after director of many wonderful musical videos , with this film has lost his touch. Four points of view that add up to the vote that I expressed for this film. Thanks",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Markedly different,"This is a great introduction to the band Joy Division and Ian Curtis' story for people who weren't of that era. I was born in 1982, and being a music follower I knew about Joy Division, I knew Ian Curtis killed himself, I knew the Smashing Pumpkins and Nine Inch Nails covers of Joy Division songs. I always thought they seemed quite important to the modern music world, but watching this movie was my first real introduction, and I spent an afternoon listening to all their releases afterwards. First, I thought it was a really respectful and thoughtful movie, and quite unlike most rock star rise and fall stories. It fascinated me to learn afterwards who the film makers actually were with regard to their relation to the band historically. I liked how Mr Curtis didn't seem to be a hedonist or a showman. There's a line, something like 'those people don't know what it takes and the effect it has on me' when talking about performing, like it takes every ounce of strength and expression just to complete a show, like he really really took it seriously and needed it. This film really helped me to get the music, and give me a reference point to start appreciating it. I thought it was far more sympathetic to the subject than most films of this type, extremely well acted, and as previously mentioned, a great introduction to a band I'll unfortunately never get to see.",,Anonymous,Music
Take Control of your Joy today! And that is your New Order of the day!,"Sam Riley's mesmerizing performance as former Joy Division lead singer Ian Curtis in the bio pic ""Control"" undeniably had control as one of the best of 2007. Director Anton Corbin's cinematic take on the uncontrollable melancholic life of the un-joyous vocalist is a commendable film orchestration. Curtis committed suicide at age 23 in 1980. Corbin reveals Curtis' constant struggles with self-esteem, adultery, epilepsy, and fame throughout the narrative; starting with his post-adolescent days as a British loner to his self-destructive final act. Curtis married at a young age to gentle gal Debbie; but due to the hasty marriage, he consequently fell out of love in the coming years and suffered much self-ridden guilt from it. Curtis, still married, then meets a sexy Belgium named Annik and falls deeply in love with her even though he knows that adulterous ""love will tear him apart"". Corbin also shows us the Joy Division ""transmission"" from local band status to rock-solid popularity ""atmosphere"" status. The dialogue interactions scenes between the Joy Divisionees and their manager Rob Gretton are the film's comic relief from an otherwise gloomy rock star story. Samantha Morton's auteur work as Mrs. Debbie Curtis was one of the most powerful of the year and Ms. Morton proficiently demonstrates that she never lost control of her character. Joe Anderson, James Anthony Pearson, and Harry Treadaway were no ""dead souls"" in their performances as the Joy Division members. They just might be included in the ""New Order"" of promising British actors coming our way. And without a doubt you can book Toby Kebbell's effort as Gretton as one that definitely rocked! But it is Riley's (""believe it or not"" ""Is that really Ian Curtis?"") acting that falls as probably as the most overlooked performance of 2007. I was all hung up when Sam's stunning achievement was ""isolated"" away from the Best Actor Oscar nominees list for 2007! I guess there is so much that we can control. Now it is time for you take control and tune in to ""Control"" today! ***** Excellent",,Anonymous,Music
