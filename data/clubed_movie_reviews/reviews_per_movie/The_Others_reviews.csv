"Subtle, genuinely creepy and ... SUBTLE","The Others is a very remarkable film from more than just one viewpoint. In an era where you can only impress young horror fanatics with bucket-loads of blood and gross-out effects, Amenábar actually re-teaches his audience that fear is especially caused by suggestion and the absence of explicit images. The Others is the first intelligent horror film in years, completely relying on atmosphere and eerie set pieces. It's such a relief to finally see a subtle film that is also effective! I'm normally not much of Nicole Kidman fan but she's very convincing as the prudish, over-concerned mother who desperately tries to protect her children from the outside world (daylight in particular). She lives in a remote mansion and waits, along with her 2 children, for WWII to be over. With the arrival of 3 servants, strange events star to occur in the old house and the daughter spots 'intruders' everywhere. The screenplay - by Amenábar himself - is not totally unique (filmfreaks who're familiar with expressionism highlights from the 60's will quickly guess the hidden plot twist) but it's filled with ingenious findings and sublime dialogues. The Others reminds you of 'The Innocents' and there are far worse films to get compared with, if you ask me! What also is rather amazing about this production is that Amenábar seems so confident! This is his first giant Hollywood adventure with stars in the cast and American money and yet he has total control over everything. The acting is great, the plot actually scares you and the directing is solid. The Others is a total winner and easily one of the greatest genre-films of the last few decades.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Creepy, creepy, creepy, mind-blown...","The heading is how u feel throughout the film. Instead of writing a long review, I'll say in simple words.

A masterpiece.,"Twenty years on, and The Others still rates as one of the best, most memorable horrors of the last two decades. It doesn't have the cheap gore or lazy scares that so many do, this has the element of menace, the scares are more measured, and suitably placed.It's very different to almost every other horror I can think of, it's like a story from a much earlier era, but given up to date production values and acting. It benefits of course from such a wonderful cast, Kidman is awesome, and does a terrific English accent.The ending came as a massive surprise, and was perhaps the most chilling element of the film. It is loaded with atmosphere, it's thoroughly engrossing, I would hugely recommend this film, 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling!!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen all year, and one of the top horror stories ever told.  It's creepy, simplistic, and eerie.I was impressed by the enchanting simplicity of the plot, the lack of need for ""Hollywood"" special effects, and the haunting atmosphere that loomed over everything from beginning to end.The first half, or even three quarters, seemed to move along a bit slowly, but it felt necessary to build the suspense to the point where I was biting my nails in anticipation of the inevitable.Nicole Kidman's character, Grace... I was torn between empathy and disgust for her at times, but she definitely succeeded at captivating me with their lives and story.  Predictable in parts, but it still leaves you guessing. This was a quality ghost story, with an old fashioned ambiance; downright spooky.I was in awe of the ending, a fairly intelligent premise. It's the kind of movie that lets you escape reality for a while by entertaining you, but at the same time, returns you to the ""real world"" with your spine tingling, wondering if there isn't some possibility of truth...  Chilling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Horror at its best,"At a time when horror films constitute silly teenagers blindly wandering into danger and unnecessary gore, 'The Others' is like a breath of fresh air. It goes back to the roots of the horror genre, employing an eerie atmosphere and mysterious characters to conjure the chilly backbone of the film.'The Others' is set in the Forties and revolves around staunchly Catholic Grace Stewart, who lives in an old mansion located on the island of Jersey with her highly photo-sensitive children ten-year-old Anne and six-year-old Nicholas. The house is almost permanently entrenched in darkness, in deference to the children's condition, and Grace's husband is lost in war, only enhancing the sense of gloom to the story. One morning, three servants mysteriously turn up at the door of the Stewart mansion, despite Grace having not yet advertised the posts, to replace the previous servants who had suddenly left their posts a week earlier. Anne then begins to maintain the house is haunted, her deduction supported by the fact locked doors left ajar, closed curtains suddenly being found opened and furniture moving when there's no-one in the room. Grace, deeply ingrained in her religious belief that ghosts don't exist, initially refuses to believe her daughter but soon she questions her faith as she can't deny there is something ominous about the house...Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance as the almost cold and aloof Grace, who does love her children dearly even if she doesn't always show it openly. Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy, as the three servants, are suitably mysterious by showing they seem to know more than they let on, leaving viewers questioning their motives from the start. But it is the young child actors, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, who steal the show as Anne and Nicholas. Despite their age and inexperience, both children given first-class depictions of their characters, showing their isolation thanks to their medical conditions and their reliance on one another despite typical sibling discord at times. Mann, in particular, excels in portraying the stubborn nature of Anne and her precarious relationship with her mother. It is a shame this child never continued her acting career because she is a credit to young British acting.'The Others' is a subtle horror films for those sick of cheap Hollywood horror flicks and are seeking interesting characters and an intelligent plot. While there are no special effects or buckets of blood in this film, in the tradition of 'The Exorcist' and 'The Devil's Backbone', it instead relies upon more old-fashion methods of frightening the audience, which are far more effective. The story is well-paced, leaving the audience guessing what is happening and what the characters' motives are right to the end.This film has to be one of the best horror films I've ever seen and puts many films in the horror genre to shame. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate the value of suspense and a good fright.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A throwback to the great spooky Gothic films,"Rarely does a scary film come around that isn't schlocky and obvious. 'The Others', directed by the great Alejandro Amenabar (Abre los Ojos) is a stylish, spooky and fun film to watch that doesn't cheapen itself like so many in the genre. It is 1947 on the island of Jersey in England, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) is the mother of two small children, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) and Anne (Alakina Mann) who are allergic to the sunlight, so they are not allowed to go outside. Moreover, any room they are in has to be locked with the curtains shut, a cumbersome task in their mansion with its 50 doors. Mysteriously, the mansion's staff left the week before, which precipitates the arrival of three new servants; a gardener and two housekeepers who are promptly hired. Further complicating matters is the fact that Anne keeps talking to an unseen child, and unexplained footsteps, opened curtains and doors opening and shutting are starting to wear thin on the already uber-fragile Grace, until the occurrences threaten their lives.With 'The Others', Amenabar gives us a truly spooky and stylish thriller. The foggy atmosphere outside of the mansion, the dark rooms lit by candles within the house, both of these are just many of the beautiful stylistic areas of the film. Kidman is great as the incredibly brittle and mentally frayed Grace. While she puts on a cool, haughty façade, the circumstances she finds herself in are clearly eating away at her sanity. The actors who play her children are actually quite good themselves, particularly Alakina Mann, who holds her own in her confrontational scenes with Kidman and others. The screenplay, also written by Amenabar is quite intelligent, and if you haven't heard the 'twist' at the end, it is pretty ingenious. It is ingenious and well-written regardless, but the impact upon discovery is pretty decent.'The Others' is not a phenomenal film by any means, but it is a refreshing change from the standard thriller/suspense fare, because it adds a truly intelligent and stylish bent to the genre. Other than children, (obviously) this film can be recommended to pretty much anyone, as long as they don't expect it to be the frenetic, jump-cut fest that is so prevalent nowadays. 'The Others' takes its time to get to its reveal, and it is worth every minute. 7/10Shelly",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"""THE OTHERS is a creepy film... that reminded me of an old 40s or 50s ghost story.""","The Others is yet another in a long list of great horror movies of the new millennium. I have always loved ghost stories, and this film has easily become my favorite ghost story ever. It's like one of the great old black and white ghost stories but better. It takes you on a slow, and uncomfortable ride.The story is simple. Grace lives in a mansion with her two children, both allergic to sunlight. That little twist on the story was just great. It makes the film completely opposite than other ghost stories, with Grace not afraid of the dark, and making sure to keep the light out, to save her children. This provides us with a very creepy, and dark atmosphere. Plus the mansion is also a creepy place. Not to mention, that in the film everyone who enters the house, must close the previous door, before opening the next.Nicole Kidman is perfectly cast in The Others. This may be one of her best performances ever (She was also great in this years Moulin Rouge). She was really very believable in the part. The two kids in this film were also fantastic. Alakina Mann as Anne was terrific. She played the bullying sister great. She and James Bently, who played Nicolas, really seemed like siblings. Awesome job by both. Fionnula Flanagan was also fantastic as Mrs. Mills. She really creeped me out, and I didn't know where she stood. Was she good or bad? I didn't know, but her acting was right on the ball.Alejandro Anemabar directed The Others with such atmosphere. The dark lighting is creepy, and the cinematography is beautiful. This guy's has got a bright future. To accompany all the atmosphere we get a fabulous score by the director, Alejandro Amenabar. The music is creepy, and really adds to the feel of a 50's ghost story. It also sets the mood of the film, and makes the scary scenes, even scarier. The score is fabulous. Not only did Alejandro Amenabar direct, and score, but he wrote the great, and well-developed screenplay.The Others is not without a great twist ending, that should shock everyone. I did not see it coming, and it's such an original concept to use in a ghost story. It worked well, and I was speechless after the film. Outstanding finale.This film is yet another horror film that proves that big budget special effects suck! This film is scary, and it only had a $17m budget. The Others did great at the box office, and deserved every buck it earned. It's a creepy film, that has its very scary moments. This is a film that will not be forgotten. It'll be stuck in my mind for a long time. This really reminded me of an old 40's or 50's film. I highly recommend this film to every fan of ghost stories.The Others: 10/10, A+",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Beautiful Drama Entangled in Intense Thrills and Chills,"It's funny that I see this movie the way I do, perhaps I'm more perceptive to little dramatic, human touches, but I saw this movie and was satisfied with it. In fact, I fell in love with it. This movie is chilling, very spooky, with a few moments that will make you jump, but it's a movie that works itself up, and by the end of the movie you feel scared, and like someone has zapped you a few times, chilly from inside out, but fulfilled.People have been comparing this to ""Sixth Sense"". Though the movie may share similarities, this stands on it's own. It's content is not trying to send a message, except for a universal theme that you want to grasp onto. There is historical and religious content, purely in context for the twists and turns and nuances to make this film so complete in every aspect. Everything works so well. This movie takes pride in each scene, and each is set up so that you get the most of it. Everything relates to everything, you are given clues the entire movie, but it's set up so masterfully the ending is the suprise you've been waiting for.The performance by Kidman and the two children are one of a kind. It's a realistic interaction between siblings and a controlling, dysfunctional, but loving mother. The acting and writing (the script) is so well done, it adds for scattered scenes that will, hopefully, stick around with you for a long time. There's this one beautiful scene in the movie, it's where Grace (Nicole Kidman) is hugging her son, and her daughter (who is slightly estranged from her mom) runs up and hugs her, and there this look of absolute release on the face of Grace. Another great scene is when Grace carries her rifle around the house (shoot the ghost!), and she's desperately trying to protect her house and children.  There are more like that, so keep your eyes open.The cinematography is innovative and brilliant, camera angles and the lighting set everything up so well. The lighting is very important as well, in fact, the subject of ""light"" is so well mixed into the story, the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does. There are times when you long for the darkness, just as the characters long for the darkness (due to a part of the plot including a health condition of the children, which serves a basis for the mental thrill fest to come). To finish off this concoction, try to listen to the score, because it's very fitting.This is more of a drama than a thriller, though it deserves to be a thriller (it's scary), but the power of it's dramatic side comes bursting through. This is a beautiful movie, it has overtones of a more serious side, and it's a movie that hardly belongs in  the horror section because of it's beauty, but it's too darned eerie, weird, and chilling to fit anywhere else.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The most shocking and suspenseful movie I have watched all my life,"I have to dislike it since it has scared me so much I'm pottying for the second time in 30 minutes. If you wanna be scared like that, watch this movie TILL THE END. If you don't wanna trouble yourself and stay in peace get the hell out of this movie and never think of watching it again. I got so scared, I started this movie at 11.50 PM in the night and I'm done with it at almost 2 in the midnight. It can't get any scarier than this. The scariest part I'm referring to isn't the whole movie, however, I don't wanna create any spoilers for you. Take care and love your loved ones more.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A proper scary tale of mystery,"World War II has just ended and a young woman with two children is waiting on an island in the British Channel for her husband to return home. Her housekeepers have mysteriously vanished without any hints and thus she's forced to hire new staff, three solemn locals who claim a past with the manor they're living in. And then the strange sounds start plaguing the family.The Others works as a horror film because it allows the atmosphere to build. There are very few jump scares, almost none at all, and most of the horror is build on the fact that the mother is slowly losing her mind and is forced to doubt her every decision. The situation itself is strange enough with a lone manor, two children being forced to live indoors for fear of the light and three closemouthed locals, but then the facts start revealing themselves and it ended up being quite different from what I'd imagined. But in the best way possible. It's a well-spun tale all around.Two special mentions for extra greatness. First to Nicole Kidman, whose acting abilities are still very much on top. Hers is the carrying performance of this entire film and she sells it flawlessly. From a stern although caring mother to a determined mistress of a manor to a scared soul trembling in the face of the unknown. The second mention goes to the soundtrack, which is a perfect blend of classical haunting and British pastoral music reminiscent of the good old days of the Empire. Definitely a soundtrack I would listen just because. And I in fact have.The Others is a very good horror film. One of the best I've seen in years and definitely a film worth checking out if you're looking for something a bit more psychological and mood-dependent.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Only good point is the ending,"'The Others' takes up way more time in the viewer's life than it deserves. It is only vaguely worth it for its trick ending, and let's face it, if it didn't have an ending like that there would be nothing to the film at all.Everything plods along so slowly, and there are quite a few things which seem illogical, for example how the daughter screams wildly at some things but is very matter-of-fact about sightings of intruders in the house.Because nothing much is happening, it is only inevitable that some major shock ending is coming, and quite frankly, while it is surprising, it's not really that mind-blowing, and certainly doesn't make the whole movie worthwhile.Could have been a lot better.",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Nicole Kidman rules!,"If I had to sum up this movie in a word, it would be ""chilling.""  The Others is a delightfully atmospheric suspense film.  It's tense, scary, and very memorable -- I don't think I'll ever forget the image of a terrified Nicole Kidman clutching her rosary beads around her shotgun as she tears down the halls of her dreadful Victorian mansion.Writer/director/composer Alejandro Amenabar creates a dark, dark atmosphere, in which you feel like you can't trust anyone.  Nicole Kidman, in her brilliant performance as Grace, is supposedly the ""heroine"" of the film, but as I watched the movie I found myself more frightened of her than rooting for her; steely and overbearing, with a hint of psychotic hysteria in her icy eyes.  And then the children, (held their own and even stole a few scenes from the more experienced players) were just hellishly creepy.  The little girl was one of the most ominous characters I have ever seen in a film.  And the servants (who were also finely played) will keep you guessing the whole way through.  Every time you think you have it figured out, some of the household help will pop up and throw the whole framework off-kilter.The real attraction in this film is Nicole Kidman, following up her bravura performance as Satine in ""Moulin Rouge"" with a woman teetering between insanity and iron control.  Grace has so many layers, and Kidman reveals almost all of them through her face.  The film is anchored by her presence, and she plays off the other actors extremely well -- note the tense relationship she has with Anne, her daughter.  When the two lock eyes, it's like watching two trains crash head-first into one another.The only disappointment in this movie is the ending, which is slightly anti-climactic.  When you get to it, you'll be satisfied, and it ties up everything that's happened in the movie up to that point quite well.  But it seemed almost anti-climactic, and I was left feeling a little bit let down.Overall, I gave The Others a 9/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Perfect.... a master at work,"Alejandro Amenábar is a very young and talented director, born in Chile and raised in Spain. He revolutionized Spanish cinema when he arrived on the scene with Thesis, at only 24 years of age. The came Abre los ojos, a very powerful second film that immediately put him aside some of the leading directors there, like Pedro Almodóvar, Carlos Saura, or Fernando Trueba. The others is only his third film and you can now see a hint of who may become one of the best around in a couple of years (he's only 29).The best comparison I can make of this film is to a piece of clockwork. Precise, exact, nothing is gratuitous or excessive.... What a subtle charm this film works on you as a spectator. The screenplay is one of the best of this genre I have seen in the last few years, very carefully revised and misleading, yet at the end everything makes perfect sense, not the mention on the second time you watch it.It is true that many of the film's features and details may be traced to classic films of the genre, but there is nothing wrong with that. The director himself said it was an homage to directors like Alfred Hitchcock (to whom he has been compared somewhat prematurely.... he may reach such height but he still has a long road to walk). That is one of the great things about the film; it takes the best of the genre, the best that has been made by the best directors... it's a film lover's delight.I had never thought Nicole Kidman could have been at the height of the project, as I really have never considered her a great actress. All I can say is I am still dumbfounded by her extraordinary performance... really, a large percentage of the film's success can be related to her. Sober and discreet when needed, yet grand all the same... It does remind some of the most elegant names of classic Hollywood cinema like the Bette Davis of All about Eve or the Katharine Hepburn of The African queen. But it would be really selfish to give her all the credit when she was supported by an extraordinary cast. Fionnula Flanagan (the sweet old lady from Waking Ned Devine) is trully magnificent as the governess, Mrs. Mills, and very surprising performances of a mute and an old gardener are given by Elaine Cassidy and Eric Sykes. The children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) are also fantastic.Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamín Fernández and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people.I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, La stanza del figlio, The shipping news, The hours and Italiensk for begyndere, but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 10/10 is really fair for a film that has it all, a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of big-time projects that waste his potential.It is a film to feast on.. to savour, to enjoy, to remember....",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Rather Effective,"I watched THE OTHERS simply because Christopher Eccleston in it , a future DOCTOR WHO in a scary movie , now this I've got to see , but to be honest Eccleston's role is little more than cameo while the always consistent Nicole Kidman isn't the real star of the movie - It's writer/director Alejandro AmenabarFrom the opening shots where the servants arrive at Grace Stewart's house I had the story pegged as to where it was going . Grace is an absolute nutter isn't she ? But then the story twists and turns a little and then I thought she might be a victim , I mean these servants ... But the story keeps twisting along nicely so that the script is one step ahead of the audience . There is a slight problem though if you're familiar to Amenabar's work , especially ABRE LOS OJOS and that is that he's a master of the shock twist ending and I thought with the appearance of Eccleston's Charles Stewart half way through the movie I had the story sussed . I actually did work out how he fitted into the story and was correct in guessing his fate but I never believed in what the twist ending was so well done Senor AmenabarThere is a problem with this type of story and THE OTHERS is no different in that respect - You can only enjoy the movie once since you know the shock twist at the end when you see it a second , third , fourth time and there's another very successful film ( No clues but you'll know the one I'm talking about after you see this ) that has the same idea which means comparison's are inevitable , but it's difficult to compare to one another . Certainly THE OTHERS has a more creepy atmosphere and probably a better pace and cast with special mention going to Alakina Mann as Anna who plays her role as a totally convincing horrid brat , nice to know Amenabar has resisted the temptation to portray the children as sugery sweet little cherubs which is often the case in Hollywood movies , you might not believe this but THE OTHERS in fact is a Spanish film",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Alejandro Amenábar's mind-bending psychological horror thriller with a superb twist.,"The Others (2001) :
Brief Review -Alejandro Amenábar's mind-bending psychological horror thriller with a superb twist. Set in the closure period of World War 2, the film tells the story of a woman and her two young, photosensitive children who experience supernatural phenomena in their large manor after the arrival of new servants. The trio has been keeping the house dark, all curtained, and all rooms locked (the other room cannot be opened until the previous one is locked). The mother is trying to protect her children, and the servants are helping, as it seems. The daughter hears voices and communicates with ""the others""/""the intruders,"" but the mother wouldn't believe. She also hears voices and gets hard on children sometimes. So, the entire buildup is intriguing and scary. It does have those creepy moments, those frightening jump-me-out moments, but not much into the spooky zone. Yet the film grabs your attention because of the gothic touch to the storyline. The witch, the photographs, the graves, and the previous family-all these things create curiosity. It did remind me of a certain film, but I wouldn't spill the name and spoil the twist. And you get involved in the narrative. The director plays his trick in the end when things are looking to settle in a mainstream way and suddenly gives you a mind-bending twist. A few smart movie buffs would predict it, but the majority of audiences will be in for a surprise. Nicole Kidman rules the entire movie with her rock-solid performance. She is the soul and body of the movie, and such a beautiful one. The kids, Alakina Mann and James Bentley (despite that white face), have done so well and looked so mature that you just can't believe that they are child artists, not adults. Fionnula Flanagan is terrific as the main servant. The background score, visuals, screenplay, and direction come together very well to take you on a thrilling ride at a haunted mansion for 100 minutes and leave you stunned for a while.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Suspenseful, stylish horror film ***/****","The others ***/****""The Others"" is a suspenseful horror film unlike many these days. Most are concerned with blood and gore, teenage girls getting naked, body count, and not scary. ""The Others"" is atmospheric, spooky, bloodless, and carried by strong acting and fleshed out characters. Yet, it takes too long to make an impact and the final payoff is not as shocking as it should be.The plot is simple and not especially innovative (your average ghost story), but it seems fresh thanks to strong acting and a well-crafted, eerie atmosphere that rivals that of a Tim Burton film. Nicole Kidman is Grace, a beautiful young married mother who must raise her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) alone in their gigantic (actually, ridiculously large) mansion on a British isle, around the end of WWII. They are alone, for the husband and father has been at war and has not returned, and their housekeepers mysteriously vanished. Suddenly, a trio of friendly caretakers arrive one day. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) is the amiable old lady, Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) is a mute young girl, and Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) is the not-so-social gardener. However, there is a strange, arcane facet to the trio; they have little background and had no way of knowing that Grace was offering positions at her manor. Aside from this, Grace must deal with her children, who have a deadly allergy to light, which means that the house must be dark all the time, allowing for a spooky dark, shadowy ambience. Anna and Nicholas, most importantly, have been visited - by a family of ghosts. Noises - crying, piano music, and running - have been heard. And curtains that stop light from entering the house are opening and closing by themselves. The film is based around Grace's efforts to solve the enigma.I love the atmosphere of ""The Others,"" set in a nostalgic and ominous 1940's estate. Snowy mist blankets the grass and crisp fall leaves. Murky waters of a lake border the chateau. Elegant furniture, polished marble and wood floors, neatly-woven blankets, tautly fabricated furnishings of wood and olive green cloth, coal black German sedans, lightly wrinkled sweaters and jackets are all seemingly authentic from the era. One spectacular and tense scene has Grace haplessly stumbling through an impenetrably thick ocean of milky fog that weaves through overhanging trees and a ground of crunchy bronze and russet leaves.The action takes a while to get started up, which is a major negative. This is due to the director, Amenabar, spending time to develop an involving plot, 3-D characters, and the aforementioned décor. While Amenabar succeeds in those respects, we find ourselves wishing something would happen. Many people will easily become bored, feel tempted to sleep or leave, etc., but I, while not exactly enthralled by that point in the film, was still enjoying it.When we finally are treated to doses of suspense and chills (not so much horror and terror), it is satisfying. You most likely will find yourself on the edge of your seat or huddled in a ball anxiously awaiting the potentially fatal results of Grace's investigation. This is not so much because you care about her character, but really because you expect a sudden scream and heart-stopping outburst of maniacal ghosts. Most scenes are chilling, including the door shutting in the piano room, the old lady in the white dress, and the final chaotic conclusion. However, I can not say that I was truly horrified and paranoid from this film, unlike ""The Sixth Sense,"" where I was freaked out for months. I was still very entertained.I must commend all the actors in the film, especially Nicole Kidman. The acting was down to earth and realistic, despite Nicole Kidman forced into saying some foolish lines (""Something.. Diabolical!). The two child actors, Mann and Bentley, were excellent in a fairly difficult role for children.Another important downside to the film was the ""shocking"" conclusion. While I must admit that I found it brilliant, it lacked the powerful punch I wish it had. I don't know why this is, it just isn't. I am disappointed at how much potential the ending could have packed and how little it did.Overall, I found ""The Others"" a highly entertaining thriller with magnetic milieus and plenty of startles.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Others,"A woman and her 2 children (husband at war) move to a large dark house, supported by 3 servants. It soon becomes apparent that they are not alone.Very much a slow burner that could have been agonisingly slow if it wasn't for a tour de force and utterly compelling performance by Kidman. Everything is extremely creepy rather than scary with the entire supporting cast all playing their part in keeping it that way.So not for those who prefer their scares jumpy but producing enough judders to ensure it is up there with the best of ghost stories.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Disappointing,"I was very unsatisfied with this movie. Rarely were there parts that made you feel insecure or scared. Sure I jumped maybe once or twice, and the setting was a little eerie, but I was never scared. The previews made this look as if it was ""the sixth sense"" meets ""what lies beneath."" Acting was good, and the plot had a foundation to build on, but it was built upon poorly. This story could have been much better than it was. Good main idea, but in the end the two didn't work out together. The ending was unsatisfying, but I'll leave that for you to find out yourself. This movie could have been good, had some more thought been put into it. Good idea, but more jumpy scares and a more explained ending are highly needed. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"What a twist!!! Scary to the last moments, specially at the last moments","First of all, i have to say that this year (2001) is the one that established Nicole Kidman as a superstar, she was an ""A"" actress, but here she became ""A+"", first and mainly with Moulin Rouge and then with this superb movie, i have to say that i saw a few people who gave this great movie a 10, i rate it with a 10 only because there is nothing higher, but i'm sure it deserves a lot of credit.And i have also seen many people complaining of the ""borrowed storyline"" (Comparing ""the others"" with ""Sixth sense""), bah they touch the same topic of life (and death actually), but this one has a more religious view, and makes you think a lot about that.Nicole did a great job in this movie, nobody can't deny it, her role as a lovely but at moments almost gone crazy mother of 2 was a dualistic and strange thing that fitted perfectly well in the story. All the supporting actors did a great performance as well.The plot, the plot, i think it couldn't have been better, i don't want to tell you anything about it, so you can have the surprise i had when i first saw it, but the best of all is that you are almost as surprised the first time you see it than the second, and the third, and the fourth...... You just want to see it again, because you experience a feeling that only a few, but a few few movies give you; a strong chill crosses your whole body, it is fear, but you like it anyway, it is a fear that awakes curiosity, curiosity for what is happening next...And what a spectacular, but necessary addition is the environment of the movie: an old mansion at the times of War world II, permanent darkness and haze, dead-like servants, photosensitive children so that the house had to be kept in an absolute darkness, no electric light........could it be more scary?? I don't think so.And by the way, this is a proof that a movie doesn't need amazing special effects, even more, i think this movie doesn't even have special effects, it is all in the way the story is told, nothing more....and nothing less, something that seems to be hard these days.........But i'll stop talking, if you are reading my comment, just stop and go to your nearer video shop and buy it, or rent it at least..........you won't be disappointed..............believe me.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Best of the best,"This is one of the best movies that I've seen for so many times that can't even count. The mood, acting, colours, music is just amazing. Mysterious, spooky and intense at some parts. Nicole Kidman was just absolute star in this movie. One of my favourite movies ever",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Fairly decent and original concept.,"I'll have to admit that I put off watching this movie despite being told by several friends that it was pretty good and worth checking out. That's mostly because ""scary"" movies usually turn out to be nothing but crap riddled, cheap thrill fests with terrible acting by actors just looking for their next handout...not to mention directors that care nothing about the progress of their careers. That and the slew of B- horror/thriller movies that seemed to come out very close together along with this movie made me a little apprehensive. However, I was pleasantly surprised.First off, I'd like to say that I have yet to see The Sixth Sense, so I cannot comment on any similarities between the two films that I have heard exist.Grace (Kidman) and her two young photosensitive (X.P.) children live in a sprawling old house together in England in the 1940's and await the return of their father and husband who went off to fight the Germans in WWII. As a result of the children's very rare and dangerous skin condition, all of the house's curtains must be shut during the day and all of the doors must be closed and locked to prevent any accidental solar exposure to the children. Despite the warnings from her children and new found servants, strange things begin to happen in the house which Grace chooses not to accept or investigate...partly because of her zealous religious beliefs which leave her closed minded and ignorant to things outside her psychological realm of thinking. Sooner or later, she will have to come to terms with what's going on...Kidman's acting is admirable in this movie, and although I usually have a hard time enjoying her films, I felt she did a very decent job here. I think she was born to play a stubborn, hard nosed, uptight tart, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. I especially enjoyed the acting performances from both of the children. Both are talented child actors and were definitely helped by the script which captured what it's like to be a child. I was constantly reminded of my own childhood amongst the belittling and teasing between the two, and of course the naive and adorable fears. The film is shot beautifully and has a lot of atmosphere, partly due to the fact that since the children are photosensitive, the house must always be dark, and the director definitely likes to play with that. There's something else that helps the film's atmosphere as well, the fog, which obviously adds to the general spookiness. But I'll leave that one alone as it plays an important role herein. The score helps as well, and is well placed and executed.Overall, I found this to be a very respectable and enjoyable film in almost all respects, and I no longer consider Kidman a pretty face begging for nude scenes. I felt it was very well thought out, and if it weren't for a minor plothole involving Grace's husband, I would have ranked it higher.Easily a solid 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Others,"""Grace"" (Nicole Kidman) lives in her almost blacked-out stately pile on Jersey where her two children ""Nicholas"" (James Bentley) and ""Anne"" (Alakina Mann) are hyper-sensitive to light. When her staff mysteriously abscond, she has to employ a new housekeeper ""Mrs. Mills"" (Fionnula Flanagan), and together they must ensure that the children are always locked into a room with no access to any windows that are not shrouded by thick curtains. The suddenly she hears a noise. Maybe a voice, even? She searches in vain but these odd occurrences start to multiply. Their usually fastidious household routines start to unwind, doors are left unlocked and the children start telling their mother of people moving around the house - folks that she cannot see! Just what's going on? Are these happenings connected with ""Mills"" and the new staff? Great news when husband ""Charles"" (Christopher Eccleston) returns from the War - shellshocked and distant, or then again - does he actually return at all? ""Grace"" is becoming increasingly paranoid. She can't tell what's real and what's not - and her children are only fuelling her fears! Although way darker and more sinister, this actually reminded me a little of the ""Amazing Mr. Blunden""! A ghostly story that uses children as a conduit between what might have been, or is, or may yet to be. The young Bentley and Mann deliver effectively here as director Alejandro Amenábar uses the dark and creaky house, extensive and frequently misty grounds and a creative sound effects mixer to create a genuine sense of menace. It's very hard to be innovate with this genre, there's just so much we have all seen before, but Kidman paces herself well here delivering a story that's not so predictable as we might have expected.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"As it seems, most 2000's horror movies they're so GOOD","First of all, the plot of the movie was very interesting and mysterious, even though I didn't really had high expectations about that movie. Because, I thought it was gonna be just like every other paranormal horror movie. Eventually, that movie was way better than I had imagined! The storyline was very well written, kinda innovative and everything was well-explained. The characters were very interesting and well-developed. The filming location was only one, just a big old creepy house in the middle of nowhere. In my opinion, it was a very creepy movie and there were some scary jumpscares during the movie. The casting was nice and their acting was descent (especially, Nicole's Kidman acting). The plot twist was definitely unexpected and it was revealed in a really shocking way. The ending scene was kinda emotional and gladly, it was well-explained.

The Story Of Things That Go Bump In The Night...,"To appreciate this film to it's fullest, you need to watch it in the dark by the light of a roaring and flickering fire. Right from the outset, the writer and director, Alejandro Amenabar, sets a chill in your bones. He does this by setting the story in a mansion that is perpetually surrounded by dark grey fog. You can practically feel the frost and dampness in the air as the new servants walk up the path to the front door. Later, this frisson is enhanced by the strange, and possibly paranormal events affecting the family.The Others is a slow burn of a chiller. I like the way Amenabar uses the characters to bring the viewer into the story. You can relate to each in little ways. Though the main character of Grace, Nicole Kidman, is aloof, distant, and cold you know that she loves her children and will do anything to protect them... though there's something not quite right...Mrs Mills, Fionnula Flanagan, is the matriarch of the new servants. She's as strong-willed as Grace and won't take any nonsense from anyone... not even her mistress. At times, this creates conflict giving the audience more to meat to sink their teeth in to. With her chats to the other staff, you begin to realise that they know something, but what?There are more than enough unanswered questions to keep you watching and wondering what is going on in the house? Could it the children? Is it a stranger? Or maybe it's more paranormal?Amenabar takes everything at a slow pace and utilises this to build a creepy ambience and atmosphere. He also has a deft hand at using shadows and light. Too many times, directors go too far and drop a cloak of darkness over everything. Amenabar keeps everything lit. You can see facial expressions, which is great to show and build horror, doubt, fear, anxiety. While in the darkened background, you see a silhouetted humanlike figure pass a window. Eerie as hell.The movie is not a gross-out bloodfest of a horror. It is a haunting and chilling ghost story. So if you don't like this style of horror this flick is not for you. However, if you prefer a story and film to chill your nerves, and run its icy fingers over your soul, then give this well written and filmed movie a watch.Though I did guess the twist in the ending well before the climax when I originally watched this, back in 2002, it has taken me until now to watch it again. I still enjoyed it but not so much. The Others could be the kind of movie you pull off the shelf every twenty years or so. Not because it's awful, but because it's good and memorable. I hadn't forgotten enough to enjoy it more.With that in mind, If you've not watched The Others, I recommend you give it some of your time. It's both entertaining and thought-provoking, and well worth a look-see.Now, turn on those lights and come upstairs to the room at the top, and see where this ghostly tale landed in my rankings in my Absolute Horror and Dramatisation Of Life Lists.Take Care & Stay Well.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Ghost Story With An All Too Predictable Twist,"This is ranked in the top 250 on IMdB? Does it gain this ranking on the basis of Nicole Kidman's dull performance or because of the completely predictable plot twist that I had figured out well before the halfway point of the movie?Well, others are entitled to their opinions, of course, but I found it difficult to keep at this one. It was a pretty routine ghost story in many ways (except for the predictable plot twist that I won't describe because trying to figure it out might be the only thing that would make this worthwhile for some folks) which means that since the genre has been done to death (no pun intended) it wasn't particularly frightening, unless strange noises from upstairs, and piano playing when no one's at the piano and doors slamming into Nicole Kidman's face frighten you.Ho hum is the best way to describe this effort, which (I'm feeling generous) I'll give a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A Really Good Film, But I Think It Loses Something Along the Way","A woman and her two children live in a large house, waiting for the father to return. A maid, a gardener and a nanny arrive to help take care of the large house. But some others arrive, too -- a group that believe the house if rightfully theirs. This house is haunted! Nicole Kidman stars. Tom Cruise produces. It's tough to say how much of this film is due to their involvement and how much is due to just being a good movie. Certainly the success and nominations came from Kidman appearing (any other actress and this film would have faded into quick obscurity). But it's still artsy and I like that about the movie.I really can't talk about this film because there's twists and I want to mention them to really give a good overview. I knew about the twists when I sat down to watch this, which I think took something out of the film for me. Which leads me to think this film would not be half as good on a second or third viewing. My colleague in the movie review business, The Butcher, listed this as a must-see horror film. And it ranks at the bottom of the Internet Movie Database's Top 50 horror films, which is still respectable. I guess I don't think it's as good as they make it out to be.The ""horror"" elements are pretty much just thumps, bumps and people who might be ghosts that we don't really ever see (they always leave the room before the camera enters). So, it's not a scary film. The house and costumes are beautiful, for what that's worth... but not scary.Go ahead and watch this one. I think it's more a drama than horror, but that's not a reason not to watch it, I suppose. Strong acting everywhere, and the kids are fun if for no other reason than they have interesting accents. I suspect they'll never get another acting job again (especially the boy). Not one of my favorites, but good nonetheless.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Nicole Kidman in particular was fantastic in portraying her character with so much emotion which really helped to convey the deep issues of the movie.

Finally, an eight year old could have predicted the ""big exciting TWIST"" at the end.One good point: The creators didn't use a lot of gore to make up for the lack of imagination.

"Creepy movie  builds taut by showing  virtually eerie images ,  unsettling score and  evocative cinematography","Thrilling and surprising story full of chills , plot twists , intrigue and excitement . The movie opens with Nicole Kidman, in voice-over, reading a story. She begins with the words, ""Now children, are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin."" As a woman named Grace Stewart who lives in a darkened old house with her two photosensitive (it is very strange with roughly a thousand people in the world that have it) children (the disease they have is an actual disease known as Xeroderma Pigmentosum). Grace , whose husband (Christopher Eccleston) has never returned from the war , becomes convinced that her family home (the house - supposedly on the island of Jersey - is actually located in the north of Spanish , in Las Fraguas , Cantabria , Palace of Hornillos) haunted while overprotecting her two young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley were cast after an intensive search that encompassed 5,000 children). They will live alone there with oppressive, rare and almost religious rules , until she needs to hire a group of servants (Eric Sykes as Mr. Edmund Tuttle , Elaine Cassidy as Lydia and Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Bertha Mills) for them .The motion picture displays genuine chills , suspense, mystery and dark atmosphere with a twisted finale . Packs excellent creation of tension , thriller , emotions and terror . It's an exciting , bizarre film ; skillfully written and proceeded by Alejandro Amenabar and turns out to one of the most unusual Spaniard suspense movie ever made and certainly one of the most unsettling .The basis for this movie is an episode of the British series 'Armchair Theatre' called 'The Others' made in 1970 and remade as a movie called 'Voices' in 1972 , this version is more elaborate but the story is the same. ¨Los Otros¨ comes from a peculiar cross-section of production cultures ; it stars an Australian woman playing an Englishwoman ; it was written and directed by a Spaniard, backed by Americans, set in Jersey but filmed in Spain. Plenty of twists and turns , the strange images deliver the excitement united a thrilling musical score by the same Alejandro Amenabar . He along with screenwriter Mateo Gil appear in one of the photographs of dead people . Furthermore , Alejandro also wrote the interesting plot , embarking into the phantasmagorical, psychological or even quasi-surrealist story . Intelligent edition, special use of luxurious sets by Benjamin Fernandez and slick utilization of shock images make this one, a magnificent film . Colorful and glowing cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe which heightens the suspense . This was the first film ever to receive the Best Film Award at the Goyas (Spain's national film awards) with not a single word of Spanish spoken in it and his film went on after its release , to become Spain's biggest grossing domestic film of all time. The film opened in the US at number 4 in the box office charts and stayed around that figure for its initial run. Seven weeks into release it actually climbed up to the number 2 spot.The picture was very well directed by Amenabar in his third movie, after he achieved various hits . Since his perhaps best-known early short-film ""Himenóptero"" in 1992, in which he directed , produced, acted and wrote the script and the music, Amenábar progressed and reached his first commercial success in 1996 with ""Thesis"", Amenabar was 23 when he directed this his feature debut , a film which undoubtedly showed that a major new director had arrived on the scene . And ¨Abre Los Ojos¨ that was remade in Hollywood by Cameron Crowe as Vanilla Sky (2001), starring Tom Cruise who in ¨The others¨ was executive producer along with Paula Wagner and this marked the last collaboration between Cruise and Nicole Kidman prior to their divorce . ¨Los Otros¨ (2001) was released a few months prior to Vanilla Sky (2001), the American remake of 'Alejandro Amenabár''s Abre Los Ojos (1997). Ironically, it starred Nicole Kidman's then estranged husband Tom Cruise . ""Los Otros"" confirmed his arrival in the cinematographic world and is Amenábar's first English language film and was the highest grossing Spanish film in the all-time worldwide box office history . In all his films Alejandro also writes the script and the music, as well as composing the music for other films , most notably ""Butterflies tongue"" (1999). He subsequently directed ¨Mar Adentro¨ with the Oscarized Javier Bardem and finally the epic/historical ¨Agora¨ with Rachel Weisz . Rating : Better than average . Essential and indispensable watching .",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A very good horror film with a spectacular conclusion,"When I first heard of The Others, I honestly was that not interested in watching it, it's premise seemed like a generic horror flick and the plot about a mother living with her photosensitive children alone in a large house or mansion sounded as generic as it gets. How many horror movies we have seen with families living in an abandoned Haunted mansion? The Others didn't seem that different even if the children were suffering from a rare illness or disease, it became hard for me to distinguish the Others from your average generic horror flick. All that was until I actually watched this great film was absolutely mesmerized with it.The film starts out slow, as you are introduced to the characters and the new servants are hired to work in the house and you are introduced to the children and find out about the rare disease they suffer from. As the plot unfolds and the film moves on, events start to unfold, some weird incidents and noises start to occur in the house making the mother, the children and the servants realize that they are not alone in the house, making them believe it is haunted. The plot keeps on unfolding when the unforeseen twist occurs in the end, which I honestly did not see coming at all. It was shocking and was so well handled and executed that it is in my opinion one of the best scenes in horror films even though the scene in retrospect is not that scary but it is the shock factor that makes that scene so great to watch.Performance wise, Nicole plays Grace, the mother of the two children perfectly, she is strict towards her children and tries to discipline them, but is also well protective of them and loves them deeply, she is also depressed about being cut off from the rest of the world due to her children's condition. Bertha Mills who plays the nanny does a fantastic job in her role as a kind old lady but there is something that always remains mysterious about her especially in the later part of the film where she behaves oddly and it seems like that she is up to something with the other servants.The boy who plays Nicolas was actually good in his role, a kid who is scared, and is a sort of a momma's boy who is deeply attached to his mother, and he is scared about the recent haunting in the house. That brings me to Alakina Mann the girl who play's Ann. She received nominations for her performance in this film and it is very well deserved. It is a one of best performances a child artist has done in a horror film, she can be funny, she can be mysterious and creepy, and can also play a serious role. All of which she does in this film. Ann's character was extremely deep and the actress who played her did her job as perfectly as she can. The rest of the cast also performs well and serve well in their roles.Overall, before the watched the Others, I was thinking about watching just another horror film but I was so wrong, this is a fantastic film, with several scary parts and creepy scenes, a slow but well developed plot and a spectacular twist which will leave you in awe and leave you talking about it for days, and make you watch the entire film entirely from a different perspective.Overall Rating: 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Effectively spooky and gloomy presentation...story itself is less satisfying,"Atmospheric but somewhat unsatisfying tale of a woman and her two sick children in 1945, living in a gloomy mansion in the Channel Islands, doesn't offer many new tricks in the haunted house genre (even the colorless title warns you of that). Writer-director Alejandro Amenábar has visual imagination and panache to spare, yet his screenplay (which has an overlay of James' ""The Turn of the Screw"") is stuffed with red herrings that only serve to weigh down the ultimate explanation. Nicole Kidman is imposing and impenetrable as the proprietress of the manor who can't seem to explain the absence of her husband--and who keeps her precocious kids out of the sun because they're allergic to ultra-violet light. Kidman is one of the best actresses we have today; her film selections continue to be intriguing (she isn't afraid to take risks, which is clear with her work here), and she is also very lovely to watch. Fionnula Flanagan is flawless as the new housekeeper who has arrived mysteriously (with a mute assistant and a gardener in tow) after the previous staff has vanished into the night. Amenábar stages a grand scene near the end in a graveyard, but he's less successful at paring down the dross and giving viewers a really good fright (instead, piano music at night drives Kidman into hysterics, while her taunting daughter teases her endlessly with facetious comments). The picture does work on occasion, mostly due to the acting and the handsome production. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Leave us in peace,"The Others is a psychological ghost story. Nicole Kidman plays a mother named Grace who lives a reclusive life in the aftermath of WW2 with her two children on the island of Jersey. Soon after taken in some new servants after the previous one vanished. Soon strange occurrences begin to happen which leads to the belief that the house might be haunted. This is a ghost story that does not abide by the traditional formal. In the sense that you just have a Ghost and strange things being to happen with jump scares every other minute. The Others is a slow well-paced film that leaves you in suspense and curiously. This is primarily because of the cast who all give outside performances with such a small group of characters. Nicole Kidman is great giving off this sense of grief and in some ways kinda imitating. She has this very over-burden protective and routine of doing things, not just for her kids, but also clearly for herself for reason that is explained further in. S things begin to escalate you see how she goes from calm and compose to beginning to lose her gripe. However, it's not just her the kids also give good performances and are very entertaining and likable, especially the daughter and Mrs mill alongside Nicole play well off each other. The tone of the film is this very somber and eerie mystery from its music to the settings of the exteriors among the most fog. To the interiors of the house how the use of lighting from all these windows being covered Doors most of the doors locked is used to create this isolated feel as you are condemned to these grounds the whole movie.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
CLASSIC SCARY ASS MOVIE.,"Classic scary ass movie. No a single blood drop but yet, it manages to be scarier than many other horror movies. Even if it slow in parts and some of them are useless, the creative premise and shocking ending make up for it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Though scaries are not my favourite genre, there is no denying we have a new genius here","I do not usually go in for anything in the phantasmagoric line; even very few horror films have attracted my attention. This is primarily because I like theatre and cinema to be rather realist, I like it to say something about the world we live in, society, personalities, human values, and so on. I do not look for escapism as a source of entertainment, whether in books, on the stage or on the screen. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule - `Gormenghast' by Mervyn Peake, `The Lord of the Rings' by J.R.R.Tolkien (I am not referring to the film), and of course the universal `Cien Años de Soledad' by Gabriel García Márquez, among books, or Walt Disney's `Fantasia'. Such that the run-of-the-mill factory-produced science-fiction films generally do not attract me either - exceptions being Stanley Kubrick's `2001: A Space Odyssey' and Ridley Scott's `Bladerunner'.Alejandro Amenábar might change my preferences a little;  having seen `Abre los Ojos' (qv) only very recently, I was persuaded rather perfunctorily to go and see `Los Otros' the other night, and did not expect much from what seemed a priori to be merely a `ghost story'. Which is precisely what `Los Otros' turned out to be. But directed and written by a young fellow who also composed the music and seems bent on updating Hitchcockian traditions: Alejandro Amenábar is an extraordinary and highly talented young man. The curious mixture of British Actors with Nicole Kidman, recorded in English, but is a Spanish film, makes it evident that Amenábar had his sights aimed at America. However, the film was not shot on Jersey Island in the English Channel, but in a large `caserón' a few kilometres inland from the Cantabrian Coast in Santander, Northern Spain. The photography at all times, but especially through the fog, is spectacular, but Javier Aguirresarobe is already a past master, having already filmed `Secretos del Corazón' (qv), `La Niña de tus Ojos' (qv), `El Perro del Hortelano', `Beltenebros' and `La Fuente Amarilla' (qv), among other titles. Nicole Kidman is pretty good; she plays the part of a mother of two children who is somewhat nervous, even hysterical, as she goes through the house opening and closing the doors as she goes. `Her' two children are very good: Alakina Mann and James Bentley play their parts with a good balance between naturalness and interpretation without exceeding too much in the latter.And the music is extraordinarily good as it accompanies the different scenes, never overdoing any set leit-motif, with some fine orchestration - although in this I think Amenábar had a helping hand from others. There were moments in which subconsciously some influence could be felt from John Barry perhaps, and I also noted a brief passage that seemed to have roots in the Portuguese `fado'. As Rolling Stone Magazine says, this is a psychological thriller; a little in the Clive Barker style but without all that gore, or even certain concepts from some of Stephen King's works in which `the thing' itself is not so ominously present. But, certainly, if Hitchcock WAS the master, surely we have here a new one? Make space over there at Hollywood - a new little genius is about to cross the Atlantic.

Luckily another friend of mine borrowed me his DVD.As I had been very excited at the beginning, I was bored beyond believe while watching this one. It is so in lack of story, that even the brilliant twist at the end could not change my misery. Sure, technically it is great, the twist is awesome, but that does not make a masterpiece. Especially not, if the first 90 minutes are boring and stupid as hell.  The music is not bad, but when it rises up, the actress turns around and nothing happens, so I just asked myself: So what? By the way: Nicole Kidmans performence is breathtaking. I hope, that someday this gifted woman receives the Oscar she deserves so badly. Becaus in my opinion she was passed over for: To die for, Eyes wide shut(supporting) and of course: Moulin Rouge! But back to this movie.Some cinematography and directing are just selfish. The plot with the husband (a totally give away of Christopher Ecclestone) could have been cut out. It is just repeating the ""pillow-story"" the third time and adds nothing new to the picture. But most responsible for killing ""The Others"" is the weak writing. But I don't want to make you think that everything is bad in this movie. So here are the good things: Sometimes great atmosphere is built up. Sometimes destroyed by the selfishness of the cinematographer and the director. Same thing with the direction itself. The music is really good composed and arranged, but sometimes unnecessary (as read above). The performances are all very good and believeable. But all in all, and in this case I keep it with Martin Landau in ""Mistress"": I think, the story is an important element!So, if you like nice pictures, good acting and a brilliant twist: Go and rent it! So many people liked it.But for me: I give it 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Spooky to say the least,"Grace runs a tight ship and does not believe her daughter when the daughters tell her she sees others.

Who or what are the others? Are they helpful or are they harmful? Does it make a difference? Is anyone going to do something about it?

THIS IS A REAL HORROR FILM !,"I've just came out of the movie theater where The Others has been running for two months. Of course it took a little time before I could put my ideas back in order again, so I could write. This is a real horror film ! Finally someone understood that special effects and other r tricks are fine, but if you lack imagination and talent ( I'm talking to you, Jan De Bont) you will go nowhere. The superb Amenabar's script is clean and effective, grabs us by the neck , forces us to watch every second of it and slaps our face with a real surprising finale. In the meantime,if you can, notice the fantastic settings, the incredible cinematography (90% of its scenes are inside the dark mansion, with minimum lightning) and the performances of the cast. Nicole Kidman is in 99% of the scenes, and surely no actress today can match her combining beauty and talent. Impressive Fionnula Flanagan must be nominated best supporting actress this year. When they are together in the screen you cannot look elsewhere. Do not miss it !",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A timeless ghost story, maybe the best one.","A great horror movie, if you can stomach the slow pace necessary to develop a ghost story without either gore or action, instead thriving on the eeriness of the unexplained rifts in the fabric of reality Nicole Kidman's character experiences. The characters are endearing and the setting timeless, so that this movie may well be watchable a century from now.Unfortunately, it doesn't necessarily lend itself to additional viewings once the overarching secret is known after the first viewing. I've watched it two times but had to give up the third time - it is that reliant on the big twist revealed at the end. Oh, and if you guessed the outcome before the end, unlucky you.The fact there happens to be at least one other well known film with a similar plot resolution doesn't make this movie bad, despite the allusions of some other reviewers. In fact, I would say The Others is the better movie, despite borrowing (intentionally or not).",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Well written supernatural horror movie,"This is a pretty well written supernatural horror movie that I have seen. The story is your standard supernatural movie with a family experience strange things happening in their home. But if you go deeper into the movie, you see a lot of clues on the reveal of the entire movie. It's interesting to watch the movie over the stuff that goes on in it and the explanation the characters give out throughout. The movie has an effective atmosphere with the music and tension it builds up throughout. Also, I like the gothic setting of the movie that has a nice atmosphere to it and gives off a vintage look to it. The twist of the movie is really interesting and creative on what it is and the whole explanation behind it. I do think the characters are done really well in this movie due to the screenplay and writing. Grace Stewart is a mother who hired a couple of workers and tried to take care of her kids. I really like the character due to Nicole Kidman's performance, who gives off a solid performance with her acting and how real she feels while performing as the character. Also, the character is done really well with her not believing until later and how she tries her best to raise her kids. Anne and Nicolas are her two kids, and Anne keep saying that she sees a ghost in their room. While both of them sometimes act like brats and get annoying, they do serve a purpose in the movie, and it's interesting how they have photosensitive where they can't be around sunlight.The Others is a well written supernatural horror movie that is interesting to watch and has a unique twist to it.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
deadly pace,"The key to a good ghost story is in the telling.  The pace has to be just right  not so leisurely that the audience loses interest, but not so fast that the intriguing details are lost.  There is a good, spooky story in this film, but the film takes too long to get to the resolution.   The performances are very good (Kidman is plausibly mad), and there are some legitimate shocks; there is zero reliance on bloody special effects. Unfortunately, by the time all is revealed, I was just bored.   This would have made an engrossing 30 minute Twilight Zone episode.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not your typical ghost movie.,"This is not your typical ghost movie, where Nicole Kidman stars as Grace Stewart, who retires with her two children to a mansion towards the end of the Second World War. Her children are photo and sunlight sensitive and she hires three servants to care for them and the house; however, strange things start to happen shortly afterward and Grace believes her house is haunted.Filmed in the Channel Islands, Spain, England and New York, this movie captures the brilliance and beauty of each place and the subtle aftermath of post-WWII. Alejandro Amenábar wrote and directed the movie, providing us with an eerie story full of mystery that will have you guessing where the plot turns and have you surprised at its unpredictability. Just the Mrs. Bertha Mills character, played by Fionnula Flanagan (who always look strange and mysterious to begin with), provides enough uncertainty and chills to the story, enhancing the overall suspense. However, there are some parts where the plot lines do not quite intertwine, which may confuse the audience, and is notorious in American ghost/horror movies.Kidman did a fabulous job in her role, nonetheless, providing enough drama to captivate the audience. It's a film full of surprises, which deviates it from many other ghost/horror movies with predictable plots.Grade B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Complete rip-off (plagiarism) of The Sixth Sense,"Possible plot revelations ... warning.This movie is an anemic rip-off of ""The Sixth Sense.""  While ""The Sixth Sense"" was original in its mood, plot, and shocking twist at the end, this movie robs that same device with a plodding, slow development and too quick wrap up at the end.  It is incredible that someone would even try to make this and open themselves up to such criticism.  ""The Sixth Sense"" also explained the ""doctrine"" behind the parallel spirit world while ""The Others"" fails to explain the ""why"" at all.  For instance, we know why the main character in ""The Sixth Sense"" could not tell he was the dead person, because ""dead people only see what they want to see.""  There is no such explanations for anything in ""The Others"" -- and then to top it all off the movie attempts to create sympathy for a paranoid schizophrenic child murderer.  Huh?!

Elegant and Hauntingly Beautiful,"'The Others' is one of the creepiest and most chilling supernatural horror films of all-time with an intricate narrative that builds unnerving tension, suspense and a palpable sense of dread and sets itself apart from other horror films of the era by relying on subtlety and restraint to evoke fear. This really is a first-rate horror masterpiece that still stands the test of time.The Plot = Set in 1945, and following the end of the second world war, a young woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) who lives a secluded live with her two photosensitive children on her darkened old family's estate in Jersey and soon enough a strange series of events begins to occur causing Grace to believe that the house may be haunted.The direction by Alejandro Amenabar is sublime as he allows the tangent to build methodically with its slow yet deliberate pacing while at the same time immersing the viewer into its otherworldly ambiance. What makes things even more terrifying is the fact that you never know what's gonna happen next with its many unsettling revelations and a shocking spine-tingling final act that's effectively well done. The Victorian mansion feels like a character within itself and gives a foreboding presence that looms over the production. At the heart of this film lies a compelling exploration of psychological depth which is something of a rarity in the horror genre and it really elevates this film to a level of sophistication and outstanding brilliance.The performances here are simply excellent with Nicole Kidman giving a tour de force performance as the deeply religious mother Grace, she adds depth and nuance to her complex role and delivers one of the very best performances of her career. Alakina Mann and James Bentley each gives brilliant performances as the two children. Fionnula Flanagan gives a strong turn as the mysterious housekeeper Bertha Mills and adds an engaging screen presence to the production.Overall 'The Others' is an elegant and hauntingly beautiful supernatural horror film for the ages and a perfect reminder that sometimes less is more.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I love it!,"I have a favorite movie adaptation of Henry James' ""The Turn of the Screw,"" but I hadn't watched it in a long time. I was worried that I might have been wrong about how good it was. However, I just watched it again, and I still really like it.The movie is a thriller, a family drama, and a psychological horror all at the same time. It has a twist like in M. Night Shyamalan's movies, which makes it even better. The director, Alejandro Amenábar, is really good at creating suspense and mystery, and the movie has a romantic and sweet feeling like Guillermo del Toro's movies. There are some scary moments that are really memorable.Nicole Kidman is great in the movie. Her character is mean at first, but becomes more interesting and sympathetic later on. The kids in the movie are also really good actors, especially James Bentley. Fionnula Flanagan is also really good at creating a creepy atmosphere.Overall, this movie is a good example of how to make a new story out of an old one.

"""Sometimes the world of the living gets mixed up with the world of the dead.""","FILM: 8.0
On my recent re-watch of The Others, I was reminded why this film continues to be a standout in the horror genre. Released in 2001, it holds up remarkably well today.Nicole Kidman delivers a captivating performance as Grace, a mother trying to protect her children from a mysterious presence in their isolated mansion. Her portrayal of Grace's increasing paranoia and desperation is both nuanced and chilling.Director Alejandro Amenábar masterfully builds tension throughout the film, creating an atmosphere of unease that keeps you on your toes from start to finish. The slow-burn approach pays off beautifully, allowing the suspense to simmer until it reaches a satisfying boil.What sets The Others apart from other horror films is its focus on psychological terror rather than cheap jump scares. The sense of dread is palpable, and the film's twist ending is both shocking and thought-provoking.The cinematography is stunning, with the dimly lit interiors of the mansion adding to the sense of claustrophobia and isolation. The use of shadows and darkness is incredibly effective in creating an atmosphere of dread.The supporting cast also deserves praise, particularly the child actors who deliver impressive performances despite their young age. They bring an authenticity to their roles that adds to the film's emotional impact. Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes also leave as lasting impression.While some may find the pacing a bit slow, I appreciate the deliberate build-up of suspense and tension. It allows for more character development and makes the payoff at the end even more satisfying.Overall, The Others is a masterclass in psychological horror that stands the test of time. With its gripping storyline, stellar performances, and eerie atmosphere, it's a film that will continue to haunt viewers for years to come.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.5

A great ghost story,"Amenábar knows what he's doing, that's for sure. The movie is gorgeous, with plenty of stunning visuals and beautiful scenery. Performance wise, Kidman is great (as usual), and surprisingly, the child performances were actually quite good, definitely a cut above the majority of other kids in movies. The story itself isn't so much ""scary"" as it is creepy and chilly. If you haven't been spoiled for this movie, it's best to just stay away from the internet until you've seen it if you want the best experience. Though it's not perfect, it's a movie I watch almost every year around Halloween, and I probably will for a long time. There's a coziness and a charm to it-a good, old-fashioned ghost story, the kind we don't see anymore.(Honestly, I'm surprised so many people haven't seen it. I didn't realize that this slipped under the radar for so many people, but if it did, it's definitely worth your time.)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Kidman terrific in great moody atmosphere,"It's 1945 Jersey, the Channel Islands. Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) is staying at a mansion with her two kids waiting for her husband. Mrs. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), Edmund Tuttle (Eric Sykes) and Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) come for work after the previous servants vanished. The children are photosensitive and can't be in direct sunlight. Grace is religious and over-protective with numerous strange rules. Then Grace hears strange noises and voices which her girl Anne says it's a boy named Victor and his family.This is a terrific moody ghost story. The twist is very nicely done.

Excellent movie!,"This is on my all-time, top ten best scary movies list. Nicole Kidman is incredible as a stressed- out mother trying to deal with two children who have a deadly light-sensitivity condition. In addition to having to live in a neverending existence of locking and unlocking doors and in no more light than lantern light, she has to deal with the possibility that her big English Gothic mansion is haunted by 'the others'. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The creepy-but you don't know why daughter-the housekeeper who seems aware of something but doesn't give it away-the poor mute maid and Kidman's perfect teetering on the edge performance all adds to the tension. What is beautiful and brilliant about this movie is they way it unfolds without allowing the audience to 'figure' out what's really happening. Why Kidman did not win an Oscar for this performance is beyond me. An absolutely brilliantly made movie!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not that surprising or clever but still an enjoyable and effectively chilling ghost story,"There are 50 doors in Grace Stewart's house and she insists each one must be locked before another is unlocked. Her two children (Anne and Nicholas) are photosensitive and the curtains must always be drawn before they enter the room. Together Grace and her two children live in constant pray that husband and father Charles will somehow return safely from the war. Into the house comes new staff  Mr Tuttle who tends the garden, the mute Lydia and housekeeper Mrs Mills. With her mother's strict teachings and religious slant, Anne confides in Mrs Mills about her sightings of other people, where Grace would punish her for such stories. However it is not long before Grace struggles to understand the noises she hears and things she sees.This review contains no spoilers but I would question why anyone would want to know more about this film before watching it; you know the genre and knowing more can only spoil it for you albeit slightly. I'm not sure why I never got around to seeing this film in the cinema but somehow it slipped my mind and I was surprised to find it on the television recently as it only seemed that it was out recently. Anyway, needless to say I watched it and at the start was a little put out by plot points which seemed to have been a little bit obviously forced in to provide the director with devices to play with (eg the darkness, the locked doors, the silence etc) but very quickly the film made me forget any reservations I may have had. The plot is a simple ghost story that is told with confidence throughout, with a consistently subtle touch from Amenabar; to me he marked himself out as being worth watching with Abre Los Ojos and this film has only made me sure that he can produce the goods. I didn't think the conclusion was as obvious (although it isn't as shocking as it should be) as others have said and, although it hardly shocked me, it was still satisfying to me  partly because it matched the quiet tone of the film.He plays well with the tools he has written for himself and also includes nice ""fake builds"" with the music and plays with our expectations to good effect. The lack of gore is a good thing and, as Japan continues to show us, sometimes unsettling juxtapositioning images can be even more effective without just sudden gore etc. I was effectively creeped out by the whole thing. Kidman is very well cast and she plays very well indeed  bring the sense of fear to the screen and encouraging the audience to feel the same as her. The child actors avoid being too cute and cloying and are part of making the film rather chilling. Support is very good from Flanagan and Sykes, but you do have to wonder why Eccleston bothered in a role that is pointless for the vast majority of the film.Overall this is an enjoyable film that is quite chilling and is basically just a simple ghost story. There are no major scares and none of it will take you by surprise even if you don't see things coming but it does what it does well and without fuss. Some viewers will have issues with elements of it  and rightly so, but generally it is a very effective little film that you will enjoy the less you know about it.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I love this movie,"This is one great movie! - Considering i feel that way DESPITE there being two children that play a major role is even higher praise (for me ... because children in movies - and especially children in horror movies is usually a black mark destined to fail) I love the atmosphere, the plot as such - and the acting (hm - alright, everyone ""except"" the little boy - who i wish had ha died a terrible and gory death, indeed) The movie does not step too deep into ""the usual"" horror tropes - like bad communication, splitting up or pointless jump scares that result in nothing (usually during the first act of almost every horror movie).Nicole Kidman is great and i always love Christopher Ecclestone. Actually the whole cast is great (yes, even the boy - i am not annoyed at his acting abilities - but at what role he has to play as a character) I also liked the conclusion of the story - i am not sure if this ""twist"" has been used before - but for me it was quite new, especially the ""tone"" of it.I have just recently re-watched it (2017) - and the movie has aged incredibly well (of course mostly because it relies on atmosphere and acting, and only on very low key effects (which seem to be mostly practical - or off screen anyway) i can fully recommend this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It reminded me of the 6th Sense(another weak movie), this is of course no accident as it seems like a lot of the ideas are blatently copied from 6th Sense. I thought this was gonna be a very scarey ghost movie with tonnes of ghosts running a muck killing and slaughtering, just general terrorizing and havok. I was to say the least, extremely disapointed.

There's also this feeling that the housekeepers know something that neither we or Grace knows yet. It's creepy how the house is always surrounded by fog.

Should have won an Academy Award,This is an excellent movie. How it did not win Nicole Kidman an award for best actress I will never know. I never guessed that Grace Anne and Nicholas were ghosts. I did guess Mrs Mills Mr Tuttle and Lydia though mostly due to their clothes especially Lydia's as she wore very old fashioned clothes for an 18? year old. I thought that Mrs Mills etc were in collaboration with Victor and his family while Grace and the children were still alive and being haunted. The old lady's eyes scared me even now when I watch it at home I close my eyes when she opens the wardrobe door. I would like to see a sequel of this made from the point of view of Victor's family.

Family discovers they are not alone in their old Victorian mansion.,"I liked this movie.  It wasn't great, and falls far short of the Sixth Sense, to which it is often compared, but it was still a good movie.  The scene is England, 1945, and revolves around a woman (Kidman) who has lost her husband to the war and is isolated in this mansion with her two children afflicted with a condition which makes them vulnerable to light.  The children must spend their lives in candlelight.The movie has a few surprises, and there will be no spoilers here. I will just comment that the movie moves rather slowly for the first two-thirds or so, but does pick up at the end and did provide me with some jumps.  You are rewarded in the end for allowing the movie some character and plot development.The acting is excellent, and I was impressed by the two children's performances.  Kidman was fine, as was whoever played the old lady servant (OK, I'm too lazy to look it up now).  The movie was more spooky than scary for the most part.  The scary parts are due more to timing and development than gratuitous violence (there is none of that here).My warning is that the movie is not for those with short attention spans, or for those who need a shock every two minutes to keep their attention.  This movie unfolds like a good book, introducing the characters and slowly giving you the stories behind the people and withholding most of the action until the end when you better understand who the events are happening to.  I gave it a 6/10, which, to me, says it is better than average.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Creepy but Poorly Paced,"A woman living in a dreary old house with her two small children encounters strange phenomena.

Performance by Nicole Kidman is terrific - she is on of the top actress in the world and it shows in ""The Others"" - she carries this movie. Directing was very good here - the pacing, music, cinematography are all great and they make this story very engaging to watch. And then there is the ending of this film, which I won't spoil, but will say it's a great one and one of the reasons why this movie delivers on multiple rewatches.Overall, ""The Others"" is great ghost story. It's not a horror fest in a mainstream way, but it's great spooky story and is just so much more then that.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Alfred is back,"and by that, I mean Alfred Hitchcock.  Just watched this for the first time, without knowing anything about it, on DVD on our home theatre system.  This movie makes full use of the back channels, so if you're just watching it on a regular TV, you're going to miss the full surround experience of hearing things go bump behind you.  The plot twists and music reminded both my wife and myself of Alfred Hitchcock.  I thought it was slow at first, but it just pulled us in a little more at a time.  Lovely scenery, and a reminder that you can make an interesting horror movie without gallons of gore.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow at first but worth the wait!,"I was really looking forward to this movie both because of Nicole Kidman's brilliant acting and also the storyline, I had see a preview at a movie a week ago.  For the first 30 minutes or more I was worried I built it up in my mind too much and would be disappointed but I was NOT!  I really only want to tell you that it was a terrific story and fabulous acting by all......I do want to say more than that because anything I say could spoil it for you.  The only thing I found which was remotely close to being a fault with this movie was the darkness it seemed to be shot in through out. It made sense that it appeared that way but as a movie viewer, I am just not accustomed to that.I would suggest that you do NOT drink before or during this movie because you really dont want to miss a second!  But popcorn is a great idea, just hold on tight to the bag!  :-)I think that Nicole may take home an Oscar for this film!!  I will applaud her if she does :-)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
** 1/2 out of ****,"Strong performance and good cinematography are the only real redeeming values in this film.  The plot really goes nowhere, trying to rely on only moderately creepy atmosphere.

The Others Serves Up Solid Suspense,"I had little idea of what to expect from The Others and was pleasantly surprised by what it delivered - an atmospheric, evenly paced, visually interesting, well acted tale of suspense. Its unusual to see Kidman in a horror film but she completely delivers here, as do most of the cast. No gore, no bloodshed, or gratuitous violence, but lots of creepy atmosphere and spooky vibes to keep the viewer engaged throughout. The art and set direction are very cohesive and well done, and the same can be said for the costumes, and sound. It's not exactly, but yet kind of a slow-brew suspense yards that unfolds gradually as it draws you in.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The perfect example of how to create a ghost story.,"The Others is one of my favourite horror films of all time. It has a good plot, it is subtle, it gives nothing away until the end and everything it does is relevant to the story. I would recommend viewing the movie twice to really appreciate everything that it does, you will miss many things upon first viewing and watching it twice will really enhance the experience.It is set in the early 1900's and the house, costumes and style are very well presented; they do a good job of transporting the viewer to that time. The story is all based within a mansion where a woman and her two young children live with their three housekeepers. Her two children suffer from a photosensitive disorder and are not allowed to be in direct contact with sunlight, this means that the house is constantly in darkness, offering a much more eerie experience. The daughter claims that she can see ghosts around the house, this is ignored by the mother at the start but before long she is questioning the matter herself. Is the house haunted?My main gripe with many horror films is that things are revealed too early on, in ghost stories you will see the ghost before any real suspense has been able to build. In my opinion the scariest things in horror films are the things that you don't see, the things that only your imagination sees. This is where The Others excels.The Others consists of around 6-7 characters with the majority of it being dedicated to Nicole Kidman, who does a fantastic job with a really convincing performance. She is a very mysterious character who seems extremely paranoid about her children's health and wellbeing; she appears as a woman who is on the edge of sanity. The whole supporting cast are fantastic and not one of them lets the casting down.The Others is a film in which you cannot say much about without the fear of giving anything away, but I will say one thing, the ending is spectacular. So many horror movies struggle to get the ending right, The Others shows its fellow horror flicks how it should be done. Its certificate is only an age 12 but in my opinion it is much creepier than many age 18 films I have watched. If horror movies are your scene then I would recommend this very highly.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What about AnOther?,"Gothic horror? No. mystery? Nope. Slasher? Not even. Just a dark, dreary film set in the Channel Islands in 1945.  Who better to give us a depressing thriller than America's sweethearts Nicole Kidman and (exec. Producer) Tom Cruise. This just may be the key to their split-up.Though this is not a frightening nail-biter it may engage you if you're the pulp fiction/gothic romance fan.  It's remarkably slow through the first hour, but the set and the classic characters do provide entertainment. The key to the film's fascination is its ability to keep you wondering who these Others are.  It provides a few moments of shock in the process but when you reach your destination you may find yourself looking for AnOther.Grace (Nicole Kidman) mother of two young children and mistress of the house opens the film with a frightening scream setting up audience expectation for something really eerie that really never materializes. Seems that the master of the house has gone off to war but forgot to return when it ended. Three stock characters from thousands of British films turn up to carry the tasks to keep the house together and we're given a tour of the house. See the kids, like the audience must live in darkness or they'll shrivel up like prunes in minutes. The house has no electricity or telephones and is lit by oil lamps at best. Heavy drapes cover the windows and heavy Catholic mysticism covers this family. Getting the idea that this isn't light entertainment?Lesser stars perform their roles admirably, the strongest of whom is Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan). I saw her last in `Waking Ned Devine' and her continued strong presence helps bring the film around its plot twist. Daughter and son are cute and annoying, dad returns in a fog and remains perplexed throughout his short appearance and the remaining two characters tread lightly on screen. If you don't like Ms. Kidman, don't come since her visage remains on screen through most of this film.All of the appropriate moaning, creaking, crying, shadows, frightening looks and terrorized kids can be found here. Nicole plays the part of a moralistic home schooler and this part may have been written with her in mind considering her religious convictions. You may think her paranoid but as events unfold, her fears are well placed. She's actually battling the Dyanetic demons and we expect Mr. Cruise (or maybe even Mr. Travolta) to step in as the embodiment of evil. But they don't. Though it's pretty predictable, it's worth your while as an atmospheric piece and if you're like me, you'll wonder about the derivation of the word `smother.' Though I doubt you'll be peeking behind your drapes to see if something is lurking, it's engaging entertainment for most of the family.CyCy",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Old-fashioned ghost story, rich with irony","THE OTHERS (Los Otros)Aspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS1945: While awaiting her husband's return from the war, a lonely young woman (Nicole Kidman) locks herself into their remote, fog-bound mansion to protect their children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) from a condition which renders them ultra-sensitive to natural light. But a number of strange occurrences lead her to believe the house may be haunted...Co-produced by Tom Cruise (Kidman's husband at the time) and filmed in Spain with an international cast, THE OTHERS marked the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, previously responsible for such high profile Spanish entries as THESIS (1996) and OPEN YOUR EYES (1997). Amenábar's film aspires to Jamesian sophistication, rejecting bombast for subtlety at every turn, as Kidman's troubled heroine struggles to identify the source of her supernatural experiences (are they real, or just a figment of her overheated imagination?). Kidman is too young for the role, and lacks the necessary gravitas, but she plays it with a fair degree of brittle dignity, particularly in her scenes with Mann, the most confrontational of her children, who is either a malicious prankster intent on frightening her younger brother with manufactured ghost stories, or is genuinely in contact with something sinister lurking within the house.Like THE SIXTH SENSE (1999) before it, THE OTHERS prides itself on a series of climactic 'revelations', some of which tip their hand too early, but Amenábar's screenplay has more than a few surprises in store, especially on second viewing, when the multilayered dialogue is revealed as a masterful patchwork of irony and misdirection. Stage actress Fionnula Flanagan is appropriately enigmatic as Kidman's stoical housekeeper, and there's strong support from Christopher Eccleston and veteran comedian Eric Sykes (here playing it very straight indeed). Beautiful, atmospheric sets by Benjamín Fernández, photographed with exquisite grace by Javier Aguirresarobe.(English version)",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Stylish, subtle scares","The Others is a ghost story but in this haunted house the scares are quite subtle. This is a movie which, to its great benefit, is more about the story than shocking, scary moments. To be sure there are some good frights sprinkled throughout. But nothing over-the-top. This movie is more interested in making you think than in frightening you. What exactly is going on in this house? It's a mystery the audience will be trying to solve right along with the characters. Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, mother of two young children. The three of them live alone in an isolated house on the island of Jersey in the days immediately following the end of World War II. Grace's husband is presumed dead in the war. The family's servants just up and left in the middle of the night. Three new servants arrive at the house. And here things begin to get very interesting.From the moment we meet them there is something slightly off about these new servants. An aging nanny, an elderly gardener and a mute young woman...they're quite the odd trio. But they know the house, having worked there before and Grace welcomes them in. But first Grace must explain the rules for the house, rules designed to keep all sunlight out as the children are so sensitive to the light it would kill them. This makes for a dark atmosphere which adds so much to the film, especially once things start to go bump in the night. Grace's daughter Anne sees the ghosts but Grace herself refuses to believe it. The servants, especially the nanny Mrs. Mills, seem to know more than they are letting on. It's pretty clear these servants hold the movie's secrets. What are those secrets? The fun for us is in finding out. Grace needs to find the answers too but it seems unlikely she'll find much fun in it.Kidman is excellent in playing the loving, protective mother who is thoroughly harried by the unseen intruders in her home. Fionnula Flanagan is also terrific playing the mysterious Mrs. Mills who is somehow creepy even when she's not trying to be. Or maybe she is trying. Also notable are the performances of the young actors playing the children. James Bentley is quite good in playing the boy, Nicholas, but it is Alakina Mann, playing Anne, who is the true revelation. Mann turns in one of the best child acting performances you'll ever see, mature far beyond her years in playing a girl who sees ghosts and is not even freaked out by them, taking it all in her stride. Kudos to director Alejandro Amenábar for coaxing such fine performances from his cast and for creating such a creepy atmosphere. The movie's story is a smart one, building slowly but surely toward its big climax. There are enough hints sprinkled throughout that may let you figure things out before the characters do. So maybe when the ending comes it doesn't pack quite as much of a wallop as it would if you were totally stunned by it. But it is still all in all a very satisfying movie-watching experience. A good story with enough subtle little scares thrown in to keep happy those who are looking for chills and thrills.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Too stubborn to remain mysterious,"Amazing performance for the most part, with a great story. The characters were disappointingly weak, but the great acting made up for it.

THE OTHERS gave me chills...,"Fear of dark is typical in horror flicks, but here its fear of light for Anne & Nicholas. In fact there is a peculiar condition for children in this film (Anne & Nicholas), that they are photosensitive. This is one of those movies which the viewers must never know the suspense/spoilers for thrills. So before you watch this, don't read any reviews with spoilers. The movie is a horror/thriller so its meant to be scary but didn't scare me. The sounds (sound effects) gave me jerk for I've watched it with surround sounds late at night. Just like a typical suspense movie, it can be watched once as the second time you wouldn't.

Way too slow,"I appreciate the fact that people are attempting to make scary movies and thrillers without resorting to blood and violence, but it seems like they don't think they need to replace it with anything.

This really would have worked better as a half hour episode of The Twilight Zone, so that half the movie didn't need to be fluff and just extraneous details that didn't move the story forward at all.

we all may be assuming the wrong thing about ourselves,"At the beginning of ""The Others"" we get introduced to housewife Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman) living with her photosensitive children on the island of Jersey during World War II. They can't leave the island as the Nazi submarines have it surrounded. Then, ghostly things begin to happen in the house, and the children say that some other people are living in the house. As time passes, Grace gets more and more desperate and angrily starts carrying a rifle around. And then...it turns out that we've been assuming the wrong thing the whole time.This movie probably makes a more interesting use of light and dark than any other movie (at least that I can think of). Every scene's contrast makes you think that something terrible is about to happen. Some people have compared this movie to ""The Sixth Sense"", and I would call that a legitimate analogy. Not only is there the horror factor, but also how the main character is forced to reassess everything that s/he has known...and then we find out the truth. Kidman, whose roles often seem a little too glamorous, here makes your blood freeze and displays a menacing face without even trying.Overall, I do recommend this one.

"Slow, Deliberate, Stylish . . . and Slow, Slow, Slow.","It seems overly simple to classify ""The Others"" as a cross between classic Hitchcock and ""The Sixth Sense"" . . . mostly, because that implies ""The Others"" is a film of that highest caliber.  It's certainly not.  However, it's not awful, either; instead ""The Others"" unfortunately falls into the film limbo of being just plain mediocre.  ""The Others"" is a suspense/horror film owing a lot to its predecessors from the 1940s -- it relies on mood, atmosphere, and the casts to create the eerie mood that permeates the film, and never falls back on gratuitous gore to create its horrors.  The look and feel of ""The Others"" is very much that of a vintage Universal film; in fact, if this film had been made in black & white, and if a digital CGI version of Lana Turner could be inserted in Nicole Kidman's place, you would probably swear that this was a forgotten suspense/horror film from that era.   It's definitely not a classic -- there's a number of significant issues that add up together to keep ""The Others"" far, far short of greatness -- but it's an interesting film nonetheless.""The Others"" is, at its heart, a vintage ghost story -- on a small island off the shores of England, there is a forlorn manor house located far away from the trappings of civilization.  Living in this isolated house are the elegant Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley).  There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. While odd, these rules are vital, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it.  The servants, led by the wise Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), accede to these rules . . . but they begin to hears voices. And things going bump in the night.  So do Anne and Nicholas.  Grace doesn't hear these things, or at least she claims not to, which slowly but surely leads to the questions: Are these new servants creating the disturbances for some sinister purpose?  Is troubled Anne creating them?  Is Grace?  Or does something really lurk within the walls of the manor house, something long-dead, something evil . . .""The Others"" relies on its pacing and direction to create its ominous mood. This reliance is both the film's strength and ultimate downfall.  Director Alejandro Amenabar lets the viewer savor each moment of the film, building suspense from scene to scene at a slow and steady pace, dropping subtle hints about what has happened and what's going to happen with a very deft touch . . . he really lets things build slowly.  In fact, too slowly. ""The Sixth Sense"" also moved along at an unhurried pace, but at least that film had the good sense to know that in order to maintain the slow pace, some sort of payoff -- or at least a good scare -- has to be tossed out the audience once in awhile, if only to keep some interest and to prevent the film from spiraling into mind-numbing boredom.  ""The Others"" has no sense of this.  An hour into the film, the luxurious pace of ""The Others"" has become little more than self-indulgent tedium.  The process of building tension degenerates into pure impatience.  There's only two moments in ""The Others"" that can genuinely be considered ""jump-out-of-your-seat"" moments; if there had been three or four more of these moments, the film might've averted its slow, steady crash into monotony.  Yes, some of the scenes are extremely impressive, and I was particularly impressed with a lot of the cinematography, as well as the richness of the dialogue . . . but these things only can carry a film so far.  They have to lead to some kind of ultimate payoff in order to truly mean anything, and in the case of ""The Others"", that payoff never comes.  It's a nice film with some wicked little touches, a few of which border on pure genius . . . and then the film ends. No build-up to a dramatic resolution -- or, for that matter, a satisfying resolution.  For that reason, ""The Others"" can be appreciated for what it is trying to accomplish, and for the techniques it uses . . . but in no way, shape, or form can the end result be called a success.  It's a shame, because it seems as though it wouldn't have taken much to turn ""The Others"" from a bland film into one that was grippingly tense.Though billed as the star of this film, Nicole Kidman falls just short of providing the strength that ""The Others"" needed from its central character -- the film revolves mostly around her character's beliefs and perceptions, and she's simply not up to the task of making those beliefs and perceptions one thousand percent convincing.  Personally, I've always found Ms. Kidman to be somewhat of an acting enigma -- she's undeniably talented, but apart from her tour de force performance in ""To Die For"", she always appears to be struggling to find the right outlet for her talent.  There's flashes of brilliance from Ms Kidman in ""The Others"", but that's it, only flashes -- overall, the performance is uneven.  I found myself wondering what the film would've been like had it featured either Julianne Moore or Helena Bonham Carter as its star.  Fortunately, there's a ""sleeper"" star in this film, one I would hope to see in many films in the years to come: Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's young daughter Anne.  As Anne, this young actress shows both strength and vulnerability with a powerful range, one rarely seen in young actors and actresses today.  She's asked to go head-to-head with Ms. Kidman on a number of occasions in the film, and not only does Ms. Mann hold her own, she shines through like a champion.  If nothing else, ""The Others"" might be worth watching simply to see Alakina Mann's superb performance.""The Others"" probably could never have been made without the success of the equally low-key ""Sixth Sense"".  ""The Others"", though, while possessing an undeniable sense of style and grace, is a film ultimately without a lot to say . . . or a lot to give to its audience.  As such, ""The Others"" is a film with some interesting qualities, some more enjoyable than others -- but it's ultimately little more than an okay film that goes on way longer than it should.  ""Interesting"" doesn't always mean ""good"" -- and with ""The Others"", this is certainly the case.  Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
to rank among the 5 best movies made in 2001,"""And all the other voices said: change your mind, you're always wrong"" (the Cure, Other Voices, Faith, 1981).A few years ago, Alejandro Amenabar's third movie was prominent in the top 250 of IMDb. But today, it isn't there any more. That's really unfair. It largely deserved its place and to occupy it as long as possible.After, ""Tesis"" (1996) and ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997), Amenabar goes up a notch and signs with ""the Others"" (2001) a masterful masterpiece which refreshes fantastic cinema and breathes new life into the theme of the haunted house. He largely deserves his nickname of ""new young prodigy of Spanish cinema"". With Tom Cruise, partly responsible for the production, one could fear a strong Hollywood influence in Amenabar's opus. But fortunately, it's nothing of the sort. As a matter of fact, just like the great M Night Shyamalan, Alejandro Amenabar appears as a real author, on the fringe of the Hollywood industry and he's got enough character to let his style nurture. Let's hope he won't be crushed by the Hollywood machine. The movie was shot in Spain, with eventually a modest budget (17 millions of dollars) and it was a surprise to see it doing brilliantly a little everywhere in the world.Amenabar had already ventured in the dreadful world of the snuff-movies with his debut movie ""Tesis"" and had succeeded in mixing several films genres in one cohesive narrative line with ""Abre Los Ojos"". But with ""the Others"", one didn't suspect a real ease in the ""In Camera"". It's a quite dramatic change of style and in the end a successful translation in the fantastic.Amenabar's references are easy to guess. They're three cornerstones in fantastic cinema: ""the Innocents"" (1961), ""the Haunting"" (1963) and ""the Sixth Sense"" (1999). ""The Others"" can be considered as the meeting of these three opus. All the elements of the fantastic movie with Gothic nature are gathered and perfectly used. There's no shortage of examples: an austere mansion with a sinister architecture which hides a dark secret, big rooms half obscured, a mist which tends to thicken throughout the days, characters with sinister-looking faces. All these features blend themselves to create a nearly stifling universe. Moreover, Amenabar favors a calm and quite slow rhythm to play with the spectator's nerves as much as possible and we are entitled to real moments of fear. It is also interesting to write that a minimum of special effects is just enough for the director to maintain anxiety. He also weaves a more and more threatening atmosphere marked out by the progressive reversal of situation (in the beginning of the film, Nicole Kidman dominated Fionnula Flanagan but in the middle of the film, it's the contrary which happens). And, of course, like in a successful suspense movie, virtually all the obscure or ambiguous points are clarified making the story incredibly coherent and after the final conclusion (which of course, I won't reveal), the very last sequences have a strong emotional power and it would take a heart of stone to resist them. On another extent, let's also take down the omnipresence of religion, supposed to be a sort of protection for Nicole Kidman but which, in the end turns out to be useless. One can put forward that Amenabar had surely a strong catholic education and he must have lost his faith...But the qualities of ""the Others"" don't stop here. It is visually and technically an appealing movie with a gorgeous photography (certain images are breathtaking) and there's also a careful work on sound and the original soundtrack. On of the most important characteristics from Alejandro Amenabar is that he composes the music of his own films and her, very simply, he excels himself. The delicate and disturbing sounds we can hear contribute to reinforce the threatening atmosphere of the film and makes us feel a little more ill-at-ease again.""The Others"" was released when Nicole Kidman had just divorced Tom Cruise and I had thought that she gave the image of a more mature and ambitious actress. Amenabar's flick confirms it. One is really under the impression that she gives the best that she can. There's nothing to say about her role she takes with consummate skill. Her role of haughty middle-class housewife with a cold and penetrating look is sufficient to make one shudder. What is strange is that her name in the film is Grace and her hairstyle is reminiscent of Grace Kelly's. Is it a nod to the actress? Be that as it may, it would be unfair to forget the rest of the cast, especially Fionnula Flanagan who under a docile and frail appearance can easily become disturbing. At last, Amenabar made quite a creditable job of the directing of children who are, in general difficult actors to direct.A chilling and great movie from start to finish. To fully savor all lights turned off. Highly recommended. Hats off to Mr Amenabar: he is one of the main leaders of Spanish cinema and his career is starting well as the triumph of ""Mar Adentro"" (2004) testifies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

No one can make us leave this house.,"The Others is directed and written by Alejandro Amenábar. It stars Nicole Kidman, Fionnula Flanagan, Christopher Eccleston, Elaine Cassidy, Eric Sykes, Alakina Mann & James Bentley. Amenábar also scores the music and the cinematography is by Javier Aguirresarobe. Plot sees Kidman as Grace Stewart, the mother of two children who have an allergy to sunlight. With her husband still missing in action during WWII, Grace and the children reside in a remote mansion on the isle of Jersey. When one day a trio of house servants turn up looking to fill the vacancies at the mansion, it coincides with strange supernatural occurrences around the home. Are the children being mischievous? Is Grace losing her mind? Or is there indeed something not of this world at work?The haunted house creeper has had a number of film version tellings over the years. A different kind of horror film, it's a sub-genre that relies on suggestion and atmospheric shocks instead of rampant blood letting. The Others is one of the finest of its type, a wonderfully crafted chiller that thrives on old fashioned values to deliver its scares. The set up is standard formula stuff, a big gloomy mansion that's nice and remote with rolling gardens and finds itself often cloaked by impenetrable fog. A couple of cherubic kids, classically inviting creepy activity, and servants that have foreboding written all over their respective foreheads. Throw into the pot the lonely female trying to hold her self together as things threaten to unhinge the family bond, and it's so far so formulaic. But Amenábar, for his English language debut, has a great sense of mood and pacing, slowly unwinding the coil to reveal a sense of impending doom, playing it out amongst eerie sounds and deft camera movements about the house. That the kiddies have a light sensitive problem gives Amenábar the perfect excuse to keep the whole thing dimly lit: to great eerie effect.With unease in place and the small band of characters firmly established, the other key element of the film starts to kick in, namely the mystery element. Just what exactly is going on here? The children, excellently played by débutantes Mann & Bentley, garner much sympathy, but at the same time we suspect they might be at fault for the ghostly activity. The servants are led by the officious looking, but gently spoken, Bertha Mills (Flanagan superb), you sense something isn't quite right but all cards are played close to the chest so as to not reveal anything. So much so that when the reveal does come, it's a doozy, firmly rounding out The Others as a classic of its type. The trump card here, tho, is Kidman. Pale faced and cold to the eye, she nails the plummy English accent whilst turning in a classic performance of a repressed woman battling against-it seems-everything and everyone. Following in the footsteps of Deborah Kerr and Julie Harris, Kidman's ability to make Grace's mental disintegration believable marks it out as one of the best horror sub-genre performances ever.Suspense, scares and some tricks up its sleeve, The Others is every inch a quality bit of psychological horror. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
this one was hard to sit through.,"horrible, unintelligent retelling of the horror formula utilized by the haunting, sixth sense, and the shining. the score is so incredibly cliched that i caught myself laughing at several points. the performances aren't very good by anyone, sadly, i think the best were the two kids. the screenplay made the ""twist"" ending so undeniably evident after twenty minutes that i really found myself questioning why they continued to even build on it. i think its amazing how many times the same story can be rewritten and still have people buy it. the only reason probable is the low standards we've adopted in recent years. these really are sad times for the cinema.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliantly written and chilling; wonderfully atmospheric with stunning period detail,"The film may start off a little on the slow side, but essentially it is a truly chilling and effective period horror film, with just the right chills and thrills. Superbly directed and brilliantly written, ""The Others"" hits all the right boxes. Then there is an atmospheric music score and truly stunning cinematography and period detail(the house especially was fantastic). The story is an original one, very rarely gets confusing and goes along at a good pace. And the performances are wonderful, Nicole Kidman without a doubt gives one of the best performances I have seen her give in years, it was a performance of true intensity. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are outstanding as her children, and Christopher Ecceleston is effective in a small role. Asides from Kidman, Fionnula Flannagan is truly sinister and chilling as the housekeeper. Like Mrs Danvers in the Hitchcock film ""Rebecca"" while she is merely a secondary character, she does so much to enhance the story. All in all, this is a great film, and I recommend it highly. 9.5/10 Bethany Cox",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Exceeded expectations.,"First off, let me say that this film is not at all reminiscent of Hitchcock, contrary to the opinion of several previous reviewers. While Hitch did do psychodramas, this is really more of a ghost story. Like other reviewers have said, the movie is very stylized and suspenseful, and above all, entertaining. I don't disagree that it is slow, but in this film, that is a virtue. It allows the viewer to get a real feel for the individual characters and the family/household dynamic- all of which are critical to the climax. It is difficult to give a thorough critique without giving too much away, but I must say that I did NOT see ""it"" coming- and I always appreciate it when a film can turn my perspective upside down. This is mostly a visual movie and I have a feeling it won't come across as brilliantly on a small screen, so if you're reading this and considering seeing the film, I strongly recommend seeing it in the theater. The use of light and space and camera angles is excellent, and I also appreciated the minimal use of background music- sometimes in a thriller/horror film, the score can become distracting or overpower the dialogue- NOT a problem here. I wouldn't be surprised if this film is nominated for several of the more obscure Oscar categories (the ones I normally wouldn't even notice) like Sound Editing and Cinematography. There are a few minor inconsistencies and anacronisms, but as a whole package, this film delivers. I've seen a lot of comparisons to ""The Sixth Sense"", but please don't let those shape your expectations of this movie. This is a very different, and in many ways, superior movie, because it relies even less on gore and shock and more on suspense and psychological drama.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A chilling ghost story that will leave shivers down your spine for the night,"I was impressed. It's hard to make a ghost story scary now days. I mean, there are so many fancy computer effects. And the director probably had every chance to put them in. But!... he didn't. That's what I really admired.I did like the film. It was very creepy.

A strong plate,"Everything is spoken in whispers. The atmosphere, music in crescendo at all times, mixes a continuous fog; and the lonely panorama of an antique house. One has to be prepared to fight a phsycological war against the movie: not only because one expects a shock at each time the music reaches a climax, but because one is faced ideologically with a tremendously upsetting and desolating point of view of death. Nicole Kidman's delivers true fear to the audience, and the empty spaces on the dreaded house and suspenseful innuendos will paralyze your back hairs. The twist, marvelous twist, will leave everyone gasping. If you say you'd expected it, thats because you weren't INTO the movie but reasoning apart. Be ready.

Not really much horror or mystery in this one.,"It entertained for the most part, granted it was rather easy to figure out the twist to this one. That may have more to do with the movie ""The Sixth Sense"", because thanks to that movie one tends to be looking for a possible twist especially when reviews talk about the shocking ending or what not. This movie has a lady and her two children living in a very big house where one day a group of three mysterious strangers comes and offers their services. Well the mother accepts and so starts the spooky going ons and such that accompany all such films as these. For the most part they are minor stuff here and there. Apparently the daughter suffers from some disease and must stay out of the sunlight, yet the shades set up keep coming down. There are other strange happenings and a strange visit by the father who for some reason comes and goes in very strange and mysterious fashion. Then there are scenes where the girl is seemingly possessed which are quite nice. Still the movie was somewhat disappointing, it is one of those horror/suspense films that is a bit to talky for my tastes and one of the films to start the current trend of PG-13 rated horror films. It also has Nicole Kidman in the lead and I have never been a big fan of hers, as she was one of the worst lead actresses in a Batman movie besides nearly everyone involved in part four. However, I will say this is one of the better roles I have seen her in. I may have found this movie entertaining if we can go back to a day where the surprise ending is not advertised in the trailers.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Boring, dull, and highly overrated.","I watched this movie because I'm making it a goal to watch all of the top 250 movies (according to the IMDB list). Also I had heard some good things from a couple friends that had seen it. To get right to the point, the only reason why I didn't turn this movie off after the first 10 minutes was because I was hoping it would live up to the hype. I can't even tell you how many times I looked at my watch during this movie, each time calculating how much of it had passed (i.e. 1/4, 2/5). It was that boring. The acting I thought was brilliant from the two kids (especially Anne) and from Mrs. Mills. Kidman, on the other hand, horribly overacted in a couple parts. She is not the actress that people give her credit for. Cinematography (probably misspelled) was good but contributed to the extremely boring setting. This movie is highly overrated and does NOT deserve to be on this top 250 list. Grade = 3/10",3.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Classic Gothic Horror,"'The Others' has quickly found itself on my favourite horror movies of all time list. Nicole Kidman shines in this post-world war II gothic horror film, and her performance isn't the only one that makes this film as great as it is. Despite this being both of their first acting credits, the children are compelling, and help create the spooky atmosphere with their performances. 'The Others' doesn't need to rely on gore or cheap scares to get you sitting on the edge of your seat. The cinematography, composition, story, and chilling performances leave you with that feeling of adrenaline and satisfaction you get after watching a good horror movie. This movie is 20 years old and still manages to keep you guessing. Even with its PG-13 rating 'The Others' will be guaranteed to have your heart racing by the time the credits roll.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Well-done but heavy-handed and very depressing,"1945 Jersey. A woman (Nicole Kidman--who's excellent) keeps her two children barricaded in their big, gloomy, fog-shrouded house. It seems if the children are exposed to sunlight it will kill them. Then three mysterious servants show up to help...or are they? Strange noises are heard and the little girl starts seeing ghosts. What's going on?The movie is VERY dark, very creepy and very quiet...and that's the problem. It's too much. There's a constant air of dread and danger and it really wore me down. Also the film moves at a (purposefully) slow pace--too slow for me. It's all well-done and there are a few scenes guaranteed to make you jump (or scream) but it was too depressing. But there is a nice twist at the ending that I didn't see coming. So, it's somewhat worth seeing--just very slow-moving.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Excellent building of suspense and mystery only to actually deliver with an unexpected twist.,"Next week I will be watching this movie for the first time since 2002. I think it will stand the test of time. Interesting to write down now how I feel about it from memory and see if I still have that opinion after re-watching it.When I watched it, it was very late at night. I only had some candles burning in my living room and a mug of hot chocolate. Usually I love that atmosphere, it's cozy. Not while watching this movie though. Suddenly the living room seemed too dark and eerie in the candle light. Eventually I had to pause the movie and run to the switch to turn the lights on. Only then did I manage to finish watching this movie. And I'm no easily scared by horror movies, I've seen too many of those.I did not guess the twist in the end. The story telling was amazing and Kidman a surprise in a movie like this, but she was great, as were all actors and actresses.

An interesting balance,"I must say that the director took an unique approach to this horror movie without the usual jump scares and people making extremely dumb decisions. Nicole Kidman and the rest of the cast did an excellent job portraying their respective role. Hats off to Alakina Mann in how well she handled her character, I was most impressed with her range of emotions and how well she flowed from one to the other. Normally I have had the tendency of becoming distracted and somewhat perturbed with the lameness of some movie when I am faced with a weak and questionable script writer. This however wasn't the case here where I was following the movement quite thoroughly as the movie progressed.Aside from a few moments, the clarity of the picture allowed me to follow what was going on at said point in time and I felt ""just my opinion"" that the editing was on point as the flow was not interrupted. I especially appreciated the lack of nudity and only implied coitus which I feel are red flags to bad script writing when you require such fillers to complete the project.I enjoyed this movie and ""only my opinion again"" I would recommend seeing it.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I felt so betrayed by the cliché ending that anything good up until that point wasn't enough to compensate for it.I give it a 2/10.",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Exquisitely tempered pace, wonderful casting, and a crowd-pleasing ending make this one of mainstream Hollywood's best film in years.","The concept is lovely: Supposedly deceased husband from the war leaves behind wife (played by Nicole Kidman) and two children.  The kids are photosensitive to light so the curtains throughout the mansion must remain closed at all times.  Wife hires a new staff of three and then strange things begin to happen.The story is so well-thought out to most every detail, which makes the ending so sound and shocking.  `The Sixth Sense' precedes it by two years and regenerated an entire film genre in the Hollywood spectrum.  Typically, that film would stand as the measure of the subsequent submissions, which would slowly degenerate into paler imitations until the phenomenon faded out.  However, I believe that not only has `The Others' one-upped the sense and raised the stakes, but will hold up much better over time.  Not only is the first viewing exciting, but the second viewing shows just how well done this film is.The mansion that is the centerpiece for the film is masterfully shot from the attic to the kitchen, with Kidman opening, closing, and locking doors everywhere she goes all the time, as well as constantly drawing the drapes.There isn't really a weak link in this small troop of a cast.  Kidman delivers an especially anal, unreserved performance as an over-protective British mother who teeters on being borderline psychotic.  The kids are like Christina and Christopher Crawford: the overly headstrong sister and cute, lovable and innocent younger brother.  The maid's kindness, with her sidekicks the mute and the groundskeeper, turns deliciously ominous as we get closer to the secret they carry with them.""Open Your Eyes"" and ""The Others"" have been two of the best films I've seen in the last five years.  I am looking forward to Alejandro Amenabar's future endeavors.9: Highly recommendable, creepy, psychological ghost story.  Inspires repeat viewings.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not as good as everyone says.,I actually had never seen this movie up until last night but I had nothing else to watch so I decided to give it a try because everyone seemed to love it on here. First thing the acting in it is good from everyone except the little girl. The plot is quite good with an interesting original twist however the movie is quite slow and dull for me.I thought it was going to be somewhat scary and it was not at all.This movie is about a young family in England circa 1940s. The father has gone off to war and the mother is forced to stay at home and take care of her children who have a rare disease which makes them ultra alergic to the sunlight. Strange things start to happen though as the kids start to see ghosts.This movie was OK it was just a little boring for me. Slow and dull just like most English things.

I also love how this film keeps making you think it's going one way, but then quickly turns another way. And there is an oddly optimistic feel to this movie, despite the dark subject matter.

Outstanding performance!,"""The Other"" is a psychological thriller directed by Robert Mulligan, released in 1972. Adapted from a novel by Tom Tryon, the story is set in rural America during the 1930s and revolves around the disturbing lives of twin brothers, Niles and Holland Perry.Niles and Holland, played by Chris and Martin Udvarnoky, seem inseparable. They spend their days playing in the countryside, creating a private fantasy world, and harboring a deep connection. However, their relationship takes a darker turn as mysterious accidents and deaths occur around their family farm.The movie's tension builds slowly, showcasing the innocence and mischievous nature of the twins. However, a series of unsettling events hints at a disturbing secret. The film masterfully weaves a narrative that blurs the line between reality and imagination, creating an eerie and suspenseful atmosphere.The twisted ending is the culmination of the suspense that has been building throughout the film. In a shocking revelation, it's unveiled that Niles is actually dead, and all the scenes showcasing both twins were a projection of Holland's disturbed mind. Holland, suffering from a severe mental break, has been assuming Niles's identity and causing the tragedies that have plagued the family.This unexpected turn exposes the depth of Holland's psychological trauma and the lengths to which his mind has gone to cope with the loss of his brother. The audience is left reeling from the realization that the innocent and mischievous twin they've been following throughout the film is, in fact, a fractured, disturbed individual.The film's conclusion is a haunting revelation, leaving viewers with a profound sense of unease and questioning the thin line between reality and illusion, innocence and malevolence.""The Other"" is remembered for its chilling narrative, exceptional performances, and a twist that leaves a lasting impact on its audience, showcasing the power of psychological storytelling in cinema.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Through the careful and efficient use of the resources that cinema offers, The Others manages to create a story full of tension. One of the best films of the genre!","With "" The Others"", 2001, his third film, the first in English, the Chilean Alejandro Amenábar gained visibility. He also won the title again Alfred Hitchcock (1899-1980). But if the practice of raising new talents to Olympus is often rushed, in the case of Amenábar there is a certain coherence. Of course, the Chilean is far from the masters of suspense like Hitchcock. But ""The Others"" is still an extremely creative work of scares, with the right to a few moments of anthology. Its entire beginning, its presentation, for example, deserves to be included in any reference book on cinema.Reminiscent in some ways of Jack Clayton's excellent classic The Lambs (1960), the script tells the story of a young and recent widow, Grace (Nicole Kidman), who lost her husband fighting for England against the Germans in World War II, and who goes to live right after the end of the war in 1945 with his two young children, a girl and a boy, in a mysterious and isolated house on an island off the coast of England that turns out to be a huge mansion in the best Gothic style. As their children have a rare disease that prevents them from receiving the sun's rays, which can cause them serious injuries to the body and fatal suffocation, the house is almost always closed and plunged into a gloomy and dismal environment, where each open door forces them to close. Lockable and the rooms are always filled with large curtains to keep out natural light. When a group of three strange servants are hired to do the housework, an elderly couple (gardener Mr. Tuttle, played by Eric Sykes, and housekeeper Mrs. Mills, role of Fionulla Flanagan), and a young teenager change the cook (Lydia, played by Elaine Cassidy), strange facts start to occur, involving hauntings and supernatural situations, culminating in a surprising revelation.With only one big name in its cast - Nicole Kidman - the film has some spine-chilling moments, literally speaking. Obviously this can happen depending on how impressionable your viewer is, but the commercial success of such a small film demonstrates that many agree with this statement. The public likes to be scared, at least as far as the couch or the cinema, and for the vast majority of them, who were certainly tired of slashers, The Others may indeed represent a welcome innovation.The film actually revolves around Kidman, who fits perfectly into the role of a strong mother, but at the same time fragile and deeply insecure. Grace's character thus conceals different personalities, which explode together because of her husband's absence, her children's illness, and the sense of duty imposed by her mother's role and religion. The Chilean director's ability is also noticed in this: to build a sublime character, aesthetically beautiful, but disturbing in his performance. No blood, no deaths, no ghosts crossing the walls, but a true suspense created exclusively with light/shadow games, music, voices and special shots. Remarkable indeed, considering that the entire film was shot in the same location, an old Victorian-style village, immersed in typical English countryside mist.Upon its debut in August 2001, The Others surprised critics and the public, receiving a standing ovation in some festivals. Much of this success applies to its ""surprising"" ending, with a well-conducted plot twist, such as O Sexto Sentido, A Vila or Clube da Luta. This resource, however, is not the crutch that moves the narrative forward. On the contrary, it presents itself as just one of the film's sophistication elements. Over its 105 minutes, filmmaker Alejandro Amenábar offers the spectator very classy images. Instead of easy scares and abominable creatures that insist on coming from the world of the dead to scare unsuspecting characters, the script fills the production of allegories and situations that ask for some interpretation from its audience.Although The Others is, at its essence, a horror film, the script always prioritizes the characters and the general construction of the story as a tragedy. In this way, the film seeks to create tension around the family's physical and emotional circumstances, whether those circumstances are the extreme pressure on Grace or the rigidity with which she treats the children, always seeming to be one step away from madness. This preference for building horror as an extra layer on top of the family drama slows the film down, but it also makes it much more effective at conveying the emotional meaning of events to the characters.The moment when Grace's husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) returns from the war is a good example of how the film balances its horror elements with family drama. At this point in the story, Grace has experienced countless doors that open by themselves and inexplicable noises, so that the existence of something supernatural in the house seems indisputable. Even so, the film ""pauses"" this aspect of the story to focus on the father's return and, when it returns to the horror elements, the plot has another meaning and another weight, although it has lost some of the tension built up until then. One of the factors that help the film maintain a balance between its more melodramatic elements and horror is Nicole Kidman's ability to take the weight off Grace's shoulders. She has no difficulty in alternating between rigidity and affection for her children, between tantrums and the guilt that comes later, revealing an increasing fragility. Again, Charles's return affects the story here, as it gives Grace an almost singular moment of despair and sadness, where she blames her husband for leaving the family to go to war.The mood of the film is what makes it so special. It's one of the rare works that manages to involve the viewer only with their look, and with each passing minute, it's harder to shake off the curiosity and not feel the same fear that the characters feel. The spectator is invaded by anxiety and a feeling of claustrophobia, as he is being locked up with the children in a space that seems to be isolated from the world. Anne and Nicholas have always lived in their mother's house, and even when they find the courage to go out, they find themselves wandering through the park, closed by tall gates and deeply immersed in the fog. The absence of defined times is another peculiarity of the film. The scenes take place in rooms that are constantly dark, day and night, so it becomes really difficult to fit them into the time frame. Even the rare scenes shot outdoors are temporarily indefinable due to the fog, making it impossible to tell whether it's seven in the morning or seven in the evening.The plot, by showing genius within an industry full of narrative vices, concentrates its power in the dimension of the characters and in the atmosphere of tension of a discreet but very present soundtrack. Conceived by the filmmaker who also signs the direction, the music is masterfully orchestrated, with the highest chords raised at the right moments, avoiding the excesses of films that are not sustained by their story, but by these hardened narrative tricks. The claustrophobia climate is established by using the closed planes in place at the right time. By opening up the shots and increasing the depth of field at other times, the production fills in the images of mists or lighting that makes everything grim and mysterious for the audience that follows the suspense driving, another well-sewn element in the film, which shows that Alejandro Amenábar learned from the good guys: there is a Hitchcockian atmosphere in the scene, presented through some subtleties of editing. The Others does not rely on excessive effects to function.Some scenes are memorable and great examples of classic horror, as when the mysterious trio of servants have their real identity discovered by the children of the house and are seen walking slowly towards them through the thick fog of a moonlit night in a huge macabre garden , or when in a moment of Grace's hallucination, she sees her daughter wearing a white wedding veil playing with a puppet and mistakes her for a strange old woman who speaks in the child's voice, culminating in a maddening fit between mother and daughter.Javier Aguirre Sarobre's photography is efficient, as is the lighting work. Between black and orange, combined with an atmosphere of sensitivity to the sun, the film dives into the shadows and draws from there almost all its narrative potential. Add that to the character development and you'll understand the reasons for the production's success. Amenábar is about adding supernatural touches to the script. Anne sees ghosts, but her mother, an ardent Catholic, vehemently rejects that fact. The girl's reports, as well as the mysterious presence of the new servants, prove that Grace's faith does not explain certain realities. Amenábar's great merit in this work is to recreate with quality the style of genuine suspense, the one that consecrated Hitchcock. In the place of easy scares, suggestion, insinuation enters. The ghosts of ""The Others"" do not drag chains or chase after mortals. They are, above all, in the spectator's head.Through the careful and efficient use of the resources that cinema offers, The Others manages to create a story full of tension. Its more deliberate pace may not suit everyone, but it is a fundamental part of how the narrative works and building an atmosphere that conveys the sense of despair, fear and sadness that the character's experience. In this way, The Others does not depend on its ending, a mix of Dangerous Illusions and The Sixth Sense. It doesn't necessarily have to be ""original"" to be good. Just capitalize on good ideas. That in itself is enough to make The Others one of the great examples of the suspense genre of the last decades.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What a joke!,"This movie was a total disappointment!!!

Very Spooky and well made,"Kidman gives a good performance as do all the other cast. It is a change to see a spooky movie without loads of Digital Effects and just with good acting and music. It confirms the old saying that the most frightening things are the things we can't see. I won't say what the ending was but there was a ghost story on ITV television about 25 years ago with the same title and the same basic story, though with less actors. I can't find it on the IMDb but it was very highly praised at the time. I doubt if any recording exists of it now so it must be coincidence that this movies has the same plot and title. I recall the same can be said of Topsy Turvy which was almost exactly the same as a TV play about G&S about thirty years ago.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A visual delight but mentally undemanding,"This film has a lot to recommend it and yet I found it ultimately rather predictable and little more (in terms of plot) than a protracted tease.Having said that, it is beautifully shot - lots of shadow, fog and flickering lamps. The camera angles are intelligent and the screenplay is thoughtful and convincing.I rather feel that this film will appeal to those viewers who like ghost stories and do not expect any more than dramatic music and a sinister build-up to the denouement. It does not have the Gothic magic of Sleepy Hollow but the acting is impressive - especially from the two children Alakina Mann and James Bentley who were both fantastic. It was also wonderful to see Eric Sykes in his cameo role.Nicole Kidman does a good job with what she has to do but I feel she is too good an actress to spend ninety minutes looking wide-eyed and frightened.Worth seeing but not a truly great film.

An inflated Twilight Zone episode,"From the start I was irritated by Nicole Kidman's performance as the lead character in this. When she doesn't have some definite emotion to convey, like anger or terror, e.g. in a plot set-up scene, she can't carry it off. Moreover, she has to shoulder a great deal of the movie by herself, and I felt her pain a bit -- it looks like hard work.It's not all bad however. The gimmick of the light sensitive children provides some embellishment and amusing filler. And it does have some creepy, spine tingling moments. The two children and the rest of the supporting cast give impressive performances.This as a haunted house/ghost story with only one arrow in its quiver. It's set in the 40's, and reminds one of the pulp magazines filled with such stuff around that time. It has that lurid, somewhat tasteless feel of a story scribbled out at 2 cents a word.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Did there have to be a séance?,"Without spoiling too much I will say that I was slightly disappointed that a séance was performed at one point in this movie, with the implication that a genuine connection with the, shall we say ""spirit world"" was made. Even the movie Ghost knew better than that! All ""professional"" mediums, without exception, are charlatans and con artists, and promotion of a rational viewpoint in life is not helped by otherwise intelligent movies falling into this particular trap.And it is an intelligent movie. For the most part the film manages very well to tell its story in little revelatory bits and pieces, whilst keeping the tension high. It even manages well the part where the returned father actually being dead is so obvious to the audience, although Grace and the children (of course) don't recognise it. It is handled in a way that it doesn't matter. He's there for character and plot development, not shock value.The problem arises in the final act of the film. It's at this point that, not simply because of the plot, but something in the way it was written, lit, shot, acted, edited together: somehow one is suddenly no longer watching a movie, but an episode of television melodrama. Maybe it is because the movie doesn't finish with a cathartic climax with, say, the house burning down or something, but rather one of those ambiguous twists which reminds you of ""Tales of the Unexpected"" or ""The Twilight Zone"". But also (again without going into too much detail) there is a marked increase in phoney looking period detail, and the look, acting and writing suddenly puts one in mind of a rather sub-par episode of ""Poirot"".Despite all the praise received from professional critics, my view was that Kidman's performance was the weakest of an otherwise excellent little ensemble (particularly Alakina Mann as the daughter who is just fantastic). I was especially keen to see the magnificent Eric Sykes, who seems to be getting more work as he gets older. For non-British readers (and indeed anybody under 30), I would like to point out that Eric Sykes is not just a consummate character actor, he is also one of the funniest writers and performers this country has produced, beginning over 50 years ago with his collaborations with Spike Milligan on the legendary Goon Show, and right up to the 1980s with his own sitcom, ""Sykes"". He's still acting on stage and screen, despite having been profoundly deaf for many years.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Intelligent, frightening film is best of its kind","I thought that nothing could surpass my first terrified viewing of ""The Haunting"" when I was about 15. That's when I became a lifelong fan of supernatural psychological thrillers. Good ones are few and far between -- so, I have waited 31 years for the incredible experience of watching ""The Others""! It has been worth the wait. This is the first time I have ever had goosebumps all over my head! I am usually completely unaffected by so-called ""thrillers"" and I find horror movies to be laughable. But ""The Others"" is in a class by itself.After my first viewing of this beautifully-acted, beautifully-filmed, intelligently written story, I had what I call ""movie hangover"" for a couple of days. I was intrigued, and I knew I would watch it again. Scenes and lines kept coming back to me, along with the impression of all of the amazing performances in the film.Tonight I watched it for the second time, sharing it with my two 13-year-old sons. They were blown away, and wanted to discuss it long after it was over. We talked about not only the movie, but also questions of the nature of life and death. For me, the second viewing was far, far richer than the first, as I was able to pick up on dozens of clues about which I was ""clueless"" the first time around. My boys can't wait to see it again.

What a twist in the tale!,"I saw this movie yesterday on the television and was so surprised by it. The Sixth Sense is one hell of a movie but this movie to gives it good competition. Even though the twist end in Sixth sense is shocking, the one over her, which slightly resembles the former movie, still manages to leave one flabbergasted.The beginning of the movie looked a bit fairy-tale-ish because of the old and dilapidated building, weird characters. I thought that some creature would pop out all of a sudden, judging by the title of the movie. But, as the story progressed, I was so hooked to it that every time I had to go and attend to something, I sighed and paused the DVD angrily.The characters are one of a kind with Nicole playing an over protective, stringent mother beautifully. The children too play their parts well even though they are not so likable as Malcolm. Out of the three servants, the old lady covers more scenes and plays her role effectively.There are double twists in the end, the second one which no one would have thought of.

"Boring, dull & pointless","I had high hopes for this film after hearing so much about it - how it relied on creepy atmosphere and sound to supply chills rather than jump out at you gore.  Well, it certainly doesn't have any jump-out-of-your-seat frights.  That's for sure.  It barely has any thrills at all.  Creepy atmosphere will only take you so far.  Like Blair Witch Project, The Others is like sex without climaxing, all build up and no pay off.The ending is rather pointless and really doesn't add anything to the story. It's an easy twist to figure out and from the moment I did, I realized everything happening had no point as the ending renders it all moot.  The only good moment is the way the twist is revealed but it can't redeemed the 100 minutes of tediousness leading up to it.  How this managed to get on the Top 250 list here is beyond me.

"A mother and two children are living alone in a large Jersey house. Things seem a little strange. Very well crafted, moody  haunted house thriller.","Who hasn't known ghosts? I grew up listening to a man breathing in various cupboards around my house as I went to sleep. Both my mother and I heard him clearly. We didn't consider him malevolent, he was just there.My wife and I have heard a very unhappy, spectral woman, in broad daylight, weeping loudly in a corridor of our former house, repeatedly, over two days.I certainly believe in ghosts! And I'm not particularly psychic. I've also known of a tall old cupboard that independently spooked certain guests to the house we were living in at the time. They'd back out of the room, uneasily. I'm sure that many of you can tell similar stories.The Others is a very neatly made, subtle, measured, haunted house thriller starring Nicole Kidman.It doesn't rely on digital effects to scare or unsettle the viewer, rather putting emphasis on strangeness. The early cues are auditory. We know we're in ghost territory when those violins start screeching in that time honoured spooky way.There aren't many sudden bangs or shakes in this strange house, not extravagantly anyway, but we're led to expect that something nasty and frightening will happen. That's understood, hinted by the mood of this beautifully crafted film.Nicole Kidman plays Grace, an overly protective mother looking after her children Anne and Nicholas in a large rural house on the island of Jersey just after WW2.She's waiting for her husband to come home from the war. The children are apparently photosensitive and can't be allowed to come into contact with sunlight so all of the curtains are closed in the house and the doors are sequentially locked as Grace, the children and the staff move through the house.The staff headed by Mrs Mills (fine Irish actress Fionnula Flanagan) get about their business within the rules set by their mistress.Writer/director, Chilean born, Spain based, Alejandro Amenabar has created a moody, thriller. He also composed the music.Nicole Kidman gives a fine performance again emphasising her superior acting skills. Grace is forceful but fraught, elegant but severe.The tension rises.

The World of the Dead Gets Mixed Up With the World of the Living,"There's something to be said for a horror film that takes its time and builds to an impressive climax. The Others is the definition of a slow burn and although it never technically pays off all that it sets up, it's certainly a well made horror-thriller. I typically look for an atmospheric or psychological take on horror stories, and The Others is one that relies more heavily on those two things than it does jump scare or creepy imagery. But there's still a fair share of those as well. Powered by a strong performance by Nicole Kidman, as a protective single mother who attempts to hide her family from the threatening outside world. It doesn't completely all come together by film's end, but most of the questions are answered in a surprising and fascinating way.7.3/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The ghost world is like you haven't seen it yet,"I watched this movie for the first time when I happened to be at the TV on a dark rainy evening, being alone in the room and still being a child. It seems that this is the best combination of circumstances to see this masterpiece from Alejandro Amenabar. And the film passed for me, leaving very deep memories, forcing me to rethink the idea of ghosts.The plot of the film immediately immerses the viewer in the atmosphere of the desolation of the area. There is almost no one here, except for a lonely estate, the mistress of the house, her children and some servants. The weather is always cloudy, the house is huge, the atmosphere is oppressive. It just feels like it's getting cold and nasty in your house as well. The tone is excellent, the plot is served in portions, there is no feeling that the action is in a hurry or is slow. It is remembered positively.The actors are on top. Nicole Kidman has a leading role. She is convincing, impetuous, confident in the image of the main character Grace. You try to imagine whether a person can fight for his family, his home like that, even realizing that you are facing something inexplicable, paranormal, even hostile. Kidman in the frame pleases the eye. Child actors are also good. It's probably not easy to be in such a film, but they play their roles with dignity, you empathize with them, which means they successfully cope. The governess was also remembered. A kind of dark horse. You don't trust her the whole movie because she's obviously hiding something.I like how the frames are set, how the light is installed. The fact is that the film is quite dark. And it is difficult to show all the action in a limited light without causing negative emotions of the audience, who may not see everything they should. The picture is made so professionally that all the important points will not go unnoticed.All the attempts of the main characters to understand what is happening in their house are revealed in the incredible finale of the film. The so-called twist turned out to be so shocking that I still remember sitting with my mouth open and could not believe that such a thing was possible. The finale is absolutely not guessed, it becomes a chopping postulate of the screenwriters and the director, makes you see the other world in a different way. The film is very worthy.

Tremendous movie; very engrossing,"The performance of Nicole Kidman in this is outstanding. She plays the part extremely well and had me utterly convinced that she truly was the conservative, sensible-shoe-wearing, overbearing mother in the piece, though quite captivatingly beautiful she is too.

You won't find yourself shouting ""don't open that door"" like one does in desperation at so many awful b movie characters - you'll be looking at Ms. Kidman's face and you'll be right there with her.This film is set some fifty years ago. Now, normally with some type of period pieces, things start well before some character uses some modern slang/colloquialism and it pulls you right out of the movie.

"""They're here"" ... and so are they ...","In a nutshell, Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" is a gripping and emotionally powerful horror film, respecting our intelligence enough not to overuse graphic elements and to make the perfect dosage between thrills and mystery. And the mystery surrounding the characters is so absorbing that it immediately plunges us into such an unnerving and harrowing atmosphere that at the end of the film, whether we found relief or our hearts were still pounding, we know we'd just have lived an extraordinary experience.""The Others"" is set in a large mansion inhabited by a young mother, Nicole Kidman as Grace Stewart and her two children, Anne and Nicholas. The film opens when she receives three applicants for house jobs, an elderly tacit grounds-keeper named Mr Turkle, a deaf and dumb adolescent, and the lady who seems to lead the group, Bertha Mills, played, in a remarkable performance, by Fionula Fllanigan. Mrs Mills is the kind of character that immediately strikes the viewer as very competent in her job while the eventuality of her vileness is better conveyed by the peculiarity of her workmates. what's more, Mrs Mills' personality, very calm and professional, efficiently contrasts with Grace's more natural behavior as a loving and caring mother, trying to hide her excitability behind a mask of aristocratic-like composure.It's hard to figure the period of the film until Grace mentions that her husband is fighting in Europe: it's WWII, the film is set in a mysterious foggy island in Britain, and we ought to believe her. Now, why would the mother of two kids endure such a spooky location? the answer is immediately given, setting at the same time, the tone of the film. Her two kids suffer an extremely rare syndrome, they are photosensitive, which means they can't be exposed to sunlight without being victims of irremediable symptoms. Therefore the mansion's activity is driven by a special but indispensable routine implying to close all the doors with a key, whenever someone gets in or out. This information is vital, and plays as an interesting display of smart writing in the way it distracts us from many precocious interrogations, such as why are all the three servants dressed in a very old-fashion way.I mentioned in the early paragraph the atmosphere of the film and, no pun intended, it's indeed the key element that drives the film. The atmosphere is so intense that we don't need to be scared, because we constantly keep our guard up, it's the kind of situations so calm we know something will happen. Yet everything remains desperately quiet, and as the movie progresses, all we have are little doses of thrills, through apparitions, voices, screams, encounters with mysterious presences, and the macabre discovery of photographs showing dead people, but no death, no gore, no fights. The secret of ""The Others"" is to works as an efficient set-up whose sensational impact would ineivtably rely on the climax, so all we have to do is to be patient, and collect all the hints in order to know what to expect and this is what communicates the thrilling effect of the filmThe atmosphere is carried by a shadowy external photography and a powerful cinematography whose use of lights transforms the vastness of a mansion into a sum of little closed places, conveying the disturbing feeling of a suffocating paranoia. The house is so big yet feels so small while the mysterious and haunting presence of 'strangers' make the whole setting totally unsettling. And the force of the film is within the story as it features characters who are apparently forced to live in this mansion for vital reasons, and the satisfying resolution would either be a way to chase the others, or to be chased, but we all know the confrontation is inevitable. ""The Others""' suspense works on a Hitchcockian level, even more effective because we really don't know what to expect, and take it from someone who saw it each time with different persons, no one ever guesses the ending, and neither did I.But it would be unfair and untrue to imply that ""The Others"" only works thanks to the ending, the narrative evolves around an emotional core within the story of a mother who tries to protect her two children. And the conflict in ""The Others"" is not just between two different kinds of presences in a same house, but the psychological consequence through the torment invading the heart of a woman, torn between her maternal instinct and a terrible secret belonging to the past and profoundly affecting the present. Nicole Kidman magnificently embodies the vulnerability of a woman left alone and totally alienated by too much responsibility. And Mrs Mills represents the perfect counterpart to Grace's hellish condition and while she gets closer to Anne, and Grace's behavior becomes more suspicious, the notion of vileness goes back and forth and we wait until the moment it will finally determine who the real antagonist is  if there ever is one.All in all, it's hard to know who is the straight person of this series of incidents when emotions are so powerfully engaged. ""The Others"" is a remarkable chronicle of a dramatic family story involving a woman and two kids, one strong-minded and free-spirited little girl and her poignantly coward little brother. The two kids, beautifully portrayed, mirror the same contrasts between Mrs Mills and Grace Stewart and what's more, their condition plays like the metaphor of Grace's symbolic sensitivity to an even blinding and painful light. Needless to say that the ending doesn't disappoint and elevates the films to one of the greatest horror mystery thrillers of the last 20 years, working in every single level.So beware of the light, whether it's of a blinding sunshine or a terrible secret",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A film that makes you feel fulfilled after watching,This has to be the most entertaining movie i have possibly watched at the cinema. This and 'Saving Private Ryan'. The Others I can assure will keep you on the edge of your seat all the way through. The suspense is excellent almost straining on your senses to just give you that big scare that you actually want. The jist of the plot is fairly straight forward but the film itself is truly out of this world.Nicole Kidman is a mother of two living in a huge but pretty much scary house who is waiting for her husband to return from war. Her children have some sort of condition where they cannot be exposed to direct sunlight which can harm and possibly kill them. Therefore for the majority of the film they have to stay in dark rooms with candles as the only light source almost living like vampires.The candles in the house only add to the intensity of most of the scary scenes eg. was that shadow moving something or was it just a shadow flikering from the candle. These questions you cant help but ask your self throughout the film. Even during the day you cant escape from the scary atmosphere with the curtains pulled in every room and the lingering fog which never lets up.On the whole this film is fantastic. it's not just an excellent horror film it's an excellent film. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and is a very sexy women and her kids do there job especialy the small girl who was the better of the two also the the actress from 'Waking Ned' Mrs Flanangan was also great.On a whole again this film you should watch. My girlfriend almost gave me a blood clot on my arm she was so scared.,7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Flawless,"This movie is 20 years old and I've been aware of the The Big Twist for at least 10. I watched it for the first time in my life yesterday and thought it was absolutely (per the title of this review) flawless - never put a foot wrong, not a line out of place, just perfect, the concept itself is not that original, but the way it is presented is just immaculate. Moreover, because I knew ""the punchline"" I was able to pick up some clues immediately, but it didn't spoil the fun - it enhanced it.A must-see not just for fans of horror, but for fans or the best that modern cinema can offer.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Bof !,"Definitely overrated by the critics. This movie may be a masterpiece in comparison with most gore movies with liters on blood shed on every plan, but apart from that, it is quite dull and finally not so thrilling. Remove the ""sudden noise"" effects that make us jump a little, and you'll discover that there is nothing left to scare us. In what the plot itself is concerned, it has a taste of ""déjà vu"" (the sixth sense, abre los ojos - from the same director -, el arte de morir - another spanish movie -....). So, how long will this kind of plots surprise us, really ?. If you really want to be stuck to your chair with thrill and atmosphere, watch ""Gaslight"", a movie which is considered as a reference for this one. It was shot by George Cukor in 1944 and this is a masterpiece !

Creative and Eerie,"It's good... mostly. Lol. This movie is a little hard to review because I felt like the setting of the story was great (love period horror), and the performances were great (Nicole Kidman is strong as usual). The story itself has some uniqueness to it, and I appreciate the ending. The reason for my ambivalence is that I watched it in two sittings because I started it late one night. But I wasn't dying to finish it. I sat on it for several days - watching other things in between before I came back to it - so I guess I found it a little slow. Still, it is a good psychological horror film with a period setting.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Others,"Nicole Kidman (in a spellbinding performance) plays Grace, the WW2-era mother of two. She was left behind to live in a rather huge chateau while her husband went off to war. However, after the war is over, Grace doubts that her husband will ever return. In the meanwhile, she takes care of her two light-sensitive children with the help of a few servants. But, strange events begin to occur in Grace's home. In a matter of time, Grace begins to fear that there are other spirits or ghosts haunting her home.To reveal too many details of the plot would ruin the magic that 'The Others' works on you at the end. It's a twist ending that grabs you and makes you see the entire film in a different way. The same way that 'The Sixth Sense' did. But comparing to 'The Others' to Shyamalan's 'Sixth Sense' could translate into disappointment. The trouble spot is in the pacing of the film. Like in Shyamalan's film, 'The Others' creates its suspension through the tension felt by its characters. However, Shyamalan was a mastermind when it came to keeping its audience riveted. In 'The Others', there are numerous scenes that go on way too long for their own good. Thus, at times the film feels unwatchable. No matter, despite its flaws, 'The Others' works a spell on you.Rating: 7/10 or (3 stars)",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hang in there for the end,"There is nothing wrong with a great deal of this movie. However, it does tend to move quite slowly with the story progressing very little, which is very frustrating.

Let me catch my breath...,"phew !!! OK, my breath is back to normal, i guess. This is the second movie next to ""The Ring"" to scare the hell out of me. The plot and the script are awesome. The cast is good too. Nicole Kidman did fairly well. Alakina Mann (Anne Stewart) did a wonderful job. Without any special effects, the director has given an excellent movie with creepy scary scenes. Usually, I don't get scared much. So far only 3 movies had scared the hell out of me and among then comes this one. The ending was shocking and it was a really good twist. I watched this movie alone at night around 12 with lights off. I almost screamed and jumped at certain places. I felt the shock and thrill rising in my chest to the top with much rapidity. It kept me completely glued to the movie.Horror fans, if you haven't watched this movie, rent this one and watch it. You won't regret it. It's a movie worth watching. I don't want to reveal anything here. Just watch it. Get scared.And, if you get easily scared don't watch it alone at night and particularly with lights off.

The Others,"Spanish writer/director Alejandro Amenabar made the intriguing gothic psychological ghost story. The Others.Set in Jersey in 1945 after the island has been liberated from the Germans. Grace (Nicole Kidman) is a brittle woman living in an isolated mansion with her two children Anne and Nicholas. The children are light sensitive so the house is always in the dark.Her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) has gone to fight in the war and is yet to return.There is a strange atmosphere in the house. The children talk about life, death and religion. They are concerned about their mother's sudden outbursts. In this atmosphere the servants have abandoned the family.Suddenly three replacement servants arrive.

Mrs Mills influence becomes dominant and one day, Charles suddenly arrives to join the family and departs just as quickly.The Others has a lot of foreshadowing and a few unnerving twists. Alejandro Amenabar gave a new lick of paint to the British haunted house genre.You can see the influence of movies like Rebecca with Mrs Mills as well as The Innocents and the hit movie The Sixth Sense.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
one of the best suspense movies of all time!,"The others is an extremely well-constructed film, sometimes slow (but that doesn't interfere so much with the continuation)It's amazing how the film is so well CONSTRUCTED: the mother who is extremely religious, the daughter who hates the religion that is imposed on her and the ""mysterious"" servantsthe photography is DIVINE the contrast of light and dark is very well used here (because the children are photosensitive) nicole puts on a real acting show here, the kids are very good actors (especially the girl) and kids being convincing in acting is a very rare thing, so that gives a little extra touch to the movie, the direction is very good, the atmosphere of the movie is wonderful without being over the top, and the script and writing are also extremely sharp.THE ENDING IS AMAZING!!!!

An exceptional horror movie,"This is a rare case when a movie is watched with interest even by non-horror fans. A non-standard plot, beautifully shot with good acting. The story is both frightening and sad. It all starts out like a standard ghost movie in an old mansion, but with an unexpected plot twist. After that, all the characters in the film open up to you from the other side. And fear for the lives of the main characters turns into empathy for their difficult fate. As a result, the film turns out to be a tragic story of one family hidden in a classic horror movie. Nicole Kidman perfectly played the role of a loving mother and wife who was trapped in fear and despair, which would lead to tragedy.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like The Sixth Sense and The Orphanage reside.,"Alejandro Amenabar's first foray into English-language filmmaking is a largely successful one. One of the most striking filmmakers to emerge in the late 90s, Amenabar is a skillful craftsman whose talent extends beyond directing into screen writing and also into film score composition. Born in Chile but raised in Spain, the director of acclaimed dramas such as Open Your Eyes (1997) and the Oscar-winning The Sea Inside (2004) gives us a fine addition to the horror genre with The Others, a mainstream production made with authority.The Others is assured of a spot in the upper echelons of contemporary horror cinema where films like Shyamalan's The Sixth Sense (1999) and Bayona's The Orphanage (2007) reside. In an uninformed reality, Amenabar's film comes across as a fusion between the two above-mentioned pictures. That being said, it would make more sense to chronologically observe the influences each has had on one another over the years. Similar to Shyamalan's film, The Others has a climatic twist at the end (don't worry, there are no spoilers ahead) which equals in ambitiousness but strangely unmatched in terms of shock value.The Others stars an excellent Nicole Kidman in the lead role as the mother of two children whom are photosensitive (read: allergic to sunlight) and must be kept perpetually in the dark (an intriguing plot device). The huge house they live in does have a sinister past of a ghostly nature. What seems like a straightforward ghost story turns into an exercise in atmospheric mood setting. Cinematographer Javier Aguirresarobe creates lingering, almost elegant-like shots of the exterior of the house which is nearly always hidden in thick fog. For interior scenes it is mostly lit by candlelight (a requirement of the plot device), giving an eerie glow that is both warm yet chilling.Speaking of chills, The Others has one prolonged spine-tingling sequence in the final third: the two children 'escape' from the confines of their room in the middle of the night only to find themselves in a small graveyard with suspicious servants pursuing them. The mood setting here achieves its pinnacle. Amenabar does stick to the rigid expectations of the genre, but he explores them with a fresh approach mainly through its unconventional plot.The role of darkness versus light is reversed in this film. Here, the children seek solace in the dark but are traumatized by daylight. Their mother, on the other hand, feels uncomfortable in darkness but is at ease when it is bright. This allows Amenabar to tap on the fears of the characters and to create tension in two extreme settings. The Others is clever filmmaking, boasts artistry and is clear in its execution. At its heart, it is a film about challenging one's beliefs and the need to stand true and firm when these beliefs are challenged.SCORE: 8/10 (www.filmnomeno.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Hype Better Than Real Thing,"I'll try to comment without spoiling anything.  I consider myself a very big fan of movies, horror and thriller particularly.  So when I saw the ads for this movie I thought, finally a good psychological, scary movie.  There's been so much said about the ""surprise ending"". I'll say this, if you don't see the ending coming half way through this movie, or sooner, then your dumber than a post (and that's insulting dead wood).  The visuals of this movie were nice and there were a few ""boo"" parts that left a few giggling with nervous laughter in the theatre after they were scared, but on the whole I was disappointed that the ending was broadcast so far in advance. My recommendation, wait for the rental or better yet cable or rent the original version of The Haunting, The Haunting of Hill House or The Haunting with Liam Neeson (a bad version but still more scary than The Others).",2.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Performance is important,"As a future film director, the look the film is different than any other drama. A space within the main house that was set us as if you were to sympathized with the house and its characters. The house has a scary heartbeat and breathes on the back of the necks of its residence. The atmosphere itself is one that plays to its own script and the director Aleandro Amenabar feeds on that but camera shot that can show the life of the house. Nicole Kidman's intonation and eye can speak and play off of each other. Since The Others is not the typical horror/drama film it was able to set up its own beat that it marches to very well.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
When the Fog Hides the Truth,"Honestly, if you're afraid of the dark, you're going to love this. The Others is like being stuck in a house with all the windows shut during a heatwave, except here, it's 100% darkness. Amenábar takes a Victorian mansion, cuts off the electricity, and boom! You're left in an atmosphere where even the shadows are scared. The film gives off a vibe that makes you want to check under your bed, even in broad daylight. Like, why does light always bring fear in horror movies? Here, it's the light that kills. The house reeks of unease, and Nicole Kidman plays a huge part in that.Nicole Kidman is fully committed-like, really. You almost wonder if she had a sleep crash during the whole shoot because she embodies this devout mother on the verge of losing it so well. She's as terrifying as she is terrified, and it's brilliant. When she starts to unravel, you're sitting there like, ""Okay, I'm going to chill with the lights at my place too."" You get attached to her, but at the same time, you don't want to be stuck in that Black Mirror house with her.Let's talk about the servants. When you've got Bertha, this old housekeeper who looks like she's got a resume as long as a never-ending day, you really start to wonder where she came from. She shows up with a friendly face, but there's that little gut feeling telling you you're not out of the woods yet. It's like she knows things about your life that even you forgot. She sends chills down your spine in a ""I'm nice, but don't push it"" kind of way. Basically, the servants hang around with a vibe so off, you almost feel like they're the real bosses of the house.The plot is tailor-made. It starts with classic horror themes-mysterious kids, a haunted house-and then, bam, it flips your mind in no time. The final twist? Honestly, even after seeing mind-benders like Fight Club or The Sixth Sense, you won't see this one coming. Amenábar makes you believe one thing, and when you grasp the truth, you feel like the joke's been on you all along. You end the film like, ""Okay, I definitely underestimated how deep this story goes.""Visually, it's a treat. It's like every shot was hand-painted. There's a real play with light-or rather, the lack of it-that puts you under intense pressure. The scenes are sharp, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the editing... flawless. Amenábar handles tension like a top chef during rush hour: just enough to keep you hooked, but without overcooking the whole thing.The Others is hands down one of the best horror films of the decade. No need for jumpscares to keep you on edge-just atmosphere, top-notch actors, and a twist that will haunt you long after the credits roll. If you haven't seen this movie yet, seriously, what are you waiting for?",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Eerily atmospheric and claustrophobic. Kidman is excellent.,"I went to see this movie last night, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Nicole Kidman gives an excellent performance throughout; she is really quite remarkable. While the movie does sag in many places, losing its flow and opening the door to boredom, it more than makes up for it with the twists towards the end. Obviously the film-makers were quite aware that many people are familiar with ""The Sixth Sense""'s twist ending - and the movie hence plays on this, introducing one twist, only to find out that that twist descends into another one. The acting throughout is flawless, particularly Kidman - who gives an air of dignity and class to her character. Comparisons to Henry James's ""Turn of the Screw"" are inevitable. Recommended.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A career highlight for Kidman - but still not a classic.,"Before I yammer on about The Others, let's first discuss the career of one Nicole Kidman, who I consider the most over-rated actress on the planet. Sure she is attractive in a ""Womanly"" way, as opposed to the million ""girl"" actresses that burst on the scene and vanish seemingly weeks later, but her decision making when saying yes to a movie is obviously abysmal.Thanks to IMDb I can say that these are Kidman's career ""highlights"": - Dead Calm (My initial typo said ""Dead Clam"", which I hope to option and sell to Hollywood for a million bucks.) - The Others That's it. I've seen at least a dozen of her other flicks and have been underwhelmed every time. Kidman is good-looking without having that one ""thing"" that you remember, a good actress without ever being the most interesting character in any movie that she is in, yet she is critically lauded and extremely well paid.Another thing: I am Australian and realise this is almost slanderous that I am fully bagging a fellow Australian success story, but it needs to be said that NICOLE KIDMAN IS INCREDIBLY OVERRATED.Late addition: I subsequently checked out Rotten Tomatoes and found that Dead Calm and The Others are 2 of her higher ranked flicks, followed by Eyes Wide Shut, which I have seen but thought was nowhere near as good as it was made out to be.So back to The Others, which after my rant is actually pretty good, more thanks to the simplicity of the story than anything Kidman does though.Set in post-WW2 on a British island, Kidman plays a mother of 2 young kids named Grace living in a massive isolated manor that is seemingly eternally surrounded by fog. Her husband Charlie, was a soldier in the war and hasn't been heard from for some time - perhaps already dead. Her 2 kids are around 4 and 7, the younger a boy named Nicholas and the older a sister named Ann.Grace is understandably very protective of her two children, who apparently have an allergy to natural light (read sunshine), and must remain indoors during the day and behind thick drawn curtains. In fact Grace locks every room behind her to make sure they don't wander out, something that is a bit of a contrived plot device in retrospect.So one day three strangers roll up unannounced at the front door, Grace assumes that they have answered an ad offering work and employs them all instantly.They are: Mr Tuttle – Gardener/Handyman, perhaps 60. Mrs Mills – Nanny/Cook, also about 60. And Lydia – Maid, around 30 ish and a mute.Grace explains that her previous help vanished, and she takes great pains going through the rules regarding her children to Lydia and Mrs Mills.So one day Grace hears a crying child and immediately assumes it is one of hers. Nuh-huh, they are both OK. Ann blames some other kid named Victor who Grace has never heard of so she punishes Ann for the perceived lie. After mutterings, random noises and scuttling upstairs, it seems evident that someone else is in the house, and after questioning Ann matter of factly explains that there are in fact 4 others including the afore-mentioned Victor.Of course Grace being proper and rational initially doesn't embrace this idea, only as the usual evidence of self closing and opening doors, footsteps, unmanned pianos that play and random voices sorta changes her tune somewhat. She demands that the three servants search the home and grounds for evidence.A bit of an odd turn of events happens about half way through that I won't ruin (though it makes little if any sense), Grace decides to go for help through the fog, but eds up becoming disoriented and lost, until she finds..Again I can't say, but it does seem that the hired help know more than they are letting on, and that again someone else is in the house. Aside from Mrs Mills, the help seem to be around more to give the audience and Grace someone to be suspicious of, as elsewise she would be largely jumping at shadows.The Others finishes with a decent turn of events that makes sense given what precedes it, but unlike The Sixth Sense it does not reward repeat viewings for some reason. I had far fonder memories of this film from when I initially saw it in the early part of the decade than after watching it the other night. In essence I realised that it was a film with one scare, that wasn't really scary anyway, and two revelations that are both OK, but once you know 'em you know 'em. There is little joy in revisiting this flick.However It does contain one of the (inadvertently I think) funniest lines in film history. Grace is once again seriously discussing things with her kids and in an attempt to comfort Nicholas says: ""You'll never go to war."", to which Nicholas in typical 4 year old fashion replies ""We never go anywhere."" Dunno why, but it cracked me up enough to rewind it twice.Final Rating – 6.5 / 10. This is worth seeing the first time, but if you've seen it before don't ruin any positive memories by watching it again.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Good Looking Spook Fest,"I spent the first half of ""The Others"" ticking off how it was similar to Hitchcock's ""Rebecca"" -- yeah, another isolated foggy Gothic mansion with secrets, another spooky, possibly crazy housekeeper, another high-strung lady of the house, and that this movie could also have been made in the late '40's.I got intrigued that first Nicole Kidman's character is sympathetic, then she's annoying, then a martinet, then sympathetic again (and looking great in close-fitting 1940's styles such that we should all have personal tailors like that, whew), in a fine performance as she carries the whole beautiful-looking movie.Then I tried to figure out what was really going on, started to pick up hints, got annoyed that some characters weren't giving us enough tips, tried to guess, got fooled by some things and appreciated what my friend spotted, and then just let myself go to the love-to-get-scared in all of us.The ending completely won me over.

Hitchcock influenced suspense,"Since his first feature, Amenábar has been characterized for liking the plots with suspense and a great commercial success. For this film, he fronted a minimalistic story but with lots of suspense.Highly influenced by Hitchcok imagery and visual style, this film suggests more than it really shows. The atmosphere is extremely well created, the international actors are very well selected and the fit very well to their characters, Amenábar was able to create a very suggestive atmosphere with the soundtrack and the script do not have any fissure.This film is clearly influenced by several masterpieces such as Robert Wise's THE HAUNTING or Hitchcock's REBECCA.In my opinion, THE OTHERS should be considered as the best Amenábar film (up to date).",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
What old estate in England is not haunted?,"Talk about a ghost story. This one has an interesting twist to it.

The movie is creepy and is sustained by the eerie mood and atmosphere. High suspense makes up for the small helping of horror. Some of the camera positioning made me think I was watching Grace Kelly instead of the equally beautiful Miss Kidman.This movie will keep your interest from the opening scream.

A little bit too The Sixth Sense for me,"Nicole Kidman stars as 'Grace,' the Mother of two photosensitive children whom reside in a large Victorian house in this great yet reasonably predictable film.Towards the beginning of the film things start to stray from the formulaic horror-film plot and from then onwards it does not look back. It is this most of all that keeps you watching  - if The Blair Witch Project scared you then this will scare you too.Personally, being part of the 'American Werewolf from London' generation only in-your-face horror frightens me but nevertheless this is a tempting film that urges you to keep guessing where the plot is going to go next. You may guess correctly on the first plot twist but the second will probably elude you. This surprisingly does not detract from the film and my attention was not detracted for a moment.75%",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Check Out ""The Other"" Classics!","Before I saw this movie today,I read the reviews & they were very positive & given high ratings,so I decided to see it. I was very disappointed in it. I was expecting alot more & kept waiting for something good & scary to happen for the first while.I found alot of it to be confusing. For example: What's the deal with the husband showing up from nowhere in the fog,and what was the purpose of him in the plot? Am I missing something? Also, how come ""Ann"" was the only one to see the intruders? I left the theater trying to figure it all out. On the other hand alot of it was copied from other movies & predictable. I did not feel scared during this film overall. It had only a few creepy moments worth mentioning. One of them can be seen on the 30 second tv spot.(Ann as the old woman with the white vail) The other is the photo album that Grace(Kidman) finds. That was creepy!Everyone seems to be comparing this film to ""The Sixth Sense"" I liked that better than this but,I was disappointed in it as well. If you want to see a true classic ghost story then rent or buy the DVD of ""The Changeling""(1980) starring: George C. Scott. That blows this movie away! Lots of scares & a much better story. Also ""Dark Places""(1973) starring: Joan Collins & Christopher Lee, is another well done scary ghost story with plenty of twists & suspense. There was also an episode of ""Unsolved Mysteries"" they did about ""Ghosts"" & one of the segments was about the ""Queen Mary"" being haunted. That scared me more than this movie! It was very well done & gave you chills up your spine & left you with a really creepy feeling.And I didn't have to pay $9:50 to see it!   I wouldn't say ""The Others"" stunk, but I wouldn't say it was great & worth seeing either. I give it a 4/10.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Innovative, lifechanging","There is a platera of movies that change your views on a topic in one way or another, this one is definitelly one of them. ""The Others"", is very good at playing on your emotions, enviormental storytelling and revealing its true colors in the background, instead of showing it to you up front. The movie starts slow, it shows you the ""usual"" horror setting, a family living in an old, big and mysterious house. Makes you feel like its just another of those movies that base your fear on jumpscares, but it couldnt be further from the truth. The events, the plot, and the music are connected with eachother, like dots in childrens drawing book.

Watch this!,"I rented this and recommend it to anyone.  It is the best ghost film since Sixth Sense.  Nicole Kidman gives a brilliant performance as a protective mother of two photosensitive children, as does Fionnula Flannagen as Mrs Mills, the housekeeper.  The film is brilliantly shot and the old house in which the story takes place makes for a dark (because of the children's sensitivity to light), almost gothic setting, complimented by Ms Kidman's gorgeous porcelain appearance.  The Spanish director, whose name eludes me, creates a beautifully chilling environment and employs some gloriously creative cinematography.Final kudos must also go to the veteran British actor, Eric Sykes, who despite his well-known deafness gives a well timed and classically executed performance as the rather dead-pan gardener.  However, my biggest round of applause belong, unquestionably, to the two child actors.  Both of them will go far.  They were both brilliant, but particularly the little girl who played Anne (she was hilarious).The only criticism would be Christopher Eccleston's short little cameo. Getting such a big actor for such a tiny bit-part, for me, just seemed to distract from the story.8/10!",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Kidman' moment,"Why some people get shocked by Nicole Kidman' performance at this film? It is really unaccountable. Are your eyes wide shut?Excepting Dead Calm, where she was demanded to show some centimeters of her splendid anatomy -and never it was too much  at the movie- Hawaian born girl demonstrates to cinema and theater spectators her gifts like entire actress. She did it at Batman Forever, To Die For, The Portrait of a Lady and, of course, Eyes Wide Shut, between others solids works.I didn't watch Arthur Schnitzler' play The Blue Room (La ronde) but people who did, said she deserved to win the Golden Globe to Best Actress. She made representations to Londoners and New Yorkers till exhaustion -she got a laryngitis- of five different roles.Being making Los otros in a wet location at Palacio de los Hornillos, Spain, she felt the effects of a injury in a knee after the efforts in a Can-Can dancing-girl part at Moulin Rouge previously interpreted. She flown to L.A., USA, to be cured and came back again to Spanish set till the end of shot.And all that only a very professional actress is capable of doing for.

"Taut, ghost story","To be perfectly honest, Alejandro Amenabar's The Others really brings absolutely nothing new to the ghost story genre. In fact, everything about the film has been done before. so why did I like it so much? Simple. The Others is still a very stylish and atmospheric film. It hearkens back to the days when a film had an actual story to tell and did so at its own pace. Not ruled by hyper fast cutscenes. In this way, the film slowly builds its tension as it gives the viewer piece by piece the clues to its puzzle. And all the while it keeps doling on the atmosphere until the film almost chokes from it. In short, The Others is a better film for how it goes about its business than for what its business actually is.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Moody and Brooding,"Movie Review:  The Others (2001)Towards the end of World War II, Grace (Nicole Kidman) lives in a mansion near the English Coast with her two children Anne and Nicholas (Alakina Mann, James Bentley) where they are waiting for her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) to come back home from the war.Grace is unbearably religious and does not believe in nonsense like ghosts which her independently minded daughter Anne likes to talk about, claiming to have seen and spoken with them.Anne and her brother Nicholas have an allergy to light; so the curtains must be drawn and doors must be closed and locked before the next one is opened, to keep the light out because the light will hurt the children; beautiful, pale sad children.There are no great special effects in this movie, it is very slow and i do not recommend it for those who need action.  Most of the time i need action and i do wish this movie had more movement to it, but i still enjoyed it. It is a moody and broody movie.  It is wonderfully heavy on atmosphere.  And It has a story.All the servants have disappeared into thin air and replacing those servants are Fionnula Flanagan as Mrs. Mills,  Elaine Cassidy as Lydia, and Eric Sykes as Mr. Tuttle.   They play the housekeeper, the nanny and the gardener.  But one quickly learns they are not what they seem.  Why do they return to this house?  What are their motives?Soon after the arrival of the servants Grace begins to hear noises and to sense something diabolical is living in her home.  Is Grace imagining these things?  Is Anne creating these effects in order to gain attention?  Are the servants trying to undo her in order to take control of her home and to hurt her children?Grace despite her rigidness and strictness has a vulnerability to her. Maybe too much vulnerability since according to her daughter she has once suffered madness.  Nicole Kidman plays her perfectly.  She can express feelings and thoughts with a mere look.All are perfect in their parts; and the dialogue is excellent in it's poetic feel.  This movie is not a special effects movie, it is a movie which takes place in your imagination.  It's a movie of feeling.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Boring, not breathtaking","In spite of the outstanding performances of Fionnula Flanagan (""Waking Ned Devine"") and Nicole Kidman (one bad movie after another), the film dragged.Amenábar developed the characters and setting quite early in the film with the ""light-allergic"" children reciting catechism and clutching a rosary at the direction of their fixated mother who practices psychological denial as effectively as her martyred saints who refused to deny their Christianity.So why did the audience have to wait so long for any suspense? For what did I need patience? The trite ending?Nevertheless, I still await an appropriate vehicle for Kidman, and I am eager to see James Bentley again.

Few facts,"Reading opinions in this forum concerning the movie ""The Others"" there's a few facts I feel obligated to correct. I guess most of the people who watched this title don't know the movie IS NOT a Hollywood production. It was done before than ""THE SIXTH SENSE"" and therefore it's impossible that the movie would have copied the idea of ""The SS"".Maybe specially people used to watch typical Hollywood productions find this movie different because of lack of the over and over again repeated special effects and might consider this title disappointing.I really enjoyed it. I am not specially fan of Nicole Kidman but I must admit that her work was refined and beautiful. Amenabar did a perfect job as a director, the kids were believable, the secondary roles were done with good taste and professionalism. The photographic was excellent.If you like to watch a good movie with something different than the typical Hollywood crab, this is your choice!my points: 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Right up there with The Haunting (1963 version),"I have always been a fan of GOOD horror movies, those that are suspenseful, not obvious, keep you guessing types.  My absolute favorite was The Haunting (1963) because 1) it scared the begeezers out of me when I saw it at a theater, 2) it was filmed in black and white- much more ominous, 3) you never really saw anything that explained what was going on.  I do have a precious VHS copy & have been hoping it will be released on DVD. When I first saw the trailer for The Others I was quite excited; this looked like the first possible successor since Sixth Sense. I saw it today; I was definitely Not Disappointed.  Nicole Kidman was luminous, reminded me so much of Grace Kelly; the entire premise of the children's disease was genius. The movie was in effect black and white.  Nothing was really seen.

Is Alejandro becoming the Spanish M. Night?  I hope not.,"After seeing Amenabar's stunning ""Open Your Eyes,"" I greatlyanticipated his follow-up, ""The Others.""  Unfortunately, hisEnglish-language sophomore effort is a terrible let-down.  It had alot of potential, and it was actually a film that I wanted to like - if itweren't for some unfortunate plot contrivances.Instead of weaving an intricate web of subjective psychology,horror and supernatural ambiance, in an homage to ""TheInnocents"" (and ""The Turn of the Screw"" on which it was based),the director gives us a shallow, contrived ""twist-ending"" thriller,which doesn't have a whole lot to say or offer.  In this sense, itwould seem that Amenabar shares a lot in common with hisAmerican counterpart, M. Night Shymalan - the denouement-meister.To the film's credit, the cinematography is georgeously gothic.  Thefirst half of the film generates a good deal of creepiness throughthe atmosphere alone.  As well, the performances are stellar -from Nicole Kidman's hysterical mother, to her pale-faced children.But again, it's amazing how much one lazy stroke in a script - inthis case, the ""things are not as they seem, but you saw it from amile away"" plot twist - can sink a promising venture.Where's a script editor when you need one?",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
FANTASTIC!,"For some people I may be exaggerating, but in my opinion it is the best psychological horror I have ever seen, even surpassing the sixth sense. I think this film is incredibly underrated by critics because of the Sixth Sense, which makes it seem like a ""copy"". For me it slightly surpasses it thanks to the great originality of the setting and the incredible level of acting of Nicole Kidman and the, unfortunately, wasted talent of Alakina Mann.Alejandro Amenabar surpassed himself by making his best film and Alakina Mann could have become a real star seeing her performance in this film and also in ""The girl with a pearl earring"".",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Not as usually as scary as such on an old house story but it is certainly well acted and splendid dialogue. Nice as ever to have a small part by Eric Sykes.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It could have been so good,"Nicole Kidman stars as a single mother of two, left alone in a large mansion as her husband goes off to war.  Their home is completely isolated and it is constantly smothered in fog.  To make matters worse, their home has no electricity, and her children are deathly allergic to sunlight.  In the first five minutes, this movie had all its ducks in a row, to create a chilling thriller.  It could have been so good, but writer/director Alejandro Amenabar failed to turn this wonderfully eerie setting into a scary movie.  It was like the haunted house that looks creepy and scary from the outside, but has nothing frightening once you get inside.Early on in the movie three strangers approach the house seeking work. Grace(Kidman) welcomes them in to work, commenting that her previous staff had recently disappeared.  Immediately we are aware that there is more to these three than we are being told. Grace's daughter Anne has seen people in her house that nobody else can see. Are there ghosts?  Or does an simply have an active childish imagination? The remainder of the movie seeks to answer these questions, with Kidman's character seeming to lose more and more of her sanity along the way.There are a few very excellent qualities about this movie, the first being the previously addressed setting.  Also there are very strong performances throughout this movie, which is extremely important sice the movie revolves around a very small cast.  Firstly, I am not normally a Nicole Kidman fan, and so to say that she was fine, is to say that she did not annoy me.  That is quite a compliment in itself.  Secondly, her children are wonderful. Particularly Alakina Mann in the role of Kidman's young daughter.  There were scenes between her and Kidman that I thought that she completely stole. Finally, Fionnula Flanagan as the elderly maid Mrs. Mills held this movie together.  Every time I got bored and disinterested, she would come on the screen and renew my interest.  I know that these are not familiar actors, but they were wonderful with what they had.  The problem was that they had very little.  This movie plods along with nothing really happening.The one other very strong quality this movie offers, is the final ten minutes.  These final minutes are wonderful and priceless.  I only wish that all of the writing leading up to it had been as interesting.  Unfortunately I can not recommend sitting bored for 120 minutes, only to enjoy 10 of them. If that ratio is fine with you, then enjoy those last ten minutes.Ultimately this is a movie with much promise, much potential, but sadly lacking in substance.  Thrillers must either create tension, or scares, and there are too few of either one for me to recommend this movie.  Wait until it's out on video and then you can fast forward as necessary.

Intense chills and an interesting ending...,"""The Others"" Review:Pros- A very scary and mostly fun thrill ride through a haunted house. Decent performances, by a good cast; and an interesting, somewhat original story-line help the movie. The ending is also very creative.Cons- Some performances are weak. The story is VERY complicated and confusing at brief points. A little disturbing in some areas. The setting is god-awful, which really makes the stroy less interesting.Bottom Line- A fairly good horror film with a decent cast and some spine-tingling sequences. You should, however, probably rent it, rather than see it in theaters.My score(0-10): 7",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Oooh - Australian actors,"A couple of movies I've watched lately, have all involved Australian actors. Heath Ledger in Brokeback Mountain, Hugh Jackman in X-Men, Guy Pearce and Nicole Kidman. I completely forgot she was an Aussie. Her portrayal of an overprotective British mother is incredibly good that when I played the DVD extras, that Australian accent came back on. Kidman, Flanagan as the lead housekeeper, the two young children especially give great acting performances. And like Ledger in Brokeback, when the acting is superb, and the story well told, repeated viewings are a must. I don't know why some people call it ""slow"". From the opening scream to the surprise ending, The Others kept me involved, not knowing if the housekeepers were diabolical or ""Grace"" was really mad, as her daughter suggested. Director Amenabar wrote, directed and composed the score for the film, which greatly enhanced the mood at certain scenes. The music gave a clue of what was happening but it was still effective. A really enjoyable nighttime flick, one that will make you shudder, and very well made.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I didn't know what to expect of the ending while watching the movie, and I was greatly surprised by it indeed. Of course I cannot tell anything about the plot without spoiling your viewing pleasure! Anyway, for the plot only my mark would be close to 10/10.Sadly the story develops very slow. In fact I believe that the first hour or so could have been told in half the time. That could have created extra time to raise the suspense or to put us even more on the wrong leg. The last half hour gives us what lacks in the first hour, however. The plot moves fast towards the climax then. Acting (especially by Nicole Kidman) is great. Photography is beautiful and the plot -as said- is very good.

Solid but predictable,"Solid but predictable, especially if one has seen other recent ghost movies. The resolution left a number of loose ends which could have been more imaginatively brought together.  The core of the film--the relationship between the living and the dead--could and should have produced something more than a not-very surprise ending.  The historical background--the German occupation of the Channel Islands during WWII--was merely used as a prop, not at a part of the narrative.  Similarly, the use of Catholic imagery and theology (which was often oddly misstated) seem to have little or no bearing on the story or its resolution.

It's a delight to watch, with its attention to detail and the absence of any blatant anachronisms or plot holes.When I watched The Sixth Sense, I was disappointed.

Gothic and weird. Worths to see it,"To be honest when I decided to go and see this film I thought that acting Nicole Kidman would be a nice and ""handsome"" film without having read almost anything about it.I was misjudging the director and the ""beautiful"" actress, because this important film from the Chilean/Spanish Amenabar is much more than a normal thriller or a ""scary movie"". The photography is rather gothic, and since the beginning there is a sense mistery around this ""haunted"" house. The lack of light which is a ""leit-motiv"" of the action helps you to enter into Amenabar's world. As soon as the action goes on some elements are disclosed to the spectator but you have to wait up to the end to understand the whole plot.Nicole Kidman is the right actress in the right role, a bit ""northernish"" and of course beautiful.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Scary ... how easily some people are to impress,"I suffered this over-rated film last night, so now you don't have to.  The plot is thin, shabby and largely second hand.

How unlikely and contrived are the McGuffins buried under the leaves?  People seem to have confused lack of pace and creakingly dull storytelling with ""atmosphere"".  All reviews mention ""the twist"", so you're going to spend a good minute and a half trying to work it out - and you'll be right!

Well Crafted Ghost Story,"There's not much that can be said about this film that won't give away the ""surprise"" ending.  I figured it out about fifteen minutes in, but this didn't detract in any way from the enjoyability of the rest.  If you figure things out, you gain a different perspective on how to watch the movie that makes it all the more enjoyable.  I enjoyed the music (and often the silence), which added to the creepy mood of the film.  The lighting was very strictly controlled, which also gave a feel of something otherworldly.  This isn't as fast-paced as most of what Hollywood considers horror films (things jumping out of closets and chasing you with knives), but this is no great loss.  True horror can only come when it's built up slowly and believably. The Others achieves this in several places.

A very stylish movie,"""The others"" is an entertaining horror movie that is greatly indebted to ""The sixth sense"" (1999, M. Night Shyamalan). The words that come to mind by ""The others"" are rather ""clever"" and ""stylish"" than ""original. Personally I find ""The sea inside "" (2004) a better film of director Alejandro AmenabarWhat do I mean by calling this film ""stylish""? In the first place the light. The two children in the film suffer from ""xeroderma pigmentosum"", which means that their skin is allergic to sunlight. Children with this disease are also called ""children of the night"" of ""children of the moon"". As a consequence it is always dark in the house, and this is very well done giving rise to very beautiful images, for example as the mother (Nicole Kidman) is waliking through the house with a kerosene lamp.In the second place the character of Nicole Kidman is designed as a real Hitchcock blonde. One would almost think that her name (Grace) is a reference to Grace Kelly.In the most frightning scene of the film Crace is looking for her daughter and is in for a shock when she finally finds her. For a chance this scene does not reminds me of ""The sixth sense"", but the shock effect is very much the same as in the end of ""Don't look now"" (1973, Nicolas Roeg).",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Good film, but too slow!","I must admit that I had not even heard of this film until my wife mentioned it. We only went to see it because of the high IMDB rating. I have mixed emotions about this film. It was most obviously inspired by the Sixth Sense, although it does offer a different spin on that theme. The acting was fantastic. I did not know Kidman was that good. The supporting cast was also equally as excellent, as was the directing of the film.But, this movie is sooooooooooo slow! You are left constantly, constantly waiting for something to happen, but get nothing until the last 20 minutes of the film. I found myself frustrated, and just wanted the end to come so that the movie would make sense. Fortunately, the movie does explain itself, but the explanation did not totally make up for the time it took to get to the punch line.That said, I would still recommend this film.

A cliché pioneer of horror plots,"I personally am not a big fan of the horror genre. Yet it has come to my attention that at the time I write this review, one the popular horror plot is the twist where the main characters that the viewers assume as the ones being haunted, are truly the real haunters themselves. And Now, seeing this movie about fourteen years after its original release, I think now I have found the original movie that set the trend for such a plot. Of the small number of horror movies I've seen, I can appreciate the surprise that the plot brings, especially in the part where the twist comes in. In my opinion, the twist served n this movie has the surprise level comparable to the one I saw in The Skeleton Key, even in the original Shutter, that Thai movie. Nicole Kidman played an stable role, successfully portraying an insecure mother with the burden of a lost husband and photosensitive children. Yet I don't think this was the best performance from her.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

top notch,"This is a real winner, and the only reason I cannot go with a 10 is because I had to fast forward and rewind a number times to try and understand what was said. It is full of whispering in thick British accents, not a good combo for me even with the volume full blast, and there is still a couple spots where I'm still not clear what was said. Other than that, is it a brilliant story that offers subtle hints to point to the ending but you'll still be surprised. IMO, Alakina Mann, the little girl who played Anne, upstaged the rest, though Kidman was plenty good. I sure hope this young British girl (near an adult now) continues in acting as she is an ace.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Clever, chilling, provocative.","Oooooh, scary movie? Well, not in the vein of, say, ""Carrie"" or ""Halloween"". (Scary gore-fests are a bit passé, aren't they?) No, this is an intelligent ghost story. The premise is not an original idea, but it's extremely well presented. Nicole Kidman turns in another effortless excellent performance without outshining her fellow actors, so we also get the full benefit of the fine contributions from unknowns (at least to me) Fionnula Flanagan as the housekeeper and Alakina Mann and James Bentley as Kidman's character's children. After seeing the faithful -but-tedious ""Potty Harry"", it's very refreshing to see child actors doing their job really convincingly and movingly. Meanwhile Eric Sykes as the gardener brings just the right combination of gravitas and ""Ho ho, I know what's going on and you don't"".The direction is mostly subtly effective, and very occasionally not-so-subtly effective, in particular during the ""Oh so *that's* what's going on"" pharyngoedema[1]-inducing scene near the end.Most of the time this film rolls along nicely at 8/10, but it briefly hits 10/10 with the afore-mentioned revelatory scene so I'm prepared to overlook the utter implausiblity of the premise and give it 8.5/10. Not an absolute must-see but definitely a pleasure to have watched it.[1]: a made-up term meaning approximately ""lump-in-the-throat""",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Slow-paced genuinely creepy mystery thriller...,"I remember watching the 2001 movie ""The Others"" from writer and director Alejandro Amenábar back in 2001 and remember it as a good movie. And I do remember how the twist to the storyline was a rather shocking moment back when watching the movie the first time. I haven't seen the movie since that first time back in 2001, so as I had the opportunity to return to it in 2022, of course I did so.I only vaguely remembered the events in the storyline, though the surprise plot twist to the storyline was something I never forgot. But I will say that the movie is still rather enjoyable and entertaining today, 21 years after it was released, and despite of knowing the plot twist. So writer and director Alejandro Amenábar did manage to put together something wholesome here with ""The Others"".The way that the storyline is constructed and slowly builds up suspense and thrills, while keeping the audience utterly in the dark and guessing at what it going on is just a stroke of brilliance, and it carries the movie phenomenally, even the second time watching it.The acting performances in ""The Others"" are good, and Nicole Kidman was nicely cast for the leading part. However, I must admit that it was the performance of Fionnula Flanagan (playing Mrs. Mills) that stole the attention on the screen, because she was just simply phenomenal in this movie.If you enjoy a properly written ghost story of the mystery thriller genre, then ""The Others"" is something you have to watch, if you haven't already seen it. And of course I am not going to spoil anything by giving away the plot twist, but it really is a great one.My rating of ""The Others"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Intense physiological thriller,"The Others (2001, Dir. Alejandro Amenábar)It's nearing the end of the Second World War and Grace Stewart (Kidman) lives with her photosensitive children (Mann and Bentley) in a large and silent house. After her previous servants went missing, Grace accepted the offers of work from three new servants. But since these three have entered the home, strange events occur, and Grace begins to wonder if it's her sanity getting the better of her or if there is something much more in the house with them.Intense physiological thriller with a fantastic performance from Nicole Kidman. This is how horror really works, as you literally sit in awe of what it could possibly be. Both the emotions from the central character can be felt within the audience, as the horror isn't thrown in your face.I think I've finished here, ma'am.

Now, I sit down with the remote in my hand while watching a video, volume up for dialouge, volume down for special effects.

Better the The Sixth Sense...,"If (when) The Others becomes a fairly popular film, then many comparisons will be made to The Sixth Sense. The only real reason that it would even be compared to The Sixth Sense is the shear fact that The Sixth Sense was the last decent psycologial horror film to come out. The Others is a completley different film, except for the fact that the children can see ghosts (or can they...) The Others, who's only star is Nicole Kidman, is a tense, creepy, and sometimes just damn horrifying, expericence. I wont give away any of the plot, it's too complicated, but I will say that where The Sixth Sense relied on one big twist to pull everything together, The Others has several. The Others is a film that was thought out, well written, and then executed with perfection. In reading other user comments, I have noticed that some didn't like the end twist. I personaly thought it was more cleaver then The Sixth Sense. But that's just my two cents worth.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Slightly predictable but well produced classic ghost story,"""The Others"" is a predictable (I guessed the dénouement from the basic premise) ghost story which is saved by top-notch performances from the cast and solid production values.Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a very cold and unsympathetic character. It's a brave choice for Kidman and she's excellent in the part. She's joined by a great cast including Christopher Eccleston, Eric Sykes and Fionnula Flanagan.There are a few tame scares but this is a classic-style ghost story and more traditional fare than Asian offerings such as ""Ringu"".7 out of 10.

The Best Psychological Horror Of The Decade,"Before deciding to right this review, i read the reviews on Amazon and on the IMDb. After reading these, I got so wound up about people saying that this film is not scary or is boring that i wrote this. This IS a horror film, granted not an obviously scary film or a slasher film. If you like films like Friday 13th then the chances are you won't like this. This is a very intelligent film and granted very slow, however this enhances the tension and the ambiance of the film.The acting is near perfect with Kidman putting on a fantastic performance. However for me Flanagan is the stand out star. She is both genuine yet creepy at the same time.Another reason why this film is so clever is that it is completely unreliant on special effects which is a very pleasing to see, and the isolation the character feels is emphasized by the location on a Gothic country house on Jersey.There are only a handful of characters which is another pleasing sight so you are not always trying to remember names. The children are very well acted although the boy has a tendency to be rather annoying especially in the last two scenes. You genuinely felt empathy for the characters and you cared about them unlike in recent films.As for the twist at the end, anyone who says they predicted the twist in the first twenty minutes, is lying. The ending is truly surprising and appropriate.I love this film and the DVD is one of my favourite in my collection. The film has replay value but is best watched when its dark.

Unusually Thoughtful and Affecting Ghost Film,"The reason Amenabar's work on The Others is so above the fare of a given ghost film is because it turns out to be a beautifully philosophical musing on death, how death is something even the dead are not prepared for, because the psychological fear assumed on earth overpowers the physical seamlessness the real thing may have. There is also an honest undercurrent of perspective on how religion may effect the mental state of afterlife, complemented by another concept that may or may not be hopeful or comforting to people, which is the idea that spiritual and materialistic connections in this life may carry over into the next.The film flows gently like the English countryside it portrays, patiently executing a brilliant build-up of seemingly purposeless events and phantom motives that serve as exterior for the perfectly coinciding ones that later reveal themselves.The multi-talented Alejandro Amenabar, who wrote, directed, and also scored the film, has crafted an unusually thoughtful and affecting ghost film. Nicole Kidman's nerve-shattered, heart-ravaged performance as the strict Catholic war widow who spends her life protecting her two photosensitive children gives just the right conservative, classical yet realistically drawn upon approach. Christopher Eccleston, playing Kidman's husband, may be quite dull, but Alakin Mann and James Bentley, playing Kidman's children, are either not from the assembly line of cryptic horror movie children or they're from a fresh batch.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hands down the best ghost horror I've ever seen,"Saw this a while ago but as I was thinking about the all time best ghost chiller this one is it. Maybe because I went in with no expectation it seemed even better. But if there is ever one film that will give you literal chills - this is the one. If it doesn't then I suspect no movie can give you a breathless moment.Actually the build up is very slow and feels dull but curiosity kept me watching, was she an abusive mother etc. MAny things will come to mind on what is going on as it can seem confusing in its understatement oxymoronic as that sounds...Then BAM! Chills like no other film have ever given me. Nothing to do with the excellent ambiance or script to give this a 10 just the plain simple fact that it gave me a shock like no other film has ever done. Not since I was a child watching horrors on the sly has a movie made me feel such dread.

"Excellent first class ghost film, a rarity","Not much time to write, but wanted to say that this is a first class ghost film, for people who like genuine suspense/chills, and a clever twist and interesting storyline. Most importantly for me, it is realistic and fulfills my belief in ghosts without overdoing the connection between 'living' and 'dead' worlds i.e. the whole thing is believable if you believe in ghosts unlike many so-called horror films which rely on silly sudden 'shocks' or effects or people with half their face hanging off but forget the underlying realism that is needed; you could probably find faults with it if you wanted to but if you want a creepy ghost film which has a sinister undertone throughout, and a few, although I would say enough, real shocks, then this is highly recommended. Yes there is a similarity between the endings when compared to The Sixth Sense, but that does not detract from the originality of this story; the ending in my opinion is absolutely superbly done, not a let-down at all. Also, well-directed and acted. The maid has a wonderful ambiguity about her, she is warm and understanding while also distant and a bit spooky - fantastically done.

Solid Piece With An Antiquated Style,"An old fashioned haunted house/ghost story done with a cast delivering perfection. It is the performances from all involved that captivate this story.

"Slow, Boring, Not Scary, Slow Boring..You Get The Picture.","What's really a shame about this movie is that it could (and should) have been a sleeper hit. But because of it's slow pace and lack of any scary jump-out-of-your-seat moments, the film falls to mediocre. The atmosphere was perfect for this film. Located on an abandoned island sits an old manor house with a cemetery next to it. It doesn't get much better then that for a ghostly atmosphere. We learn that Grace and her husband Charles are the owners of the house and live there with their 2 children Anna and Nicholas. The husband had left to fight in the England / German war and has not returned. There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. The daylight can actually injured her children and cause swores and burning if they stay in the light to long. Three strangers appear at the door looking for work. Grace had put in an ad for servants to cook and clean the old manor, or did she? Now, with all of this going for it you would expect at least 3-4 scary moments with the first hour, right? WRONG!! Besides some creaking doors and floors, a piano that plays by itself and won't stay locked and a paranoid Grace and her son, there wasn't a single scary moment in the first hour. There are only 2 scenes that will have you jumping out of your seats, and that just isn't enough. I was literally dozing off during this movie and my girlfriend was ""sighing"" wondering when something interesting was going to happen. As for the acting, Nicole Kidman did an admirable job, but little Alakina Mann who played the daughter Anna (in her very first movie), literally stole the show. This girl was brilliant. Not only was her dialogue spoken cleaning with precise timing, but her facial emotions were dead on. At times she looked very erie and subdued. Even the little boy who played Nicholas (James Bentley) did a wonderful job. Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), who did an outstanding job in Waking Ned Devine was perfect for this role and showed her acting talent very well. Nope..it wasn't the acting that killed this movie, it was the script.Everyone is calling this a Sixth Sense clone and in some ways, it is. Most people will figure out the twisted ending long before it gets there. I did! If the writer had let the cat out of the bag half way through the movie and then provided a new interaction between the characters, things could have been a bit different. Instead, the solution was told and the movie ended, just like that. Definitely wait for this to hit the video store. If this movie came out back in the 50's or 60's it might have been worth a look, but with everyone expecting a modern day ghost story, the film just doesn't live up to anyones expectation.

I've never been so scared!,"My favorite genre has the last 10 years been horror-films. Films that chill you to the bone, films that makes you not want to go to sleep.

"Sooner Or Later, They Will Find You","Alejandro Amenábar is among the brightest young filmmakers today. Though he has ridiculously been labeled, by some, as the next Pedro Almodovar, Amenábar surpasses Almodovar because he gives his all to a film and always stays true to the story rather than succumbing to meet studio standards. Amenábar is a passionate filmmaker. He really seems to believe in his work. His talents are not limited to directing as he is a successful screenwriter and music director too.'The Others' is his first Hollywood movie and yet there is treated in a non-Hollywood way. In this day and age when special effects like CGI are used in every film, Amenábar goes the old fashioned way and perhaps the only bit of 'contemporary special effects' he uses is the green-screening. In an interview, he once mentioned that the expressions he has drawn from Nicole Kidman's eyes are much better than what any special effects could have done and this is actually quite true.'The Others' is an atmospheric film. The director is clearly influenced by the likes of Kubrick. He succeeds wonderfully in creating a gloomy and chilling atmosphere using lots of subtlety. Lighting plays a key role both metaphorically and literally. Most of the scenes are either set in full daylight or sheer darkness. The noteworthy cinematography brings out the claustrophobia and loneliness and the breathtaking score adds to the spookiness.Often compared to 'The Sixth Sense', 'The Others' goes steps further with its subtle multilayered storytelling. It is much more than just a horror film because there is plenty of psychology and philosophy included in the story. Amenábar has written a solid screenplay with intriguing and thought-provoking dialogue.'The Others' is further blessed with remarkable performances. Fionnula Flanagan is terrific as the suspiciously creepy servant with a hidden agenda. Eric Sykes brings some humour to lighten up the very intense atmosphere. Elaine Cassidy too impresses with a subtle performance. Alakina Mann and James Bentley are awesome as the bratty mean sister and the scared little brother respectively. Christopher Eccleston too is very effective in a small role. However, it goes without saying, that top honour goes to Nicole Kidman. Kidman is sublime. The intensity with which she displays Grace's despair, fragility, anguish and maternal dedication is astonishing. It is a marvelous performance.'The Others' may arguably be the best in 'horror' movies but it will be wrong to classify it in a specific genre because it works on so many levels. It is an absorbing film experience and something that has worked for me even after multiple viewings. I have lost count of how many times I have seen this amazing film.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Excellent mystery horror movie, with an outstanding plot twists and unexpected ending.","Despite being exactly 20 years old, ""The Others"" is still a solid mystery/horror thriller that keeps the audience on the verge until the very end. There are some predictable scenes, but for the most part, plot twists are really surprising and the ending is completely unexpected, at least for me. Nicole Kidman did a good job, but I think that her acting is sometimes a little bit exaggerated, especially when she gets scared. Grace is a woman that strongly believes in religion and I liked that she has many arguments with her daughter Anne about deep topics. Alakina Mann takes a lot of screen time, while Christopher Eccleston who played Charles, is left a little bit aside. I wish that the director had balanced these two roles, giving a similar relevance. However, characterization is really good, the cast is small, so the movie had the time to really introduce and develop everyone in a meaningful way.What I really appreciated is that there is no violence at all in this movie, and yet it is scarier than a lot of recent thrillers. Director builds tension up with a certain camera movement, or with a specific shot, but there is no sudden loud music or noises, therefore no jump scares. Locations are chilling, the whole film is set in this enormous old English manor located on an island. This brings a desolating mood. The set is captivating and the production design is great.""The Others"" is a movie with a straightforward and simple plot that explores a lot of inner human fears about life, death and the unknown.

"Best supernatural thriller since 1999's 6th Sense, BWP, Stir of Echoes","This movie succeeds on a number of levels, but also fails to overly impress us with it's story or it's climax.First off, it is very refreshing to see a movie such as this at a time where recent horror movies have been the pathetic ""Forsaken,"" and the mediocre slasher rip-off ""Valentine."" What do we have to look forward to?  ""Jeepers Creepers"" (sigh).In this company, The Others may well go down as the best horror film of the year.The acting in The Others is one of it's strengths.  Nicole Kidman, contrary to what I heard prior to seeing it, gives a strong performance as the authoritarian parent who doesn't know how to deal with the freaky happenings in the house.  The kids both give good performances, especially the daughter, in what may be the best performance of the movie.  The housekeepers are decent but not outstanding.The lighting in The Others is really quite amazing.  The whole movie is lit by candlelight, and it plays out very realistically and adds to the atmosphere.  The cinematography is done flawlessly.  Director Alejandro Amenábar has shown he can film better than most directors today.The movie takes a long amount of time getting to the climax, but it keeps us interested.  Had it taken just a few minutes longer in getting there, the audience likely would have lost interest.  The problem with the movie lies with the climax and resolution, which doesn't quite make the trip getting there worthwhile.  There are good twists at the end, which I will not reveal, but at the same time we expect something more to happen which never does.  Part of the blame for that must go to the lack of important things happening leading up to the climax.Overall a decent but not great movie, which seems like a godsend to horror fans at a time like this.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Finally a ""horror"" film that doesn't rely on gore, Jason, or Freddy","I won't say much since there's lots of info on this film. I will just say that this was a fantastic film!!! Despite some people's comments that it wasn't scary, I found it wonderfully gripping and far more terrifying than any film in recent memory. Then again, I don't find the usual Hollywood Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street pap scary at all. Gore is gore and granted it can be appealing if you like that kind of film, but it's not SCARY. This is film is psychologically scary, especially if you have ever been afraid of being alone in a haunted house or even remotely scared of the possibility of ghosts. What makes this film scary is that it preys on your own fears in much the same way Sixth Sense did (another great film, better than The Others in fact, but only by a bit). And if you find it slow, then you are probably one of the sorry victims of too much MTV and instant gratification. If you like Hitchcock, Sixth Sense, or a horror film that engages your mind, then you'll probably love this film. If you hate it, then you'll probably take comfort in the fact that you can always go home and watch your collection of crappy Hollywood horror crap (ok fine it can be enjoyable in the same way a B-movie can be enjoyable, but admit it...it's crap) and unplug your brain altogether. Then again, perhaps a lot of you could fall into the latter ""sub-gerbil"" intelligence level. Often the worst films seem to make lots of money and the films of masters like Godard can't get a multiplex release.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The Turning of the Kidman,"It seems pretty apt that Kidman would replace Kerr in this subtly lifted inspiration from Henry James to the mind and talents of Alejandro Amenabar. Never mind that Cruise and Kidman were going through a divorce at the time, Tom still helped with the funding, probably feeling like he owed Amenabar one for letting him recreate Abra Los Ojas into the lackluster Vanilla Sky. The stirrings are creepy without being over-the-top, and the twist ending is plausible which makes re-watch palatable... though there's not quite enough character in the characters to see anything more than plot polishings when it's all said and done, Kidman does a fine job of providing an aura to the mother that's all but mostly absent from the script. We're never sure what makes her as she is and the history behind the family is as foggy as the island they can't seem to get away from. Oh man, another ten minutes of scenes just to flesh these characters out and we'd have a something of a Gothic masterpiece on our hands. So close!",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A story of life and death,"What's life? What's death? And who are the others after all? The living or the dead? You will not find the answers to these questions in the movie though it deals with them somehow. This a very original movie in its kind I mean the ghost story movies kind. It has a few contact points with other movies involving ghosts and children like for instance ""The Innocents"" or ""Shining"" though maybe not so scary like the latter(nevertheless of course a bit scary anyway like any ghost story worth of its title). But it has the advantage of having a very surprising end that will leave you almost breathless though not exactly horrified since it's even somewhat poetical. The acting is great not only by Nicole Kidman as the main character but above all by the two children that do extraordinary performances. The interior scenery of the old mansion where the story takes place is quite convincing and very much fit to the general atmosphere of the plot. A good movie indeed though not exactly a masterpiece because the story doesn't give great occasion to that classification in all its details since in these stories that mix natural with supernatural it's always difficult to make things logical and illogical at same time.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

It's not often that a movie gets it right,"This is an elegant haunted house movie in its purest, most classic form. It relies solely on atmosphere, creepy music and sense of foreboding, without ever resorting to those cheap and overused ""jolts"" that pops up from the side of the frame to scare us. The script is well-written and in certain cases it makes you think. I recommend watching this movie without any preconceptions of any kind, otherwise it might ruin the experience and surprises.I must point out that after reading several of the critics' reviews, I cannot understand those who claim that the movie is too slow. Why? Have they been so desensitized by movies with big explosions and CGI graphics that they cannot envelope themselves in a movie's atmosphere without a guiding hand? The comparison of this movie with The Sixth Sense is well deserved, and this I believe says a lot about its quality. Every frame and moment are filled with a thick atmosphere that never lets up, and the answer always seems out of reach until the very end. Interesting and hard questions are also being raised about our perceptions of the supernatural as well as religion, and the movie handled these issues very well with overlaying subtleness. I have to say that the movie is also nicely cast, the two kids are great and convincing without any hint of cliched sentimentalism about them. Nicole Kidman did a good job, she got better throughout the movie and in one scene looked positively ravishing.After seeing several of those special effects-laden haunted house flicks such as the remakes of the Haunting and House on the Haunted Hill, I was so sure that nobody understands how to do this particular genre justice anymore, and that we'll just have to resort to its teen-lite version such as Scream. Well thankfully The Others proved that with the right approach and thought, substance and style always go well hand-in-hand.

"Spooky and Dark, yet enjoyable","For a PG-13 suspense film, The Others is definitely a good film. Nicole Kidman's Religiously devoted character and her photosensitive children make the film very frightening. The film focuses on a woman and her two kids who live in a spooky house that they believe to be haunted(the film sets right around the end of WWII). I had lots of doubts about this film. But ironically, what I found put me in a complete awe. The film starts out kind of lazy. The first half of the film did not capture my interest, as opposed to the second half, where the beast of suspense and thrill was unleashed. I definitely enjoyed this film and it's once again proved that foreign directors have a knack for making awesome flicks.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Classy ghost story,"Classy ghost story that goes on a rather long time in what seems to be an over-acted, theatrical style.

Amenabar Achieves the Impossible,"Films that deal with the supernatural, whether in direct or implied terms, are more often than not disappointing, in that they rarely manage to deliver on their promise.  Moreover, films of that same school touted as being `scary,' as well, are usually even more of a let down; so a film that can truly bring a supernatural theme to fruition and be frightening-- joltingly scary even-- in the balance, is one to be celebrated.  `The Others,' written and directed by Aleiandro Amenabar, is a film to be celebrated.  Unlike most films of the genre, this is a true sojourn into regions beyond the known that actually takes you to that final destination.  And when your mouth is so dry you can't swallow, and the palms of your hands have gone clammy cold with sweat, you'll know you've arrived; that Amenabar has succeeded in taking you to that place where few filmmakers dare to even attempt to go. By the end of the film, it's clear that when Amenabar makes a promise, he keeps it.The Channel Islands, 1945:  World War II has ended, and in a picturesque country mansion, the mistress of the manor, Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), is at the end of her tether; she has not heard from, nor about, her husband, Charles (Christopher Eccleston) since he went off to war, and all of her servants-- including her children's nanny-- have inexplicably disappeared without notice and without a trace.  Caring for her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), without help, is beginning to overwhelm her, as they suffer from a rare disease that makes them vulnerable to light any brighter than the essential amount of candlepower, a condition that demands the utmost vigilance on the part of their caretaker.  And at the moment, that means Grace, alone, in a house by necessity shrouded in darkness.Help arrives, however, in the form of Ms. Bertha Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and her companions, Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes), and a young girl named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), in response to an add placed by Grace in a local newspaper.  All experienced in service, they are the answer to Grace's immediate problems, and she puts them to work immediately.  But it soon becomes apparent to Ms. Mills and the others, that something is amiss in the household; something to do with Grace, who seems to be having trouble coping.  Still, there's more:  Anne insists that she has seen `others' in the house, including a young boy she calls `Victor.'  And, according to Anne, Victor claims that the house belongs to him and those with him.  The real problem, though, is the fact that no one else can see him.  Only Anne. And it's about to take Grace to the very edge of what's left of her sanity. If, indeed, there is any left at all by that time.More than a supernatural thriller, what Amenabar has created here is a gem that stands out from among the rest because of it's sheer purity and brilliance; a diamond with it's own unique cut that dazzles the mind and the eye with it's perfection.  From the opening frames, he sets a deliberate pace and begins to sow the seeds of doubt and question, opening that Pandora's Box of enticement that allows you to consider that otherworldly devices are actually at play here.  In the quietude of the atmosphere he's so deftly created, he winds the tension slowly and subtly until the wheel can turn no more, and just at the point at which others films would fail because they simply cannot deliver on the promise of what has preceded, he hits you with the reality of what is happening, and in a way that will jar your senses.  He does not manipulate and he does not play games; he quite simply and directly delivers one of the best endings ever filmed within this particular genre, especially, and moreover, one that will stand against any of the best from any category.  Because, regardless of genre, very few films have ever delivered so well on what has been promised as the story unfolds.Nicole Kidman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her performance in `Moulin Rouge' this year (and deservedly so), but her portrayal of Grace Stewart is the one that should have put her at center stage and clutching the gold on the big night.  Her presentation of Grace is introspective, subtle and reserved; understated and convincing, she fills the screen with a dark charm that is reminiscent, and yet something of the antithesis, of Grace Kelly.  And her screen presence has never been more dynamic.  She enables you to feel her fear, anger, confusion and frustration as the drama moves toward the denouement, and it is Grace through whom you most experience the impact of that final, breathtaking scene, when all is at last revealed.  A truly memorable performance from the gifted and beautiful Kidman, and one that is destined to be more appreciated with the passing of time.Flanagan turns in a memorable performance, as well, creating a character in Ms. Mills that transcends the stereotype of one `in service,' and successfully adds to the aura of mystery surrounding the events as they transpire.  It's a portrayal that demonstrates how important a good character actor is, and how much it can add to a film.The supporting cast includes Renee Asherson (Old Lady), Gordon Reid (Assistant), Keith Allen (Mr. Marlish), Michelle Fairley (Mrs. Marlish) and Alexander Vince as Victor.  Riveting entertainment that will slow your breathing and increase your heart rate, `The Others' is an inspired film that offers one of, if not `the' most satisfying endings ever produced in the realm of supernatural cinema.  Amenabar is a magician who has performed the impossible:  He's made the `Super' in supernatural viable and real, succeeding where almost all others who have tried failed.  It's an awe-inspiring accomplishment from an accomplished filmmaker; and it's the magic of the movies.  10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Dejavu in many ways,"Not very original and in terms of the acting little convincing, yet stylish flick with a twisted finish that reminded me (and some of the other reviewers here) of ""The Sixth Sense"". Rumors spread that Amenabár wrote the script before ""The Sixth Sense"" came out, but even if that would turn out to be true, it wouldn't make ""The Others"" a more valuable film.Amenabár evolves a very conventional haunted house plot, with Nicole Kidman in the centre of attention, as she gives an above average but not compelling performance as a strict and at the same time desperate mother, concerned about her two kids. The youngsters are over-sensitive to light of all sources as a result of a rare disease. Since they can't be exposed to daylight, all windows of the inhabited mansion are permanently darkened. Three domestic servants move in and strange things start to occur, like the floor board creaks without anybody walking and the kids begin to hear voices and so on.The film is too much about Nicole Kidman's character and the kids aren't believable for most of the time, showing once again the difficulty of finding talented low-aged actors.

It was cool to see Tom Cruise listed in the credits. It brought back some good memories of a once-lovely couple.I started watching the movie assuming it was R, but had to close the movie and look at the homepage to see that it was PG-13. The movie is quite juvenile, and I think most horror fans will find themselves rather underwhelmed. If the film were released new today, I don't see any reason why it couldn't be branded as PG. Other than a few loud jump scares, there is nothing thrilling or horrific here.That said, the movie is decent for what it is. Nicole Kidman needs no introduction - she is the most elegant, polished, and sought after actor in the world for good reason.My only complaint with the film is the audio mixing. The film is 25 years old, so perhaps it didn't translate well to streaming platforms. Scenes often have a disorienting blend of overly loud music, crashing jump scares, and barely audible dialog. I had to rewind and turn on the captions to understand most of the Bible readings and general dialog. This film could really do with a remastering. With as popular as it seems to be, a remastering of the audio and an addition of deleted scenes would be a nice 25th anniversary for the film.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

When her daughter Anne (Alakina Mann, who holds her own strongly, playing off Kidman well) starts telling her she can see ""intruders"" in the house, Grace disregards it until she begins having terrifying experiences of her own. After the arrival of mysterious ""servants"", who aid Grace in her paranoia, it becomes clear that something is very wrong within the walls of her home, and she must take matters into her own hands or something far worse could come of it.

one of the best ghost stories in ages....,"Agree with other reviewers here that this was one of the best ghost stories to come out in a long time.  Why Kidman did not at least get an Oscar nom for her performance is puzzling.  The two young child actors were great too. Moreover, it's amazing Alejandro Amenabar not only wrote and directed the film, but wrote the score as well (with its heavy echoes of Bernard Hermann's VERTIGO score throughout -- most excellent!).While ostensibly a supernatural thriller ala THE SIXTH SENSE (which I also enjoy for different reasons), this story is really one big parable -- it's message is that organized religion does not hold all the answers for us in this life.  It's a subtle theme but definitely there, illustrated by two scenes:   when Kidman's character admonishes her son to pray with his crucifix and tells him that all will be well; and when she chastises her daughter during the school lesson for making the choice to deny Christ and that those who do end up in limbo -- these scenes are paid off brilliantly in the ending when Kidman's daughter asks, ""Where are we?""For any of this to make sense, you'll have to rent it and keep an eye out for the above scenes.Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Effectively bone-chilling, but there's more to it than that.","Rating: **** out of 4.Sadly, there are fewer and fewer movies horror stories like THE OTHERS being made nowadays. Ask even some horror movie fans and they might pick SAW or Friday THE 13TH over THE INNOCENTS or DON'T LOOK NOW any day, and to an even lesser extent, some of the horror fans of my generation prefer the PG-13 junk to any of those classic 70's horror thrillers. Well, it's a good think that once in a while, great horror movies like THE OTHERS come out and bring us back to horror movie heaven where we truly belong.THE OTHERS is one of the better horror movies to have come out in years. I can't believe I have only seen it recently! Consider this one of the movies in my ""Should have seen it earlier"" list. Director Alejandro Amenabar takes us on a psychological horror mind trip rather than the latest disposable PG-13-level release. It's scary but not in ways you expect. There are an occasional number of ""boo"" moments, but Amenabar handles them better than most; taking full advantage of our expectations and than catching us when we least expect. The whole theme of the story too is far more mature than most films of the genre. Perhaps it ain't as thought-provoking as, say, THE INNOCENTS (a film THE OTHERS takes a few notes from), but it's brilliant in its own clever, mind-blowing way.Having only recently landing a role in MOULIN ROUGE as a playful, sumptuous Can-Can dancer, Nicole Kidman takes an opposite turn playing a dark, fragile character as Grace, a woman who lives alone with her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley), in an old dark mansion while her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston) is away at war. Grace hires a trio of helpers - housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), a mute named Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and gardener Mr. Tuttle (Eric Sykes) - to attend to the house. Then strange occurrences start happening, prompting Grace to believe that the house is haunted by ""intruders"". Anne starts seeing a boy she calls ""Victor"", as well as an old woman she believes is a witch. Plus something may or may not be all right with the new help.THE OTHERS returns to the classic horrific atmosphere of those old-school horror movies - the candelabra-lit walks through dark hallways, doors being slammed shut by other things than the wind, and specters that look even creepier without the use of gruesome make-up effects. Even without the use of a lot of ""jump-out-and-scare-you"" moments (though there are a couple here), Amenabar keeps us interested because, unlike recent throwaway fare, he has an excellent story and an interesting array of tragic, unstable characters, and an atmosphere than effectively (literally) keep us in the dark throughout the movie.Amenabar has not made an outright horror outing since (he did make TESIS prior to THE OTHERS, but nothing else after), which is sad. The genre needs more like him these days, one that can perfect the balance of good writing, performances, atmosphere, and scares and delivering a ideal entry in the much under-utilized genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

I won't give away the ending, but suffice to say that with the plethora of ""misleading"" movies out there today it isn't hard to figure out what is going on.The whole of the movie is dimly lit and overly spooky.  The movie is set in a large manor house with curtains on all the windows to protect the children from the sunlight (they are photo-sensitive).  A constant supply of fog, austere costumes and actors who could sit for American Gothic complete the setting.  Frankly, by the time the real intense part of the movie started I was already inured to the setting.  And that was one of the great failures of the movie.  Trying to keep the audience on the edge of their seats the entire movie is a losing proposition.

"M.R. James, Finally Done Justice in Film","Excellent ghost story set at the close of the Second World War about a widowed mother, and her 2 children living on a huge, classically creepy estate. Things begin to go astray when a mysterious trio of servants moves in. Wow, pleasantly surprised at the reaction on the board to this, I expected people to hate it. Thought I was one of the few who still appreciated gothic horror. Of the spawn of The Sixth Sense, you have the abysmal Dragonfly on the one end, this, The Others, at the opposite. Might even be better than The Sixth Sense for sheer creepiness. It lacks the gore, and obsequious visual shock of TSS, but more so than TSS, sticks to the original game plan; to frighten us. I have found, the fright element in TSS by the end of the film is all but beaten out of it, as it becomes more of a human drama piece. Not so here. The Others is a more narrow ranged, and I mean that positively, exercise in good old-fashioned atmospheric horror. It builds slowly and brings you closer and closer to a very effective, and frightening climax. It relies heavily upon scenery, weather, lighting, costume...all of the old forgotten tools. Most if not all of the fear is implied, and left for your imagination to fill in the blanks. I like that.

The performances must stay true to the story after the final twist is revealed, but must not foreshadow what is in store for us in the final scenes.""The Others"" has another one of those endings that makes you want to see the movie again just to see if everything adds up correctly. Unfortunately, most people won't have the patience to sit through it for a second time. The film, directed, composed, and written by Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amendabar, contains a convincing atmosphere and knows how to build tension the audience can cut with a knife, but the timing is off. It makes us wait way too long for something to happen that will relieve the fog-thick suspense.   	 The film takes place on the secluded Isle of Jersey in the final days of World War II, where a young woman awaits the return of her husband who went to war when his country needed him. Nicole Kidman plays this quiet, subtle woman, named Grace, who spends her days and night taking care of her children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) in her gorgeous Victorian mansion. She hires a new trio of house servants to replace the crew who mysteriously disappeared. Then strange things begin to happen. Grace's daughter explains that she has been communicating with an unseen boy. At first, Grace does not believe her child, but when Grace herself starts to hear strange noises, and witness unusual events, she also questions the possibility of an intruder inside her home.""The Others"" lingers for a long time. It does get under our skin and create a strong, spooky mood, similar to that of the old-fashioned haunted house movies. The film makes us believe we are in a dark, lonely house, and that someone, or something, may be inside with us. Nicole Kidman's performance is contagious. She infects the audience with Grace's fear and suspicion. Easily one of the year's best performances, Kidman stirs the terror with a gripping, uneasy edge. The supporting actors do not steal the scenes from Kidman, she deserves the focus, but they still give her enough material to react to.It's too bad that more doesn't happen in the movie. ""The Others"" eventually becomes redundant-it's scene after scene of Grace walking through dark rooms and closing the blinds to her house-her children are allergic to the light (a plot element that doesn't contribute much to the story). The film also stumbles when a specific character enters the picture-the event is highly anticipated, but the movie doesn't know what to do when it happens. It's worth seeing because of the final revelation, the spookiness of the atmosphere, and the performance by Kidman. Alejandro Amendabar must think that with a story like this, the less you reveal, the more suspenseful it is. ""The Others"" proves a different theory: less is not more-more is more.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Accommodating the afterlife.,"Set in England after WW2, Grace and her two children, Anne and Nicholas live in a rather isolated mansion waiting for their husband/father to return from the war, but I they haven't heard from him since leaving. To make matters even more worst their housekeepers have just got up and left without any notice and the kids suffer from an illness were sunlight could cause them to badly, blister up. But suddenly three mysterious servants show up to work there and that's when strange occurrences start happening with the kids claiming that they're not alone in the house, but the uneasy Grace doesn't want to hear about it, that's until she becomes aware of the strange forces at work.The sudden interest in subtle, supernatural horror flicks can be attributed a lot to M. Night Shyamalan's film; 'The Sixth Sense (1999)'. This is my second viewing of it and I might be going against the grain, but I say this film is more emotionally engaging with such penetrating atmosphere and flawless performances compared with M. Night's mixed bag. 'The Others' is an intelligently stylish, sophisticated slow burner that plays on the little things to work up the increasing intensity that slowly strangles you with its grinding atmospheric air. Director Alejandro Amenabar manages to create a rich atmosphere from the shadowy grand exterior of the house to the blanket of mist that smothers the lush surroundings of the estate. But what impressed me most was the confident and sensitively in depth performances he got out of the small cast. Nicole Kidman raises the bar with an extraordinary performance as the rigidly, fearful mother. The two kids Alakina Mann and James Bentley are convincingly good. Then you got remarkable supporting roles from Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy. Christopher Eccleston makes a small appearance too. The story sticks close to the traditional, Gothic haunted house tale with the usual set-up with dead silence making way for sudden noises, poorly lit rooms, things going bump, fake scares and so on. But what made these things such a breath of fresh air is how director Amenabar had total control of his vision with precise timing to milk out its bold, suggestive thrills, which will totally put you on the edge just like that of Kidman's brittle character. The atmosphere ventures into a dreamlike realm but still keeping a steady foot in reality. While, in the imposing Gothic mansion the darkness fills every space with it creaking with isolation and tightly knitted quarters. These striking visuals and set-pieces are gorgeously shot with such skill and a good eye for detail. A powerfully streamlined score is generally enchantingly and when it strives for creepy scares it does so in an exhaustingly tense tone. The elegant plot illustrates an very intriguing mystery tale that's psychologically demanding with secrets crossing your path and many cryptic hints to what may happen. The film's major revelation might not be a huge surprise for some, but I for one didn't think it was that easy to pick up on.A chillingly subtle, but astoundingly effective suspense drama that pushes you to the brink with assured direction and very first-rate performances.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
By far the best horror movie I've seen in years!,"Normally I'm not a big fan of horror movies. Not because I'm easily scared, but because I can't stop laughing (which, for as far as I know, isn't the meaning of the creators of such movies). This time however it was a completely different story ... I don't think I've ever been so on the edge of my seat with a horror movie than with this one.The main reason why I love this one so much is because it reminds me of a story that runs in our family. It is told that my great grandfather once had contact with his dead wife during a séance. Apparently, details were told which only he and his wife knew about, which scared the hell out of him of course... I don't know how much of this story is true, but the movie certainly reminded me of it.The good thing about this movie is that it doesn't need brain eating zombies, gigantic spiders or other weird creatures that are supposed to scare me, while they only make me laugh. No, ""The Others"" relies on nothing more but a good story and excellent acting in combination with a great decor. I kept focused until the end, also thanks to the great twist at the end.I can't tell too much about it of course, you'll have to see it for yourself. I loved it and I give it a 9/10.

A Highly Underrated Gem Of Horror Filmmaking.,"Shrouded with a thick layer of mystery that cleverly unfolds over the course of its runtime, making excellent use of horror elements to encapsulate the whole film with a tense mood, and further enhancing its dark ambiance by capturing its low-light surroundings in a truly fascinating manner, The Others is one of the most underrated gems of modern horror.Set in Jersey during the aftermath of the Second World War, the story of The Others follows Grace, a religious mother of two children who have a rare disease that makes them allergic to sunlight. When three new servants arrive at their mansion, a series of inexplicable events are set in motion which convinces Grace that there is a mystical presence in the house.Written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, The Others packs in a highly gripping story that is smartly narrated from start to finish and is able to keep its mystery alive till the very end where it surprises its audience with a shocking revelation. The screenplay is no slouch for the characters & their arcs are elegantly handled and each added element only works out in favour of the story.The old mansion on a seemingly isolated island brings a creepiness of its own. The camera employs minimal use of light, sometimes relying solely on candles & its effervescent glow to capture the drama, and it is effectively carried out. Editing steadily unfolds its narrative. And the performances by its cast is thoroughly convincing, with Nicole Kidman & Alakina Mann impressing the most in their respective role of Grace & her daughter.On an overall scale, The Others is an outstanding piece of horror filmmaking that's patiently crafted, deftly scripted, elegantly shot, brilliantly paced, calmly scored & strongly performed and exhibits a wonderful balance in all aspects to deliver a genuinely chilling experience to its audience. And on the strength of its interesting premise & proper attention to characters, The Others is a welcome entry in the genre of horror that's absolutely worth your time & money. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great atmospheric horror film.,"""The others"" is one of the best horror movies of the last ten years.The story is quite simple at first sight:Grace Stewart(Nicole Kidman)lives alone with her two children,who suffer from photophobia(that is the disease which makes people vulnerable to light).The narration starts when the new family in servants arrives in the house... If you think deeper,the idea of photophobia is really genius!It sets a really dark and atmospheric setting where the plot takes place.Moreover,it is one of the very few films of its kind,which does not make you wonder:""Why the hell don't they turn on the lights?""or""Why don't they open a window""etc. The plot has many surprises,some of which quite predictable I must admit,but it manages to keep the viewers interest till the end.Nicole Kidman is quite convincing and shows that she can be a very good actress.

Spectral happenings on an estate in the Channel Islands after WWII (no spoilers),"RELEASED IN 2001 and written & directed by Alejandro Amenábar, ""The Others"" is a haunted house flick about a woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in an old manor on one of the Channel Islands with her two photosensitive children immediately after WWII. After three people arrive seeking employment, they increasingly become convinced that the abode is haunted.While this is a fantasy movie in that it depicts supernatural happenings, like doors mysteriously opening and closing, these types of unexplainable things have been known to happen. The movie is a serious exploration of what may really be occurring. The mansion seems sterile and there's a one-dimensional pale 'look' to the bulk of the picture, which was intentional for obvious reasons. Speaking of which, the perpetually fog-laden grounds create a nice ghostly ambiance.Everything hinges on whether the last act effectively reveals the truth and it does. The film provides intriguing food for thought.THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour, 44 minutes and was shot in Cantabria, Spain (exteriors of the mansion); Penshurst, Kent, England (The Lime Walk) and Madrid.GRADE: B/B-",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Lovely Genuine Horror Movie,"I'm afraid that telling a slightest hint of the plot will already give away what's coming when you watch the film, so I'll just give you the set up: A woman named Grace retires with her two children to a mansion on Jersey, towards the end of the Second World War, where she's waiting for her husband to come back from battle. The children have a disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight without being hurt in some way. She then hires 3 servants to help around the house, or mansion.Okay, that really doesn't give the plot, but as soon as you watch it, you'll know it's a ghost story, but this time, it's not mainstream! Well, isn't that original? I'm so glad they don't have those usual horror movie clichés and those huge amounts of gore. In fact, this movie doesn't even need special effects to make us scared because this movie is really creepy.If this can't be one of the best movies in 2001, it should at least be the best or one of the best movies ever made in 2001, if not one of the best horror movies. If you're tied of those PG-13 horror movies, this won't disappoint. It's like The Ring (in as good PG-13 rated horror films).I love this movie because it's like Lost, in which subtle clues are given away little by little until it reaches the twist ending. Believe me, the pay off is great, if you think this movie's pacing is too slow. I'm sure it's slow, if someone figured the twist ending already. If not, don't try to think some up or you'll get mad at the graceful pace the film is moving.Nicole Kidman gives a really great performance in here, as well as many other characters. The cinematography, the score, and the production, they're all great! This film really doesn't follow many mainstream movie rules.

Suffers from the UNBREAKABLE disease,"This movie can be compared to that of the SIXTH SENSE but suffers from the same fate as UNBREAKABLE. You could watch the sixth sense and skip the ending and still enjoy the movie because of its plotline. The ending is just the kicker that makes you want to see it again.Like UNBREAKABLE though, THE OTHERS has very little plot. It spends the entire movie with a setup for a ""surprise"" ending (which is not very surprising). Without the ending, the movie just states facts about its characters and the situations they are in (not what they are doing).This would have been better suited for a short (like a TALES FROM THE CRYPT type story). Stretched over the course of 2 hours, it is very thin. There are also some ""plot holes"" which took of a point for me. It is too close to others movies out there to get anything above a 7, but since someone may see this that hasn't seen any other movies that are similar, I gave it just that for its technical points.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"good, not great......","'The Others' is a movie that is extremely rich in atmosphere.  Kidman's character, Grace, and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a mansion that is constantly surrounded by a thick fog.  Plus, most of the movie is candle lit.  The light, and lack there of, plays a huge role in much of the movie, and creates a thick sense of tension and sometimes dread.However, no matter how good the atmosphere was, the pacing was a little awkward.  It was generally slow, sometimes bordering on being to slow, all building towards a supposedly startling conclusion.  I will admit that I thought it was decent, at least somewhat original and smart.  In a lot of ways however, it just wasn't worth it.You could probably talk to your friends afterwards about what made you jump, what didn't, and what you thought of the ending.

Nicole Kidman  Gave a Great Performance,"Thought that this film was going to go down the garden path like most thriller films. However, I was greatly surprised and enjoyed an entirely different experience. Nicole Kidman,(Grace Stewart),""Birth"",'04, showed her great acting talents and charming beauty. Grace opened doors and locked them constantly and never let any sunlight into this huge dwelling of a home where she lived with her two children. They used candle and oil lamps for lighting and the children seemed to drive their mother crazy. Grace was waiting for her husband to come home from WW II since the war was over in 1945.

Another winner from Alejandro Amenabar!,"'The Others' may be Alejandro Amenabar's most conventional film to date, but it is an effective and creepy old fashioned supernatural thriller, and continues the promise shown by his first two (highly recommended) movies 'Tesis' and 'Abre Los Ojos'. While I can't stand Nicole Kidman at the best of times I must admit she convinces as a nervous and overly protective mother trying to figure out the increasingly unsettling situation she finds herself in. This is arguably her best performance since 'Dead Calm' all those years ago. She is supported by two talented child actors (Alakina Mann and James Bentley, both making their film debuts), and a solid cast of character actors - Fionnula Flanagan ('How The West Was One'), veteran British comedian Eric Sykes ('The Plank'), Elaine Cassidy ('Felicia's Journey'), and (briefly) Christopher Eccleston ('Shallow Grave'). Genre fans will no doubt swiftly guess what is really going on, especially if the name Herk Harvey means anything to you, but that won't spoil your enjoyment of this well made, atmospheric and genuinely scary movie.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Hovering on the verge of horror,"""The Other's"" is an entertaining yet somewhat misleading movie; billing it as a horror movie is just wrong. That isn't to say that the movie didn't possess elements of the genre, just that enough of them simply weren't present. The movie's setting is very moody, and the fact that it takes place entirely in a relatively dark area makes the suspense level rise incredibly, and the direction is enough to keep you on your toes. The cast isn't one filled with big names - save Nicole Kidman - but the characters don't exactly need to be deep to fit the part. Kidman's performance was good, but seemed a little eccentric and dragged out during most of the scenes.All in all, the movie is more of a suspense thriller; it does deal with ghosts, but not in a conventional sense by any means.

A Big Disappointment!!,"I had heard good things about this movie and arrived full of expectation but unfortunately left thinking what a complete waste of 2 hours. The film is very slow and I was constantly waiting for something to happen but it just never does. Despite valiant efforts the film failed to create any sort of atmosphere, despite the fact it commences in almost total darkness I was very rarely on edge. To me the film appears to be a feeble attempt to recreate the affect of the sixth sense but it fails miserably. The 'twist' at the end is rather predictable and even if you do not see it coming it does not fill you with any shock, you will just be anxious to escape the cinema by that time.  The only glimmer of light in this dismal production was the performance of Nicole Kidman who does carry the lead role very well, although talk of an Oscar may be a little optimistic.

Very intense and moody thriller,"This movie looks and feels as if it could have been directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and thats really saying something.

The movie has a thick atmosphere, especially because of the foggy surroundings and the mysterious mansion.

A Movie Worth Seeing,"Creepy, spine-tingling, twisting, etc...these words plus many more could describe the nature of this film.  Set in an erie, remote house, this film uses psychology to thrill as opposed to blood and gore.  It uses the thoughts on what happens when you die and plays around with them, ultimately delivering a very pleasing film.  While in my opinion it took a little to long to get started, the scary enviroment, jump-scenes (not to many but when they occur, watch out), and the overall ending was worth the time spent.Overall, if you are looking for a suspenseful and respectable (not to often do you see those two words together when talking about a horror film) thriller, this is a good bet.

Overrated- but a decent watch nevertheless,"It's a little messy at times, and slow at others, but The Others (for the most part), is a very clever and very well acted little horror film- incredible reminiscent of many classic films from the past. Largely a main factor of this film is the Victorian post-war setting that the film takes place in. Director Alejandro Amenabar largely focuses on the atmosphere and visuals of the world around them, which I feel can be a bit defeating in the scheme of things. It isn't that the look of the film isn't well put together, but that it takes priority over the characters and depth of them from time to time. We don't need to see and hear so much about the postwar world, we can understand how they feel from the characters, and I wish Amenabar decided to spend more time and effort on that fact to make a more dense picture. Besides that, and the film starting out at a rather slow pace- the film can be quite clever. It isn't always the scariest, but it can be rather interesting to watch the story unfold nevertheless, with twists and turns at every corner- and an incredibly devout performance from Nicole Kidman. The characters are well done, despite the films flaws, and although there are a few predictable moments, I did rather enjoy the twists that came along- particularly the ones we see towards the end. In the end, The Others is far from a perfect horror film, but it does have its moments of genuine curiosity and great performances nevertheless.My Rating: 7.1/10.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Clearing up some misconceptions.,"The Others is ""obviously based on The Sixth Sense""? Because it's a ghost story? Please. Has anyone seen The Changeling? Not that it matters, because The Others is just like any horror movie: it feeds off the movies that came before it and attempts to make them better. It succeeds.The Others not only succeeds in weaving the classic Hollywood ghost story (music, atmosphere, sudden shocking scenes, scenes of dawning horror), but it also succeeds in creating a very good movie. Nicole Kidman is absolutely fantastic, as are the two children, and the direction of the movie is absolutely stunning.Classic atmospheric horror seemed to be a lost art, relegated to be remembered through replays of Vincent Price movies.But then came The Sixth Sense, bringing back the classic ghost story with a wrenching twist.Then came What Lies Beneath, adding more terror to a more realistic plot, with another stunning finish.And now we have The Others, a truly beautifully haunting ghost story. A truly terrifying horror movie, one of the scariest in years. And it is much, much better than its modern-day ancestors.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

A Ghost Story of the Old School,"Ever since the success of The Exorcist and similar films in the seventies, serious horror films (as opposed to the tongue-in-cheek variety) have normally been overstated. By this I mean that such films have been dominated by special effects, with plenty of blood and gore and everything shown explicitly. Before that, however,there was a tradition of making more subtle, understated horror films, where the horror is implied rather than shown directly. Examples that come to mind are The Spiral Staircase and the original versions of Cat People and The Haunting.Although it is a recent film, The Others falls within this earlier tradition. It is set on Jersey in 1945, shortly after the liberation of the island from Nazi occupation. Grace Stewart lives in an old manor house with her young son and daughter. The two children suffer from a rare allergy to sunlight, which means that they cannot go outside but must stay indoors in darkened rooms. Grace's husband, who was fighting with the British Army, is missing, presumed killed. The children begin to believe that the house is haunted by the ghosts of an old woman, a married couple and a boy named Victor. At first Grace does not believe them; she is a devout and strict Roman Catholic, who dismisses belief in ghosts as superstitious. The strain of living in such a lonely, gloomy house and her worries about her missing husband and her children's health, however, are beginning to tell on Grace's mind. The strange behaviour of the three servants she has engaged is another source of worry for her, and she starts to wonder whether there might be something behind the children's stories.The film ends with a sudden, shocking twist (which I will not reveal). I have read in other comments on this board, and elsewhere, that the twist is an obvious one which anyone can see coming. I suppose that it might be obvious to real horror film buffs; all I can say is that it certainly took me by surprise. Too often a surprise ending merely serves to show off the scriptwriter's cleverness, without any thought being give to the film's internal coherence, but in the case of The Others, although the twist was unexpected, I found the film had a satisfying ending that made sense in the context of what had gone before.Establishing a suitably eerie atmosphere is an important factor in the success of a horror film, and The Others is extremely atmospheric. The film was shot in a rambling old house (actually in Spain, although it looks very English). For most of the time we see the house shrouded in dense mist. The children's rare illness, as well as being relevant to the plot, also serves as a device which enables the director to ensure that most of the interior scenes, even daytime ones, are suitably gloomy. Light only enters the house at the end, when the mysterious housekeeper opens the blinds against Grace's strict instructions. This development leads straight into the surprise denouement; the physical light of day and the metaphorical light of truth enter the house at the same time.There are some effective performances, especially from Nicole Kidman as Grace. Grace, who starts off as a strict, authoritarian parent and gradually becomes more and more disturbed, is portrayed as that very dangerous type of individual, the control freak who is losing control. There are a number of holes in the plot; it is never, for example, explained how Grace's husband managed to escape from the German-ruled island to join the British forces. The sudden reappearance of the husband halfway through does not really add much to the film. Overall, however, I found this an impressive and genuinely frightening ghost story; proof that, even in the twenty-first century, one can still make an effective horror film without resorting to explicit violence or stomach-churning special effects. 7/10",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
one of the year's best!,"All i can say about The Others is that is one of the best films of this year and also in the genre of terror and suspense next to the Sixth Sense. It is chilling, well written, great performances, excellent photography and above all great story! I just saw this movie yesterday and i'm still  thinking about the ending, you just can't imagine the end of the story, i was really impressed by it! i think Alejandro Amenábar scored big with this one, all i have to say is go and see it, if you haven't you won't regret it! especially if you're fan of the genre.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A great old fashion horror movie.,"This is a horror movie that is made on the old fashion horror recipe,it has an old house and lots of darkness and of course ghosts. The whole setting is simply great. This movie has some scenes that will literally make you jump of your seat.I remember one scene where almost all the people in the cinema jumped of their seats and covered their eyes.It is not a shocking scene,but i just catch you by surprise and it happens so quick. A very positive thing about this movie is Nicole Kidman,I have never thought of her as such a great actress,but this movie really proved me wrong.She is excellent in her role,and I think she deserved an oscar for it.The two kids in the movie is also really great. This is a movie you have to see.",,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Nice filmmaking, but not quite all there...","This thriller is very Hitchcockian - the comparisons are too numerous to mention, from the bird noises to the ankle camera shots (Kidman even looks like Hitchcock's favorite actress, Grace Kelly from certain angles!).  But The Others would have been a mediocre Hitchcock, and is above average modern American flick.  A lot here is taken from the Sixth Sense school, but not done as well.  Surprisingly, it's the story that's a bit weak and predictable here, bogging down excellent cinematography, directing, acting, etc.  The mechanics are wonderful.  Way too many scenes of Kidman in a gloomy hallway with an oil lamp... Enough already.  There are no secondary plots here of any interest - the main one may be enough to carry the movie, but not make it great.  As for the amazing surprise / plot twist at end --- I honestly had it pegged in the first 1/2 hour, and I normally am pretty darn dumb when it comes to ""figuring out"" surprise endings.... Maybe I was lucky on this one, or maybe there was just so much dead time during the film that I had the chance to think about it too much...",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
very refreshing!,"I just finished watching this movie and it was very very refreshing. I am a big horror/scary movie fan and even though I didn't think this movie was very scary it was very suspenseful and very well made. The reason it was refreshing is it's not like most modern ""lets scare them"" type movies. The storyline was well done along with all other elements that go into making a movie. It didn't rely on sex/blood/gore/cursing or any of the other things that film making rely on to get people to watch. It was a VERY VERY clean movie and was a nice step back from most of the modern movies. It also wasn't corny. Many horror/scary movies are very corny but this one was well done and doesn't leave you saying, ""I saw that coming an hour ago."" It's plot and twists aren't obvious so it leaves you curious and keeps your attention. It is a slow build up till the climactic end and well worth waiting for.All in all this movie will leave you very satisfied...I'm sure of it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Where did I put my keys?,"Kidman has been busy. The second film from this versatile actor in as many nights. While I fawned over last nights offering 'Moulin Rouge', I have to say that this left me feeling a little cheated. 'The Sixth Sense' had reminded us to think about a film while it's showing rather than after it has finished, or you may miss something important. This comes too soon after that wonderful film. The outcome too obvious and one too many ends not tied up evenly enough for my liking. Excellent performances from most though the children (bless them) were not up to anything like scratch, especially after seeing the likes of Haley Joel Osment at work. Jersey - 1945. Two sickly children and their mother are holed up in a mansion,  never seeing the light of day due to a rare light sensitive condition. The husband had failed to return home from the war, though he does make a cursory appearance later on. It seems that they (and the servants) are not alone in the house. The eponymous 'Others' are visiting them. Much roaming about in the dark ensues and there is much made of locking doors and things that go bump in the night. Needless to say, in an effort to match the previously mentioned Shalaman picture, there is a surprise at the end. It may have stood in greater standing if it didn't if the truth be known. The audience is expecting a twist these days and these people should know this and not make the surprise so darned obvious. I worked it out early on and spent the rest of the picture waiting for it to be announced to everyone else. Nice locale, nice score, nice acting but shabby writing and the plot was thin to breaking in parts. A valiant effort, but an effort unrewarded.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Unable to withstand sunlight, Grace's children must live in total darkness. In their isolation, they discover that they are not alone.

A Unique Ghost Story,"The Others isn't your typical ghost story; there isn't the quantity of jump-out-of-your-seat thrills you'd expect to find in a film like this. In fact, The Others is virtually chill-free for the first hour. But what The Others lacks in quantity, it makes up in quality. Instead of a roller coaster of cheap chills and thrills, The Others takes a much denser and darker approach to the ghost story.The Others takes a considerable amount of time to set everything up - almost too much. Halfway through the movie I wondered if there was going to be a pay off. Ultimately there is quite a pay off, but it takes so long to get there you might not feel it's 'worth it'. Despite the fact that I found The Others to be quite slow, I did enjoy it. Nicole Kidman does a great job as the neurotic and tortured lead, and she's backed up by a strong supporting cast. Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar lights almost the entire movie by candle light, something I haven't seen since Barry Lyndon. This gives The Others a soft and warm look that is uncommon to the genre. Amenabar also makes light a character in the film, where daylight becomes much scarier than the warmth and comfort of the dark. If you're planning on seeing The Others, I'd advise you to avoid reading any reviews which talk about the plot. The film takes a number of twists and turns which can easily be spoiled. This might be a good film to wait for DVD, except for the risk of the plot getting spoiled before you get a chance to see it.",6.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
When are they gonna get to the fireworks factory?,"I rented this movie when it was brand new. It was the sort of thing where I remember being able to guess the twist just from the trailers alone and I thought it looked very trite. But, once I actually watched it, I kind of remember sort of enjoying it? I think? It's honestly hard to say.Which is to say... 24 years later, I now found myself pretty bored. There's some okay environmental stuff, like a spooky old house lit only by lamps is always going to be a positive in my book. But the sheer act of waiting for the twist feels like a huge grind. I'd forgotten most if not all of the setup and watching The Others slowly play its hand had zero sauce for me at all.Especially because it's become such a basic, generic, fire-and-forget twist. It's the first twist everyone expects when you tell them, ""this horror movie has a twist."" I honestly thought The Others had more going on than this, but it doesn't.But hey. Nicole Kidman is good. Because when is she not? The movie might be three inches deep but she's doing her best to swim in the material. Could have done with less of the little boy, Nicholas, though. He spends a lot of time whining and sobbing and just generally being a wet blanket. I started losing my tolerance for it towards the end.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"A lesser ""Sixth Sense""","The similarities between this film and everyone's favorite Haley Joel Osment vehicle are too numerous to mention.  And the key difference between the two movies - one that allows ""The Sixth Sense"" to stand out despite Ms. Kidman's command performance - is that it was a viable movie prior to the whiz-bang surprise ending.  ""The Others"" (what a dull title) managed to scare and entertain me most of the way, but it didn't make much sense until our requisite surprise ending came out.  This is not a bad thing in and of itself, but my appreciation of the movie was blunted by its incoherence much of the way through.  That's my two cents, anyway.",7.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
This is SO good!,"Directed by Alejandro Amenábar, ""The Others"" is a psychological horror film that stands out for its atmospheric tension and masterful storytelling. Set in a remote, dimly lit mansion on the Isle of Jersey shortly after World War II, the movie follows Grace Stewart (Nicole Kidman), a devoutly religious woman who lives with her two light-sensitive children, Anne and Nicholas, in almost complete darkness due to a rare photosensitivity condition they possess.The film excels in creating an eerie and unsettling atmosphere through its use of suspense and a hauntingly beautiful score. The old mansion's creaking floors and shadowy corners amplify the feeling of isolation and unease, while the cinematography masterfully plays with light and darkness to heighten the tension. The story takes a psychological approach to horror, focusing on the psychological unraveling of the characters and the mysteries surrounding the house.What sets ""The Others"" apart from typical horror fare is its emphasis on suspense, mystery, and psychological depth rather than relying on gore or jump scares. The movie crafts a sense of dread by gradually revealing unsettling truths about the house and its occupants. Nicole Kidman delivers a captivating performance as a mother grappling with her children's mysterious condition and the increasingly strange occurrences in the house.Without delving into gore or body horror, ""The Others"" maintains a sense of eerie ambiguity that keeps the audience engaged and guessing until the climactic revelation. The film explores themes of perception, belief, and the thin line between reality and illusion. Its subdued, chilling approach to horror leaves a lasting impression and makes it a standout in the genre.""The Others"" is a testament to the fact that effective horror doesn't always require graphic visuals; it can thrive through atmosphere, storytelling, and psychological tension. If you're looking for a lesser-known horror film that plays with your mind rather than relying on visceral scares, ""The Others"" is a must-watch.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A scary, freaky and shocking horror film!","There's no way in hell ""The Sixth Sense"" will ever gain my approval as a modern horror movie since he forgot to mention people that he based it on a kid's show called ""Are you afraid of the dark?"" with the episode being ""The Tale of the Dream Girl."" A month later in 1999, more ghost movies followed where there was Stir of Echoes with Kevin Bacon proving to be more of an effective and original thriller. Other ghost movies followed but none will ever come close than ""The Others."" Nicole Kidman plays Grace Stewart, a widow to a soldier during the events of World War II who shelters two of her children, Anna and Nichols, in a mansion all by herself. Not only is she a fanatical Christian where she gives lectures and wants the children to remember certain things, but she doesn't allow the children to leave the house due to a skin disease they have. She hires help from Fionnula Flanagan who plays Bertha Mills, along with Eric Sykes (Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) and Elaine Cassidy to assist her. Grace soon discovers weird things going around in her mansion before asking the children if they been horse playing and the housekeepers if they've been touching things and moving objects around that weren't suppose to move.Suspicion turns to threats, threats lead to clues, and everything will be unravel sooner or later with a shocking ending.I'm not familiar with Alejandro Amenábar's work, but as soon as I say ""The Others,"" all I have to say is that it's one hell of a movie beating the hell out of ""The Sixth Sense"" with its amazing cast and its edge of your seat/heart pounding moments making it one of my favorite horror movies of all time.Like ""Alien,"" don't you dare see this film alone or in the dark.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Excellent acting, very good story","Nicole Kidman and Fionnula Flanagan were both excellent in this movie. The story was quite good, but the interaction between their characters made the movie for me.  I never paid much attention to Nichole Kidman until just recently.  I guess it was because she was married to Tom Cruise who, for the most part, I consider to be just an awful actor.  I was wrong to discount her acting ability because of their association. Still, I can't see what she ever saw in him and I'm not surprised that it's over between them.As far as other people's comments about the story being a rip-off of the Sixth Sense, I feel that kind of thinking is ridiculous.  Both movies where very good and I enjoyed them equally (maybe the Sixth Sense a bit more.)  It never even crossed my mind until I read some of the other IMDB comments. Why can't people just allow themselves to be entertained without being so negative and looking for fault with everything?

Classic Ghost Story,"It seems that in a long line of stinkers this summer, there was no hope for any movie to wow us, like 1999's The Sixth Sense, or last year's Gladiator, but this year we have a winner. The Others is a tense, carefully crafted ghost story,similar to the Sixth Sense, but different in so many other ways as well. The slow build up only adds to the suspense, and when finally you get to experience ""the others"" as I guess they are called, the whole audience burst into screams ofpure terror. The dimly lit scenes give you an odd sense, where dark is morecomforting than light (due to a disease that can kill the children if they are exposed to bright light).

This film is testament to the power of dramatic tension in horror,"Only once in a very long while does an excellent horror flick happen to be playing in that cinema that you swore was offering a horror flick when you paid that ticket price.  More often that not, what you are offered is a special-effecstravagansa that's like that cold spaghetti you stuck your hand into at the carnival when you were a kid.  It's sensuous, definitely horrible, but not really all that scary.Then again, once in a while, someone like Amenabar demonstrates what we all knew as kids: Nothing bites in the dark like your own imagination!  The atmosphere of ""The Others"" is, as you might expect, dark and cold, set upon the classic Lovecraftian tale of a tragically broken family trying to live in the past.  The tone of the movie is established *very* quickly (there is no time wasted!) but allowed to mature more slowly as bit by bit we discover more about Grace, her family, and the mysterious servants.  The tension rises slowly; ""The Others"" teases you with whispers and creaking doors, relying on the marvelous use of consecutively dark and bright rooms to generate a kind of confusion between the reality and nightmare that permeate the house.Don't worry though, when ""The Others"" wants you to jump, you'll jump.  My housemate was airborne, while I'd much more sensibly taken cover behind the seat in front of me.  I haven't done that since my Dad took me to see ""Misery"" when I was twelve!  The beauty is that it isn't usually the events themselves that are scary; Chainsaws, Baseball bats, and/or men hanging from the ceiling are notably absent.

It has no special effects or gore for that matter, so it relies on moody lighting, a tense score, great acting and storytelling - at some points in the film, a combination of these things actually make broad daylight seem creepy. My only snagging point is the disease that the children have - they're photosensitive - so any exposure to sunlight will kill them. This is the basic set-up that the whole movie is based on, at first it may seem like a poor excuse to keep the house in perpetual darkness, but gradually it becomes a revelatory plot point. Now, if you're sharp, this light-sensitive ploy will be a dead giveaway right from the start.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The masterpiece,"After ""Rosemary baby"" this movie to me ranks second in the excellence of storytelling, acting, directing, mood, suspense and terrific twist at the end. As a lover of horrors I know how difficult it is to do a good thriller, and as a matter of fact despite my love of the genre, there are only a few good ones I had actually seen in my long life. It shows you how difficult it is to do it well. Therefore I am still on the quest for masterpieces such as above movie. I was absolutely impressed and just wish that Alejandro Amenabar would do another horror as sophisticated as this one. And acting should also be mentioned as superb. Nicole Kidman of whom I am not a special fan,is to my surprise excellent in her portrayal of deeply depressed, psychotic wife; Fionnula Flanagan - fantastic actress with amazing voice and presence, and two other actors also splendid - the producers couldn't choose better players. And children were also great compared with typical Hollywood annoying kids who speak like adults and behave in the most artificial, phony manner. Please, watch this movie. It is not just your plain horror taking place in a spooky house but psychological drama about religion, motherhood and mortality. And dear Mr. Amemabar - make another horror. There are excellent stories written in Victorian times. Take one and show young viewers something besides vampires and zombies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Good or Great? Hmmm...,"War World II has finished, and Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne and Nicholas, live in a huge foreboding mansion. Grace sadly, and perhaps naively, awaits the return of her husband, who went off to fight. Currently Grace has no home help, but she doesn't have to worry for too long. One day three people knock on the door and offer to be her servants. Grace not only needs help for the garden and cleaning but also for her children, who are photosensitive, which essentially means they are allergic to light. Keeping the children away from all light, except for dim candle-light, is a hard job, and this has taken it's toll on poor Grace. But soon Grace will have something else to worry about.A weird noise here, a bizarre occurrence there. Strange things are happening in the house. Is it ghosts? Is it Grace's imagination? Or is she going mad? And do the three servants have anything to do with this, or are they innocent bystanders?When the credits started rolling, I didn't know what to make of this film. I had enjoyed it for the most part, but near the end I started to wonder whether the film really was as smart as it thought it was. I had heard the film contained a nice twist, and when I watched what I thought was supposed to be the twist I was greatly disappointed. But I was wrong, and the film had a little bit more to go. I enjoyed the twist, but I don't think it's of jaw-dropping quality. Which is quite like the whole movie, very understated. If you only like big action movies, this isn't for you. I enjoyed the slow pace of the film, and the score is very nice, along with the cinematography. I enjoyed all the performances, with the children being stand-outs, and Nicole Kidman as good as ever. One complaint is that I would have liked more scenes with Lydia.In the first half of the film there were several scenes, that while not boring, I thought weren't as amazing as the movie seemed to make of them. However, upon finding out of the twist I feel these scenes would have a bigger impact on me. So I certainly will be going back for a second viewing.I have seen the other film by writer/director Alejandro Amenabar, Abre los ojos, and enjoyed it greatly, and I look forward to seeing more films from him.Whether this is a good or great film doesn't really matter, have no doubt, this is a very fine film. I just didn't know how good it was. I couldn't decide whether to give it an 8 or 9. If I could, I'd give it a 8.5 out of 10. But I can't, so...8/10",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary Movie with more than a twist to lean on....,"Nicole Kidman has turned out to be an excellent actor, above most of the rest. Kidman plays the role of a single mother, trapped in a big mansion because of her two children's sensitive and allergic problems with sunlight. Suddenly ghosts are hunting the house. Kidman, her kids and the servants are disturbed by this and the movie shows us the fight on how they try to solve the problem. But the movie is deeper. It is about trust and believing. It is about what the past, present and maybe even the future can tell us. What is present anyway? It's all relative. > Kidman's son in the movie is really convincing and makes your hair raise on your arms and your head. Really worth watching. Lightning, music and photo is excellent, so is also the directing. A movie not worth missing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

And unlike ""Moulin Rouge"" Kidman's other triumph of the season, it will translate well to the small screen.There is one moment toward the end of the movie where a frightful person appears.

One of the BEST ghost stories ever done,"This movie is one of the very few examples produced by Hollywood of how a great ghost story may be done without gore or cheesy special effects or dead teenagers or some ghoul jumping out of a dark corner to grab the heroine.

The suspense is genuine and the audience really feels for the characters and their emotions.If Freddy and Jason and the other slashers are your thing, then by all means stay away from this film as you will be disappointed that no one is cut or tortured or hunted down in a screaming mayhem to die a gruesome death. If, however, you want a true, old fashioned, ghost story with well developed characters and a mysterious plot, then you will love this one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
The Others: A Return to Classical Supernatural Horror,"Nowadays in horror, it isn't enough to simply hint at a ghost. The audience is going to want to see the specter in the flesh. But that takes away the true fright of supernatural terror. The feeling of an otherworldly presence is much scarier than seeing it. After such classics as 1961's ""The Innocents"" and 1963's ""The Haunting,"" a film like Alejandro Amenabar's ""The Others"" is a warm love letter to horror.The film is set in 1940's New England. While her husband is away at war, Nicole Kidman's character, Grace, watches over her dark, foreboding mansion, as well as her children, Anne and Nicholas, who have a disturbing allergy to sunlight. Once Grace calls upon new housekeepers to tend to the mansion and the kids, things begin to go wrong. There is something the new guests aren't telling her, Anne is ""lying"" about seeing a little boy named Victor, and strange noises occur. But Victor isn't the only problem. There are others, uninvited guests that can't be seen. Is the house haunted or is Grace's sanity string beginning to loosen?""The Others"" is, without a doubt, an extremely frightening horror film in a repetitious world of serial killers and nude blonds. It got attention when it was released, but today, I feel like its popularity has unfairly faded.The film has an ominous feel right from the start. There is nothing happy about this setting. You can already tell that Grace is unhappy, and since her husband is gone and her children's lives are at stake, she is always on edge. The mansion is completely darkened, and leaving a single door open can bring in sunlight and trigger an effect on the kids. But in such a case when a door is left open and nobody has touched it, we, as an audience member, develop paranoia and fear of the characters' surroundings.Back in the day, not seeing a ghost was, and still is, more terrifying. Masters like Jack Clayton and Robert Wise knew that, and so does Alejandro Amenabar. We don't see a single apparition. Amenabar favors implication over shock, something Hitchcock would be proud of. It is an old formula brought back to fantastic life.Although atmosphere is a highlight of ""The Others,"" the casting of Nicole Kidman is equally powerful. She is beautiful as well as talented. Her performance sponsors a realistic fear, which is a mother's loss of a child's love or even the loss of a child. Bring ghosts into the mix, and you have a perfect recipe for psychological horror, thanks to her performance.The ending is definitely a more common cliché currently than it was in 2001, but it still brings chills. And so does the rest of the movie. Paying homage to the classical horror films of the 1940's, ""The Others"" knows what truly scares you, and I hope one day, that it won't be a film just for older audiences, but for newcomers who have been raised on slasher movies, also.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Yes, this movie has such a climax that may give you the same experience.. If this movie will get any negative points by critics it will only because of the entire movie moves with slow and dull pace towards its climax, but once you are there you ought to stand up and applaud as you might just never watch such end in any other movie ever again.

Dark and Brilliant,"This ghost film is incredibly well made. It is truly scary at only a few points, but even when you aren't screaming, this film has a very eerie and creepy feel throughout. There are also lots of things that can be interpreted in different ways. It seems as if the mother is mentally unstable, but there's no proof, causing you to question everything else. Is any of it actually happening, or is it just a grief stricken woman having a nightmare? You can't and don't know, which makes it a brilliant piece of psychological horror. It's been months since I watched it, and I still wonder what the true story was. A must see for fans of ghost films, twist endings, or anyone looking for a psychological horror film, as opposed to the cliché gore films that we see all the time.

A fantastic ghost story,"This is a return to an old tradition in the horror genre: the haunted house film.  Many would argue that this particular subgenre has already been revived by such films as _The Sixth Sense_ and _What Lies Beneath_, but I would reply that this movie, with its excellent writing, acting, and mise-en-scene, shows just how silly and amateur those other films really are.One of the main attraction of this film is Nicole Kidman, and that is rightfully so.  She is as brilliant in the film as she was in _Eyes Wide Shut_ (perhaps more so) as a mother who is at once religiously fanatic and deeply compassionate towards her children.  It is this sort of moral ambiguity that makes this film so delightful and fulfilling throughout.The visual effects in the movie, although subtle, are nothing short of amazing.  The foggy landscape around the house and the dark, moody tone of the entire film set a tone in which the scares seem perfectly in step with the rest of the movie, as well as the emotions of the central characters.Last but not least, the script is one of the best I've seen in a long time. It maintains a careful pace (neither too slow or fast- a pitfall that claims many haunted house films) while slowly building to an unforgettable and logically sound conclusion (which seems to be less and less valued in big studio films these days, although it is an element with importance that cannot be estimated.)All in all, this is terrific filmmaking.  Here's hoping we see more horror films of this caliber soon.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

the sublime thriller of all times: No other will ever reach its perfection...,"Talking about ""the others"" we're talking beyond any doubt about the best thriller movie ever! And not only! We're talking about a movie which twists to such an unbelievable extend the idea of what this kind of stories in art and literature represent, that makes you wonder if it could ever be possible in the future to have another example in this field that would add anything to what seems to have reached its absolute perfection. In ""the others"" we don't just have a story with threatening ghosts. We have an amazingly inspired twist, which through a breathless series of doubts and huge wonders, questions, and events which do not at all deviate from the scheduled flow of a very solid script, lead you finally to such a bitter, dark and – consequently yet surprisingly- extremely unexpected ending, that leaves you – and every other spectator- speechless on your sit. Yes, unexpected, because, though in a very artistic way indeed, the movie makes believe that it doesn't want to hide the truth, it gradually leads to it's perfect doubt, till it finally comes to its shocking, twisting revelation. There's no question that we're talking about one of the very best movies of all times! It's certainly the best for the ones who have a strong preference for thrillers.

It is a slow moving picture, in a lot of scenes it is very obvious to me that Nicole Kidman is acting, i.e., she was not convincing, and the film didn't frighten me at all! One good thing is the fact that the film maker didn't use gory scenes throughout the picture which is a plus, even though a weak one! The stars that stand out the most in this film are Fionnula Flanagan, playing the housekeeper/nanny, in a very good performance, and the daughter played by Alakina Mann.

"Amenabar saves the summer, let's hope he'll save this (lately) chaotic world of cinema","Amenabar is called to be the genius who takes the art of cinema to where it belongs: excellent writing, perfect direction and great performances. I hope he goes one in his way of originallity, lack of unnecessary effects and having the best of the actors and the characters. The film is not so long or boring as many people say. I think the people who say this is because they went to the cinema alone and they were simply greedy of the couples that were scared and holding each others hands and arms very tight because of the fear. For those who say that its a copy of the sixth sense, let's remind them that the story was written long time before the release of this film (just check out). NIcole Kidman is the actual ""woman on top"" (of her career). She's at her best in this film, as the rest of the cast. The name of the character (Grace) and her style is a clear homage to the late Grace Kelly, Hitchcock's muse. The whole film looks like an all time classic, like Rebecca or Vertigo. Its photography is near perfection, the music and the timing make your heart nearly stop, the story is really well thought and it makes you suspect of somebody, then of somebody else, then think one thing, then another, and at the end everything make sense...I can't tell yo more than that you have to go to see this great movie...

The tension keeps rising,"Watched this film for the first time since I saw it in the cinema and it holds up wonderfully. Even knowing what is to come, it is still a tightly-wound eerie pleasure.
The screenplay by Alejandro Amenábar is a masterpiece of structure, gradually revealing its mysteries, and playing on the audience's assumptions to create an atmosphere of dread.
The choice to make the children allergic to light is another master-stroke that gives director Amenábar the opportunity to play with darkness and light, and create a pervasive sense of danger.Nicole Kidman is great. Hard to believe this film came out twenty years ago, and she is still going strong. We take her for granted, and forget how brilliant she has been in so many movies across the years.

A classic ghost story,"""The Others"" is a surprisingly effective supernatural thriller / ghost story from the Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar (""Open Your Eyes""). It is a type of film where the less you know (about its plot), the more you will enjoy it--so, I will refrain from commenting on the actual plot of ""The Others."" However, I must remark that it is refreshing to see a horror film that taps into, and makes effective use of, the fears that are naturally ""hardwired"" into all of us (e.g. the dark, creeking doors, unidentified noises), instead of trying to induce artificialshock and terror into us (the usual method is: something suddenly jumps into frame, accompanied by a loud ""boom!"" on the soundtrack). ""The Others"" manages to generate an enormousamount of claustrophobic eeriness and suspense (most of the story takes place inside a house which has its windows covered with curtains) which are occasionally punctured by real moments of surprise. Nicole Kidman is present virtually in every scene and her natural and believable performance is a large part of what makes ""The Others"" so absorbing. This film should appeal to thoughtful horror fans who prefer suspense and mood over gore and blood. It is the best example of its genre since 1999's hit, ""The Sixth Sense.""",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Wow, what can I say. The best movie I've seen all year.","It was with some trepidation that I went to see the Others. Although I'd heard a lot of good things about it, I've just recently seen Jeepers Creepers, and had begun to fear that all of this years hallowe'en movies were going to suck. Over the first 45mins, I really thought I had made a mistake, little did I know that the film was slowly and cunningly drawing me deeper and deeper into the story. Although it is very slow to build, without this, it would have fallen flat on its face very quickly. You can't help but begin to feel for the characters and you also find yourself terrified of the house.Not only does this film encourage you to second guess the events as they unfold, it is constantly revealing tiny snippets of plot which throw you straight off the scent. In fact, it is so clever that any more mention of the plot will spoil the entire film. Suffice to say that the Sixth Sense'll never know what hit it when this film opens.Nicole Kidman was excellent. She really is a good actress, the nuances of her performance, and her interaction with her children and the servants is superb. Mrs Mills (can't remember the actresses name) was also great. The real revelation of the movies was the two young children. They gave great performances laced with terror, but with a humourous touch. Their childhood naivety conflicting with the things they have read and seen.Recently, I've noticed a trend for the studios to reveal far too much of the story in the trailers for their films. For example, all of the funny parts of American Pie 2 were in the trailer, slightly dulling their impact in the film. Those of you who have seen the trailer for The Others may think that you've seen most of the plot and that it will have been spoiled. Don't be fooled, the trailer hardly scratches the surface of this wonderful piece of film-making.Overall, I can hardly fault it. The acting is fantastic, the direction is superb. The lighting was uniformly excellent. But most of all, the plot and story were thrilling. Go see this film. But if anyone tries to talk to you about it, cover your ears and run away.

so they do make 'em like they used to,"Using absolutely no CG imagery, nor even blood or gory make-up effects, director Alejandro Amenábar goes old school here, crafting something that is truly special in a year like 2001, filled with meaningless, thoughtless work from directors who have proved they know better. ""The Others"" is the kind of picture (what they used to call this form of entertainment) that won't really course through your veins until after the end credits roll. Along the way it provides such great imagery, the kind you only see if you're really paying attention. For instance, when Grace is going through the box full of old photo albums, there is briefly revealed a ghostly face in one of them, as if it's watching her. Likewise the opening shot of one scene showing another ghostly face lit in candlelight (you remember the shot), that at first cannot be distinguished as real or a painting. All of it contributes to a singular purpose: not a shot wasted, no line of dialogue that isn't giving you something meaningful.""The Others"" is beautiful, not just in the way it looks, but thematically as well. Like any ghost story, it explores the spiritual. It doesn't tell you what to believe, but forces you to question the nature of death and hell.I predict that this will be the most underrated film of the year. Audiences have been programmed for too long to expect certain things. Too many films don't trust the audience enough to let them collect information and draw conclusions themselves. Too many films have spoon-fed us. Many will get to the end of ""The Others"" and say, 'what, that's it?' It's such a subtle work, it'll leave many feeling like there should have been more. For these reasons, this film will probably be forgotten before too long. And yet, it's the kind of film that should be studied for years to come, particular for its writing, direction, and cinematography. ""The Others"" looks like it could have come from almost any decade. The 'aughts' should be proud to have this film as part of its cinema history.Grade: A",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

The lighting is very important as well, in fact, the subject of ""light"" is so well mixed into the story, the dark feels safer and more secure than the light does. There are times when you long for the darkness, just as the characters long for the darkness (due to a part of the plot including a health condition of the children, which serves a basis for the mental thrill fest to come). To finish off this concoction, try to listen to the score, because it's very fitting.This is more of a drama than a thriller, though it deserves to be a thriller (it's scary), but the power of it's dramatic side comes bursting through. This is a beautiful movie, it has overtones of a more serious side, and it's a movie that hardly belongs in the horror section because of it's beauty, but it's too darned eerie, weird, and chilling to fit anywhere else.Finally, I cannot but mention the crew of the film. It is even a more fantastic job when you consider that the film (many people don't realize this) is chiefly a Spanish production. The production design by Benjamín Fernández and specially the cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe are extraordinary. Just as in the best painting of figures like Goya or Rembrandt, light and shadow reveal the objects and the people.I do not hesitate to say that this is really one of the best films of the year 2001. I am still waiting to watch Le fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, La stanza del figlio, The shipping news, The hours and Italiensk for begyndere, but I know it will remain amongst those at the top. A 10/10 is really fair for a film that has it all, a perfect machinery that arrives at a time when we seriously need intelligent films and not blockbuster deceptions. I can only say I hope its director won't jump to Hollywood in search of big-time projects that waste his potential.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"story, story, story makes this such a don't miss film!!!","The mark (for me at least) of a truly great movie is a well written story. Developing characters slowly, letting the story flow from their personalities. But the very best is that Amenabar does not rely on CG or gore or violence to create a chill down to your bones scary movie. They kicked it old school with this one and it is a real gem. Another rarity is the truly original story line. Full of twists and turns that despite your best efforts you absolutely do not see coming. I've also found I enjoy this movie better and better with each subsequent viewing. It simply begs to be watched again to pick up on all the nuances you miss the first time around because you are just simply too scared to pick up on them. Kidman is at the top of her game in The Others. Fionnula Flanigan is terrifying as the - well you don't exactly know what she is up until the end. It leaves you guessing as to the true nature of the supporting characters who play the new staff. Amenabar does a superb job with lighting and location. Isolated and utterly creepy the old house itself is almost a character unto itself in The Others. Mann and Bentley also deserve nods for their performances at such a tender age. If you can manage to hold off for a wonderfully blustery, stormy evening alone, it will only add to the thrill of The Others. I just had my 5th viewing of this excellent movie again tonight and it was every bit as entertaining as the first. This one is a true DO NOT MISS.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An excellent unique and original ghost story,"The Others is not exactly a very exciting film, but it is one of the best movies ever made in cinema history. The movie is a psychological thriller with drama and suspense mixed up that tells a ghost story with a very interesting twist never seen before. It's quite an original movie and Nicole Kidman is the best with her beauty and eccentric appearance. It has a very good script, nice costumes and excellent plot. The Others is a film that, although it does not generate as many emotions in me due to its slowness, I cannot deny that it is a masterpiece and that is why my final rate for it is a 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

This shows that you don't need jump scares or gore to make an extremely effective and memorable horror movie.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Kidman kudos.  Borrowed theme but still worthy of theater viewing.,"I've never been a Nicole Kidman fan, but found her disturbingly authentic here as a prim and proper widow on the edge of her coping skills.  Her neurotic orthodoxy and nunnery-brand discipline are simply crutches to carry her character through what would be a ghastly existence of having to raise children in a large, necessarily dark and gloomy mansion... while silently grieving the loss of husband and father killed the war.  Who wouldn't go a little nutty under such circumstances?The Others does borrow from the plot of another recent hit movie, but is different enough in style and execution that it certainly warrants a movie theater viewing.  I don't hold myself out to be a professional critic, so take it for what it's worth when I say that The Others is intricate, occasionally plodding, but certainly chilling.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Pant-wettingly scary!!,"I am a wuss, I am the first person to admit it. The Supernatural terrifies me. I even have to watch ""Buffy"" from behind a cushion. However, I was lulled into a false sense of security by the fact that this film was only rated a 12.'Huh', I thought, 'How scary can this film be?' Ever use the expression ""Famous last words""? Well, mine will go down in infamy.""The Others"" certainly gives proof to the fact that a film does not have to contain sharp weapons of any description, heavy breathing, or copious amounts of blood to scare the wits out of a person. This film definitely played on your subconscious, rather than conscious state of mind. But it was more than that...after all ""The Blair Witch Project"" was said to do the same, and to compare the two would not be dissimilar to a comparison made between double oscar winning Tom Hanks, and Tom ""Well, I played the back-end of a horse in my high school pantomime"" Joe Public. I can safely say that alongside ""Scary Movie"", ""The Blair Witch Project"" has got to be one of the most overrated, tedious pile of crap I have ever had to waste 2 hours of my life watching.""The Others"" is in an entirely different class.

One Of The Best Of Its Kind,"""Sometimes, the world of the dead gets mixed up with the world of the living"". That simple phrase, perhaps more than any, describes the sheer brilliance of ""The Others"", one of the greatest (and perhaps somewhat underrated) horror/thrillers in cinema history.For a very basic overview, ""The Others"" sees Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two photo- sensitive children (played by Alakina Mann & James Bentley) living in an old mansion in post-WW2 Europe. While waiting for the father of the house to return from war, the house is are suddenly intruded-upon by seemingly otherworldly inhabitants. Then, Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan) and Co., the home's former tenants, come a-calling and only deepen the mystery of what might be transpiring.""The Others"" is certainly a film in the mold of say, ""The Sixth Sense"", in that it all leads to a spectacular twist ending you likely won't see coming (especially if it is your first viewing). I won't completely spoil the proceedings here, but suffice it to say that director/writer Alejandro Amenabar expertly weaves multiple mysteries together and has it all climax perfectly in the endgame.What makes ""The Others"" stand the test of time, however, is that even when you are very familiar with the big twist, it can still be enjoyed again and again. This is largely due to Kidman's inspired performance, as well as an exploration of themes (family, childhood innocence, insanity, ownership of one's surroundings, etc.) that probe much deeper than the usual genre fare here. In short, even when you know what is coming in the end, you'll still be sucked into the character journeys upon every viewing.Overall, ""The Others"" continues to remain on my ""short list"" of greatest psychological thrillers of all-time. Its spooky atmosphere, layered mysteries, and uncommon depth make it a well-rounded exercise in suspense.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
intelligent movie-making,"The Others made me shiver. Indeed it was the old-fashioned fear that hides in every corner of a 19th century mansion surrounded by fog and such tension it's almost touchable. The Others could happen in any place or time but director Alejandro Amenabar has chosen the post WW II period to be the set of his two hour traffic. Grace(Nicole Kidman), a mother-of-two lives in rare conditions: her offspring has a disease which keeps them inside the house, curtains closed. The story begins to open after her new household helpers arrive. It is amazing how such little can sometimes turn out to be the best. Amenabar plays with our smallest fears which tend to get more frightening our minds twisting them. Everything in this movie is ment to be.The cast is troughoutly talented and wonderful. N. Kidman does another great part in a year which in it's diversity to Moulin Rouges Satine shows her changing capability. Grace does have the air of coolness surrounding her appearance and reminds Kidman's previous screen personas but this time it actually has a positive effect. The children, Alakina Mann and James Bentley, do have both innocense and confidence in their performances.The story is calmly revealed bit by bit but it manages to keep the viewer focused. Amenabar's directing is one hundred procent quality: He does not offer answers on a plate and visions and the story based on the 40's subtle atmospehere surprises -literally.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
See It! 8/10,"Since the '6th Sense' found success by slapping us in the face with the long lost 'shocking' ending, Hollywood big-shots have spent endless 'hours' (or at least minutes) trying to do it to us again.With that said, 'The Others' might be considered a clone (including opening up the same weekend as '6th Sense' did)--- However --- the movie is strong enough to remind us that a good film can actually be 'filmed' instead of 'generated' by a computer. No crazy graphics... No disgusting/flying creatures... and no tasteless and cheap Hollywood 'CGI' scares!Creative camera work, Clever integration of sound and music, a creepy cast in a creepy environment... and a version of Nicole Kidman that only Tom Cruise knows, all make for a chilling film.The movie traps you in an old fashioned way and probably should have been filmed in Black and White.

A ghost story guaranteed to scare the pants off you,"A great ghost story; genuinely scary, particularly if you are seeing it for the first time. It's a haunted house movie and the less you know about it the better. It's also something of a chamber piece. It has a small, compact cast and only once does it leave the house or its grounds, (and then only for a chilly walk in the foggy woods). Nicole Kidman is the mother protective of her children to the point where we wonder about her sanity and she's magnificent. It's the best thing she's done so far, (leaving her Oscar-winning turn in ""The Hours"" in the shade). Fionnula Flanagan is the matronly Irish servant who arrives at her door looking for work with a mute Elaine Cassidy and gardener Eric Sykes in tow.The young Spanish director Alejandro Amenabar both wrote and directed the film with great skill as well as composing the haunting score. He also gets great performances from the children. Indeed, this is the kind of movie that will appeal to children while scaring the pants off them.

Haunting,"With its sterling reputation as one of the best cinematic ghost stories since 1963's ""The Haunting,"" Alejandro Amenabar's 2001 film ""The Others"" was one that this latecomer plopped into his DVD player with great anticipation. And I am happy to report that all the positive word of mouth is right on the money, and that this really is some kind of great work. As most folks seem to have already discovered, ""The Others"" takes place on the isle of Jersey in 1945, where Grace (superbly played by Nicole Kidman) awaits the homecoming of her soldier husband, whilst caring for her ""photosensitive"" children and breaking in some new domestic help. Soon, though, Grace's worries are greatly added to by strange noises upstairs, the sound of a sobbing child, and the tinkling of a piano in an empty room. It would seem that her lavish mansion has been invaded by...spirits? Featuring an endlessly fascinating story line, interesting characters, fine production values, a creeping sense of dread and a good number of jolts, ""The Others"" really does make for a top-notch, classy horror movie. Amenabar not only wrote the screenplay for and directed this great picture, but also provided the film's lovely/creepy score. (The man must be some kind of a friggin' genius!) Fionnula Flanagan (who, incidentally, impresses me no end by dint of her having appeared on three ""Star Trek"" series!) is marvelous here as the housekeeper, Mrs. Mills; how wonderful to see her and Kidman giving two very Oscar-worthy performances in their many shared scenes. The picture features an absolutely brilliant ending that I was not prepared for (those who have read E.F. Benson's 1923 story ""Mr. Tilley's Seance"" will perhaps appreciate this ending even more), and that final shot of Kidman and her children in an upstairs window is just...haunting.

Original Thriller,"""The Others"", starring Nicole Kidman, sustains its classic horror setting without being super formulatic (though at times it is). It has a brilliant surprise ending, but some people may not understand it the first time watching.Grace Stewart (Kidman) is a stressed-out and enormously religious English housewife whose husband has gone off to fight in the war (I think it's World War 1). Her children are allergic to sunlight, and can only live by candlelight. The family lives in an enormous, evil-looking mansion on an English island, where it's always foggy and huge black gates protect the sizable estate. The house looms over the grounds, and - huge surprise! - there's a small cemetery in the back. Now who would guessed - a horror movie? With a cemetery?!!!! Anyways, Grace hires a crew to tutor the kids and be general servants. It's an odd crew, featuring a witch-like elderly lady, an equally wicked-seeming gardener, and a timid servant girl who never speaks a word (this part is awkwardly played by the actress). Once the crew is hired, strange things start to happen - including a stupendously filmed scene involving a forbidden piano playing in the night. Grace connects the bizarre happenings with the ever-odd crew, whose eccentricity seems to be growing with the surreality.Despite some awkward acting and horror movie deja vu, this is an amazing movie that will scare you long after you finish watching it.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

If you got Stan for the Grammys I recommend you watch this movie because it's 100% worth the watch. The whole time I was thinking of how the plot twist would play out and I definitely didn't expect that. If you don't like movies with jump scares I would recommend to watch this movie because there was not a single jump scare but it was very chilling. Highly recommend the watch!,8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great old fashioned ghost story,"I didnt expect too much from this film, but to my surprise i really enjoyed it. This movie is, thankfully, short on special effects and long on atmoshpere and mood. The setting, an old house in 1940s Jersey, is inspired (no Americans, thats not near Trenton)! The acting is first rate and the English kids are much less ""cutie pie"" than their American equivilants, which is a real bonus. This is a genuinely scary film, but not for those who enjoyed ""Scooby Doo- The movie""",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Substance defeats flash!,"In this new century and millennium, a return to intellectualism has made movie goers more demanding and raised the bar for movie makers.  The director/writer of THE OTHERS has answered the call and created a mental masterpiece.  This movie provides all the hair raising thrills that a true psychological artwork should.  What are missing are the tiresome effects that have dulled the viewers' senses and their wits.  Nicole Kidman outdoes herself and shows everyone not only what a great beauty she is (an uncanny resemblance to Grace Kelly in this flick) but also what a truly great actress she is.  The art and mood in this film are superb.  Each moment is filled with a cerebral nibble.  Don't miss this one! Regards, Jeneria.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Elegant, stylish and original moviemaking","I actually found this movie really good all though I had my prejudice thoughts. From the minute it starts (and the starting is really brilliant!) you get the image that The Others is not as cliché filled and normal kind of thriller. I liked the way the film was full of good little scary parts and not just a horrifying end and nothing happening in between like in many lame horrormovies. The music and the zooming with the camera were effective. And what a great idea it is to make a horror movie with two children allergic to light! Scary movies are supposed to be gloomy and grey looking and the allergy gives a ReAsOn why the movie is darkish.Nicole Kidman gave a strong performance and I was very pleased of her but mostly I was impressed with the two children. They were absolutely great, natural and true. Expecially the girl, Anne, she had a hard role in her shoulders but she handeled it like a professional actress.And the ending...of course I´m not going to tell about it because it is a delicious treat if you don´t know what happens in it. I WAS suprised!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Run-of-the-mill Gothic Thriller,"The performances are all marvelous -- most especially the young girl and Fionnula Flanagan.  Kidman was just a tad too flamboyant for me in spots, one scene in particular conjuring up images of Nancy Kelly in the Bad Seed -- but overall, she was more than up to the task at hand.  The suspense is real, and the visuals are quite well done.  The sound track, sound effects, make-up, and costumes are all first-rate.But, for me, the flimsiness (these days called delicacy and cheered by critics -- all things run in cycles) of the storyline and transparency of the twists make this an unmemorable time-killer.  If you're into this kind of movie, it's probably worth an 8/10 -- for me 6/10 was the right number.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Like Goobers for your brain: A treat,"I went into this movie hoping for a nice, old-fashioned suspenseful horror movie. I was rewarded with that PLUS some brilliant performances, nervous chuckles and emotional pay-off to boot. I am not a Nicole Kidman fan (especially after MOULIN ROUGE, ugh), but I thought she was sensational in this, or as Tom says, ""Nic is pitch perfect."" She really is, capturing her control-freak, jittery, yet deeply maternal character to a ""T."" With another, less mesmerizing lead performance, the kids would have totally stolen the show. Instead, they just add on to the fun--the little girl is like a BAD SEED aspirant and the boy is adorable. You feel for his terror as he's tortured by his big sis, his controlling mom and the house he lives in. To milk so much psychologically from such a basic premise, the writer/director gets a LOT of credit.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Not as familiar as some would think.,"The beautiful thing about this movie is its slow pacing. Most would write it off as boring, but to many, the pacing only adds to the tension. ""The Others"" is a slow-paced thriller that offers some familiar territory, but if one re-examines, realizes the differences are abound.First off, Nicole Kidman's performance is dead-on perfect. She enchants, much in the same way as earlier this year with ""Moulin Rouge"". She is one of the greats as far as actress go, and this movie displays her at her best.The story is confusing, but rightly so. So many unanswered questions that leave you wondering where this movie will go. Although sometimes it is a little obvious, the way they are presented never fails to surprise.Another bright point of this film is the mood. While most thrillers/horror movies rely on the dark to frighten, this movie uses light. This is due to the conditions of the children, where they are sensitive to light. There are many particularly frightning scenes in which a spot of sunlight sends chills down our spines. The film has a noir-ish look to it, and at some points, almost looks black and white.The twist in the end is what turns most off. But, to those who ponder it, they will walk away satisfied. At first you may think your experiencing deja vu, but relax. Its a lot more clever than you think.I've never been to a film that had the audience so attached to their seats, screaming and laughing at the same time. This is a rare gem in a particularly drab summer. See for yourself why this movie is so fantastic. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

slow just doesn't describe it,"With all of the hype, I was prepared for a truly great production. I was very mistaken. The Others features some excellent acting work, but the whole story drags so much that one truly does not care who or why. Turning the DVD off after thirty minutes would not deprive one of anything. Staying through to the end only proves that we had nothing to do last night.The big secret was pretty obvious by thirty minutes in and the final resolution was an ""OK, so what?"" moment.I know that the IMDB audience registers in a 8.1 I feel generous at 5.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Superb Gothic thriller!,"What can one add to a masterpiece?The cast is superb, the dialogues are perfect, the house is both creepy and engaging, and the rhythm is just as it must be.I had my quibbles about Kidman, but she surely shows why she could act so well in ""The Hours"". She's just great. Such a pent up neurotic would steer one inch and she would become a caricature. Instead, every gesture is perfect, every fit of hysteria just has to be there. Like every note in a Bach sonata. Her icy, statuesque beauty, allure and hairdo (!) make it all ""come together"". The scene in an unexpected sexy white night gown asking for love from his estranged husband is a small, very small gem :).Cinematography is BEAUTIFUL, I want to live in this house! (Unocuppied if possible :)). To all of us who have read ""The castle of Otranto"" in loony early teens, this was what Walpole was talking about :)!Horror is the contrary to gore. It's atmosphere, not ketchup. This is more of a psychological study (and a lesson in acting, let us not forget ""Fionnula Flanagan"" and Grace's bratty daughter. By the way, I LOVE everybody's English usage, and how it reveals class differences between ""Master and servant"". Body language too!This is a MENTAL drama, the plot wisely gives us SOME keys to keep us engaged, but never enough to foresee what's coming. At least not me! ""kate_hartshorn"" (Irvine, CA) is right: this could well be a practical case of a ""psychology of perception"" course. And I agree with Mr. Kleinman from Portland (also on Amazon) that one should better NOT read much before the film. I was lucky enough this time to only watch the pictures and a general look at the cast. Had I read even Amazon's ""plot keywords"" would have basically spoilt all the fun (as it has, many times before).I didn't really FEEL much for the characters, although I confess I suffered with poor troubled Grace. I give it a ten although, for I suspect it follows the ""rules of the genre"" that preclude any glorious and hefty monologue alla ""Pacino"" or something heroic, political or socially relevant.I can't see how this film could be improved, but I am not so sure it would stand a ""second viewing"". At least, not in the near future. And certainly NOT a third one!! I suspect this is what separates the films that you ""carry to the grave"" to other ""mental exercises"". Like some piano players like Perahia, with perfect technique, but somewhat lacking ""soul"".",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A truly good scary movie,"I have no idea why people are comparing this to The Sixth Sense. I called The Sixth Sense in five minutes (much to the chagrin of everyone around me in the theater; I really hadn't hoped I was right and it was THAT predictable) whereas The Others was one of the handful of movies that immensely impressed me by how well it was done. The acting was superb (this would remain my favorite Nicole Kidman movie until The Hours came out) and the ending genuinely caught me off guard- a rarity.I thought that this was an excellent movie, a wonderful nod to an age when movies didn't need CG and other effects to be genuinely scary.

The best horror movie in a generation,"A big claim? Well yes and no. Firstly I should define what I DON'T mean by horror - men in rubber suits or teenagers with outsized cutlery. If these movies were ever scary it was in the early 1980s when 'Alien' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' defined those particular genres to such an extent that no one has ever matched their standard.What I consider horror is something much more subtle and far older - the fears that we all carry inside of us whether we admit it or not.The terror of death; the ache of loneliness; the fear of a believer that there might not be a God, the worry of the most convinced atheist that there may well be one; the committed rationalist who outwardly denies the unknowable; the constant temptation of evil - those have been the staples of horror from the dawn of time and they still have the power to influence us.Who hasn't lain awake in the small hours with their heart pounding?Has anyone not glanced behind them when walking down a lonely country road?Is there anyone who can honestly say that they haven't thought of doing something that they know to be wrong - just for the sake of it?Unfortunately these ideas have been out of fashion for a long time. No one has come close to the superb horror of Robert Wise's 'The Haunting' which made a terrifying movie out of banging on the walls and a shaky staircase. Perhaps it is only 'The Blair Witch Project' that has recently attempted a minimalist approach to horror, but that film could not hope to live up to its advance hype and consequently was something of a disappointment. Fortunately 'The Others' arrived in the UK with mercifully little hype and is something of an unknown quantity.'The Others' takes the staples of a traditional ghost story from the pen of M.R. James and most particularly from Henry James' 'The Turn of the Screw' and produces something that manages to be very familiar and at the same time wholly original. The opening is a wholly discordant voice from childhood radio 'Are you sitting comfortably? Then I'll begin.'It is the end of 1945, the war in Europe has ground to a halt and a world where the living and the dead are intertwined is trying to recover from the devastation. A young family is trying to settle into a large old house, unsure if the soldier father is alive or dead. The opening shot follows Grace (Nichole Kidman) as she walks to answer the front door. There she finds three servants looking for positions in the rambling house. Apparently the previous household staff had got up and left the house without rhyme or reason, Grace escorts the three through the house, insisting with fragile urgency that they always remember to lock doors after them.She offers to introduce her children Anne and Nicholas to the new housekeeper, Mrs. Mills. This is the first of many deeply unsettling moments. The curtains *MUST* be draw and lamps lit. Grace disappears into the children's bedroom and wakes them; what monstrous things are going to emerge? The suspense is drawn out until breaking point and then Grace reappears with two angelic looking children. not for the last time the movie throws you off your balance. The children suffer from a form of acute photosensitivity preventing them ever experiencing daylight, hence the locked doors and shuttered windows.These are the simple props used to support everything that follows.People and a place on the edge of reality begin to slip into another world entirely. Doors open and close of their own accord, the protective curtains are thrown open, furniture moves, a piano plays in the middle of the night and Anne claims to have seen other people in the house. Throughout, Grace tries to reconcile events with her own deeply-held Catholicism, a terrifying construct where Hell and Purgatory are very close at hand. It is this belief that comes under attack, gradually at first, but as the movie progresses, her world begins to crumble. With control always shifting towards the increasingly sinister Mrs. Mills.A slight tale to be sure, but then the best horror stories only provide a skeleton (real or metaphorical) for our own fears.The house is just as much a character as the human beings that live in within; it appears to be adrift from the rest of the World. There might well be a world beyond the massive wall but equally there might be nothing at all. With the curtains constantly drawn the house is filled with a perpetual twilight, but even those times when we are able to glimpse through the windows there is precious little to see with an unchanging grey fog shrouding the autumn countryside.The movie reeks of death; there is persistent question of whether father is alive or dead; the belongings of departed former occupants are covered by shroud-like dust sheets, antique photographs of unknown people (including a particularly macabre photograph album) look out from shelves, whilst the garden is covered with autumnal leaves. Mortality is a presence in the house, even the hope of an afterlife is coloured by Grace's firm belief in the fate awaiting sinners and the less penitent.Nicole Kidman is as pale, brittle and delicate as porcelain in the role of Grace. As her grasp on the control of the house slips with ever-increasing speed, her world begins to falter and it is entirely possible that Grace will shatter under the pressure. She believes in a loving God yet he appears to shun her when she needs him most, whilst the fight against evil appears to have robbed Grace of her husband. Outwardly she tries to maintain the restrained chill expected of an upper-class woman in the 1940s, yet inwardly this is a loving mother and distraught wife, desperate for some form of emotional support.The children are central to the film - there is none of the preternatural adulthood offered by Haley Joel Osment, these are very real children. Nicholas (James Bentley) is at the age where he is stilltrusting of everyone and tied firmly to his mother, a very real innocent. Anne (Alakina Bentley) is older, just at the stage where she is starting to show independence and at an age where children are capable of very real cruelty. Much of the narrative is driven by Anne's interactions with the remainder of the cast, and Bentley proves more than adequate for the task, sometimes frighteningly adult, at other times a helpless child.The servants are characters from the pages of Dickensian fiction, the slightest of the roles is Lydia (Elaine Cassidy) a disconcerting mute who clearly knows something about the house's past, but cannot, or will not let on. Eric Sykes plays Mr Tuttle the gardener and manages to cast off a long history of comedy roles to give a subtle, almost otherwordly performance. However it is Fionnula Flanaghan's Mrs Mills who provides the counterweight to Grace. She gradually unveils herself as the movie progresses, starting off as the sweet-smiling, efficient servant, but slowly transforming into the centre of power in the house; threatening, all-knowing and truly terrifying. Mrs. Mills is a worthy successor to Judith Anderson's legendary Mrs. Danvers from Daphne du Maurier's 'Rebecca'.Extraordinarily, this very British movie is directed by Spanard - Alejandro Amenabar who has redefined the genre with complete mastery much like Ang Lee's take on 'Sense and Sensibility'.'The Others' is an astonishingly beautifully made movie. Each scene is set and lit like an oil painting. Shadows and the darkness play just as important a role as the warm glow from oil lamps and the fires. Daylight where it is allowed to intrude is a frigid blue-white colour, bleaching life and colour from everything it touches.Sound plays an important part in telling the story, there are plenty of minor chords and shrieking strings to set your nerves on edge, but it is the quiet that is the most memorable. Entire scenes are played out in near silence serving to heighten the almost unbearable tension of the latter part of the movie.So is the movie scary? Undoubtedly yes, the pacing is perfect with enough false climaxes and unexpected shocks to keep even the most demanding horror fan happy. It takes its time to set up all of the pieces, but as the whole story is put into place, the screw is gradually being tightened. Situations becomes increasingly claustrophobic, Grace's nerve falters and Mrs. Mills appears to feed on her weakness - where is it leading?Fortunately the end of the story is extremely satisfying and comes quite unexpectedly. In retrospect, or on a second viewing you will see all of the clues to the solution littered through the narrative, but none are so obvious that you will put the whole thing together until the director is ready for you.Oh and I didn't sit comfortably at all.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great horror film,"This is movie is one of the best I have seen in the thriller-genre. All actors do an amazing job, thoroughly directed by the young director Alejandro Amenábar from Chile.What Amenábar uses instead of computer graphics and explosions, is the art of being subtle. Things are often more frightening when you don't see them, but can only sense them or hear them. The movie itself is very brilliant visually, and Amenábar has made the eerie music that goes with it, too.Though the story takes place on a british island in 1945, the location (a house) was found in northern Spain. The house, that is the 'frame' of the whole story, had to have some gothic elements without being a stand-out cliché. The house they found was perfect for this story. One final thing I have to praise, is the acting of Nicole Kidman, but also of the 2 children. Alakina Mann and James Bentley acts so naturally, that one can not help believing their characters and being swept into their tiny world. This movie is a modern classic that will have a special place in my heart forever. An absolute 'must' for thriller-fans!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Tremendous film. Great effort by all to produce a must see!,"I believe this film is excellent. I was not a big fan of Nicole Kidman before I saw this film, (firmly believing that she had yet to come in to a role where she shined). Well this movie is a vehicle for her. I feel the tone of this movie is Nicole Kidman. I see very little flaws with this film. The cinematography completely captures the power of light in the film, and it sets a great feel. The directing is very strong, helping portray the confusion and struggle of a family realizing that they arent alone in the house. For anyone with an attention span longer then a commercial, you will thoroughly enjoy this film on a second, third, fourth e.t.c viewing. I feel there is nothing in this film that is unnecessary, and everything helps build up to what is in my opinion one of the most dramatic and completely shocking endings I have ever seen from a movie.

An expertly constructed haunted house story,"""The Others"" was the English-language debut of Alejandro Amenábar, who was at that time best known for ""Abre Los Ojos"", shortly thereafter the recipient of a Hollywood adaptation in the form of ""Vanilla Sky"". Here, Amenábar crafted an original screenplay that managed to breathe new life into the age-old haunted house sub-genre. Following on the heels of ""The Sixth Sense"", this movie is another classy supernatural thriller that keeps audiences guessing until the very end.The story's main character is a British woman (Nicole Kidman) who lives in a remote country house with her two children shortly after the end of World War II. Her husband went away to war and, having not returned, is presumed dead. With the previous household staff having recently vanished, a trio of former servants arrive to offer their services. They are accepted into the household and soon become acquainted with the children's unique medical condition. The ingenious premise put forth by Amenábar is that the children are highly photosensitive and cannot be exposed to light. Thus, the house is draped in shadow out of necessity. This sets the stage for mysterious occurrences that may or may not be supernatural in origin.The cast is small but well-assembled. Nicole Kidman is the focal point and she delivered an impressive performance in a demanding role. This type of movie doesn't often get recognized by prestigious awards bodies but Kidman nevertheless managed to land both a Golden Globe nomination & a BAFTA nomination. The actors that played her two children (Alakina Mann & James Bentley) were also up to the task. However, the best performance in a supporting role has to be that of Fionnula Flanagan as the enigmatic Mrs. Mills.Amenábar certainly knows how to establish the proper atmosphere for a good old-fashioned haunted house story. Not only did he bring his script to life with visual panache, he also scored the movie. ""The Others"" does such a nice job of sustaining its suspense that you don't realize until it's over just how simple the story actually is. It's a simplicity that harks back to the written ghost stories of centuries past but presented with a verve that has no trouble transferring the timeless appeal to modern viewers. It's also a presentation that's elegant enough to appeal to more than just watchers of horror movies.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Atmospheric disturbances,"The best thrills and chills are those inside our own heads. Everyone knows it but Hollywood keeps trying to outdo itself with more gristle, more gore and ever bigger vats of blood. Not the case with this film, which is almost a throwback to the ghost stories of the 19th century and the B&W mystery films of the mid 20th century. Revisiting that territory, in a film as tidily put together as this one, is refreshing.Nicole Kidman is radiant as Grace, the isolated, migraine-prone mother of two perturbed children (Alakina Mann is wonderful as the older child Anne, James Bentley is good too). Both children suffer from photosensitivity and Grace is meticulous in protecting them from the daylight. But all is not well. They are marooned in a mansion house (Grace appropriately compares the house to a ship at one point), the place is eerily fog-bound, the postman hasn't come, three new servants have arrived unexpectedly and the children are noticing that they don't appear to be the only ones on the house. Then Grace starts noticing things too...The most trivial things become objects of fear and suspense in this film. A face in a picture, shadows, a moving curtain, a door that moves suddenly, a bump upstairs, half-heard whispers, a piano playing behind a closed door, dense fog. The atmosphere is developed superbly and Kidman plays her part - when required, she looks utterly s*** scared. But don't expect gory shocks for there are none.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

creepy and intelligent - gets your attention and keeps it,"I was so impressed with this movie. It's smart, you don't get anything handed to you - it requires that you make an effort to figure out what's going on, and pays off beautifully.

Also, I've always considered her a very talented actress. But I was just amazed by how well the two children did: they were simply brilliant, especially the girl.

Excellent Psychological Horror Piece,"In a horror market filled with useless gore and pointless plots, it's a breath of fresh air to see a quality scary movie. Looking back on the film, there wasn't an abundance of frightening scenes. Instead of the usual ""visible"" ghost activity, the writer/director Alejandro Amenabar relied on an eerie atmosphere; you get the feeling something supernatural is occurring, without being shown what ""it"" is. There are no flashy special effects or CGI monsters. At times, the expressions on the faces of the characters, heightened by an eerie soundtrack, composed by Amenabar himself, are enough to chill the viewer.If you have read any review of this film, you know it has a surprise ending. Thus, you may spend the entire duration of the film trying to add things up and figure it out before they reveal it. I did this, and managed to only figure out part of the surprise. The rest shocked me.Fans of Polanski and Shyamalan will love this movie. Many critics have compared it to the ""Sixth Sense"", but I don't think the two come close to eachother, plotwise. They are related only in the use of atmosphere to scare the audience.This is probably not a movie for the ""Hollywood Blockbuster"" lover. It requires a lot of thought and imagination.

The movie has an extraordinary atmosphere and great cinematography, lighting etc. Basically everything about this movie is great. Nicole Kidman (with this movie and Moulin Rouge I really like her), the children and the woman who plays Mrs. Mills were all excellent. At the end of the movie one is likely to compare this movie to The Sixth Sense but thinking about it you realize that it varies the topic in a very interesting way. The script is wonderful giving you some hints but not giving away the plot. So overall, the direction, acting, setting, lighting, script and story are truly outstanding. It's a movie you think about and wanna see again to totally get it. I can recommend it very much.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Breathtaking Classic,"This is an excellent film, and trust me I am not a thriller fan. The peformance given by Kidman is simply outstanding.

Twist at the end is worth waiting for.,"'The Others', while not a horror film in the sense of the 'Halloween' or 'Friday the 13th' series is none the less disturbing.

Great thriller!,"At first, I wasn't sure about this movie. It seemed odd and I found the ailment of the children a bit ludicrous. Not that people don't suffer from it, but both children having the same rare ailment is a bit far fetched. But if you can look past that and continue watching, you soon get drawn into the story. It seems like your normal, creepy haunted house story, but the more you watch, the more hints that are dropped, you start to wonder if this movie is more than that. What I enjoyed best were the twists that you never see coming. Think ""The Sixth Sense""... If you enjoyed that movie, you'll love this one.

One of the best thrillers in a long time (8/10),"I am usually not that big a fan of scary movies, since they are usually very typical.  People run around, then they all die along the way, until usually one or two people walk away.  This is BY FAR not typical.  But it is typical in psychological thrillers in that most of the film doesn't make sense until the last half hour or 15 minutes.  But the rest of it is amazing.  Although slow at times, its slow in a way that your still interested enough to pay attention.

Critique-The Others,"Though we see the family of three is very knowledgeable in the bible, by the end of the film we see that the mother loses faith in what she has devoted her entire life to. After taking the life of her children and her own, she believes that God has given her another chance when she pulls the trigger and she is still standing there. In the end, when she comes to the realization with the fact that she is a ghost, she is confused about the existence of God. It is our opinion that she loses the belief that there ever was a supreme being. There is no explanation as to why this has happened to them. One of the last lines in the story is the housekeeper saying that the mute girl's last lines were ""What now?"" We feel that Grace came to realize that there is no God. She has come to the finalized thought that she is to live in that house, their house.This is why we recommend this story. It is a story that could appeal to any type of audience that like suspense, mystery, question of beliefs or just have some time to spare.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
so good,"So good I am amazed American people liked it. 'Cause this movie is enough for deleting from your mind every stupid Hollywood terror flick you have ever seen.

True: the end is not that amazing, and you can easily guess what is going on.

This movie is not like all the others!,"For this movie to be in the top 250 is a stretch! It made me feel uncomfortable just watching it! I'll agree, at times it could get spooky, creepy, and a little suspenseful - but C'MON!!!! This movie could have easily been done in a half hour and all the good scenes would not have to be edited out! I thought Nicole Kidman was playing the part of my aunt Ginny in this flick! I guess I feel uncomfortable watching a woman be over-bearing to her kids that she ""claims"" she loves and subjects them to cruel punishment.The ending to the movie explains basically what's happening during the rest of it. This is the kind of movie you need to watch a second time to get the whole picture, but let me ask you something - Why would you? Ghost or Human, after a thousand hints, I would believe SOMETHING was going on! But then again, when you see women like Nichole Philpot live in this world, you would believe Nicole Kidman would play a character THAT messed up to actually believe it was ""just the wind"". MAN!!!If I did not wake up in a cold sweat dreaming about my aunt at nights after watching this I may have given this a ""4"", but unfortunately I do, so I gave it a ""2"" not to only show my displeasure of this movie, but to get it out of the top 250!

We Will Never Leave This House,"To a certain extent, one's enjoyment of THE OTHERS will depend on how quickly you recognize the major plot device on which the entire film turns. Once recognition sets in, how much you are able to further enjoy the film will then depend on how much you have become engaged by the characters--and it is here, really, that the film stumbles a bit, not so much through the way it is done but rather through the way the characters must be played in order for their behavior to make sense at the film's conclusion.The premise, which seems deeply influenced by both Henry James' THE TURN OF THE SCREW and the 1960s film version known as THE INNOCENTS, concerns a woman who resides with her two children in an isolated mansion following World War II. Her situation is dire: her husband is missing in action and presumed dead; her children suffer from a rare genetic disease that makes sunlight dangerous to them; her servants have departed in the night without a word of warning. The latter problem seems remedied by the arrival of new servants--but no sooner are they installed than odd happenings begin to occur. Is the woman going mad? Are the servants involved? Have intruders secretly entered the house? Or could it be--something unearthly? The cast is exceptionally good here, with Fionnula Flanagan as the newly arrived servant Mrs. Mills and children Alakina Mann and James Bentley giving remarkable performances. But the focus is on Nicole Kiddman as Grace, a role that Kiddman plays with a white-knuckled grip and considerable ferocity--so much so that it becomes extremely difficult to like, much less sympathize, with the character. In some respects, however, this is ultimately necessary for this extremely plot-driven film to have any significant impact, and in hindsight it is hard to imagine that the role could be played in any other way; still, hindsight does not allow you to engage fully with the character when you are in the midst of the film. It is a flaw, but it is an unavoidable one--and the film is so remarkably stylish that it largely overcomes both the anticipated plot-twist and Kiddman's necessarily ferocious performance.The production values are first rate all the way down the line. Everything looks right, sounds right, feels right. But two items deserve special mention: the exceptional soundtrack, which was composed by director Alejandro Amenabar himself, and the stunning cinematography, which has tremendous visual texture and which neatly blends a fluidity of movement with a remarkably claustrophobic feel. If your tastes run to special effects and blood-spatter horror films, you are likely to disappointed, for there are none in THE OTHERS; Amenabar craftily creates tension more via what is suggested rather than shown, and doors left ajar and half-heard sounds are his devices of choice; it is all very subtle and yet remarkably chilling.The DVD package is a double-disk set, with the film on one disk and bonuses on the other. Although the bonuses are often quite interesting--particularly a documentary on individuals who actually suffer from hyper-sensitively to sunlight--they actually contribute little to the film itself, and it is a bit surprising that such a small bonus package would require a second disk. The sound for the feature is also problematic re home viewing, and I recommend that viewers play it at top volume, for there is no middle ground--everything is very quiet or very loud, and the contrast adds tremendously to the film's effect.It is extremely difficult to know how to rate this film, for as I've noted the very nature of the story has two embedded flaws: the almost inevitable recognition of the major plot device and the necessity of Kiddman's over-the-top performance. But even though I recognized the nature of the plot device very early in the film, and even though I found ""Grace"" an unlikeable woman, this did not actually prevent me from feeling the icy breath with which director Amenabar endows THE OTHERS.

Maybe that's what they were trying to accomplish: showing us how obvious it should have been but how hard it was for them to realize the truth.  It wasn't a bad movie but it certianly wasn't a good movie.  It copied Sixth Sense in so many ways but totally failed where Sixth Sense succeeded so dramatically.

"Atmospheric, brilliant","This is a great, chilling film.  I won't mention anything about the plot, because the less you know the better.  There are SOME similarities to ""Sixth Sense,"" but to compare the two films or judge this against the other is not fair.  ""Sixth Sense"" was a classic, but ""The Others"" stands by itself as a great work.  Alejandro Amenábar is an enviously talented guy.  Besides the brilliant script and direction, he wrote a score that darn well should be at least nominated come oscar time.Also, you may hear about how ""slow"" this movie is.  I completely disagree. First of all, it's not an action movie.  But, if it developed any faster than it does, it would be silly.  I can also say that I felt tense at least 90% of the time, all the way up to the finale.  In fact at 114 minutes, I almost wanted a bit more, ALMOST.  The great direction, close-ups, acting, low-lighting, and creepy cinematography allow you to feel the fear as the characters do.

In this movie, the story unfolds through the dialogue from scene to scene. Nicole Kidman's performance is wonderful. The supporting cast is also good as well particularly the children. This movie is a definite must see!!! The frightening parts may be few and far between but there is always a sense of eeriness, which is unsettling throughout the movie.

One of the greatest horror films ever made.,"I cannot even come close to describing how good this film is.  It has everything and is genuinely one of the most atmospheric and chilling horror films ever made.  It doesn't have all the Hollywood gloss and special effects, instead it has first rate acting, from all the characters, first rate direction. Most importantly of all it lets you use your own imagination to fill out what you can't see. The plot also is important to this film and is much cleverer than you expect it to be.  You have to watch it carefully and to the very end to fully find out what has been going on.This is a truly gripping and scary film and unless you are Mr Spock you will have goose bumps at times and will jump out of your skin at other times. What you must do to really appreciate it is to watch it from start to finish without being distracted.

Amenabar at his best,"There's a strong dose of Henry James about The Others. Grace is a sister creation to governess Miss Giddens in The Turn of the Screw. The conflict in James' novel is between the sexually repressed governess and the children she believes to be possessed, most likely (though James would never think such a thing, let alone spell it out) because she suspects they are influenced by sexual beings - the dead couple, the former governess and her groundsman lover - and that they commune with these beings through their own burgeoning wickedness. Grace, however, is corseted by her challenged beliefs: she's deeply religious in strict Catholic, disciplinarian fashion, and punishes her children when they start to tell her about things she doesn't want to believe - even when her own acute senses present them to her incontrovertibly. But while the Jamesian atmosphere is an obvious referent, the two protagonists' situations are quite different. Giddens is a surrogate mother who sublimates her romantic longings for the absent parent she's met but once into her relationship with her two charges. Grace's hysterical need to keep the truth of their father's death from her children prevents her trusting her own intelligence as well as her motherly instincts. In other words, Miss Giddens fears that her demons are within whereas Grace fears external knowledge. Director Amenábar had another hit with 'Abre los ojos'. But 'The others' remains his masterpiece.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Leave us in peace!,"""We must learn to live together . . . the living and the dead."" Certainly one of the most chilling lines you will ever hear.

She plays the mother of two terribly sick children living on an island off of England during World War II who has just lost her husband. She hires three strangers who just happen to have worked in her home previously and begins to have strange occurrences happen soon afterward. The movie takes awhile to come full circle but it once it has you in it's grip it won't let you go. It is fiendishly scary and the buildup to the finale is filled with tension and suspense.

A truly worthy tale of suspense and intrigue,"I walked into The Others not expecting much. Most 'ghost stories' today are just bloody messes with no real plot, nothing to keep you interested. I constantly find myself looking around the theater to see if anyone else is as bored or disgusted as I am. Not The Others. First let me say, I am a huge fan of literary ghost stories, well done, frightening tales that don't use blood or gore or any other media than written word and your own imagination to scare you. I was pleasantly surprised. The acting was amazing, the plot very well thought out, and remained true to what I consider real Suspense. This film proves you don't have to be a bloody gore-fest or a plot-less, mindless killer-kills-all-girl's-friends-in-really-bloody-ways-for-no-real-reason. No suspense, no intrigue, no thought needed the only thing that scares people in those films is the gore, not the story. The Others really takes you into it, I forgot completely I was in a cinema, and was completely engrossed. Having read, as I said, a great many 'suspense/horror' novels I kept mentally trying to see where the story would go, but while I did guess a few things, I could not guess it all and was thrilled beyond words by the cleverness of the tale by the end. I was truly held in thrall every moment waiting to see what would happen next and was blissful with the style it was carried out in when I left the theater. I cant say enough good about this movie. Nicole Kidman (who I thought was amazing in Malice and Moulin Rouge, and Far and Away) really astounded me. Her performance was stupendous. I dislike Tom Cruise as an actor and a person, and I don't want to give him any credit for this fantastic tale, especially since he was just one of 9 producers and they really don't do much but pony up some cash, so give the credit where it is due, the actors (especially Ms Kidman), and the writer and director, Alejandro Amenábar.

I have seen this before,"Well, the movie is well crafted, it offers a well achieved climate of suspense and tension, and the performances of both Nicole Kidman and the two children are excellent. The problem, and it's not a minor one, is that the entire weight of the story relies on the final twist, and this twist is not only predictable but in fact it is because we've seen it many times in other movies, most of them little-known with one very notable exception in Tim Burton's Beetlejuice, which despite being a comedic proposal, offers exactly the same twist. This predictability, which I insist is the key to the narrative, undermines the whole sense of the movie by depriving it of its greatest appeal.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Easily the Best Film of 2001.,"Lord of the Rings??? Ha! This was the best movie from that year, hands down...better than Moulin Rouge, Monster's Ball, Shrek, In the Bedroom, A Beautiful Mind and all the rest. Many people have compared this movie to The Sixth Sense, but note: this movie was written BEFORE the Sixth sense ever came out. Alejandro had this eerie little gem planned for years, which makes it even more of a marvel.This is also the superior movie because of the all-around great acting that Sixth Sense lacked in places. Fioluanna Flanagan -- an all-time underrated character actress -- plays the maid with stunning precision. Compare this to her other great ""maid"" role in the TV movie The Legend of Lizzie Borden. And Eric Sykes as the bumbling-yet-creepy Mr. Tuttle does extremely well, delivering the movie's funniest line...you'll know what I'm talking about. It's made hilarious simply because of his pitch-perfect delivery.Also, these child actors, Akina Mann & James Bentley, are unbelievable -- I kept wondering where on earth the casting director found them. They're sort of a dark version of the Mary Poppins kids and every bit as good if not better. Bentley, especially, manages to be cute and terrified without also coming across as annoying and over-the-top like other, more-acclaimed child actors.Nicole Kidman is gorgeous here. She's really hot. Besides that, I do believe Kidman's performance here is inferior to the role in Moulin Rogue -- people simply think this one is better because it's a dramatic film (most people do not realize how hard it is to do comedy well, let alone musical-comedy). In fact, this movie is more of a dramatic chilly family melodrama that horror. It's not really scary or even suspenseful; that is, even if you figure out what's going on early on, the tension and the dramatic storyline will still keep you watching, as happened to my best friend when we saw it. However you count it, Kidman is definitely a goddess, starring in the two best movies to come out of one year.The Others is just well-done, nothing fancy, but with a few brief moments that will have you screaming at the screen.

A very special movies,"Although""The Sixth Sense"" was a very good movie, the histrionics it generated were largely due to the performance of the child actor, and the supposedly unguessable twist. ""The Others"" has two marvellous child performances, two hammer-blow twists and Nicole Kidman in a display that is in my opinion, the best by an actress since Frances McDormand's Oscar in 'Fargo'. And yet it is not as if the film needs such a performance to carry it. Everything, from the lighting, to the fluidity of the camera, and the mesmerising music, knits perfectly to a truly magnificent whole. I hope it gets the credit it deserves come oscar nomination time. The first real must-see film of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
GREAT,"This movie is by far the best movie of the summer.  It is what so many movies in this vain wish to be, Haunting.  I would also recommend watching the classic George C. Scott movie ""The Changeling"".  You'll see wonderful parallels between the two  movies.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
An unusual twist on an old idea,"I just saw ""The Others"" last night, and I must say that although I found hints in the movie that reminded me of at least three other movies I've seen within the past thirteen years, I feel ""The Others"" can stand on its own, mainly because it brings something new to the table of films of its ilk. Alejandro Amenabar should be commended and hailed as the next Alfred Hitchcock, because he was able to direct a suspense thriller without any gore.  This film works on the mind, and does its job brilliantly.Special kudos to Nicole Kidman and her supporting cast, Mr. Amenabar's effective score, the cinematography, sound editing, costumes, and sets.  And just when I thought I had everything figured out, more details came to the surface to jolt me some more!  In a year of woefully substandard movies so far, ""The Others"" stands out as a film of intelligence and real chills without flashy special effects.  It is a return to solid storytelling, intriguing characters, and the mark of genius, in that it transported me to another time and place and involved me so much, that I thought I was part of the story.  For a few moments, I was able to forget the problems of the real world, as I got lost in the world of ""The Others.""  Go see it with an open mind...you'll get lost, too.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Chilling and exquisite,"I'm not normally a fan of scary movies, but this film accomplishes with atmosphere, good pacing and solid acting what 1999's disappointing remake of The Haunting couldn't with all the computer generated wizardry in the world.

A complete waste of time,"I've frequently avoided seeing hyped films until they, well, sort of cool off a bit. I don't like being disappointed. Don't watch this film. OK, watch it, but don't rent it. And if you have seen The Sixth Sense, it doesn't take more than five minutes to realize the concept. And that, that is very disappointing indeed. It may not be very long, but it certainly feels like it. But I admit that Nicole Kidman's constant terror of every single object in the house, whether it's door-knobs, skillets or furniture, will make your skin crawl. Not out of terror, but because you desperately want the film to end so you can do more useful things, like washing windows or getting very, very drunk.",1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"An exhilarating, intense and fabulous film.","The Others is; Nicole Kidman's best film and best performance to date. She is simply STUNNING and MESMERIZING as Grace - a truly top notch performance as all of the performances are in this classic. This film is NOT a copy of the Sixth Sense. The idea is taken from a COMPLETELY different angle to the Sixth Sense.The screenplay was written BEFORE the Sixth Sense was released AND in my humble opinion anybody who thinks it is a copy is being VERY UNFAIR . It was one of the best films of last year and the only people who didn't like it probably didn't understand it, or, like different genres, and, probably enjoyed incomprehensibly idiotic, brainless, pathetic, painstakingly awful, critically panned films of 2001, such as Tomb Raider, Pearl Harbor, Jurassic Park and some of those ridiculous comedies etc.[ no offense to anyone who liked these, everyone's entitled to an opinion] -basically unoriginal laughably acted films with waferthin plots and even thinner performances. The Others is a thinking person's, intellectual horror film/thriller. The Others is a VERY clever and unpredictable film. It is an elegant, stylish, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker that should not, has not and will not be forgotten. A classic if there ever was one!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant! ***** Buy or rent it now!,"I have to say I saw The Others before the Sixth Sense and I have a few comments to make; Sixth Sense fans who say that The Others is a rip off of the Sixth Sense, don't flatter yourselves- the Sixth Sense wasn't THAT good.The Sixth Sense wishes it was this good. Think about the twist. It isn't at all the same as The Others' twist.Stop comparing two different and unique films just to be bitter and cause annoyance to The Others fans. This is a BRILLIANT film,last year's best and one of the genre's best to date. Nicole Kidman gives what can only be described as a spellbinding performance in this critically acclaimed and haunting shocker.- definitely her best performance to date. With more twists and turns than you can shake a stick at, and a suffocatingly intense atmosphere, The Others is undoubtedly a winner. Fionulla Flanagan is superb and the two child actors are on level footing with, dare I mention Haley J Osment and overall, this film is not to be missed. Sixth Sense fans, get over yourselves !!! The Others is an elegant, beautiful, intense, unsettling, horrifying, chilling and haunting shocker.Truly unpredictable, with spectacular performances all round, particularly from Nicole Kidman who gives an unforgettable performance- without a doubt her best ever. She is truly mesmerizing as Grace and definitely deserves the huge amount of critical acclaim that she's received. She plays the part to perfection and her English accent is superb. This film is a flawless masterpiece. A wonderful cinematic experience that's not to be missed! Just view the reviews below for a taste of the acclaim it's received by fans and critics alike!

A superb ghost story.,"( A- ) I was pleasantly surprised by this one. But I must say that the trailer was poorly done. I wasn't at all tempted to see this movie until I saw the high rating (8.3/10) on IMDb. That made me curious enough to go and see the movie. I'm glad I did.THE OTHERS is a great classic ghost story right up until the end when the viewer is shocked with an amazing twist. The acting is good, even the children were good in this one.Don't expect some masked and deranged fellow pop out of nowhere and start jabbing people with a huge knife. This is a good old fashioned ghost story, which means that there's no gore and no real violence. That DOES NOT mean that you will not be frightened; if you pay close attention, you most certainly will.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Classic Haunted House Movie,"I know a movie is creeping me out when I feel like someone or something is going to grab my ankles from behind my seat.  This film did that, with gusto.  I found that the incredible performances all around, most notably Nicole Kidman's turn as the frazzled lady of the house, made up for a VERY predictable ""twist"" ending.  The scene that I found the most unsettling was when she found the photo album, and it stuck with me.  The setting was incredibly ominous, and the shocks kept coming, even though I correctly predicted how it would end halfway through.  A film this predictable has to have some very strong merits in other areas to get a good review from me, and this one has plenty.  Destined to become a classic, because it already feels like one.  This is a film that could easily have come out 40 or 50 years ago, and that's a great compliment.  The  lack of special effects HELPED the movie, in my mind.  I remember giggling insanely at the ""ghosts"" in 1999's ""The Haunting"", and thankfully, the effects were muted, if not non-existent here.  This is a classic haunted house movie, and it delivers.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Much better than expected.,"I don't know why, but I had rather low expectations of this film.  I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  I still wouldn't say this was a terribly great movie.  It was good, but nothing great.  I'm actually VERY shocked that this film made it into IMDB's top 250.Also, I must admit that the film was MUCH better on the second viewing, perhaps it gets even better on the third time around.  I'll have to test that theory one of these days.The acting is pretty good for all the cast members, Nicole Kidman being the only cast-member that I've previously heard of.  Although, I did recognize Christopher Eccleston (Charles Stewart) from ""Gone in Sixty Seconds"", but I certainly didn't know him by name when I first saw the film.The story is quite interesting and takes a very interesting route of telling the story.  There is a number of similarities between this film and ""The Sixth Sense"", but I think I must concede that this film is pretty good in it's own right.  The only complaint about the story in the film is, I didn't like that the children had this weird photosensitive disease.  Does this condition ACTUALLY exist?  I can't imagine it does.  But you know the saying, sometimes Fact is stranger than Fiction.  The children having this condition does work quite well with the story, so maybe I should just accept it.If you're into creepy/strange/odd/ghostly movies like ""The Sixth Sense"", then you'll probably like this film too.  I would have a tough time saying this film is for everyone, but like I said, if you're into creepy movies, then you may want to take a peak.  Anyhow, hope you enjoy the film, thanks for reading.-Chris",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I'm still scary !!!,"After an original script that we can see in a Hollywood ""nice"" film, starred by Bruce ""Die Hard"" Willis, like a loving angel (snif)...here comes the REAL TERROR.Alejandro Amenábar write and direct the best spanish, european and whole world scaring movie in years. In the movie we can see the best Nicole Kidman i remember and future stars as Alakina Mann (sure he wins the prize for Oh! What a sister!, jumping over mine.The first thing that people on the theaters must think is on how much Alejandro spend on special effects....perhaps i can pay it....The film is a classic film nowadays.I have never screamed as today at cinema...and Wow!!! i'm still scary !!!Well, it's hard to accept for you (talking to US people), but men, we are in front of the new terror king....and he's spanish!!!",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A spooky ride of a movie.,"THE OTHERS was written in the year 2000 by a Spanish guy named Alejandro Amenabar. Yes, the same guy who wrote the Spanish film that VANILLA SKY was based on. So, instead of just making a film that rips-off of THE SIXTH SENSE, he also makes it in Spanish, titling it ""Los Otros"". Touche!Nicole Kidman did an okay job of acting and we soon understand that her two children have the rarest of rare diseases. They are allergic to the light. So, when three mysterious servants arrive, strange things begin to happen. The cast is basically English, which is definitively odd since this film was written by a man of Spanish origins. The story moves along quickly and as everything is happening, it all seems to make sense. But then we wonder to ourselves, why is all this happening now? Why did it not happen years earlier? These questions are never explained and that is what helps make the film retched. Better examples of the genre would be the all-time classic, THE SIXTH SENSE, and many more consisting of WHAT LIES BENEATH, DRAGONFLY, THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES and about a hundred others. In fact, most of the above films are somehow cliched in the film, so that might be where the title came from. THE OTHERS can mean that the film is consisted of stolen material from ""other"" movies. But, that is only my interpretation. See it for yourself and see what you think. It is okay on a level of spookiness and chills. But that is about it. There are some creepy twists and turns which help the story stay thrilling enough to keep the viewers awake, but after it is over, you will be wondering the same very questions that I was. THE OTHERS: 4/5.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Amenábar at his best.,"This is really a great masterpiece where a Spanish director shows there can be quality out of the Dream Factory that Hollywood actually is (I don't only say that because we share nationality). This movie shows how really great movies should be, and it has a hard to confuse classic taste. The way things are treated, the lack of explicits, and especially the lack of blood and/or gore makes this movie become a real classic since the first theatrical release. It's obvious that Mr. Amenábar just drank from the best sources (especially Hitchcock). Since ""Poltergeist"" I didn't see less killings in a whole movie, and, however, it's still chilling. Take example of these, you new filmmakers.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Come up with an original idea ...,"After watching this movie, I thought well where have I seen that precipice before.  Oh yeah, The Sixth Sense!!!!   Come on, you can at least come up with your own idea for a movie.  If this was original, I would have been wowed (like when I saw the Sixth Sense for the first time), but it just stinks that this movie would be considered.

Best Movie of 2001!,"""The Others"" was totally robbed. IT should have been nominated for at least FIVE Oscars (including Best Picture), not NONE AT ALL. I loved ""Moulin Rouge"" (it was my second favourite film of 2001 after this), but Nicole Kidman's talents were more obvious in Amenabar's (freaky) masterpiece.This film, unlike many these days, is intelligent. It is classy, brilliantly acted, and mysterious. Plus, it packs a massive punch in the end that'll overwhelm you. I predicted the ending of ""The Sixth Sense"" before I'd even seen the movie, but I just didn't see this one coming.""The Others"" will amaze you. I was so gobsmacked by it when I first watched it that I went back to the cinema the next day, the day after that, the day after that, and again...the day after that. Unlike most movies, this one will stay with you LONG after the first viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
a plea for visceral enjoyment,"Firstly, I'd just like to say I've read many of the other comments here, and I do not understand why some people feel the need to belittle the intelligence of those who enjoyed a film, when they themselves did not. Enjoyment of a film can be visceral - it gets you in the gut, your adrenaline rushes, or you may be overcome with waves of inexplicable dread or melancholy. This kind of enjoyment does not need to be intellectualised - it is felt or it isn't. Even a technically bad film can produce such affects in some members of its audience.So your wife fell asleep in the film, and you were bored. Does this make you a superior being to the people who sank low in their seats, voraciously absorbing the gloomy atmosphere, and feeling our insides turn to ice water? I fell asleep once in Jean Luc Godard's 'Breathless' (however I've managed to stay awake during Tarkovsky films - no mean feat according to some). And yet that film is considered a masterpiece by many. It just didn't resonate with me.Anyway, I think you can tell that I loved 'The Others'. It's haunted me all weekend. I saw some things coming but resisted the temptation to 'second guess' the plot, allowing the film to reveal itself to me in its own time. The children - let's not compare them to Haley Joel Osment for that kid is a freak of nature - were pinched faced and touching, reminding me of my relationship with my own malleable younger brother when we were that age, and I could make him believe anything (hehehehe).In a time when most films with a supernatural bent rely on what is seen and what horrors can be made visible through special effects, it was refreshing to find a film which relied on what was hidden. It was more about sound than vision. I'll be seeing it again, hoping to recapture some of the delicious ambivalent dread of my first viewing.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great movie.,"If you can picture...Poltergeist, The Haunting, The 6th Sense, and Carrie all rolled into one film ""The Others"" would be the finished product. This movie has suspense and thrills that are hair-raising and makes the audience jump out of their seats (at least when I saw it, they did). It even has some comedy in it, when Anne was teasing her brother Nicholas. (I thought it was funny.) Plus, ""The Others"" has two unsuspected twists that made the whole audience go dead quiet (You could practically hear the person next to you breathing.) and gasp in awe. GREAT MOVIE!!!!",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A Brilliant Movie,"""The Others"" is all around a superb film that I loved. I've seen many complaints that the movie's plot is too slow. However, the way the movie is made you simply can't rush it along or it just wouldn't work. It isn't a slashing gorefest without much plot that needs to have nonstop action and violence but rather a subtle film that focuses on the fear of silence and what you can't see. The film never jumps out at you but rather maintains a frightening atmosphere throughout the entire movie. The acting in ""The Others"" is excellent all around. Nicole Kidman truly shines in her role as a mother of two sick children who hasn't seen her husband since he went to war. She grabs your attention as soon as she appears on screen and never loosens her grasp. She deserves an Oscar nomination. Heck, I'd even say she deserves the Oscar. The supporting cast is also wonderful, especially the children who are very realistic as a brother and sister.  Everything else about ""The Others"" is excellent as well. The cinematography, score, screenplay, and direction all range from very good to Oscar worthy. So all in all, don't listen to the film's detractors and see ""The Others"" for yourself. And if you are among those who say it is to slow, watch it again try to see why it can't be rushed. I give it 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Scary deep down (8/10),"Another one of those movies. The Trailer just doesn't show how good this movie is. With an amazing finish (much like The Sixth Sense) this movie will give you the creeps.

You will probably notice a lot of things, when you go watch this movie a second time.If you like being scared and you like a cool story, where you don't know the ending from the start (like must big Hollywood pictures) than this is for you.

Nichole's best work to date!,"I think this picture is just wonderful. It shows that you don't need special effects to scare the crap out of someone. I must say that without Nicholes and those kids (whoever they are) this film would have just been another 40 mil. grossing pic. Because of Nichole this film was so scary, the only other that has scared me like this was ""The Eye"" a terrifying film from over in Asia, directed by (I think the Pang brothers)- and the original ""Candyman"" (of course I was 12 then, and did the whole Candyman thing in the mirror more than once) I just know that even after I had seen it a couple times, I still got freaked out even though I knew the result.

Not enough meat on the bone,"Nicole Kidman plays super convincingly, but the script and the idea behind it didn't really grab me. The film obsessively tries to put a lot on mysterious and tension, but it all didn't work for me, I found it rather exhausting and tedious. In general, I found the film rather dull and lengthy. The twist at the end, on which the whole film is working convulsively, was already clear to me after 20 minutes. I couldn't even say at this point what the film should have done better, because I think the story has too little meat on the bone for you to fill a whole 1h 41m film with it and it also becomes interesting.

"One of, if not, the best scary movies this year!",This was one creepy movie. I saw the preview for this movie before Scary Movie two and I knew I had to see it. Every thing about this movie was great. The acting is all done very well. The one thing that surprised me was that I didn't get bored. For the past couple months I have been getting bored and impatient towards the end of movies. But this one is paced very slowly and I didn't even get bored once. The Book of the Dead was one of the very creepy things about this movie. Those pictures were just scary. And one thing that I liked about this movie was the fact that special effects weren't used. I myself prefer special effects but I'm glad none were used here. They weren't needed. They just used creepy noises. The Haunting was all about special effects and I hated it. Now any one who says the ending was predictable was very wrong. I was very surprised. Unlike the Sixth Sense(5/10) I couldn't see it coming. This movie is way better! I am probably going to see it again. I'm surprised that this didn't make more at the box-office. 11/10,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Real Scary!,"A very clever, dark, moody little period piece (are the 1940's a 'period' yet?) that was scary, intense, and very, very well written.  Well-directed, too, but most people don't notice that, especially not Hollywood.The characters were very well done, and that's where the focus was, as in ""The Sixth Sense.""  The difference here is, that movie had more eye candy, and more frequently... most viewers might get bored with ""The Others,"" although I certainly didn't.  I was riveted, from start to finish. Well-acted, too, all around.  Here's hoping Nicole Kidman keeps getting the good jobs.  And those kids too, and let's not leave out Mrs. Mills.  Great characters, great acting.I have to wonder if I'll enjoy it as much on second viewing, or third or fourth, like ""The Sixth Sense.""

Surprisingly good,"I was very skeptical about this one. The trailer looked like this was another boring movie the likes of ""The Haunting"", and boy did I not want to see something like that again. But somehow my friend convinced me to go see it and I'm really glad I did.It was the perfect movie for a rainy Friday night in April.To begin with, this movie probably contains the best performance delivered by Nicole Kidman. She is very believable and was a perfect choice. The two young actors were even better. Is it these magical and brilliant thrillers(""Sixth sense"", ""Unbreakable"") that bring the best out of children actors, or is it just my imagination. Anyway, a brilliant movie that can easily be compared to Shyamalan's ""Sixth sense"", especially the ending part, but in my opinion a very different movie. I consider the comparison to be flattering, since ""Sixth sense"" is well, an amazing and unprecedented movie experience, and ""The others"" produces a similar atmosphere, but it ends there. This movie takes its own path, and it does so very successfully. To make a horror movie without any blood, simply by playing with sound and light is extraordinary, and I realized it only after I read a review by a great Slovene film critic. Great, great acting, a thrilling and exciting story and of course a brilliant ending make this one of the best movie of 2001 and Alejandro Amenábar passed his first Hollywood movie making experience with flying colors.

Shyamalan only better...,"A mother on the edge and her two children in a creepy fogbound house, complete with odd servants. The film creates a rising atmosphere of oppressive, paranoid dread that makes you feel genuinely uncomfortable and disturbed. Kidman's performance is faultless as a woman who appears to be teetering on the edge of a nervous breakdown. Her highly strung characterisation only serves to complement the sense of foreboding that flows through the film. Brilliantly, the film gives nothing away, and throws nothing at you, but leaves you to do the work - acknowledging that the viewer's imagination is far more vivid than any film-maker's art. Very little, physically, happens in the film - but by the end you feel as if you have run a marathon.

NOT the Sixth Sense,"Having seen The Sixth Sense before, I can assure you this is not a ripoff of that movie. First of all, The Sixth Sense was NOT the first movie to use surprise endings (see Se7en, Carnival of Souls, any Hitchcock movie). Yes, there are some similarities but overall, this a far superior movie. Nicole Kidman plays her greatest role yet as a single mother guarding her two children. Should you feel sorry for her at the ending? No, but this is a movie- should you feel sorry for Norman Bates in Psycho- no, but it still doesn't make it any less of a great movie. Having said all that, I must say that the subtle use of sounds and noises are frightening. Even having watched the film numerous times, there are still parts in this where I am startled. The only negative comment I can see is the movie is a bit slow but give it time....you won't be disappointed. The best movie of 2001.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"A slow but, more than worthy scare!",If you like a good ghost story this is the movie for you to see.  Nicole Kidman deserves the Oscar for this.  Her nervous 1940's Englishwoman was played perfectly.  I certainly hope the girl that plays the daughter is nominated for best supporting actress.  I've paid to see this movie 3 times. It starts rather slowly but all the while the plot certainly thickens on the fog shrouded island that lends atmosphere to this project.  To me it was like seeing the best of a 1940's thriller for the first time.  Then I had to see it again to pick up on clues.  Yet the third time I went was the time that made me jump the hardest.  The plot is truly engrossing and you're never really sure exactly what is happening until the final climactic moments.  You'll leave the theater with your mouth hanging open.,10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
I liked it,"I think that The Others is great movie.  It doesn't rely on gore or conventional forms of horror.  It relies on suspense and mood, which it does a good job of.  No, it doesn't have the horrific violence or a lot jump-out-of-your seat moments.  But the scary moments are truly great, and well done. I try to see all horror films, because I like to be scared, but until this movie I haven't ever really been scared.  I am fairly analytical and I usually know what's going happen long before it does.  But even though I saw these moments coming I was still surprised, and I like that. I would recommend this movie to everyone I know.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A creepy movie - possibly Kidman's best,"No blood and guts needed, just atmosphere, quality direction plot and acting is all that's needed to make a movie creepy. Better than ""The Ring"", almost as good as ""The Shining"". Kidman proves that she's more than just a pretty face with good support from the other actors with Eric Sykes, renowned as a comedian, playing well against type. This movie will scare you - go see it but not by yourself. Probably Kidman's best, along with ""To Die For"" (haven't seen ""The Hours"" yet).",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Don't waste your time,"This one is really a disappointment. The director must have thought: mix some ingredients like ""old and lonely house with a lot of fog around"" + ""nervous mother"" + ""strange servants"" + ""darkness"" and I'll get a blockbuster... But it doesn't work, because these are all stereotypes. The only stress I got from this movie was because of it's stupidity - there's no logic. Why don't they all leave the house if they are so afraid? Why is the mother not going to a doctor with their children who both have this strange disease? --- The only answer can be: because then there's no plot for a movie. The acting of Nicole Kidman fits the movie: overdone... All in all I must say that it's a waste of time to watch it.

A new horror/thriller classic,"This movie is what I call a real thriller: it grabs your nerves from the very beginning, and doesn't releases them at the end with a silly, happy finish.

Relative Ghosts,"Along the vein of previous ghost films such as ""Tales From the Crypt,"" ""Jacob's Ladder"" and ""The Sixth Sense.""""The Others"" is simple, yet brilliant ghost story filmmaking and storytelling.The Plot concerns Lady Grace and her two children (both suffering from an extreme sensitivity to sunlight) and their secluded life on an English island.  The family waits for the return of missing Husband/Father from WW2.The film is based on an original script by the Spanish director himself, but shamelessly borrows from Henry James' epitomal ghost novelette, ""The Turn of the Screw"" and Thomas Tryon's psychological horror novel, ""The Other.""Whatever the case, you'll no doubt enjoy this chilling entry (filmed in mainland Spain, not the English island).  I found it very entertaining, and Kidman is extremely convincing as the bitchy and 'wound-too-tight' Lady of the Mansion.  The child actors and the supporting servant cast also do a winning job.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
"Excellent movie, well worth watching","I really enjoyed watching this film the first time, and enjoyed it even more the second.  The acting was first rate with Nicole Kidman turning in a very intense performance.  The rest of the cast did a great supporting job, adding greatly to the intensity of this story.I really liked the way the story slowly unraveled, it did not feel rushed and events seemed to happen very naturally.  I found myself easily getting into the rhythm of this movie and was never bored even though there is very little real action.The only complaints I have deal with two specific scenes, the first is when the caretakers see Nicole K's character go off towards town.  Instead of them speaking I would like to have seen the old lady just point at the headstone.  The other is when the caretakers are in their attic room talking; again I would have preferred silence or just to cut the scene.  In both cases I felt that less would have been more.  Otherwise, I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys well written, directed and acted suspense thrillers.-Thanks",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
It is the worst movie ever!,This Movie Sucks. It's just like the Sixth Sense only it sucked.I didn't think it was possible for a movie to be that bad.

If she did Panic Room like she was supposed to I wouldn't have seen it.,1.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Kidman's Best Work,"I was very pleased by this movie.  The cinematography is wonderful and helps to make the house seem more claustrophobic.  The director captures an ethereal quality in the actors. The mysterious sounds and voices that disturb this family, led by Kidman, ultimately come from more than one source.  Their deepening confusion, and struggle to maintain sanity, is what propels the plot. Obviously, this is the type of movie that demands to be seen and not spoiled by too many revelations here. I think Kidman is cast perfectly in this role.  This is her best performance. In some respects, this is a story about seeking redemption. Can eternal love achieve forgiveness for a heinous sin?  There are some interesting questions posed herein by the director. This movie has a wonderful cast, excellent acting and terrific cinematography. It is not a superficial or facile movie, although it might appear to be at first.  The Others rewards a perceptive, attentive moviegoer with a great experience. Highly Recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

GOOD movie!,"The Others is one of two films I've seen in the past year that actually made me afraid to fall asleep. The film is a stylish thriller/horror with a well developed dramatic back story that is actually very powerful.One of the great things about this film is its lack of effects. Much like The Changeling (1980), it delivers subtle chills without using a drop of blood. The writer backed it up with a mysterious and sad story about the family, and he spends much of the movie developing this - making the ghostly moments all the more frightening.This film is proof that the film-making industry still makes subtle horror movies without blood, gore, teenagers getting mutilated, and without sex! Let us hope more films like this can be made.9/10",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
One of the greatest ghost stories ever,"This is one of the best ghost stories ever written, it's up there with classics like the 1963 version of ""The Haunting"".  Very few ghost stories have ever been able to obtain such an amazing level of horror and at the same time maintain its dignity.It's very refreshing to see a ghost movie that does not rely on computer effects and cheap, make-you-jump-out-of-your-seat moments of shock (but don't fret, you WILL jump out of your seat more than once).  It achieves its horror through subtle lighting and sound effects, something that's virtually impossible to find in most modern-day horror movies.It starts off a little slow, but quickly grabs you attention and doesn't let go until the end.

I thought I was going to be scared.,"Ok, this movie just bit the big one.  I love Nicole as an actress, but why did she do this movie?  The person falling asleep infront of me and my friends was more interesting to watch.  There was absolutely nothing to this movie until the end. Half the time, me and my friend were laughing at the movie. Nicole is beautiful, but holding a shotgun was hilarious. I was tempted to shout ""Hail to the king, baby!!"" And then with the door, who didn't know that was going to happen? And the kids screaming because of light, reminded me so much of the part in Interview with the Vampire, where Kristen gets fried.

"Worth a rewatch, still spooky even knowing the outcome","Hadn't seen this in years and enjoyed it almost as much in my rewatch. I will say though that knowing the outcome changed the fear factor a bit, almost like watching a different movie in that respect.Its set on the Channel Islands in 1945, a ghost story that deals with Nicole Kidman as a troubled young mother, awaiting the return of her long missing husband from the war. Her two children have a rare photosensitivity disease which means they cannot be touched by direct sunlight, her daughter claims to see ghosts. The mother hires servants to help in her spooky mansion, she thinks they are playing tricks but their arrival changes everything.I still struggled with the scene with the husband, even ""knowing"" it felt awkward and just strange and Nicole does wear on you after a while with her dramatics. Great movie though, scary, atmospheric, stylish with a slowly unraveling plot. I enjoyed the mystery",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Great Mind Trip Movie,"Warning, this is more of a Trumpeting review.  Not much story line or other such discussion here.This movie was great!  In my opinion it is tied with Sixth Sense as the best movie of it's type.  The ending is as good as Sixth Sense where it really all hits you at once, and there is not much chance of guessing it using foresight.A good friend of mine pretty much summed up my current feeling on movies: The longer the movie goes before you ""get it"" the better the movie is; until the ending, where if you don't ""get"" everything, it becomes a very bad movie.Following that line of thinking I think it is one of the best movies lately. However, about half of the people that I have talked to now, I have had to explain the ending.  My guess is that if you ""get"" the end, you will put it along with your favorite movies, otherwise you will feel like you have wasted your time.I would have compare the movie along the lines of ""Sixth Sense"" for it's general direction, and surprise ending.  The ending however is as good as movies like ""Momento"", ""The Game"", and other movies where you never quite know what you are in for.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

"Pain, suffering, forever....","For those who perhaps do not know, ""The Others"" is a movie produced by Tom Cruise starring his estranged wife, Nicole Kidman.That is all that I can say good about this farce which through clever advertising would pass itself off as some sort of horror thriller.  It is in due time about as thrilling as having chewing gum stuck to the sole of your shoe.  Sitting through the whole movie is as pleasant as removing the afore-mentioned gum from your shoe.Early in the film while speaking about religeon, Ms Kidman mentions pain, suffering forever.  That is what you will feel if you sit through the whole film.......If Ms. Kidman could act as well as, say, Sissy Spacek in ""Carrie,"" if the children acted like accomplished child actors rather than like a couple of kids you picked up at the corner store, if someone (Tom?) cared about making a good flick rather than a fast buck then perhaps the screenplay could have been rewritten to have some redeeming moments.  Perhaps the cast should have just improvised the whole thing; it could not have been any worse.It is a shame Hollywood can put out a movie as awful as this, and it will make money in spite of it's being a stinker.  Everyone involved with this fiasco should be ashamed of themselves, but of course, the money will assuage their pain.  Shame on you, Hollywood!  Shame on you, Tom, Nicole!

beautifully haunting,"Amenabar's The Others is a visual beauty. the atmosphere of the movie is dark and chilling.It is inevitable that the movie is compared to the sixth sense. there is a similar touch and feel to that classic movie. however, the plot is significantly different. ive read other viewers claim that the plot is unoriginal, actually they may be right. a haunted house, an ending that HAS been used in the past, a ghost story ... well .. nothing original right? wrong.the director lets the plot build itself, keeping the audience always on the edge, expecting a sudden scare - but the plot just thickens and thickens ... slowly unravelling ... the movie is enthralling even in its nothingness.the performances are brilliant. nicole kidman has earned herself at least a nomination, if not the oscars itself. alakina mann as the daughter is also stunning. kudos to the casting crew. and the director.you might not like the movie much or end up loving it like i did (and the many others it seems - top 250!!!). but do not miss it. its different.a haunting 9",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
THIS IS A FILM YOU'LL REMEMBER,"I would dare to say that one of the best films of the last decade is `The Others'. `The Others' has a very interesting and original plot. It tells the story of a young mother who lives with her two photosensitive children in a house, somewhere in England, after World War II. After the arrival of three servants, the family starts to suspect that the house which has to be kept in darkness because of the kids' illness is inhabited by an other family. In other words it's haunted. What I enjoyed the most about this movie is first of all the unexpected, totally unforeseen ending which really renovates the horror film genre. The performances of the whole cast and especially of leading actress Nicole Kidman are natural but brilliant. The photography with its game between `light and darkness' is excellent and the settings are perfectly attached to the chronological period represented. The mysterious, sentimental score and the well balanced direction of Alehandro Amenambar give this film its unique atmosphere. This is undoubtedly a film worth seeing as it combines drama with horror. The movie leaves us with a bitter taste afterwards and questions which remain unsolved. What it teaches us for sure is that hell  - if it really exists - is never the Others. What scares us the most is the ability of human beings to cause terrible pain to those whom they love most.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Completely surprised! Much better than expected!,"I purposely waited to see this on video because I had read enough negative reviews about this movie, that I did not want to waste my money on seeing it at the theatre.   Well, now I'm sorry I didn't see it sooner.   The negative reviews completely misled me.This is the best ghost story and haunted house story I've ever seen on film. It has completely believable characters, a lot of hints dropped throughout (which I didn't catch until the ending), a growing tension and fear, excellent acting, and perfect cinematography to capture the story.If you have ever been turned off by the House On Haunted Hill type movies, believe me, you will like this so much more!  It showed that this type of film does not need gore and special effects -- just a good story, the right atmosphere (music, setting and cinematography), and exceptional acting by all in the film.One question:  Why did Nicole Kidman get nominated for that flimsy role in Moulin Rouge, but not for The Others?   This is possibly her best role ever, next to To Die For.   Her portrayal of the rigidly protective mother was masterful, and she convincingly brought out the full range of emotions.I was completely surprised by the artistry of the movie, how well it gripped me as a drama as opposed to a horror flick, and how the ending just plain floored me!

"Amenabar strikes gold, beautiful but mildly predictable","I have became a big fan of Amenabar since I watched Abre los Ojos and Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky. This movie obviously looks more like a big budget Hollywood film than Abre los Ojos and the visuals are much better.If it had been a small budget pic, it would probably had the same sort-comings of Abre that Vanilla Sky rectified. The Others greatly improved Amenabar's status as a writer and director in my eyes and I see no room for improvement for this story. But, unfortunately, I had the movie figured out pretty early because one scene was sorta close to one from (now hold your laughs) Beetlejuice. Those who have seen both movies might make the connection... But, all in all, he made another movie I myself would have loved to be in on. Kidman's performance was good, to me it was a 7 and a half, maybe an 8, out of 10. And kudos to Amenabar to keeping to movie to 104 mins., any longer would have been overkill.

Nothing Other Than Great,"Is this Nicole Kidman's year or what? First she stars in the dazzling, cinematic spectacle that is ""Moulin Rouge"". Then she takes a turn and releases the ""The Sixth Sense"" for summer 2001, ""The Others"".""The Others"" takes place in 1945. Grace (Nicole Kidman), a widow and single-mother, lives in a secluded home with her two children, Anne (Alakia Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley). She is forced to live in darkness, for her children have a severe allergy that causes them to break out and blister when exposed to mass amounts of light. All is going well, but soon, Grace begins to learn the she, her children, and her servants are not alone in her house. Grace becomes determined to find out who the intruders are...and drive them out to regain her home.This movie was just beautiful. The story was sharp and original. It wasn't just some cliche`d haunted house movie with spooky sounds and bumps and creaks in dark rooms, with boring ghosts that you seen any old day. The story used the idea of the haunted house, and twisted the story to make ""The Others"" into an original, creative, and new telling of the famous tale. This practice of taking and creating is what made ""The Sixth Sense"" so remarkable, and therefore makes this movie great as well.The acting was just as great. Not only is this Nicole Kidman's year for her movies, but for her acting as well. She has managed to give Oscar-caliber performance in two movies for this year alone. She convincingly plays the strict but caring mother, who is torn between the logic of the beliefs she grew up on and the apparent happenings in her house. You almost forget that she is acting. Alakia Mann and James Bently also deliver key performances as well. In fact, there wasn't one cast member that let me down.""The Others"" was also cinematically beautiful. The dark tones on the movie set the perfect mood for this movie's theme, giving regular scenes the right amount of light and sinister scenes the deserved amount of darkness and horror. The camera angling and positions also wonderfully gave the ""oomph"" needed to make the scenes be seen in the proper mood.A well-crafted dramatic thriller, ""The Others"" is a must-see for thriller-lovers and movie-lovers alike.

It's wonderful to see that there still are a few chair-gripping, CEREBRAL (to the dense, ""cerebral"" means ""boring""), good scripts out there.  Another good thing is that ACTING involves facial expressions, eye expressions and (heaven forbid) emotions instead of blood, gore, and cursing, flying around amid shallow car chases set to bombastic and robotic ""music"" that is used to overwhelm and distract the viewer from the lack of script and acting abilities.""The Others"" is a fantastic find. Nicole Kidman is excellent in this. I never gave her much of a chance before, but now see that she is very talented. Julia Roberts couldn't have pulled this off. Nicole's expressions and eyes screamed volumes as she made me feel what the character felt without having to say a word. The children's performances were some of the best I have seen by kids. The other three main characters were perfect as well! They kept me guessing!I find most movies completely predictable and the soundtracks to be overblown and distracting. That is not the case with this one. I loved the quiet moments that were used to build up the suspense and to allow the viewer's mind to race with ideas---------something that has been sorely missing from films for years. The music ENHANCED the movie!! What a nice change that is! It was perfect and added mystery, eeriness and helped solidify the aura and tone of the film, instead of banging you over the head and being annoying and obnoxious.""The Others"" has terrific acting, a wonderful story line, an enhancing soundtrack, is full of feelings, emotion and fear.

The best movie I've seen this year,"""The Others"" is, by far, the best movie I've seen this year, and I haven't seen a lot of good movies this year. ""Traffic"" was awesome, ""Pearl Harbor"" was good... but ""The Others"" is the best. I usually go to the movies with my mind packed with everything about the movie I'm about to see. But this didn't happen to me with ""The Others"". I didn't even know who was in it!!! A friend told me: ""It seems to be nice, Nicole Kidman is in it"". Well, I gave it a try, and I thank my friend for the tip. It scared me since the very beginning (you'll know why), it captured my attention since the first minute and it didn't let me go. It doesn't, actually. It's still stuck in my head. By the way, I've seen it twice.I'm not telling what the movie is about, you can find that in the plot summary link. I'm just telling you my comments about it, and my comment is, as I said it earlier, you should give it a try. Don't go to see it with the idea of watching ""The Sixth Sense Part II"", both movies are different. Don't go with the idea of trying to discover how it's going to end (to my point of view, you'll never find it out). Just go with the idea of getting into it, feel the atmosphere and have a great time. The spooky elements (it's not predictable as you may think), the great acting (the kids and the housemaid are superb in their acting, Oscar material, definitely), a great direction, a smooth photography and the ending sequence (which left all the audience shut) will do the rest. Go see it twice.",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Masterpiece,"Well, I don´t know. Maybe it is because I am personally involved in it (I met the film´s director last year in a Spanish Hotel and we had a short but nice chat about cinema)but I judge AMENABAR´s work as something classically remarkable. In ""The othres"" it´s not only the plot, the atmosphere, the acting, but the whole stuff that really works in favour of two hours of FUN. (Well, the American version is less than 100 minutes long).

~Good Old Fashioned Scary Flick!~,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer, Nicole is the actress of the year. An outstanding job by her and the entire cast (including the children which are never easy to handle with such MAJOR roles).  Not to mention the brillant casting and the brillant script both by the director.  A good old fashioned scary flick without throwing blood and guts in your face.  This is how they should make MORE of them, and hoping maybe Hollywood learns something from this film.  The ending was a complete surprise and the movie gave a whole new meaning to 'things that go bump in the night'.  Absolutely do not miss this film.

I'm thinking of 'the other' movies I could have watched,"I'm sorry, but this movie was a miss for me. I see a lot of nice reviews, but this is no horror movie. I was recommended this movie because I wanted a good, suspenseful movie with a plot twist (which is the only thing I got). Throughout the whole movie I remained bored. I was never once scared, although I did jump once. (But that does that really count?) This movie has a VERY predictable plot with two major plot twists, only one of which was good. The only scene I enjoyed contained the second plot twist. Which is why I was nice and rated this movie a 4. Nicole Kidman's performance was good, but the long, drawn-out and boring plot did not help her. As I feel as though I wasted two hours of my life, during which I could have watched a way better movie, I would not recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare. Maybe, and I mean MAYBE, to a family looking for a suspense film to watch together.",4.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
captivating original story,"I have seen this movie recently and it really impressed me from the beginning to the end.It's all about the unexpected,you cannot tell what's going to happen next,it's not predictable like other movies of its genre.The lead actress is exceptional in this role and proves she really has the talent to play any type of character.You will probably hold your breath throughout the unfolding of the plot so be prepared not to take any unnecessary breaks because they will spoil the mood and you will lose minutes of interesting action.I strongly recommend you pay attention from the beginning and do not lose any detail.The ending is just as unpredictable as the entire movie itself.Therefore I advise you to watch it as it's a great movie",10.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
A masterpiece of a thriller.,"This is what a good thriller/horror movie should be like. The setting is classic thriller material. A house where doors have to be closed before opening another, mysterious servants, and excellent development of the main characters. Throw in a good cast and an excellent storyline, and you have ""The Others"", a must-see for all cinemagoers.Once again, Nicole Kidman proves why she is one of the most admired actresses in Hollywood by giving a stellar performance. A mother forced to keep her two light-sensitive children out of the light, her character is conveys strictness and frailty at the same time. Her presence on the screen is powerful even when she is not speaking.The supporting cast complements each other. The three servants have a silent yet tangible devotion to one another, and the big sister-little brother relationship between Alakina Mann (Anne) and James Bentley (Nicholas) is convincing.This movie is does not rely on fancy effects and heavy makeup to keep the audience scared yet begging for more. Rather, a combination of good lighting, good acting, and good timing scares the audience out of their wits. The plot moves along at just the right pace, keeping the audience in continual suspense without straining their patience.Though critics claim that its ending is carried over from ""Sixth Sense"", this movie was written before ""Sixth Sense"" was produced. However, comparisons between the two movies is inevitable. Without going so far as to say that ""The Others"" is the better movie, it is no doubt one of the best thrillers to have graced the screens in 2001.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Although the others doesn't have any flashy special affects, the camera glides around suspiciously at the house, and the people, adding to the suspense.This movie is the best of 2001, and so far the best of the decade. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie was the rating. COME ON PEOPLE, there was no blood, no sex, no nothing, so why did it get PG-13? Do a better job next time on that one.Actually, I was glad that there was no blood or sex, because that usually makes movies dull and boring. Good job guys! You created a masterpiece for 8 and up!

One of the Scariest Movies I've Ever Seen,"Perfectly directed, well written and well acted, ""The Others"" is an old-fashioned horror movie in the best sense.  Clean and simple (it could almost be rated ""G"" if it weren't so scary), we don't get ambushed by special effects and excessive makeup.  No, ""The Others"" plays with our heads, and it pays off beautifully.In a movie Alfred Hitchcock would have been proud of, eerieness abounds, and we are left constantly wondering just what is up with this house. Photographs of dead men, women, and children tucked away in an album.  Loud noises in empty rooms.  A young girl strangely calm about all the supernatural events she claims to have witnessed.  Servants with something to hide.  And a heroine on the brink of madness.If you like scary movies, this is a must-see.  My fourteen-year-old son was giddy with fright, sometimes even tempted to look away from the screen, but always drawn back to make sure he didn't miss a moment.  Me, I never looked away--this movie is far too much fun.",9.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"

Classy ghost story in the best tradition...,"Set in Jersey at the end of World war 2 and filmed in Spain, The Others is a good old-fashioned ghost story with all the classic ingredients - tinkling pianos in deserted rooms, doors that slam themselves shut, strange whisperings and sinister servants. The film is lifted onto another level, largely due to a superb performance by Nicole Kidman, ably supported by an excellent cast.Like 'The Sixth Sense', the film is deliberately slow, ponderous and very atmospheric with finely judged 'scary' moments. The twist at the end is totally unforseen and very effective, though as with the Sixth sense, it doesnt really stand up to close scrutiny.

"Refreshingly old-fashioned, character-driven haunted house story","Set in the isolation of the Jersey isles in the days directly following the conclusion of World War 2, Nicole Kidman stars as Grace, an upright Catholic mother coping with the absence of her husband who has yet to return from the front and the burden of raising two precocious children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley) whose deadly allergy to sunlight requires her to keep their immense home shrouded in darkness. Into their strange home arrive an eccentric trio of servants, headed by the seemingly benevolent housekeeper Mrs. Mills. Shortly thereafter, Grace finds their lives turned inside-out as it becomes increasingly apparent that they are not alone in the house and in fact may be the targets of a malevolent haunting. Alejandro Amenabar's lush haunted house story is moody, atmospheric and plays far more like a richly textured old-fashioned film from the 1940s than the garish gross-outs and rock-'em/sock-'em visuals that cater to the attention deficit audiences of today. He has been blessed with a stellar cast, spooky settings and a solid screenplay, which keep the audience guessing as to what is going on. Sharp-eyed viewers might guess some of the elements, but it is doubtful that they will guess all of them as Amenabar has a tendency to consistently provide new twists to muddy the waters. Bentley and, particularly, Mann are credible, sympathetic youngsters, who may be victims to their physical health, but are often more astute as to what may be happening than their mother. Fionnula Flanagan is an inspired choice as the motherly housekeeper, whose unflappable demeanor masks a bit of the sinister. Much of the film rests on Kidman and her interpretation of the not always likable Grace. At the start of the film, Kidman presents Grace as rigid and unwavering – a woman to whom no obstacle cannot be overcome by sheer will and a reading of scripture. She honestly seems to love her children, but seems torn between the resentment of constantly living in darkness and isolation on their behalf and embracing the inherent martyrdom of such an existence. There is a certain bit of viewer satisfaction in watching her world shaken up a bit and seeing her iron façade start to slip. Kidman does a marvelous job of walking the line between making Grace a force to be reckoned without turning her into a hateful tyrant and then slowly transitioning her into a far more complicated woman, whose emotions slowly start bubbling to the surface. I actually find this a far more difficult and intriguing performance than the one for which she would win the Oscar the following year in The Hours. A truly worthwhile and haunting film that actually grows on the viewer even moreso over time.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Decent but flawed supernatural effort,"Arriving at an old Victorian home, new workers looking after a woman's two bed-ridden children experience a series of ghostly happenings that questions their religious upbringing and must figure out how to stop it from continuing.This one turned out to be an absolutely banal drama rather than a horror film, which has a lot of problems. One of the biggest issues is that nothing at all happens in here, with being just so slow and plodding that the scares hardly happen. Since nearly all the early scares or confrontations are off-camera with us coming upon their reactions or hearing about what happened, leaving this one to completely gloss over the potential main selling point by not showing anything to be afraid of and only telling us. This is compounded by all the times she keeps spouting off about their fates in Purgatory and such for failing to listen to her, her insistence on teaching and interpreting the Bible and all of the religious nonsense that permeates the film, as well as the rather ridiculous plot-point about the father coming home, which is dismissed quite suddenly and eats up several minutes of screen time going nowhere at all. Beyond the plot problems, the last act twist is just utterly confusing and makes no sense, rendering much of the film up until that point quite contradictory to what's been established and doesn't really serve a point at all. All of these issues aren't enough to save it from some rather nice points here, mainly a fine, suitably creepy Gothic mansion that serves as the perfect point for this effort, there's some generally freaky moments with the children's reactions to different events around the house and then there's the first revelation about the different workers' true past which prompts some fine action scenes for the first time and gets some chilling scenes involved. These make it worthwhile, but it's overall quite flawed.Rated PG-13: Violence and children-in-jeopardy.",5.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
Brilliant & Masterful...,"Blair Witch Project was a Scooby Doo cartoon mystery compared to the suspense and horror that this film evokes.  Despite its PG-13 rating, I would hesitate to allow anyone under 16 to see this film.  It's very unsettling.  But don't get me wrong, this is a fantastic film.  Kidman and the cast demonstrate that it doesn't take gore and chainsaws to create a true horror movie.  This film is intelligent and skillfully filmed.  Every nuance; every scene is perfectly crafted to recreate a mystery.  There is no red herring, yet the complex story keeps you guessing.  I'll have to see the movie again to appreciate how much the storyteller does give away and how obvious the mystery's solution seems in retrospect.  The foggy mists and gray colors and dark corners will haunt you...but you'll savor every minute of it. I love horror movies...but this is a movie I'm glad I waited to see at home.

The Ultimate Haunted House-Ghost Story!,"I have for a long time had a lot of problems with the haunted house or ghost-in-the-house type movie.  There is generally way too much screaming, gore, special effects, and worst of all, these movies tend to take their ridiculous premises way too seriously.The exception has always been ""Poltergeist"", because so much warmth and humor was part of the story of a middle-class American family under siege in their nice suburban home, and because it definitely had some really scary moments. Thank you, Mr. Spielberg, one more time!So, when I first saw ""The Others"", I was not expecting much.  Was I ever blown away!  First: Nicole Kidman gives one of the best performances of her career in this movie -- better even than ""To Die For"" -- so why was she nominated for an Oscar for that pathetic role in ""Moulin Rouge""?   Second: This movie throws out all the other haunted house and ghost story cliches. The premise of the story is actually quite simple and believable if you believe in ghosts, and it cannot be repeated here.  See it and enjoy it. There is no blood or gore.  There are, quite frankly, no special effects. It is just a great story, within the confines of a ghost story and a haunted house setting, with a dynamite twist ending, with fantastic acting from the entire cast (especially Kidman as the strictly religious, super-control-freak mother of two very different children, and kudos to the little girl who portrays the daughter who knows too much and to the elderly lady who plays the wise nanny-housekeeper who also knows more than the mother).

"A powerful, intense thriller.","In this film, a mother tries to educate her two children by herself, protecting them from a mysterious illness that causes them great sensitivity to intense lights, such as sunlight. While her husband is fighting the Nazis, she lives isolated in a Channel Islands mansion, keeping the house in partial darkness along with three mysterious servants. The lead role is played by Nicole Kidman, who does a brilliant performance in a character who sometimes seems very loving, almost needy, and other times seems unusually hard. But she's just a woman trying to bear a burden that seems heavy: the burden of carrying everything back while her husband is away. The children are equally interesting: played by James Bentley and Alakina Mann, two very competent young actors, they are naive, sweet but also very mischievous, and their mischief contributes greatly to the suspense, especially the girl. She seems to know something that nobody else knows or to have a particularly sharp intelligence. The father, played by Christopher Eccleston, is almost a mere figure. He is purposely an absent character who is permanently present for the simple fact of all the others are constantly speaking of him, and this absence has great importance to the psyche of his wife. But the true life of this film is borrowed by Fionnula Flanagan and Eric Sykes who (along with Elaine Cassidy) give life to the house servants. The way they acted and how counter-acted with Kidman is brilliant, giving the film a deeply conspiratorial atmosphere. The constant darkness, the gas lights, the huge old house, the permanent haze surrounding the grounds are cliché elements that give the film a touch of elegance and help the audience to grab to the movie until the end, which is quite unexpected and disconcerting.",8.0,Anonymous,"Horror, Mystery"
the other view of things,"All the horror movies usually scare you ""out of your wits"" with sudden sounds and unexpected moments of evil appearance. Well, this one doesn't. It's well composed, and the acting is brilliant. Personally i want to give credit to the old lady Mrs Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), she is simply the best in this movie. Sometimes she appears as a kind-hearted nanny, but at times - very sinister. The plot is widely known to have an unusual twist, but regarding the title of the movie, i guessed approximately in the middle. It didn't spoil my pleasure, and later i rewatched the movie a couple times just to grasp the details of the other view of things. I would say that the vision of the situation shown in the movie is what you should watch it for.
