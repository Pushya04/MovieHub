"Who are you, really?","Honestly, I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like It's A Wonderful Life.Does it take me back to that place in my heart, that makes me long for everything that once was great and it could be again? Does it remind me of my childhood, Christmas in my home? No. Maybe it's just simply what I always wanted from life and every man I want to be.Everything about this film is well for lack of better words, perfect. No question to it any longer, the best performance by an actor I have ever seen. It's more than just beautiful, timeless or fair. All of Stewart is revealed. Everything coming together for Capra. Lionel Barrymore at his best, which seems to be his worst.Sometimes I think there is a reason why somethings happen. And I'm pretty sure there is some magical reason why this film was made. I'm 27 years old and saw it for the first time Christmas Eve of this year. I've watched it 3 times since. The only movie to ever make me cry. I probably wouldn't have all the answers for you, if you asked me why. I'm still trying to figure Stewart out and just how beautiful was Reed.What can I say? This movie is a life changing experience.Makes me feel good to be alive. What a wonderful little world it is. And if I waited my entire life, it would not be a waste of time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the greatest movie ever made in cinema history!!,"When I heard about this movie for the first time, I thought it was just a forgettable and funny movie. But I was wrong. I saw this movie last Christmas and I did not find it funny, but I loved it, though! Everything is so great in this movie. The story is amazing. The characters are great, and the character's development is fantastic! the cinematography is grea, and the acting is fantastic. James Stewart was mind blowing. The whole movie is amazing,touching and encouraging. You cannot describe how good this movie is. Nor can you describe how good the message is.This is the best feel-good movie ever. It's a life changing movie, actually. It makes you feel good to be alive. Do me a favor and watch this movie as soon as possible! When you're sad, think about the message this movie delivers, because you will get a smile on your face! I'm 14 years old. My English is not very good, but I hope this review was useful!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Great Influence...,"No movie ever made has influenced me more than this classic. I had the honor of doing a play version of it about 5 years ago. I had seen the film thousands of times, had loved it, but I never really knew what it meant. During the course of the production, I suddenly felt alive. I felt that I wasn't having enough fun. I felt that I wasn't doing enough in my life. Crazy things, like kissing my mother or my father. I hadn't really hugged one of them in a while. It makes you think. It's more of a thinking person's film than a mere Christmas film. If you think it's just a Christmas film, I insist you watch it again and again, until you get the message.Stewart gives the finest performance of his career, in one of the most difficult characters ever portrayed. A character all of us are familiar with...a person looking to find himself/herself. It's the great struggle for finding what it is in life you really want to do. George Bailey teaches us so lessons throughout the film and in the end he teaches us the most important lesson of all, that life, although a long and winding road, truly is (for lack of a better word) wonderful...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Atop my Top Ten,"I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking onscreen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""To My Big Brother George, The Richest Man In Town""","I've always thought that the reason It's A Wonderful Life has had such enduring popularity is that more than in any other film it shows what can be the value of a single individual and the contribution to the greater good they can make.George Bailey as portrayed by James Stewart is the kind of every man hero we can all identify with. He's got the every day problems to be sure, raising and providing for a family, but he's got bigger problems than that. Fate has made him the rallying point of opposition in his small town of Bedford Falls to the ""richest and meanest man in town"", embodied in Lionel Barrymore.It's a real David vs. Goliath battle. Barrymore seems to have unlimited resources at his disposal. Samuel S. Hinds as Peter Bailey put it so well to him in asking what are you doing all this for? Barrymore does have more money than he could ever possibly use. A little charity wouldn't hurt him.Remember the basic plot outline. A whole lot of people in Bedford Falls one post World War II Christmas Eve see that their friend George is toting a heavy load of mysterious origins. Their prayers reach the heavens where an angel is dispatched to aid.But before Henry Travers the angel arrives, he's given the story of George Bailey's life. And we see the kind of struggles he's had, the sacrifices he's made for the good of a whole lot of others. We've also seen a greedy and grasping Potter, grabbing everything that George Bailey cannot save.Something happens that day before Christmas through no fault of his own, Bailey is in big trouble. It's driven him to the brink of despair. That's why the angel is sent down. He shows him the alternate universe that would have been had he never existed. It's something each and every one of us should try to do, step outside ourselves see just what our contributions can be.But I think what Frank Capra is trying to say in this greatest of his films is that having done that and we realize we haven't contributed to the greater good of humankind, we resolve to do so. It's a simple, but profound lesson.What if Potter got the same opportunity? In a sense Charles Dickens did just that in A Christmas Carol. Would Lionel Barrymore change? It's an interesting point of speculation.In addition to those cast members already mentioned a whole group of players who worked with Capra before grace this film. Add to that some others and you have a perfectly cast feature picture.Donna Reed has an interesting part as well. Your choice of mate is real important in life. Had she not been as loving and supportive to George Bailey, he might very well have taken a different route in life. Mary Hatch Bailey became a signature part for her, more identified than her role in From Here to Eternity which got her an Oscar. It certainly was the basis for her TV series.When Todd Karns who plays Harry Bailey toasts his brother he's saying that the riches of the world are not necessarily things that can be quantified. Your life is not measured in material things, but in how you use the material things given you.And that universal lesson will be taught into eternity as long as It's A Wonderful Life is shown every year. Wouldst we all learn it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonderful Film and Timeless Classic,"This film has become a Christmas tradition in my family.  We watch it every year and never tire of it.  Frank Capra is a master of creating films with a message that reinforce strong values.  This is probably his greatest film in that regard.  Both he and Stewart have publicly stated that this is their favorite film.The message in this film is one of courage and sacrifice for the greater good as George Bailey, a man with big ideas about seeing the world, continually forsakes his own desires to do what is right for the town.  The second message is that each life important.  No matter how insignificant we feel we are, we are all inextricably linked to each other and play an important part in the fabric of one another's lives.Capra's direction is brilliant.  His genius is bringing human stories to life in a ways that not only make a point, but that totally involve the audience in the lives of the characters.  He is always extremely optimistic about the human condition.  He is known for testing his characters with overwhelming adversity to make them struggle to triumph in a way that causes the world to change and the character to grow.  For this reason his films were always crowd pleasers and this film was the best of all in that regard.Led by Capra's understanding hand, the actors all did a magnificent job. Stewart's wide-eyed enthusiasm and boyish charm, coupled with an unbending strength of character made him the perfect folk hero.  Donna Reed was lovely and charming and attained the right balance between being supportive and inspirational.  The romantic chemistry between her and Stewart was subtle and charming.  Lionel Barrymore was towering as the greedy old skinflint who was trying to take over the town.  Thomas Mitchell plays one of my favorite characters, as the bumbling Uncle Billy in probably his most memorable role.This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century.  It was nominated for five academy awards and won none.  It was swept in 1947 by `The Best Years of Our Lives', a great film that won seven Oscars that year but in my opinion was the lesser film.  History has corrected that minor injustice by rendering `It's a Wonderful Life' an enduring classic that is viewed and loved by generation after generation.  Of course, I rated it a 10/10.  I can't wait to see it again this Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
IT'S NOT OFFICIALLY CHRISTMAS SEASON UNTIL I WATCH THIS MOVIE,"I am so glad Frank Capra had a vision to make ""It's A Wonderful Life"". I'm glad he chose Jimmy Stewart to play George Bailey. There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born? Our actions do speak loudly. In an age of 9-11, we need this movie more than ever. The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Best feel good movie ever? Quite possibly.,"Here's a new definition of cold-hearted: a man or woman who remains completely untouched by the 1946 Capra classic ""It's a Wonderful Life"". You can't not be moved by this wonderful little gem.The acting is all great. One of the film's greatest strengths for me is making George Bailey - the star of the movie played by James Stewart - a nice normal man. He's not perfect and that's pretty much essential to the film's success because Bailey could be *any* man. The lesson of the movie is fairly simple - we all have our role to play in the world and we are all important. Most movies would make this into a schmaltzy affair but Capra delivered a touching, heart warming tale. Bailey consistently denies himself to allow others to live as he sacrifices his life to make sure people can have enough money to avoid having to sell-their-soul in debt to the evil H. Potter (alas not a Harry Potter...). His complete and utter humility is great - he doesn't see how much he accomplished until his guardian angel Clarence shows him. Again Clarence isn't played in the usual clichéd manner but more as a believable character who honestly loves Bailey for his strengths.The movie is a success because you can't but want Bailey to succeed. The manner in which he does could be classified as corny but, because it's so deserved, that doesn't matter. The music, the set pieces, all the touches add to a wonderful movie and give you hope that life can indeed also be wonderful. A lovely mood-lifter. 8.8/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful film that should be watched again and again.,"This is one of the best films of all time, without a doubt. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!James Stewart is one of my favourite actors, and in this film he acts so naturally you even forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film, and by no means is this a light hearted look at life, as many believe. This is not a rose tinted look at the wonderful life we have, this is a dark, downtrodden start to a film where the lead character is about to commit suicide.However, it is a beautiful film, and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Capra's most cynical movie, and why he's right.","Criticizing It's A Wonderful Life is almost an act of treason in this country, but if ever a movie deserved a closer look, it's this one.Far from being a celebration of the importance of the individual, or of small-town life, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" depicts most citizens of Bedford Falls as timorous weaklings. Moviegoers identify with the hero, George, of course, but he's the exception in this movie, not the rule. If any general lesson is to be learned from the story, it's that a willful leader is the only thing preventing ordinary small-town folk from losing not only prosperity, but morality.The evidence is plain: Without George Bailey to hold the town together, it becomes Pottersville, which is a Hays Code version of Gomorrah. The townsfolk haven't got the courage or sense to manage their own affairs without a leader. In Bedford Falls, that's either corrupt Potter or long-suffering George. The only other characters with any backbone are Harry Bailey and Sam Wainwright, and they both left town. What remains are virtual ciphers like Mr. Gower, Uncle Billy, Ernie, and Bert.America doesn't exactly burst at the seams with self-reliant citizens, according to Frank Capra. So why does this movie merit a healthy 7 rating? Two reasons:1. Because it has undeniable power. Capra was a good director-- but a great propagandist. He made patriotic short films for the U. S. Army from 1942 until 1948-- and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was made in 1946, smack in the middle of that period. The film is a masterpiece of manipulation. People love it, watch it over and over again every year, never noticing that its real message is deeply cynical, presenting little hope for mankind, and almost no faith in it. Indeed, it is almost fascistic in the way it champions the idea of a single leader (or worse, divine intervention) taking charge over ineffectual ordinary middle class people.2. Because Capra proves himself right with his own movie. As an influential leader/filmmaker, he is skilled enough to make generations of sentimental Americans cry and cheer at his movies, no matter how much he insults us.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of those quintessential Christmas movies....,"It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special, and along with Scrooge, the original Miracle on 34th Street and Home Alones 1 and 2, it is something I watch every Christmas. Why? Because I love this movie, seriously I do. Looking through my 1000 or so reviews here, I couldn't believe I hadn't reviewed this movie; I have seen movies that I have loved and cherished since childhood and I have seen movies that belong at the bottom of the garbage. It's a Wonderful Life belongs to the former, although I am 17, I appreciate a good movie when I see one. This is more than a good movie, it's a timeless masterpiece, that holds up on repeated viewings and never loses its magic.It's a Wonderful Life could have easily been overly-sentimental and clichéd, but the quality of the direction and the screenplay that others have summed up perfectly assured it was a beautiful, heart-warming and somewhat poignant film. While there are some funny parts, not bursting-your-gut funny but funny in a subtle sort of way, other parts are close to heart-rending. The direction from Frank Capra is excellent, sensitive and nuanced, and Capra shows even more talent as a screenwriter having penned one of the most honest and touching scripts ever in a film. Casablanca, All About Eve and The Shawshank Redemption all had wonderful scripts, but the script here has a lot to say about community spirit and shows that this film is much more than feel-good sentimentality. There is the element of feel good here, no doubt about it, but it doesn't overpower what the film intends.Visually, It's a Wonderful Life is a wonder. I don't think it is dated at all, the cinematography is crisp, the black and white looks beautiful and the pristine Christmas scenery really does take me back. Some of my favourite ever memories was of Christmas, whether it was watching nostalgic Christmas videos, eating Christmas dinner or singing carols under the Christmas tree. Another thing I have to mention is that the movie is richly and beautifully scored, Dmitri Tiomkin's music here is absolutely gorgeous, lyrical, whimsical, nostalgic and most importantly it never felt intrusive in the more integral parts of the film. And I have to mention the story, never in my life(and I genuinely mean this) have I seen a movie where it communicates such a strong message and so well too. The story of a suicidal man who is shown the value of his life by his guardian angel is an effective, timeless one, imitated perhaps but never equalled.Finally the acting is wonderful. James Stewart, and I seriously don't give a damn whether he was a racist or not and neither should you, is absolutely superb as George Bailey, a truly complex character who goes through such a lot to get to where he is at the end of the movie. George Bailey is like Mr Deeds, John Doe and Mr Smith rolled into one, and in my opinion only James Stewart could have given justice to a character that has self-doubt gnawed at his essential decency. Also the character change, like that of Alistair Sim's Scrooge at the end of Scrooge, was heart-breakingly believable. Donna Reed is radiant and charming as his wife, who is like a caring lover, devoted wife and dedicated mother, while Thomas Mitchell gives one of his more memorable performances as Uncle Billy. Henry Travers is a revelation as Clarence the guardian angel, but there is another performance I think is worth of mention. For a good morality tale, you need a good villain. Well in the name of Potter, you have one. Who better to portray him than the great Lionel Barrymore acting at the peak of his powers?Overall, a timeless classic with a true and heart-rendingly poignant ending. 10/10, one of the easiest perfect scores I have made recently.

Sheer brilliance!,"After strong performances in films such as ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""The Philadelphia Story"", James Stewart confirmed his status as one of the greats with his performance as George Bailey in ""It's a Wonderful Life"". This movie is, without a doubt, the best of all time.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a movie that you can watch over and over again. It's movie that makes you think, about life in general and how each person makes a difference, and about how great life can be (hence the title ""It's a Wonderful Life). Whilst making you think, it also entertains with many light hearted moments, particularly towards the end of the film.The direction, sound and casting in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" are second to none.  Yet it is the fact that almost any person can watch this movie and come away feeling inspired that makes it easily the best movie of all time!A 10/10 without a doubt!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

FRANK CAPRA'S OPUS,"If you were to ask me what Holiday-themed film I enjoy the most and never get tired watching, my answer would invariably be, Frank Capra's ""It's A Wonderful Life"" (1946).Of course, there are many other great holiday movies that are also genuine cinematic treasures, even though they're not as well known as ""It's A Wonderful Life."" My ""must watch"" holiday list includes many of the black and white classics I have previously reviewed on IMDb such as, ""Holiday Inn (1942),""It Happened On 5th Avenue,"" (1947), A Christmas Carol (1951),"" ""Christmas In Connecticut,"" (1945) and although it's in color, ""White Christmas"" (1954). And for good measure I still immensely enjoy watching ""Home Alone 1 & 2"" (1990-1992) and the charming trilogy, ""The Santa Clause"" (1994-2004-2006).Nevertheless, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the singular holiday film that continues to resonate with me on multiple levels. It is a supremely powerful story of self-worth and destiny, bolstered by superb acting, laced with unforgettable characters like George Bailey, Clarence Oddbody, and Mr. Potter, thoughtful cinematography which perfectly captures the small town ambiance of Bedford Falls, sharp editing (no surprise since Capra began his film career as an editor), a beautiful score by Russian composer Dimitri Tiomkin, and more memorable quotes than could ever be listed here.Ironically, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" may never have popped up on anyone's cinematic radar screen had the proper copyright ownership documents been registered. How this error occurred is fascinating.The original 1945 ownership of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" belonged to Liberty Films, an independent motion picture production company created by the film's brilliant director, Frank Capra. The following year, Liberty was purchased by Paramount. Ten years later, in 1955, M. & A. Alexander subsequently purchased the rights to the short story, ""The Greatest Gift,"" on which the film was based. With the purchase also came the rights to the film itself, television syndication, and the music score. Shortly thereafter, National Telefilm Associates (NTA) became the new owner. Amazingly, a clerical error meant NTA had neglected to renew its copyright. By 1974, the movie fell into the ""public domain.""In essence, Capra's masterpiece no longer had copyright protection, and therefore, anyone could make copies of the film, package it anyway they chose, all without having to pay for it. Because of this, television studios began broadcasting ""It's A Wonderful Life"" during the Christmas holidays, while dozens of other companies packaged and sold the film in various media forms such as VHS, and later, Laser Disc and DVD. The good news- This nearly forgotten film was now being seen for the first time by millions of people. The bad news - Many of the reproductions were of poor quality, with some crudely edited down from the original 131 minute run time into a shorter length to accommodate TV scheduling. Nevertheless, these unusual series of events managed to breathe new life into Capra's stunning film for future generations.As often occurs with films destined for immortality, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was initially a financial box office failure, although it was nominated for five Academy Awards (including Best Picture) and has been revered by the American Film Institute as one of the 100 best American films ever made.There's nothing more I can add to this review that hasn't been covered already by other astute IMDb reviewers, but I will say that if you have still not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"" by now (2021) then stop whatever you're doing and buy the BR, DVD, or stream it. I'm confident even after your first viewing you are going to feel like you've just seen one of the greatest films ever made, and you would be absolutely right!No spoilers here as usual but I will reveal that while much of the film happens in the fictional town of Bedford Falls during a very cold, snowy, Wintery Christmas holiday, it was actually filmed in Southern California which was experiencing a sweltering record heat wave!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life's Not Always So Wonderful,"My apologies to all of you ""It's a Wonderful Life""-ers out there. Please believe me when I say that I've tried multiple times to develop warm feelings for this movie. But it's just not meant to be. I've seen this film a couple of times, and I never want to see it again.I want to beat James Stewart's George Bailey about the head and shoulders every time I watch the movie. Perhaps the most passive-aggressive hero in motion picture history, George Bailey spends half of his time sacrificing his own happiness for the sake of others, and the other half whining about his hard luck. No, George, it's not hard luck...it's the result of your own decision making skills. Either be selfless and stop complaining, or be a bastard and screw everyone else. But make up your mind, and don't take two hours to do it.Ahhh, perhaps I now live in too cynical and jaded a world to tolerate George's namby-pamby indecision. But maybe that's a reason better than any other to keep this film around. Character aside, however, the one thing I can unequivocally praise about this film is the performance of Stewart. He provides a welcome bitter edge to combat Capra's sugary-sweet corn. His breakdown scene in a bar, where he desperately prays to God to help him keep himself together, is a tour-de-force.Drag it out every Christmas and enjoy...I won't begrudge you that small pleasure. Just don't expect me to join along.Grade: B-",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Depressed about how your life turned out? Watch this film,"Reminiscent of the story of Scrooge of A Christmas Carol, the movie in itself is predictable and slightly less haunting. Similarly, the center of the film is also focused on the Christmas holiday, making it much more dramatic because contemplating suicide on a night where everyone is celebrating is such an irony. Throughout the film, you feel powerless for George, as if all the world's problems continue to fall unto him, a character that most people can relate to regardless of age or generation. Dreams come with sacrifices.Supposedly a feel-good movie, its one of those where you are made to feel bad so you can feel better after. It has you cringing and falling flat on your face before you get picked up. Though the ending may be touching, it does not do much in terms of solving the main character's personal issues and is unconvincing in a real-world setting. Perhaps in an ideal world, that is all it takes to be happy.A movie with a big case of 'you don't know what you have til its gone'. All it takes is an imaginary slap and you're back to accepting the life you have been dealt, only this time, you're happier about it.From an optimistic point of view, the movie is a good reminder to everyone that happiness isn't a checklist you have to accomplish, but a state of mind you attain when you feel content.7 out of 10 stars, because it's a classic and has a better storyline and script than most movies these days.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Enjoyable, hearty and well crafted","Lovely film.'It's a Wonderful Life' is enjoyable, hearty and well crafted. It takes longer than I would've predicted to get to 'the event', but it's very much worth seeing the journey that comes before - as we see the arc of James Stewart's George. It all crescendos with an ending that you can't help but smile at.Stewart is excellent in the lead role, you really do see every single emotion that his character goes through. He is, by far, the standout performer, but there are of course good performances from the likes of Donna Reed (Mary), Lionel Barrymore (Henry) and Henry Travers (Clarence).I did notice a few weird cuts in there, not that I hold that against it or did it affect my enjoyment - it's just noticeable. I see, via other reviewers, that there's a colour version - Channel 4 showed the black-and-white version over here in the UK. I can't say I felt the need for colour, which is always a good sign.Wholesome. Not that it, evidently given the average rating, needs to be said by someone like me, but: I'd certainly recommend this.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
GOAT Christmas movie,"This story gets me every time. The themes of gratitude, family, and self worth are timeless and touching. It also has messages regarding materialism, and how money and ""things"" aren't really what's important in life. Despite George's failed dreams, he still touched people's lives in ways he couldn't measure until his guardian angel showed him. It's a beautiful reminder of what really matters in life, and the remastered color version looks really damn good. This movie is legendary and should be mandatory annual viewing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Deeply Moving Holiday Classic,"Shortly after the end of WW2, the tastes of the American people yearned for something more real like the war, which lead to the underperformance of Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life as it was deemed too sentimental. After years of being played on television, it eventually got the attention it rightfully deserved. George Bailey, played by James Stewart, yearns to leave Bedford Falls, but one unfortunate event after another calls for George to make sacrifice after sacrifice, until it all culminates to one crucial moment on the night of Christmas Eve when he is at his lowest and most vulnerable. James Stewart presents a wide range and a layered character and one we can root for as his dreams go further out from his reach. How the writers brought Christianity into the story was appealing to me and is approached in a way that makes it universally digestible. We have ourselves a great cast of memorable characters that show some growth and then there is the easily detestable Mr. Potter, who seeks to take over the town and is continuously at odds with the Baileys. The tone of the movie itself I found to be perfectly balanced as we get plenty of heartfelt moments, but also some dark and intense ones as well. It's a Wonderful Life proves to be more than a holiday classic, as it excels with its story that everyone can take something away from. Final verdict: 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"More than ""a Christmas film""...","An absolute classic of ever there was one. A movie that, thankfully, transcends being a ""Christmas movie"". If you removed the minuscule reference to Christmas you would still have the classic as it is today. A film about caring for your neighbour and your neighbour is everyone. A film about sacrifice for those you love and even your community at large. It won't make you rich in money but it would make the world a better place. Never forget the YOU, like George Bailey, matter. You matter to more people than you know. It's a Wonderful Life if you can see that.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

George Bailey Please Stop Complaining,"This movie is like eating your vegies. You don't like them but you know they are good.I didn't really enjoy this movie. George Bailey gives so much in life and suffers because of it. He then starts complaining and having a cry over it all. Get over it mate. What was happening in his life happens a lot more often today, so he may have won the battle but he didn't win the war. Business is business and if you can't move with the times, you are almost bound to be unsuccessful.I didn't enjoy it because I found his personality so annoying. What this does mean is the movie got me thinking and Jimmy Stewart played his part well. I have only kind words to say about the production of the movie and definitely recommend it to all.7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

One of the Most Beautiful Movies of the Cinema History Ever,"On the Christmas Eve at Bedford Falls, the guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is assigned to convince the desperate George Bailey (James Stewart) to not commit suicide. George is a good man, that sacrificed his dreams and his youth on behalf of the citizens of his small town. He inherited the loan business of his father and he gave up traveling the world and joining the university as scheduled. Later he resisted the proposals of the evil banker Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) and has never sold his business to protect the poor community of Bedford Falls and offer a means to afford to buy their own house. He married his beloved Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) and had four children with her and a tough life with his family. When his uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) loses US$ 8,000.00, found and stolen by Mr. Potter, George decides to commit suicide, since he believes he worth more dead than alive. When Clarence sees that he is not able to persuade George to give up his intention, he decides to show the life in town if George had never existed. George concludes that life is wonderful.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is certainly one of the most beautiful movies of the cinema history ever. This masterpiece has a touching and moralist story, showing that the famous sentence that a man can make the difference is true. Everything works perfectly in this movie. The original screenplay develops the situation and the characters accurately, using flashbacks and magnificent lines. The direction of Frank Capra is outstanding as usual. The cinematography in black & white and using shadows and lights is fantastic. James Stewart leads an amazing cast, showing a perfect chemistry with the gorgeous Donna Reed, in the role of a compassionate and enlightened good man. Lionel Barrymore is also amazing in the role of the despicable banker. I do not recall how many times I have already seen this film, but last time was 16 Dec 2000. This is the type of movie that a lover of cinema will never get tired of watching many times. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""A Felicidade não se Compra"" (""The Happiness Is not Bought"")",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beautiful and more relevant than ever,I've seen this film at least 20 times over the years and it never fails to move me. It Is so relevant more than seven decades later. Our wonderful nation could very well face the same future that Mr. Potter wanted to inflict on Bedford Falls. Amazing how its basic premise of redemption and good winning over greed resonates in 21st century America.The older I get the more emotional this film makes me. It is simply that good.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's a vexing movie,"This isn't the first time I've seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"", but it still leaves me cold. And it's primarily because the Dickensian ""what-if?"" hook that redeems George Bailey in the end isn't enough to make up for the brutal treatment of that character up until that point. I know that's a minority opinion; my family thinks I'm nuts. But look, Bailey's a dreamer, brimming with a youthful ambition that gets snuffed out time and again by his obligation to Bedford Falls. Sure, there's a message here, that he protects the town from predatory capitalism, but to see the man struck down by one cruel twist of fate after another is beyond frustrating; and the payoff feels cheap in comparison.This is a classic for a reason, and who knows, maybe I'll grow into it. But as it stands, its charms are wasted on me.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Ageing Beautifully,"I had fond memories of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" but, somehow, it never made my top ten. The other night I felt the urge to see it again, from beginning to end, after that fun compilation from the AFI, 100 movies, 100 Cheers. The most surprising thing about this perennial classic is that it's not just a good movie but a sort of miracle. Age has made it more relevant, more powerful. Frank Capra is, without question, its miracle worker. His narration style was a first and in a way unsurpassed. As you may very well know, the film wasn't an instant success. A peculiarity it shares with most of the great works of art. The truth is something that needs time to be confirmed even recognized. James Stewart's performance lived from a 2006 stand point is, quite simply, extraordinary. Capra's films were known as ""capracorn"" in their day. Strange to think about it now because its sentimentality wasn't really sentimental but a need to find goodness in the darkest places. The great Capra not only found it, it unmasked it with the same relish that he unmasked evil and greed. My only regret is that on this times of technical prowess we'll never see again the likes of ""It's Wonderful Life"" But, trying to look on the bright side in the most Capraesque kind of way. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" will be around for ever.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic,"It's a wonderful life is a classic. Most of the reason people really enjoy this movie is because of the sentiment they have while watching it with family and friends. Although, while watching the movie, I wasn't constantly thinking about how old the movie was. The story and the acting was captivating enough to make me forget about the old style. I've seen some reviews about how the movie told a depressing message about why you shouldn't take risks in your life and just stay where you're needed. However, I think the movie just tries to tell a message that there is meaning in life even when things are looking down; a slight change of perspective can change your whole outlook on life. Overall, a lighthearted movie with a meaningful message.Also the wink at the end was foul ;D.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Not A Fan,"Sorry, this film just doesn't move me (and I cry a lot at movies). I find it long-winded, heavy-handed and rather preachy.

It makes you stop to think about your own wonderful life...,"On one crisp December evening, two decades ago, my husband and I celebrated our very first Christmas together as a married couple. One of our yearly traditions, which we established that very Christmas season, has been to settle in front of the TV with a large bowl of popcorn and sodas for a quiet evening enjoying the holiday classics.That evening, my husband flipped the channels and excitedly noted the film ""It's a Wonderful Life"" had just started playing. After learning that I'd never seen it, my hubby enthusiastically said, ""You have to watch this movie - it's one of the best films EVER.""I guess my prejudice toward black-and-white TV was rearing its ugly head. I was in no mood to watch a dated film that I thought was of no relevance to us. I encouraged my hubby to see if he could find one of the many holiday classics that we enjoyed as kids growing up in the late 1960s, early 1970s timeframe.My husband chuckled and said, ""Trust me, you'll love this story. It's about this guy, George Bailey, who..."" After relating a brief synopsis of the film, he warned me that I might find the first 45 minutes or so to be slow-moving. Still, he encouraged me to pay attention closely. ""Remember everything happening now to this guy, George,"" he advised, ""It'll pay off in the second part of the film.""As I watched George struggle with his devoted wife to raise their kids and pay the bills, report to a job that he never really wanted, battle his devious nemesis Mr. Potter, and yearn for a life that might have been, I thought - okay, there are some universal themes here. But this was a Christmas film? I couldn't make the connection, and really wasn't in the mood to continue watching anything that wasn't about Christmas.I was getting ready to go into the other room to finish my Christmas wrapping when, suddenly, finally, it was Christmas Eve in George Bailey's little world. I remembered looking at that serene little town, decorated for Christmas and bathed in fluffy white snow, and wishing that I lived in such a place.And just as my husband had promised, over the course of the next several minutes, everything started to come together. By the end of the film, as I watched George Bailey come to the realization, with his cherished family and lifelong friends gathered around him under his Christmas tree that George Bailey, representing every man and woman, ultimately realized that he surely had had a wonderful life. I wiped away a happy tear from my eye, knowing I'd viewed something very special.Then two and then four Christmases later, as I sat in a rocking chair, at first with our newborn baby girl and then her baby brother, I watched It's a Wonderful Life with my babies. I have subsequently repeated this tradition with friends and relatives of all ages. Many of them, like me at first thought they were dealing with an out-of-touch film from the mid-1940s, only to come to realize the timeless, wonderful gift we've all been given by Frank Capra.Since Christmas 1985, I have watched ""It's a Wonderful Life"" countless times. I agree with many other viewers - it is not only hands-down, the best Christmas movie, but perhaps my most favorite movie of all. I love and cherish it for so many reasons, perhaps most of all because it really makes you stop to think about what's important in your own life.And the most special moments of all are those times when I get to share ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" as my husband did that one Christmas so long ago, with someone who is watching the film for the very first time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Magical.,"George Bailey gives his all for the people of Bedford Falls, big hearted and selfless, George puts the needs of others before himself, pushed to breaking point, he contemplates suicide.I feel almost guilty watching this grey film in November, as it's definitely one of my Christmas watchlist, but with the decorations appearing, and the mince pies in shops, I thought, why not.Nobody does it quite like Frank Capra, there is a depth to this movie that's quite something, it's a story of greed, hope, compassion and humanity.The story resonates as much today, a tale of the little guy taking on the unscrupulous, wealthy greedy big business (some things never change, right!)It's light hearted for the most part, but there are some very bleak moments thrown in, that scene where people demand their money, and that heart stoping moment where George vents his frustrations on his Uncle.So many moments tug on the heartstrings, it's no wonder it's a festive favourite, but it deserves its place as one of the greats, not just a Christmas great.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Is the worst thing that can befell a woman is to be a ""spinster"" and work in a library?",,Anonymous,Fantasy
I beg to disagree...,"Now, here is one movie where I will have to disagree with almost everybody. I do not care that this film has become a Christmas staple, and notwithstanding my love and admiration for Frank Capra and James Stewart, this movie is far from even being particularly good, let alone a masterpiece. This is a movie that somehow got hyped up with the passing of time, and now exists in a universe of its own. It is telling that at the time of its making, it did not even receive a single Oscar. Apparently, at the time, nobody thought it to be so special...Now, if you look at this picture objectively and without the typically ""small-town-America do-good pink-shaded sunglasses"", you will find a very simple, obvious and at times boring story. The characters are so simplified, that most are just caricatures of real people (just look at the local villain). Technically, there is nothing to write home about either. The sound, as a matter of fact is terrible, one can barely discern the (sometimes confusing) dialog.And then we come to (according to the masses, and not only) the most important part of the movie: the message. Here is where I have another major problem... I may be cynical or stupid, but I do not see what this all-important transcendental message is; If it is simply 'be a good person', this could have been (and has been) done much better. This movie is a mix of slapstick Hollywood 'feel good' and of political correctness '1947 style'. No wonder it fares so good in our modern times...",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film will clearly answer that question.It just goes to show that movies do not have to have all the special effects bells and whistles, deafening sound track and Dolby digital to capture viewer interest.

I don't like it,"I am definitely in the minority regarding ""Wonderful Life"". I have avoided seeing this movie for years ... and I finally gave in just before Christmas 2009. It was Christmas Eve and I discovered why I was so depressed on the holiday. I really can't stand this movie. The original problem I had with it was when I first saw it many many years ago. I didn't like the idea that ""Mary"" needed glasses and was ""ugly"", and a lonely prim librarian without Jimmy Stewart in her life. No, I am not a librarian, but I love spending time in libraries with all the knowledge books have to offer. I felt this was gratuitous and insulting. In addition, couldn't ""Mary"" have found another husband? I resented those old movies where all the those poor, struggling people live in large, comfortable old houses, even if the hero's mother ran a boarding house. I think Frank Capra's films are phony and the products of an immature mind. Another Christmasy movie is my favorite one: ""The Bishop's Wife"". It's sophisticated, witty and beautiful, and has much stronger actors than any of Capra's films, with the exception of Henry Travers who, as far as I am concerned, is the real star of ""Wonderful Life"".

One of the All Time Greats,"It's a Wonderful Life (1946)**** (out of 4)This timeless classic has James Stewart playing George Bailey, a frustrated businessman who gets the chance to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. I've lost count of how many times I've watched this film over the years but it keeps getting better with each new viewing and I can't help but notice new things each time I watch it. There's really nothing I could add that hasn't already been said about this movie but it's certainly one of my all time favorites and I'd argue that it's one of the greatest ever made. This movie has been called timeless by many people but I really can't think of too many movies where this is more true. I can't possibly see how this movie would ever grow old fashioned or out of touch because there's always going to be people who feel like the main character here. The most amazing thing to me is that the film perfectly captures how someone might begin to feel that they're worthless and I can't help but think that anyone who watches this movie will have a better look on life or themselves after watching it. I really can't think of too many movies that contain as much power as this one but I'd say that's why new fans are gained each and every passing year. The greatness of the film is certainly its heart but Stewart also deserves a lot of credit for his marvelous performance, which is certainly one of the best of his career. There are countless scenes in this movie where Stewart just nails it and I'm sure everyone knows the praying in the bar scene but there are many other great ones as well. On this viewing the scene on the bridge when Stewart begs for his life back hit me unlike any other time. There's also the scene in the bank where George has to bargain with the people not to take all of their money. Lionel Barrymore was always great playing bad guys and I can't help but think he's one of the greatest villains in movie history. The evilness that Barrymore is able to get through this character makes it among the actors best work. Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell and Harry Travers also add great support. Every inch of this movie works flawlessly and that includes the sequences where George gets to see things as if he were never born. I think these moments contain Capra's greatest work as a director as the darkness and atmosphere he creates is so think and depression that it perfectly puts you in the mind frame of George. Then you've got that priceless ending, which ranks right up there with City Lights and Psycho as being the greatest for any movie.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Great feel-good movie,"Now, I don't think it's perfect. I certainly don't think it's a masterpiece, but it's got a lot a stuff going for it. Credit where credit is due, I can see why this is a classic.
It's characters are infinitely loveable, and all of the performances are damn good. Pretty great direction and dialogue as well.
The editing was certainly a little off sometimes, and that was noticeable, although this is a really minor complaint. It has a good deal of subtext, and manages to convey George's feelings very well with the cinematic medium. However, I felt that his feelings were a little too simple and on the surface towards the end, but I'm not saying he had didn't have good reason to be upset, it's just with an act such as suicide, you'd expect George to be completely and utterly tired of life. And the film was saying he was, but it didn't TOTALLY convince me. My main complaint really had something to do with the time period. The angels at the start being stars was certainly funny, but they could've shown a little more, which would be hard to, but it would make the film a bit better.
That aside, this is a pretty great film, and a great experience at the theatre, which was where I saw it.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

From a Time That No Longer Exists - Its a Wonderful Life,"Frank Capra excelled at films where socialist values (not the political ones, but the social ones) were extolled by several characters within his films. It was a time when people cared about other people instead of just themselves and their own families. That, unfortunately, is a bygone era in the US. That US no longer exists; we are now all out just for ourselves and our families, and everyone else will just have to fend for themselves. Of course, there are exceptions, but for the most part, the mentality of these films are long extinct. The family and friends of Jimmy Stewart rallying around him in his time of need is just what this film is all about; a fantasy. In real life your FAMILY MIGHT rally around you, and that would be it; maybe even a friend or two. But an entire community? I don't think so.

"A ""Better-Off-Dead-Than-Alive"" Bible Story","Believe me - This decidedly heavy-handed, Christianity-driven, tear-jerker (from 1947) is so loaded down with underlying religious propaganda that (depending on which side of the bible your ""daily bread"" is buttered on) it's either gonna warm your heart, or else it's sure to freeze it.This film's story-line also preached (and I quote) ""No man is a failure who has friends"" - (Yeah? - Isn't that nice to know?) - But, with that in mind - (I ask you) - What about all of those out there who have no friends? Does that render them as failures?Anyway - From my critically observant point of view - ""It's A Wonderful Life"" was so incredibly over-sentimental and highly manipulative (as it zeroed in on the idealism of small-town, American life in the late-1940s) that its storytelling repeatedly veered right off the radar into the stratosphere of pure surrealism.And, with that - This film ended up coming across like an extended (and rather creepy) 2-hour-10-minute episode of The Twilight Zone.

The idealistic and charitable Bailey family, especially George, are the one thing that persistently prevents Potter from succeeding.However, George has his share of troubles, and they eventually begin to take their toll on his good nature and optimistic outlook. It's now up to his guardian angel, Clarence Goodbody, to open George's eyes to how wonderful his life really is.IAWL promotes friendship, empathy, optimism, and love of life. You can't but admire the excellent way in which it does this. The story, the sets, the actors, the dialogue, the music are all top-notch. Highly recommended!9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Sentimental and Timeless,"The wonderful (pun intended) thing about this Christmas classic is that you can appreciate and fall in love with it all over again as you age and reach different stages of your life. When you're a kid, you enjoy the fairy-tale elements of the story, and you laugh at Clarence the Angel's lines. As a teenager and young adult, you identify with George Bailey's famous speech: ""I know what I'm going to do today, and tomorrow, and the next day after that."" He has so much hope, idealism, and the time to spend on righteousness. But the older and older you get, you see the tragedy in George's journey. You feel sorry that he never achieves what he wants and that he spends his life taking care of other people and holding down the fort for the reserves that never arrive. That's why, no matter how old you are, you always cry at the end of It's a Wonderful Life, and that's a wonderful thing.The sentiment of this story is truly timeless. There are no cell phones, people use trains as transportation, and the Great Depression is only mentioned in history books - but every part of it is still incredibly relatable to modern audiences. Youthful crushes, idealism before you gain experience, defending your family without understanding the consequences, and seeing ""the bad guy"" without any backstory to his life. No matter what generation you belong to, you live through all these phases when you're young. Bravery, loyalty, regret, frustration, and gratitude don't expire on a certain year. So even though the movie is in black-and-white, the appeal of wiping the slate clean on your life still hits home.Sentimentality aside, it's still a great movie. James Stewart gives the performance of his career as George Bailey. You believe him every single step of the way, and you feel that you've actually gotten to know him, rather than the character. When the camera films his vulnerable prayer scene in Martini's Bar, you're almost embarrassed to be watching such a private moment. Thomas Mitchell also gives a career-best performance as the stereotypical drunk family uncle. Despite his enormous flaws, he really does mean well. Beulah Bondi, as the long-suffering mother, Henry Travers, as the affable guardian angel, and H. B. Warner, against type as the emotional drug store owner, provide a steady supporting cast to the film. You've seen all these actors in dozens of movies before, helping to set the stage of a small town where everyone knows everyone. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen, playing Bert and Ernie, are also familiar faces. Even the smallest impact is still an impact, like the friendly local cop or the one taxi driver in town.Lionel Barrymore is a hilarious villain, and unrecognizable in his disguise. He rattles off his venomous lines with such wisdom, and even though he's supposed to be the bad guy, you know that a lot of what he says is true. In a rare occurrence, you'll be able to hear Gloria Grahame before she stuck the cotton in her mouth. This was only her third movie, and her adorable turn as Violet makes you wish she never got self-conscious about her lips. Finally, there's Donna Reed, the epitome of the American housewife. If James Stewart is the perfect everyman, Donna Reed is the perfect everywoman. It's no wonder she became the iconic television mother after being the backbone of the Bailey family in It's a Wonderful Life. She sacrifices, steps up to the plate, and gives generously, all with a smile on her face. Plus she's really pretty, and she keeps her figure after four children!I know you've seen this movie before. You've probably seen it a dozen times by now. But if you're thinking of skipping it this year, don't. Don't you want to see ZuZu's petals one more time? Hear, ""I wish for a million dollars - hot dog!"" Feel the cold, oppressive rain during the run on the bank? Don't you want to get a new lease on life just as the calendar year comes to a close? Of course you do, and millions of Americans will experience all those wonderful little moments with you this Christmas.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Its great movie to watch,"In a movie It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) goes through out his life trying to help people in his home town living with his wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house. Even though he understood that his father's business does not bring much income, people were his main focus. He lived with a dream that one day he will travel across the globe and will come back to build new buildings. Despite of his dream, Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) prevents him from leaving his home town and is forced to take over his father's loan company. On the Christmas Eve, George's uncle Bill (Thomas Mitchell) loses $8,000 while he is attempting to deposit them into the bank account. Mr. Potter is the one who discovers the money but hides them from Mr. Bailey. As George realizes that after bank examiner finds out about missing money, he might go to jail and will loose his company, therefore he decides to ask Mr. Potter for help and give up his company. As he thought about his family, he was told that he is worth more dead when he is alive, and decided to commit suicide. Because of his family prayers, an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) was sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people he cares about by taking him to the time as if he was never born. I loved this movie because of its positive attitude. Some of the main characters are just perfect for their character in the movie. Even though James Stewart won an Oscar for his George Bailey character, my favorite character is the Mr. Potter. His bold head and cricket eyes are perfectly underline his grouchy character. Bailey's wife Mary is a perfect character as well. Her facial expressions are very clearly expressing her feelings. Her face did show an expression that she is deeply in love with George. Also you can see when she figured that George is in money trouble.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Overoptimism for the masses,"What do we have here? Could this be the most positive film ever conceived? Was this made for children or for the whole family? Was it crafted for suicidal maniacs maybe? No, no, it can't be that; too dark for children and too childish for adults. I don't like to use the word ""dated"", but this is what I would call a dated film with a dated (now cliched) message.
Well, it has an intensely naive positive message, but maybe necessary for that period. But why so much optimism? Could have been because of the post-war overoptimism? The Post-World War II economic boom? Could be.
The film is clearly flawed, objectively speaking. The main problem is the protagonist. With just a few occasionally bursts of anger towards the end, he has a flawless character. Altruistic, nice, tolerant, idealistic, etc etc. He is the perfect white boy. The antagonist is pretty much the antithesis of the main character. Stereotypical Walt Disney cartoons-like characters? Well, almost. Almost! Also, this is a fantasy film not because of the fantastic elements, but because characters act unnaturally during specific events. Some moments are too cartoon-ish and unrealistic. At least those moments are funny, so I can forgive this aspect (this is actually the case in many classic American movies).
Well, I appreciate the subtly dark undertones of the film and even the cartoon-ish humor.
I repeat, this film may be too dark for children, too light and naive for adults and too cliched for today; objectively, this is a dated film.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"One of Frank Capra's best, but not the best.","This film is one of those that any movie lover sees at least once in their life, if only because it is so talked about and so respected among moviegoers. However, I got the feeling that the movie, despite being really good and entertaining, doesn't justify so much buzz. It's a good movie, and there's no doubt about it, but it's not exactly a work of art, as many good commentators have argued. In fact, from the filmography of those involved, it's a film that doesn't even stand out: James Stewart is much more interesting in Hitchcock's films, who knew how to get the best out of the actor, and even Frank Capra made films as or more remarkable than this one.The script is very simple: an angel is sent to help a man at the most difficult moment of his life, when everything indicates that he will be arrested after sacrificing his life and dreams to maintain the firm that his father left him, and that prevents an unscrupulous local millionaire from completely taking over the city and doing what he wants with the people who live there. We are, therefore, facing another Christmas movie, where faith and hope are the main focus. The script, well written and effective, is one of the film's strong points: in addition to bringing us a good story that appeals to the whole family, it is based largely on a main character so pleasant that it is impossible not to like her and just watch. The movie just to see how she will overcome the challenges that lie ahead.The cast is headed by James Stewart, one of the great actors of this time, in another excellent work. At his side, however, are other excellent actors such as Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore or even Henry Travers. The cast's overall performance is good, but that's not what makes us want to see this movie. Deftly directed by Frank Capra, the film has a leisurely pace but doesn't waste a lot of time in exaggerated consideration, doing its best to keep the story going.Technically, it's a regular film that makes the most of the resources available at its time, without overshadowing the story it wants to tell, nor going to the director's head, determined to keep the film in a direct and relatively frank record. The black-and-white cinematography is very good and pleasant, and everything was excellently shot, with sharpness and clarity. The editing work was also well done, and the cuts are barely noticeable. The sets and costumes are well done, the dialogues were very well written and there are many memorable moments.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Masterclass in Movie-making,"The first time I am aware of seeing IAWL I managed to catch the last 5 Min's of the movie. It seemed to feature a character running around shouting 'Merry Christmas' at everybody, followed by a party where everyone handed over money To be frank, I wasn't in a hurry to see the rest of the movie.Then several years later, I started to watch IAWL from the beginning, unaware that it was the same movie. I was struck by how comprehensive the character study of George Bailey was. He was a good man, but his ambitions were frustrated at every turn. He wanted an Education, that was just outside his grasp. He wanted to travel, life conspired against him. At every step of the way, one person saw George 'rolling with the blows', that was Mary Hatch. This woman loved George and wanted to stand at his side, so they can face the slings and arrows of misfortune together. This is love of the purest kind.But even Mary's love cannot prevent George contemplating suicide. A single bad day that sees George on the top of the World at the beginning and thinking that taking his own life is the only way out by 10.45 pm.I was stunned when the ending turned into the movie I had seen some time before. But this time I understood, this wasn't just sentiment for it's own sake. To understand the ending you need to have gone on the same dark journey that George Bailey had been on.Many others have commented on the feel good aspects of the movie, so I won't. What I would like to say is that there are a number of scenes which live in the memory long after the end credits.Young George trying to persuade Mr Gower that he had prescribed poison (with young Mary Hatch Looking on).George hurrying home when he heard his father had had a stroke (with Mary Hatch looking on).George waiting at the station with Uncle Billy for Harry to come back from college (only to find Harry is already married and has a job that will keep him away from Bedford Falls).That kiss (I have to check that I am earthed, there is so much electricity in the air).Mary giving up their honeymoon money, to keep the Building and Loan out of Potters grasp.The Bridal Suit (with Ernie & Bert).Trying to talk to Mary in the alternate reality, but managing frighten her.The Ending.I don't think I have seen a better character study, or for that matter a better movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Outstanding,"I have seen some very good films in my life, of that there is no doubt. This one though, Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" I remember the first time I watched it, it was the holiday season I think my sophomore year of High School. Being a high schooler I tried extremely hard not t let my tears show, but it was no use, and I could see similar failures around the classroom. I haven't seen a movie that could reach such an emotional level with me since, probably the only one that ever came close was Lion King, when I was 5. This movie will always be on my top 5 list, and so far no contender has got even close to removing it from the #1, and 64 years after this movie has been made there still isn't, that is really saying something.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Average movie,"I think it's an average movie. It's got classical Hollywood propaganda- and politics. I think people tend to ignore the undertones of trying to get people to stay in the 'homeland' of America. There's also political messages about democracy and individualism, as well as small messages about family life and propaganda about the war. It's good in that it gets people to appreciate life, yet it seems to discourage people to aim higher. For some people having a wife and kids and friends is nice, but for some they have other goals. Seeing the world and achieving ones goals is important, we can't all accept second best. We have to be selfish in some ways if we are to get what we want. There needs to be a balance, but in this movie George lives more for others.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Small town life,"In It's a Wonderful Life, George Bailey (James Stewart) is man who wants out from his small town life but something always keeps him from breaking out and fulfilling his dreams. Instead he ends up working in the family loan company, helping other people out. He has a wife Mary (Donna Reed) and four children in an old house which they make their home.On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Bill loses $8000 while he is attempting to deposit the money in the bank but loses track when he brags to the town bigwig Mr Potter. The Bailey family nemesis, Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore) finds the cash but keeps it to himself. George realises when the bank auditor finds out that the accounts do not match he might lose everything and go to jail. George decides to kill himself However an angel Clarence (Henry Travers) is sent to save him and to show him how valuable his life is to the people around him by taking him to the time as if he was never born where he sees an alternate timeline. George discovers that he has made a positive contribution to many peoples lives.The story has been told many times since then in television, books and films. Even the last episode of Classic Dallas was a variant of this movie based on the Ewings if JR was not around!The film is regarded as an all time classic and it does have merits for being novel such as the beginning of the picture with a supreme being calling for an angel and the angel being one who has yet to gain his wings that is another story done many time since.The film is charming, winsome but also a shade too long. The alternate timeline where the town becomes a cesspit looks improbable with Mary being a spinster librarian, a friend of George (Violet) becoming a good time girl and other townsfolk becoming nasty and rather brutish.Also Mr Potter never seems to get his comeuppance, even during the days of the code Mr Potter still managed to find a way round things!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The whole sequence right after that where he is praying to God for help just chokes me up every time.I dare you to name a modern day actor who could do it so well.And wasn't Donna Reed the perfect wife?

The success definitely belongs to Frank Capra and the star of the movie, James Stewart.When the movie has released 1946, it is amortized to his budget due to the indifference of the audience. I think the reason was the low popularity of those kind of movies during their period. During 1940s', people were mostly preparing love stories which focused on a couple's relation with simple details. Additionally, it was moved up by the following of the second war.

A lone dissenting vote on It's A Wonderful Life,"I hate to be the lone dissenter here, but I think It's a Wonderful Life stands right up there as one of the most overrated movies of all time.  Not that it is a particularly bad movie, but I cannot see how it rates on everyones top ten list. True, the story is interesting and a bit intriguing, and it has a couple of good scenes.  But you take out the scene where Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed are dancing and they fall in the pool, and you take away the last five minutes of the movie, then there is not much left.  And speaking of the last five minutes of the movie, that is the only reference in the whole movie to Christmas, yet this movie has been branded a Christmas movie.  To me, in terms of Christmas movies, it does not belong in the same category (or class) as Miracle on 34th Street, White Christmas, A Christmas Story, and yes, Even Home Alone, Parts I and II.  I will give it one thing, the ending to this movie is truly one of the best of any movie ever made.

This is NOT cynicism regarding the message, I actually love the sentiment of the film despite its religious propaganda overtones. I just find the movie saccharine beyond belief and cringy at every ""hee-haw"" turn, and Donna Reed is about the only actor I don't want to spontaneously combust.

Everyone's prayers make something move up there, in the heavens, and an angel named Clarence is sent to save the lad. Most of the movie we learn, alongside Clarence, how George has come to this harsh situation, and the big question is hovering in the air: will Clarence be able to save George?Honestly, there isn't a single aspect of this film that I see as truly phenomenal, or even above ""pretty good"". It has its enjoyable comedy-oriented scenes, its witty dialogue bits from time to time, and I'd even say that the film does a pretty good job showing us George's desperation, the way that his dreams escape him because he's too involved in helping the townsfolk. The main cast is also solid, but that's about it.The film's conclusion is supposed to be moving and endearing, but I couldn't help but find it cheesy and artificial. Not only that, but the whole final act of the scene, the part that's supposed to be the climax (and is also the most famous part of the movie) feels rather dull and cliché. Sorry, just couldn't get into it. Also, the relationship between George and Mary feels forced, too, when it comes to some pivotal moments in the film. They have their cute moments, but moments that are supposed to be cute or romantic in the late parts of the film just feel slightly off to me.This is a simple review for a simple movie. I get why the movie is being referenced so much, since it has some iconic moments, and the first half of the film is pretty fun indeed, but I just couldn't get emotionally involved when it came to the emotional core of this movie. I guess it was worth watching anyway, if only for the pop-culture value, but this one's truly overrated in my opinion. Feeling a 6.3/10 on this one.P.s
I watched the colorized version, couldn't find the black-and-white one in good quality.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""Aah!"" or should that be ""Argh!""","Watching this film in the wake of the banking crisis, it is apt to have a different effect on the viewer than that intended. The actions of George Bailey and his father amount to a long justification for ""sub-prime"" mortgages,""sub prime"" being a euphemism for ""lending to people who have no chance of paying you back"" which has lead to the present day bank bailouts which means that responsible people now must pay for the actions of the irresponsible. Why does doing this make George and his dad the good guys?Why, for that matter, are we told that George's father only made enough money to send one of his kids to college? Is that meant to be good? Surely, in the real world, that would make him a poor father? He has clearly never heard the truism ""charity begins at home"" although he did have enough money to hire a black servant..perhaps he should have saved the money he spent on her to put his kids through college? Just a thought.Obviously Hollywood will never get to grips with the real life implications of the Bailey's irresponsible lending policies, ie people being lumbered with unpayable mortgages and losing their homes. No, this is the land of magic pixie dust where good intentions always lead to good outcomes. The reality is transformed into a one dimensional baddie, an evil capitalist who could come straight out of the Stalinist propaganda of the period (in fact this film could have easily be shown in the USSR without a single cut whereas it was -rightly- a box office flop in the US). Oh, if only there weren't these greedy evil people, if only banks could lend money to good people without worrying whether they could pay it back, then how much nicer the world would be!Around this childish morality, a sanctimonious and saccharine story is built. Even by Hollywood's golden age standards it is extremely sentimental. I must say in passing, I've attempted to watch this film many times, but this this is the first time I've managed to make it all the way through and only through gritted teeth.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Wonderful Film with a Cutting Edge,"Once again, my two cents' worth of a film that is the darling of so many people, myself included.  It has its uplifting conclusion, and the theme that every life has its purpose in the great scheme of things.  George Bailey is in trouble.  He has decided to end it all.  The thought of jail and disgrace is more than he can handle.  George's life has been a continual parade of missed opportunities.  There is a layer of pain just above the surface of nearly every scene.  George is a victim and this series of disappointments takes its toll.  He eventually becomes hardened and frustrated, but because he is honorable, he goes about the business of living.  He has gifts he doesn't realize.  He has family.  He has status, and while not often appreciated, he is.  Unfortunately, we don't always share our love and admiration with those who deserve it.  His sense of adventure from birth has been clutched from him over and over.  His bad ear makes the army an impossibility, his father's death forces him to run a business he wants to run away from, and even his honeymoon money is used to prevent a run on the bank.  George never knows his importance until Henry Travers' well meaning angel comes along.I love this movie, but I also take it seriously.  It can be painful to watch sometimes.  The best scenes are the ones where George never existed.  His despair is evident and the tension builds higher and higher.  When he comes back, such a weight that is lifted. Jimmy Stewart is at the top of his acting form; I loved him as a living human being and as an actor; he portrays the kindness I believe the world should have.And then there is Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Ward Bond, and all the others.  They are superb.  It's a question all of us have wrestled with: ""What if we had never existed?""  There is no peer in Capra's canon.  I truly believe that this is a necessary part of our heritage.  We need to see things as they should be.  I love Christmas because it at least portends to be the time we all look at our gifts.  This movie is a gift to the world and one we can learn from over and over, even if the events never took place.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An all-time classic,"One of the films that has been on my watchlist the longest. I finally understand why this is regularly listed as peoples' favourite film, and why it has become the ultimate Christmas staple.Jimmy Stewart was fantastic in this. I can't help but feel he brought some of his own wartime experiences into this role and the way he portrays George Bailey at his most vulnerable. The rest of the cast were fantastic too. Special mention to Donna Reed as the beautiful Mary, and Henry Travers as Clarence, who definitely had me laughing more than once.This didn't actually feel like a traditional Christmas film for most of it. In some ways, that just makes it even more universal and timeless in its appeal.The plot and originality have been reproduced in countless ways ever since. It's easy to see why. You can't help but think about your own life at times, and somehow come out the other side a little more grateful, a little more optimistic. Any film that can do that is worth its weight in gold.A well-deserved classic and one I'm grateful to have finally seen.Those final scenes. Damn.

It's perfect,"This is my most favorite movie of all time, not just as a Christmas movie. Sure, it has its morality plot points - but if you watch it carefully it is also a primer on economics. Watch what happens to banks before the FDIC was invented, and consider how owning a house effects a family's wealth generationally. In this time period the Martini's would not have been considered white, so apparently George Bailey is building a subdivision that doesn't have deed restrictions! Imagine that. Meanwhile Old Man Potter wants to keep everyone living in his cheap substandard rentals so they won't get ""above themselves.""I love this movie in Black & White as originally filmed, but for those who can't bring themselves to watch a B&W movie, Ted Turner made a colorized version in the early 80s. Some of the beautiful shadows are lost, but Violet's hat gets a whole new look. I think everyone should watch this movie, at least once as kid to learn the real meaning of Christmas and at least once as an adult to unpack the economics lesson. For myself, I was lucky enough to see it once in a full size theater during a special. And in the 90s when it fell into the public domain it used to be run on TV every year so we could watch it as a holiday tradition. It never gets old to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Fantasy Americana (with a somber undercurrent),"Heartwarming Frank Capra film which has become (quite unintentionally, I presume) a Christmas perennial. Set in small town America, James Stewart stars as a discouraged and suicidal banker who learns a lesson about life from an angel anxious to get his wings. Fantasy with a holiday theme took many years to garner its classic status, yet it's a shrewd mixture of comedic, dramatic, and emotional elements. Capra's direction is quite sensitive, creating an evocative overview of middle America and the struggling working class. Stewart gives his usual sterling performance, and Donna Reed is a good romantic screen match for him; Henry Travers is the perfect twinkle-eyed old angel. Capra also co-adapted the screenplay based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift"" (which seems to have a touch of Dickens as well). Later remade as the 1977 TV movie ""It Happened One Christmas"", which featured Marlo Thomas in the lead. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

1 hour of movie stretched into 2,"The final 45 minutes is really the movie and for some reason it takes an hour and a half to get to that point. I went into this film with a general knowledge of what the plot would be, so I was shocked at just how long it took to get the ball rolling.The final act of the movie is quite good, which is why it's the only part that people talk about today. I just can't in good conscience give it a score any higher due to how slow the first half is. I get why people love this movie but it's just not for me.Synopsis:
George Bailey has so many problems he is thinking about ending it all - and it's Christmas! As the angels discuss George, we see his life in flashback.

Brings you back into the true meaning of Christmas,"I know this is going to sound ridicules, but seriously, I have not seen this movie since I was a child. Even though they play it every year for Christmas, I never really had an interest to see it again. I was complaining to my mom the other day how sad it is that people just look at Christmas as present time and just getting what you want, I almost cried over it because I miss how my family would get me presents, but we'd go the homeless shelter to help out people who couldn't have a better one than us, I always thanked my parents for those wonderful experiences. It taught me that there is always worse and we must help those not just on Christmas, but all year around. Well, we did it again this year, but I'm now in the retail business and when I complained about this to my mom, she lent me the movie and said to watch it.Watching this movie truly touched my heart and brought me back to the true meaning of Christmas. I mean, your heart just goes out to George and his wonderful little town of Bedford Falls. He and his wonderful wife Mary together do whatever they can to make it in life and support their 4 darling children. But when a horrible mishap goes on at the bank that George works at, loosing $8,000, he starts to wonder if his life is worth living. But there is one angel who will not give up on him and shows him what life would be like if George had never been born. In Bedford Falls without George, turned into Pottersville because of the very greedy business man Mr. Potter, no one is happy and Mary is all alone. George realizes that maybe life is worth living and comes home to this loving town that is willing to do anything to help him and his family out.""What goes around, comes around"", I couldn't stop tearing at the end because it's just so loving. I hope future Christmas's will go back like this movie's examples, where people are just happy to have what they have and realize some are not so lucky, but we must all do our part. Cheesy, I know, but if one person can raise their hand, we all will do our parts in the end. Merry Christmas, everyone! :)10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

No man is an island unto themselves!,"IT's A WONDERFUL LIFE is definitely one of the most beloved and most watched films of all time. Simply enter human warmth and kindness in the festive atmosphere. Great script and a story that follows the life of one man, his family and his fellow citizens will not leave anyone indifferent. The magical atmosphere and timeless magic simply forces us to become part of the film. Given the time period and the retrospective of life, it is hard not to find yourself in one of the situations.Director Capra went on a series of films about the little people with real human virtues. Again, one protagonist dominant. In this case, dissatisfied with their lives. Capra wants to show something that is long lost. Family, friends and hard work are actually a wonderful life.James Stewart as George Bailey hit the famous director. Not only because of its irresistible charm and manners that had a chance to hone working with the most beautiful and famous women in Hollywood, but for the link in the mode of dealing in the character George Bailey and the actor. Furthermore, his character, although at first glance may be too mean, really has a great depth, and excellent Stewart interpretation gives it weight. Stewart's acting phenomenon I personally never liked her, but his fantastic performance I will never challenged.Donna Reed as Mary Hatch Bailey is quiet and modest woman who truly loves and appreciates his wife. The character is so simple and quiet to the stunning strength has exactly the moments when it is most needed. Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Henry F. Potter essentially it is a greedy materialist, passion for money in his being destroyed any shred of humanity, but he is not satisfied and with all his strength his personal dissatisfaction wants to convey the awareness of other people. I have to be skeptical and say that today these people are incredibly much.No man is an island unto themselves! Globally, the story in this film does not have a universal character. However, we can hardly resist the impression that we are all part of a whole, and unbreakable bond. I am not a supporter of the belief that there is ""someone up there"" who maintains the world's balance. Simply have eyes and see what happens. However, I think it's Capra lukewarm fiction and mild levity created because of those feelings.This movie is full of optimism, the story is touching. The man is an unusual way realized, despite all the problems, how is life actually delightful.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Highly recommended,"The film has what I love most about films, ""Inspiration"". The story really is built up in such a way that you'll eventually get inspired by it. Acting by James Stewart is superb. The story is about a man who wanted to do a lot of things, but circumstances changed his fate. He never lost hope, but one day things get really out of controlled and he loses faith in everything. It is very interesting to see how the story reaches to its ending.PROS:One of the best acting performances I had seen recently. The whole film rests on its beautiful story. The film is a very fine example of what we expect from life and what we actually get. The life of our hero seems to be frustrating a lot of times but than in the end, you are finally going to get convinced that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE.CONSI admit that the whole angel thing did not impress me much and I was hoping for more realistic kind of thing. Also the editing at some later part of the film looked bad. It was nominated for the best editing Oscars, but just my opinion. But when you have a very fine story, you have to overlook these small glitches.MESSAGE: ""It's a wonderful life.""VERDICT: ""A must watch for all.""",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Bit Oversentimtal but you got to love Stewart and Capra and yes Lionel Barrymore! .,I've seen this movie every Christmas for years. Its pure Capra and Stewart sentiment. I like 'You Cant Take it With You' alot better. It has a pertinent message plus humor. There's just saccharin overdrive here to me.The only one who really brings some realism to IAWL is Lionel Barrymore 's excellent portrayal of Mr. Potter. Hey you may not like him but he is as real as it gets here! He steals every scene he is in and of course crucial to the film. You can't have a movie like this without a great villian. And he is about the best villian in Cinema history! And leave the ending alone! It doesn't need an alternate ending. I never watched that SNL skit and never will!Great over all cast here though and I can see the appeal. But its like 'Gone With the Wind'. I've seen it too many times.,6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pursuit of happiness? Only if you stay put!,"So, if Jimmy Stuart had really lived I wouldn't sip a Martini now - but I would know and maybe even befriend a valuable citizen called MISTER Martini who lives because Lionel Barrymore died at the right moment? Or is it the other way round? I liked to speculate along those lines, when I was a child.Watching It's a Wonderful Life made me quite mad. The message is pretty cruel. It goes like: you are needed here and don't you dare planning to go on a world trip or anything like that. It's for other folks only. This strongly smells of Calvin's doctrine of predestination which, some say, is one of the foundations of the spirit of the USA. The main character is practically denied a free will, due to the circumstances a non too benevolent god arranged for him. I must admit, Stewart's hysterical shrieks on the bridge, as it dawns on him how valuable he is for the community, sounded to me like the first signs of full fledged madness.Ironically, the Potterville Stewart's character prevents through his sacrifice seems to be a much more thrilling place than the Bedford Falls he preserves, at least to a modern day audience. I am not against modesty, a good community spirit and loyalty, but inertia and values that are declared absolute and unchangeable will not help to solve the world's problems. I don't know how Frank Capra weathered the HUAC hearings, but the rigid categorizations of the citizenship this movie makes in order to propagate American values could well have pointed at him as a Commie sympathizer"".James Stewart's George Bailey is the exact opposite of Gary Cooper's Howard Roark in The Fountainhead, made three years after this movie.

It's a Wonderful Life will continue to inspire retellings and the creation of similar stories for eternity, and that is a powerful thing.

In this one, he uses an amazing story device; he has the main protagonist wish that he had never lived, and then God sends an Angel to show Jimmy Stewart as the main protagonist exactly how everyone's life would have been different if he had never lived.By doing this, Capra shows the importance of COMMUNITY and CARING for one another, and also demonstrates his deep faith in the Church and in the Lord.This is far and away Capra's best film, and far and away the finest Christmas film ever made.Hodie Christus Natus Est.Zuzu Bailey: Look, Daddy.

Misguided celebration of self-destructive charity,"There is a folktale concerning St Martin, who as a soldier on a mission of importance, gave half of his cloak to a naked beggar he met in a snowstorm... the moral being that there are circumstances where it isn't worthy (or rational) to be charitable to the point where you can't survive yourself. It's a A Wonderful Life, however, is the story of someone who - in effect - gives all his cloak, then complains about the consequences.There's been a deal of revisionist criticism focusing on the political subtext, but I'm more interested in the personal angle.  In my view, George's suicidal state of mind is not caused by the greedy Potter or by family mishaps, but by his invariable decision to respond to such situations by throwing away all of his own wellbeing and hopes in favour of others.His actions are not even necessarily 'good'.  At every turn, George lets sentiment completely swamp reason. What if covering up for an incompetent pharmacist led to further deaths?  Perhaps Uncle Billy *ought* to be in an institution?  Perhaps George should have recognised a no-win situation, made a settlement with Potter and moved on, instead of selfishly saddling his family with a company he deliberately runs so unprofitably that it hasn't the capital to ride a financial setback.Furthermore, the alternative timeline presented by Clarence is clearly fake, concocted to justify George's failure to break out of this self-created rut. There is no reason to asssume, other than because Capra wants it so, that if George hadn't existed his wife would have remained unmarried, his brother fallen through the ice, or the town's social change necessarily proved negative in the long run (Potter after all, won't live for ever).Sorry, but I find this film deeply exasperating.

"Beautiful film, perfect for Christmas.","This is a movie about George Bailey, a businessman who is on the verge of suicide due to being on the verge of bankruptcy, costing his livelihood as well as many others' quality of life. However, he is greeted by a kind angel who shows him what the world would be like had he not been born. A rather simple plot, yet a brilliant one.This movie perfectly conveys a message about self worth as well as selflessness, showing how much of an impact you can have on many people's lives if you're willing to help others and in turn, help improve their lives as well as how you should be grateful for the things that you have and not be foolish enough to throw them away (especially family and friends). The movie also does a great job balancing love, humour, tragedy, and joy. I should also mention that the acting is fantastic (I especially like Lionel Barrymore's performance as the grouchy, villainous Mr. Potter).Following George Bailey's story was truly enthralling and the film did an excellent job making him a sympathetic and likeable character. A man who sacrificed his dreams of travelling the world in order to financially support the inhabitants of his childhood town. Seeing his sacrifice pay off in the end is truly, dare I say, wonderful.I absolutely recommend this, especially as a Christmas family film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Movie!,It's a wonderful life. Well it truly is. I have never reviewed a movie before. Probably because I have never seen a movie like this. I have watched a lot of good movies but never bothered about reviewing any of those because none of them made me do that but this movie forced me to do that. This movie is flawless. The best movie I have ever seen.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Possibly the greatest film ever made,"The storytelling, level of acting and pure emotion found in It's a Wonderful life is what separates it from almost any other film. Watching it, whether it is the first time or 50th time, reminds the viewer of the meaning and significance that was once ubiquitous in film. Movies in the modern day are largely filled with cheap thrills, one liners and constant stimuli. It's a Wonderful Life is the complete opposite. It tells a story that is so fundamentally important that it almost NEEDS to be told. The lessons that can potentially learned from watching this film are invaluable. The beautiful and talented Donna Reed gives one of, if not the best female acting performances I have ever seen, and James Stewart portrays George Bailey so well that it is hard to imagine separating the man from the character. Even some of the greatest films have flaws, but I am unable to find any with It's a Wonderful life, it is a bona fide masterpiece, and I believe any true cinephile would agree.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Just discovered it. Can't get enough of it!,"This is a seriously enjoyable watch for the New Year. I've been meaning to watch it for quite a few years but couldn't get my hands on the movie, living in Asia. Just watched it online last New Year Eve and it was amazing. I love how they portrayed the life's little coincidences. How little gestures can change a person's life. It's sweet and great and I don't know what else. My favorite scene is when George woos the girl. Seriously sweet how they did it in the 19s. The character of George is funny and true. I also love how they portrayed the family. Love how they dawned on the importance of loving relationships and seriously it brought me back to the innocent self I have been as a child. This is really going to make it to my next New Year's watch list.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Interesting concept but poorly made or poorly aged,"I can find value in the film because of the perspective it brings to American culture. I also appreciate the message they are trying to give. The concept they came up with to convey the message is very interesting and has high potential. But unfortunately it's not the movie I hoped it would.I understand that the film is from a very early stage in the history of cinema and I do not want to criticize it harshly. But side plots which designed for our main character to change people's lives are uncreative and dull. That's why the alternative world which we saw was not striking for me at all.In the main plot, which I can call a capitalist criticism, our main character sacrifices himself too much. This is no longer a highly appreciated situation in today's world culture, and not at all in American culture. Didn't this country instill the American dream in the world, of being the hero of your own story and moving the world? Also, it seems interesting to me that capitalist America has been praising a movie that criticizes moneymakers for decades. People back then knew where things were going.Lastly, how can a movie where people talk so much and so fast be so slowburn? For a heartwarming Christmas movie, there's too much tragedy covered at too long.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
This Film is a Life Changer,"Everyone has heard of this film, and if you haven't seen it, it's probably because you live in Antarctica or you have purposely avoided watching an old corny rerun in black and white.I command you to watch it, and if you have a heart, you will cry with joy. This film has endured as a timeless classic for 70 years for good reason. This film is pure art because it taps into the human experience in such an effective way. The message that we are all important is simply and beautifully brought to life.Jimmy Stewart's performance is human, funny, poignant and brilliant. Do not look for subtlety, clever meanings, high drama, modern art, political correctness, special effects, sex scenes, or car chases. You won't even see any color (avoid the colorized version at all costs), but what you will find is a perfect little film that will stay with you forever. This film represents the very best of what America wants to be at its core.I appreciate high brow multi-million dollar productions as much as any other film geek/ movie buff, but this film always brings me home because it reminds me of what really matters in life.Watch it and savor every wholesome corny second of it. If you don't feel something, you are not human.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Enjoyed it but doesn't live up to the hype.,"I'd argue the ending makes the movie. In other words, the ending is so heartwarming that anything that came before it is forgotten. I'm not saying it's bad movie but....George goes to a bar to drink is woes away? Since when? What evidence or foreshadowing do we have that a man like George would go to a bar and get drunk when faced with problems?George then contemplates suicide (not a spoiler since the movie starts with this info). What reason to we have to believe that George would even consider such a thing? Regardless of what he learns about others, he's got frikkin unicorn wife. You know, the lady that did so much for him on their wedding night. He's also got 4 amazing kids. He didn't need Clarence and it was unbelievable that he'd consider ending his life.George sees the world without him.... This didn't work for me at all as motivation for George to go back. First off the angel never told him he could choose to go back. Further, it's out of date. The new town with all the clubs looked way more interesting and fun to me than the old town with an ""emporium"". Maybe it wasn't the town he was used to but it wasn't objectively worse, just different. Of course I get the main point was all the people worse off without him but it just came off as contrived. I haven't yet read the book ""The Midnight Library"" but apparently it covers this idea with a lot more balance.The mean old Mr. Potter was a ridiculous caricature which made much of the movie feel like propaganda. It's all fine to to sing kumbaya with each other ... until someone takes advantage and doesn't hold up their end of the bargain. Then suddenly the entire thing goes belly up. In other words, there's a balance between greedy but pudent Mr. Potter and generous but irresponsible Mr. Bailey. Without that balance Mr. Potter will own the town but Mr. Bailey will also, of his own accord, go bankrupt by being more generous than his loan company can afford to be which in and of itself will ruin all the people who's money he's loaning out.Further, in today's lens, his ""I loaned him money because I knew him"" sounds at lot like banks only loaning to people that look similar to the banker. In other words, the ""I know this person so they're ok in my book"" (eg, the good ole boys network) was banned for good reason.You'll note, the movie got mixed reviews when it came out. It also lost money meaning people at the time didn't like it. Go read the reviews when it came out and you'll see similar issues as those mentioned above.In any case, the good scenes won out and I'm glad I watched the movie and teared up at the end. But, it's not a 10/10 because of how contrived it is, at least for me.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I don't get it,"How is this a Christmas story? Perhaps it is my different cultural background or the fact that we were fed other movies for christmas over the limited broadcast of my youth. This movie is never shown in TV where I live so I had to go out of my way a bit to see it, but I just had to watch this timeless masterpiece as many call it.I don't get it.It is sooner a drama about recession and life in general(a pretty OK at that) that happens to feature Xmas and an angel, but I feel like it has very little to do with the actual plot. They could have used any other supernatural plot device instead of the Angel and the majority of the movie isn't even about that. Most of the movie is setup and rather depressing at that. The part of the movie which deals with the premise only comes around in the third act and is over rather quickly. In the end the bad guy even gets away with it.My theory for the cult of this movie is that for a time, this was the go-to movie to broadcast (for whatever reason). Thanks to nostalgia, people watch this movie with their own children and the circle repeats. You won't remember the movie for it's quality or plot, but the feeling you had while enjoying the holidays and that is fine I guess. Coming to a movie fresh with no nostalgia from an another background though? It did not resonate at all.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Perspective!!!!,"This will be my 100th comment on this website, and, it stands to reason that I should pick an all time classic movie such as ""It's A Wonderful Life""!! This film is Frank Capra's best film ever... A statement of this nature tells you how remarkable this movie truly is!! Jimmy Stewart was voted by one magazine as the second best performer ever in the history of Hollywood!! Only second behind Katherine Hepburn, making him rated the best actor in the history of movie making!! While some people may question this assessment of Jimmy Stewart, due to Jimmy Stewart's innocuous Huckelberry Finn disposition, I can empathize with this verdict of Stewart's acting on account of his precisely executed latent tendencies which ultimately resonated into an articulated anger!! Jimmy Stewart's acting is very itemized, and thus, it establishes emotions which are genuine, these emotions relegate Stewart to a vulnerability which was pertinent to the fact that his feelings which could no longer be bottled up inside of him, would make him obtusely erupt!! Donna Reed is in this movie, and her performance is very believable as well!! Lionel Barrymore is extremely adept at playing the role of the ogre (Mr Potter) who is metaphorically writhing in his acquisition of the Baily Building and Loan!! This movie is the classic Christmas movie of all time!!, ""Miracle on 34th Street"" and ""Fantasia"" as well as any other Christmas movie, do not capture the spiritual camaraderie related to the yuletide association with caring and benevolence that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" exemplifies so flawlessly!!What the film ""It's A Wonderful Life"" accomplishes is the ideology behind the true meaning of what Christmas signifies... This phrase in of itself sounds very rhetorical, however, with a movie like ""It's A Wonderful Life"" such an accolade is the genuine article!! ""It's A Wonderful Life"" resembles the movie ""Best Years of Our Lives"" in the manner by which a happy ending is attained the hard way!! Often times, we look at our lives and become demoralized at the uneventful banalities which perpetually plague us!! We are depressed at how money dictates virtually everything, and, as was the case with George Bailey, we become trounced by failure and despondence!! Adversities are what make us cohesive, considering that this film was made right after World War II concluded, we as Americans were thoroughly aware of such a fate!! The fatal predicament which besieges George Bailey in this movie arouses occasion for all of the good citizens of Bedford Falls to bond together and realize the importance of caring for each other!! Such a homespun philosophy was anything but an artificial panacea, and with it, Americans immersed themselves into a nationally guarded perspective of good will and compassion!! This film is outstanding!! The talent and the ideological premise to this film, has out-shined virtually every other movie made!! A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned!!! Films which make people feel fortunate are not breaking any rules which compromise the quality of a film!! All of these carefully devised components to this film make ""It's A Wonderful Life"" an absolutely magnificent movie!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A man receives a rare gift,"Frank Capra's sometimes dark post-war film, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" was released in 1946. It was intended to be released in 1947, but when a Technicolor print of ""Sinbad"" couldn't be delivered on time, this film was put into release.For that reason, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - possibly the most wonderful film ever made - was overshadowed by ""The Best Years of Our Lives.""But you can't keep a great film down, and as the years have passed, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has found its place as an iconic film that means Christmas. It's survived the public domain (due to a clerical error, when the copyright was not renewed in 1974), where it was cut to ribbons and shown so often on television (and why not, networks could show it for nothing) that people were sick of it. Now that it has to be licensed again in order to be shown, the film is shown in its totality and not as often.This remarkable story of a man who sacrifices his dreams for the betterment of his community and the business his father built resonates today more than ever, when it often seems like no one cares about anything except what's in it for them.James Stewart is perfect as a caring man who swallows disappointment after disappointment and finally is ready to give up, until he is given the gift of seeing what would have happened had he never been born. No man, he learns, is poor who has friends.I can't think of a better message or anything more inspirational than can be found in this film. George Bailey is all of us, and his story is a reminder that we're all important and, no matter how tough it gets, we need to keep going. One of my favorite movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Hard To Imagine A Time Without This Movie,"One of the hallmarks of a truly classic film is its ability to make the viewer contemplate the genre's existence before the experience. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a case study in this, as perhaps no movie in the history of cinema has concocted a better mixture of acting, emotion, seasonal--holiday--relevance, and a story that will reach into the very depths of your soul.For a basic plot summary, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" tells the story of George Bailey (James Stewart), a simple man from a simple town--Bedford Falls--who desperately wants to escape his father's ""Building & Loan"" business and travel the world. Every time he is about to take that ""next step"", however, George (through both external and internal devices) remains in Bedford Falls managing the family business. Along the way, he marries childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed), morally clashes with iron-clad town business baron Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), and eventually ends up building a life in the very place he once so desperately wanted to escape from. On Christmas Eve, however, George is dealt a horrific blow and is on the verge of ending his own life until he discovers he has a guardian angel named Clarence (Henry Travers) looking out for him and showing him what a sad place a George Bailey-less world would be.The main reason this movie works so well is because we all have a little bit of George Bailey in us. That is why the poignant moments of this film capture our deepest emotions and promote serious life-reflection during the holiday season. Because we know how easily each one of us could be (or even are) living out the actions of Mr. Bailey on a daily basis. In this way, one could view the film as a character drama through and through.Yet, at the same time, there is more than a touch of fantasy here. The opening scenes feature angels conversing with each other, while the ending is an alt-universe trip that provides much of the emotional punch. Very much Twilight Zone-esque (and even 10+ years before that series). Far enough ahead of its time that the film was a middling success--if even that--at the box office in 1946. It truly took decades for the plot and themes to be re-examined through a more modern lens, if you will.That incredible plot is then bolstered by the perfect casting choice of ""everyman"" Jimmy Stewart to play the lead. Truly one of the greatest acting performances ever put to film both in scenes of jubilation or intense despair. The other cast members (especially Barrymore as the nefarious Potter) are brilliant as well, with each knowing just how to coax the right amount of emotion out of his/her role.In short, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is easily one of the greatest motion pictures ever constructed. I can--and do--watch it every holiday season without fail, and each viewing I pick up something I hadn't seen or considered (i.e. the sign of an extraordinary screenplay). It is completely genre-diverse, can be enjoyed by the entire family, and will thoroughly entertain you while also prompting some deep introspection. If it isn't my favorite single movie--and it might be--at the very least I can't imagine a world in which it doesn't exist (much like George Bailey himself).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic bit of American propaganda that never fails to warm the heart,"`George Bailey is a pillar of his community whose life has been selflessly dedicated to the welfare of others.  Through the evil machinations of the town's business mogul, George is driven to the point of suicide.  In answer to the prayers of the townsfolk, a missing angel comes to the rescue.  He shows George what a sad and sorry place the town would have been without him.  Can this life George out of his despair?'Who hasn't seen this film?  Anyone?  It is an unashamed tribute to homely values and is hugely warming.  The story itself is not exactly rocket science, but it is does contain plenty of nice touches as we follow George through his life of missed opportunities and sacrifice through to his marriage and eventual down fall.  The world that this happens seems so distant nowadays, with our friendless society - so few people do anything for their fellow man in big cities etc.  So this is very touching to see a man who serves others in such a major way.  It is a story of how every little helps and how you cannot overdo friendly gestures.Stewart is excellent with his partner Capra.  Barrymore is also excellent in a thankless role - he represents all that is wrong in society and of course he rises to a powerful position.  Henry Travers is good as Clarence, the wingless angel and of course who can forget the excellent Donna Reed as Mary.It's pure hokum of course, the regular Christmas movie that lifts everyone's spirits.  But isn't this what we all wish the world was like really?  Why can't it be - if only for two hours.  This is what Stewart and Capra do best - enjoy and forget the real world.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A timeless Christmas movie,"A timeless story, one of the must-see classics of the old cinema. ""It's a wonderful life"" is crafted in a beautiful way, and it's the absolute Christmas movie. It is a Christmas movie indeed because at its core lies a beautiful message that celebrates the holiday spirit, but the truth is that the movie's message is one to be celebrated at all times. Even in the darkest of times, life must be celebrated,and together with others we must always hope for tomorrow. The ending is really beautiful and touching and is actually what has turned this movie into an instant classic. My only issue with the movie is that although I understand what it stands for,and love it, I don't like the way it treats its protagonist. George Bailey is an ambitious man, a free spirit and his life has trapped him in a place where I feel he's not happy enough. And the movie ends,and sure he learns his lesson,and although he is celebrating the life he's got, he has lost all ambition and his fire.

It's a wonderful reason to jump off a bridge,"Of all the male stars of Hollywood's studio-dominated 'classic' era, James Stewart was the hammiest. He almost always shouts when a whisper would do; instead of striking an impressive pose, he's always squirming about, arms flailing. He's the melodramatic version of Jerry Lewis.His way-over-the-top performance in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" lingers like the taste of lettuce fried in lard atop a peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwich on a moldy McDonalds burger roll.But then there's the story itself. It's notable that Capra waited until the Depression was largely over before putting together this dreadful lie about it (which is what this film is really about). Apparently the banks didn't spend years foreclosing homes and farms? No one was displaced, we all held together in the small towns we grew up in? Family's weren't shattered and careers not ruined? It's wonderful baloney to serve with peanut-butter and fried lettuce.It's deplorable that American's think of this as a ""Christmas classic."" Christmas should be about joy, not self-centered delusion. The truth is, the world would have been the stronger is Stewart's character had never been born. The people in it need to find real reasons for living, not Capra's pandering.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What if...?,"I wanted to see 'It's a wonderful life' because it is sitting comfortably at the 20th spot of highest rated films on IMDB. Interestingly, on doing research on the film, I found the film received mixed reviews at the time of its release, and was a box office flop. In time, it became the highly rated movie it is today.So what did I think of the film? Well, let's just say I can easily understand why the film was not a box office success back in 1946. Due to its subject matter, many viewers might have found the film to be blasphemous. What, with an angel being sent down to Earth to help a man on the brink of committing suicide. The angel being sent down, is Clarence - an angel who hasn't got his wings yet, and is hoping to get his wings when he succeeds in saving the suicidal George Bailey.But what lead to family man George's suicidal inclinations? Before Clarence is sent to Earth, angel Joseph tells George's story so Clarence can familiarize himself with the man he is to save. The story starts with a 12-year old George saving his younger brother Harry's life. Years later George is a fast-talking, high-spirited, adventurous young man. He has dreams of traveling the world and doing amazing things. Off course romance soon finds him, he marries and has kids. And he is working at his Father-in-law's Building and Loan firm.The events leading to George becoming suicidal was actually quite boring, and I sat there wondering how this movie could be so high rated. And then the final 20 minutes changed everything, and the film really got to me. These final moments salvaged the film to such an extent that it gave me goosebumps, making me think about a lot of things I never thought about before. Talk about thought-provoking!! I guarantee the film's finale will make you ponder on your life, and you might even see the world in an entirely different manner.James Stewart was exceptional as George Bailey!Would I watch it again?

"It is not depressing at all, unlike what some reviewers claim","Saw this again last night. There are nearly 1,000 reviews of this on IMDB, so there's no need to fully go over the plot again here. My comments are directed at some of the other reviewers' comments, specifically the ones that seem to really, really miss the point of the film by totally misinterpreting what the film's message was.One reviewer from this year says it is ""possibly the most depressing movie ever made."" I dare say there are over 100,000,000 people who completely disagree with that notion.That review says that other people with serious financial problems will be troubled by the movie because they don't have a town full of people who will come to their rescue.He/she goes on to discuss the portrayal of the town if George had never been born, saying Capra considered bars and nightclubs to ""be the worst thing that could happen"" to a town, lamenting that in 2020 we'd ""all be lucky to have them going again NOW."" This person points out that ""we can't all have these incredible effects on others' lives like George did; so this makes the viewer...feel like HELL.""That reviewer finishes with the thought that the note Clarence wrote in the book he left with George, that ""No man is a failure who has friends"" is ""something to really kick you in the gut if you are down.""There were other reviews I read that made some of the same points, saying things about the film that simply are not accurate.On the finishing point, about nobody being a failure if they have friends. It is a mistake to assume this film is also saying the opposite is true-that anyone without friends is a failure. That sort of thinking would make one think that the man who wrote the book saying ""If you play golf, you are my friend"" is saying if you don't he doesn't want anything to do with you."" Not at all. The statement is simply saying that this alone makes you his friend, even if nothing else does. In our film, the point is that even if you feel you have failed to accomplish the goals you had (like George Bailey, who never got to build things or travel around the world), and even if you have fouled up things so that lots of people are mad at you (the school teacher's husband who punched him, and also George's wife), if you just have some (one) friends you are NOT a failure.I dare say this is a tremendously positive message (opposite of that reviewer's thoughts) that can inspire the people he's writing about, one having all sorts of troubles in the year of the China virus: Even if your personal world is full of money woes and family bickering, and you feel bothered that life hasn't turned out at all like you thought it would when you were a young adult with all sorts of plans and goals, if you have at least one friend, you haven't totally failed, you are a success in some manner.Some have actually criticized this film for its portrayal of the town had George never been born, saying what's wrong with nightclubs and saloons? Did they fail to observe that this town seemed to be loaded with nothing but such places? Do they not understand what characters said, about how without someone giving these people a loan so they could buy their own home, they'd be renting crummy houses and apartments from Potter, or people like him? You go to any town today that has neighborhoods with few businesses except bars and tell me if it's not obvious the neighborhoods around these areas are full of empty stores and abandoned homes and are definitely not areas where anyone wants to walk along the streets-day or night-because of a terribly high crime rate.Capra didn't suggest a saloon was a bad place-he had one-duhh!-featured in the good town, Bedford Falls, where tough guy Sheldon Leonard was a friendly bartender.The claim that the film is depressing because people know they have not had the tremendous influence on a whole town the way George did. He really did do important things for many, and others feel depressed because they haven't-that's what these critics are saying. I guess they think Capra cold have made an interesting movie if the best thing George ever did for someone was help them fix a flat tire or give them a dime when they couldn't quite pay for the groceries they wanted and he was right behind them in line.If anything, Capra was drawing his audience in to empathizing with George. George, like the typical viewer, felt like he hadn't done anything important in his life. He hadn't gotten to do the great things he dreamt of. He hadn't even become wealthy at all, earning barely $2000 a year in the mid-1940s. He was like these other people who feel they hadn't done much for others. He was shown how he had done far more for people than they realized, and the movie viewer may well think the same of him/her self after watching this film.That makes it the opposite of depressing, at least for most people. The idea is that all of us can be a good influence on others, even if not in such dramatic ways as literally saving lives. I think if you find this film's message depressing, you can easily find any film or TV show or novel to be depressing: ""I can't stand ""Seinfeld"" because those people find attractive new people to date almost every week and I haven't had a date with anyone in quite a few months,"" or ""I hate that King of Queens show because Doug seems to enjoy his boring package delivery job, while I absolutely hate the similar job I have!"" If you are not looking to be depressed by a movie, you will not feel that way watching Wonderful Life.A great part of what made this such a great film is the oft-criticized first half, where we saw all the events of significance in George's life. He led the other boys in saving his brother's life, then stopped the grieving druggist from accidentally killing a customer, then gave up his plans after his father died to save the family business, etc. It's not easy to portray someone as being a big influence when that someone has not risen to some manner of material success-e.g. a businessman who is fairly wealthy but gives lot of money to charity, or spends lots of time helping others in a charitable way. I thought the Building & Loan association was a great vehicle for this. Only a few employees, mostly family members, essentially portrayed as one where money comes in from customers and is used to help others get ahead. If Frank Capra had not taken the time he did to show us how much George had to keep changing his plans when tragedy struck or other things went awry, we wouldn't have had much reason to be concerned about his well being later on.Capra wanted everyone to feel as though their life had value, from whatever friends (including family) they had, and whatever other good deeds they accomplished in their lives. If you think some are depressed because they haven't saved lives or helped someone buy a home like George, then I guess those people would also be greatly saddened by the Miracle on 34th Street movie because they haven't had the good fortune to find someone to marry like Fred and Doris. Christmas Vacation would be a hugely disappointing movie to them because they don't have a joy of a big, loving family, or a job where a Christmas bonus brings enough money to put in a swimming pool and more. Heck, Home Alone could be an emotionally troubling movie for anyone who had a horrible vacation trip around Christmas, possibly made worse by discovering their homes had been ransacked while they were away.In other words, to people with serious depression, ANY movie can make them feel worse, either because their lives are not as good as the characters in a film, OR because seeing sad, unhappy people with serious problems reminds them of their own dismal lives. The criticism leveled at Wonderful Life could fit ANY movie, Christmas themed or not. If a film producer cannot make a movie about people who are troubled, or people who have good things happen, there isn't much left about which you can make a movie.I find this to be about the most uplifting movie of all time, one that points out many of the joys of life-intertwined with the saddest times of life, depicted realistically. George had a fabulous time with Mary at the high school graduation dance-and the pair were really enjoying their conversation on the walk home, when George was suddenly summoned with news about his father having a stroke. I know that almost any year of my life when I can think about something really good that happened, I can also remember something of significance not good happening too.If anyone reads my thoughts here, and reconsiders the movie and decides that it really is a good film after all...then I guess I have made a small, positive contribution today.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

No man is an island,"I'm quite surprised that it's taken me more than fifty turns around the Sun to see this accepted classic. Still I managed to catch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" in the cinema so I don't regret waiting.That said the film doesn't quite live up to the image suggested by the clips and excerpts that have become familiar over the years. The bulk of the movie is far darker than the end would suggest with Jimmy Stewart playing a man who's spent his life putting, well, his life on hold in the service of others. This doesn't make him very happy but it does support just about everyone else in town.Fortunately this self-sacrifice proves worth it when, eventually, everyone rallies around him just then he thinks that his life is over. This is the happy, sentimental message of the movie. Thankfully the witty script and solid acting overcome this sappiness.I don't think that this is the greatest movie ever, or even the greatest Christmas movie, but it is well made and a refreshing antidote to the usual festive fare.

"""To my big brother George, the richest man in town.""","This enduring, popular story tells of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), a dreamer from the small town of Bedford Falls who's itching to get *out* of town and accomplish big things. But, due to his kind and compassionate nature, he ends up sticking around for years, always attempting to *help* people. Then, at one point, all seems lost, and a deeply despondent George seriously contemplates suicide. An angel named Clarence (Henry Travers), who still yearns to earn his wings, intervenes and makes a difference by showing George what life in town would be like if he'd never been born.I can believe that movie lovers consider this one of the most inspiring films of all time. It shows us how that each of us *does* leave an impression during our time on Earth, and how much some of us really *do* make a difference in the lives of those close to us. As Clarence says at the end, ""No man is a failure who has friends"", and these are words to live by. George spent a lifetime earning his friendship with others, and provided a rock for townspeople in rebelling against tyrannical, pathologically greedy Scrooge-like cretin Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who aims to own the whole town - lock, stock, and barrel.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is full to the brim with acting talent, with familiar faces (Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Gloria Grahame, Frank Albertson, Samuel S. Hinds, etc.) in a great many roles. Barrymore is a completely effective villain, making you hate his character in record time. Donna Reed is absolutely enchanting as Mary, the love of Georges' life. And Jimmy himself is totally believable - a principled, amiable, dependable sort of average guy. I particularly enjoyed character actors Ward Bond as Bert the cop and Frank Faylen as Ernie the cab driver (as you may have guessed, this is where 'Sesame Street' got the idea for the names for two of their popular puppet characters).The film is fundamentally a solid story that's very well told by filmmaker Frank Capra, with moments both very funny and incredibly poignant. It's very well acted and expertly made, and would make for good viewing any time of the year, not just Christmas time.Nine out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Timeless Christmas Classic,"Very rarely can a film's message provoke an emotionless response in our contemporary, desensitized audiences who are, oftentimes, overly preoccupied by violence, visual appeal, or action sequences. It's a Wonderful Life not only appeals to one's Christmas spirits, but is able to exhibit deep rooted human conditions of failure, lack of faith, and discontentness, while proving the love we share with each other, as individuals, is the true gift of both Christmas and life.

Still Relevant Today,"This is one of the truly great films to have ever been released in the post war era. The themes of wondering how different the world might have been if you weren't born is still a recurring theme in many films as well as television series, but this one really does it with a even greater poignancy than most that try to imitate it. However, the film really gives a great message that no matter how unimportant you feel, your life, for better or worse, touches each person that that you come in contact with. James Stewart is perfectly cast as George really show's why he is the perfect everyman in this film. Also, Donna Reed is wonderful as Mary, the love of his life. The two of them really convey the love that George and Mary felt for one another what made the relationship between the two of them special. I also loved the fact that it pretty much pulled no punches when dealing with what probably was the touchy subject of suicide. This film is truly one of the all time greats.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

the movie told about an angel that helps a compassionate but despairingly frustrated businessman by showing what life would have been like if he never existed.,"I consider this movie as one of my inspirational movies. I think there are many lessons that we can take from the story. In life, sometimes we feel down, nobody cares with us, no choices in life, and many others desperate things. We might feel like why we should be born in this condition, or why is God gives this problem to us, or anything else. But, we should reconsider how wonderful life is.! From the movie we can learn that life is like a cobweb. We don't know that thing which happened to us, might be connected and give the influence to other's life. We don't know that the thing we do is might be a history. We don't know how is precious our life for others, for our family, our friends, and for people around us. We can think that the thing is disaster, but we never knew how great that thing and what is God's planned for us. From the movie we can see that George might feel very desperate and thought that better not to be born. But, God has his own plan! And no matter how hard the problem is, God can always helps his slaves. We should not be regretful to everything happened in our life. Even how hard our life is, we should consider that God is exist, and we have many friends that still willing to help us and give us their support.

One of the Greatest Films Ever Made,"The drama fantasy It's a Wonderful Life is directed by Frank Capra and stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, and Lionel Barrymore and it takes place in a modern day small town.The film starts off with angels talking about how a man, George Bailey (Stewart), needs help to make his life better. The angels decide to send a second class angel, Clarence, to go and help him. But before sending him they give him all the important details of his life. The first one that is shown was when George Bailey was a child and saved his brother's life and stopped the shopkeeper he worked for from selling poison tablets. Then it showed when George Bailey was older and how he dreamed of traveling the world but at any chance he got he had to do some sort of work for the loan shop he was in charge of. He fell in love with a young woman named Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) but struggled to gain her as his wife. This film is excellent and has a morale that everyone needs to hear, a timeless classic.Frank Capra directed this film brilliantly. It was truly sentimental and he made it so you could feel the emotions of George Bailey. There were quite a few classic moments that he created in this film such as when George asks Mary is she wants for him to lasso the moon for her. Capra truly created an excellent film.The writing of this film was pure bliss. There are not that many films out there that have a sense of purity such as this one and that is intended for all audiences. There were many ups and downs on this ride and it left you completely satisfied.The acting by the whole cast was remarkable. James Stewart gave a great performance as George Bailey never being able to get what he really wants and being extremely stressed by all the tasks that he has to do. Donna Reed was great as the love interest, providing much support for Stewart's character to grow off of. Lionel Barrymore was great as the big business man in town trying to buy up everything and keeping Bailey down. Excellent performances for an excellent film.Overall I give this film a strong 9/10, it is truly a timeless classic from the legendary Frank Capra. I recommend this to absolutely everyone young and old, it is a truly heartwarming story that has already gone down in film history.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Attaboy, Clarence!","One of the all-time Christmas classics, this excellent piece of work from Frank Capra focuses on George Bailey (James Stewart, in one of his career-best roles) who is stopped from jumping into the river in despair by a friendly angel called Clarence (Henry Travers). We then see in flashback what has brought George to the brink of suicide and key events from his life - saving his brother from drowning when the ice breaks; alerting his chemist boss to a fatal mix of drugs; courting and marrying his childhood sweetheart (the winsome Donna Reed); and dealing with the film's token bad guy, Mr Potter (brilliantly played by the crusty Lionel Barrymore). Clarence then shows George what the sleepy town of Bedford Falls would have been like without him and proves that you're never alone if you have friends around you and if you make a difference.Interestingly, two direct influences from this film were on the poetry e-zine 'Zuzu's Petals' (George Bailey's little daughter, who leaves some flower petals in his jacket); and, so it is said, on the children's TV programme, Sesame Street (Bert and Ernie, the mad puppets, who are the names of the cop and the taxi driver in this).And let us not forget, when you hear a bell ring, it means an angel has got its wings!",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

No other movie that I've ever watched was capable of that and that says something.Every once in a while every one of us was frustrated, angry, sad or sorry about this and that in our lives that we hadn't achieved, or hadn't done or hadn't gone out somewhere we wanted to. Every one of us had thought the same thought: are we worth the life we are living? Are we good enough? Would it matter if we were gone or hadn't been born at all? This movie is the answer to all of these questions. This movie is the medicine of all the inner illnesses and aches. It's a wonderful movie!People sometimes forget what a great gift life is. We shouldn't let it go to waste, live it in full, let all the joys and sorrows count, cherish every moment, every person who has come in and gone out of our lives - they're all gifts!

Wish I had a million dollars. Hot dawg!,"At the heart of this marvellous Capra film is a man, who from when we first see him in Gower's store, longs to see far off places. As we all know, he never does leave Bedford Falls and it is this sadness that is at the core of the film and the main character George Bailey, a man with unfulfilled dreams. It is also what makes this film stand the test of time. The characters are believable and compared to current Hollywood heroes win hands down. They are all so well defined and fleshed out as in a Dickens novel that one enjoys spending time with them. So much has been borrowed from this film and so much written about it. Essentially it is James Stewart's central performance that is outstanding and to watch his realistic gradual breakdown is very distressing. I always find it difficult watching the scene when he goes home after realising he cannot find the money and Mary(his wife) turns to see him clutching his daughter with such a desperate look on his face. Her reaction to him is extremely moving. A man driven to the brink worth more alive than dead, this is a much darker film than people often expect. But he does get a second chance and maybe this is why we like it so much, because in real life this is rarely possible. George Bailey played by James Stewart is someone who has a great face.

A 2019 Review I Hope You'll Read,"Why would I even think about adding another review to one of the most reviewed movies on IMDB. In a word, emotions. Few films I've ever seen evoke the inner feeling I experience when I watch It's A Wonderful Life. In fact I can't think of any even close.Capra's film is a masterpiece of humanity and spirituality. And it's light as a feather never preachy or heavy-handed. If a person seeing this can't get in touch with some deep inner joy of love and life it's probably a sign of some psychopathic character flaw. This movie celebrates the power within to overcome even when we all have flaws and weaknesses which if we allow do much the opposite. It's a fantastic journey of a life with roads not taken in while keeping an eye on what unites us all.Jimmy Stewart will forever have my awe and appreciation for his portrayal of George Bailey. George is waging war with a powerful foe. He's doing it for the right reasons and Stewart always allows the frail human side to walk hand in hand with the focused true believer. It's a powerful juxtaposition that mimics the eternal struggle of good and evil. It has never been presented in celluloid more masterfully and in such a way as to shoot straight to the heart. The entire cast is uniformly excellent in creating a microcosm of so many elements of mankind's struggle. It is not simply a journey of light either as there are many dark turns. In the end though it affirms a belief in man as a spiritual creation that can, with faith, rise and conquer darkness. I love this movie. It's a Christmas Classic that is an all-time great. So great it's my single favorite movie and I suspect it is others too and will continue to be this kind of film to even unborn generations. Yes, it is that WONDERFUL!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a wonderful movie!,"This is indeed a wonderful Christmas movie, where James Stewart plays George Bailey, who has dreams of moving out of his town (Bedford Walls) going to college, having an established career and seeing the world. However, after his father's demise, he reluctantly takes on the family business (a loan company), indefinitely putting his dreams on hold.This is a classic story that definitely reminds you of the more innocent times in America and reminds you things will always turn out all right at the end if you have enough hope and faith. The plot keeps you engaged from start to finish as you follow George Bailey's life, from his times as a preteen to him taking on the family business, and finally to him getting married and raising a family of his own - all the while seeing his dreams fade away. However, when things get too down in the dumps for him, an angel tries to help him out of despair and lets him see what would life be like in George's town without him being born. This reminds you to never take anything for granted and to always appreciate what you have.It's a great movie with heartwarming moments and great acting. James Stewart and leading lady Donna Reed had great chemistry together. And, the rest of the cast, from Lionel Barrymore as the villainous Mr. Potter to Henry Travers as the angel Clarence, all did a wonderful job.Even as a movie made in the 1940s, it holds up very well through the test of time and is surely one of the greatest to watch during Christmas time.

"""Sentimental Hogwash!""","George Bailey is a thoroughly nice guy, the backbone of the small American community into which he was born.  George's story is that of America in the first half of the twentieth century - a happy childhood before the First World War, ambition growing with maturity, then trouble for the family in the wake of the 1929 crash.  George and his family make it through the Depression, and are blessed with success as George's dearly-loved brother Harry wins the Congressional Medal of Honour in World War Two.  From this high point, George's fortunes take a steep nosedive, and the defining crisis of his life is suddenly upon him ...George's twin ambitions since early childhood have been to explore the world (travel has always fired his imagination) and to ""build things"". Events are constantly cheating him out of his travel plans, and sheer selflessness prevents him from getting an education, his passport out of Bedford Falls and into a career as an architect.  Like his father before him, George is too kindly ever to advance his own personal aims.His adversary and nemesis is Old Man Potter, ""the richest and the meanest man in the county"".  He is as unlike George as a man can be. Immobile and with no curiosity about the world, Potter dominates the small town, and is universally feared and despised.  Without family or home life, Potter has only his money, which he ruthlessly ensures will increase and multiply.  George believes in the community (""we've got to have faith in each other""), whereas Henry F. Potter regards the people as exploitable ""rabble"".  On George's study wall hangs a portrait of Abraham Lincoln. Potter has a bust of Napoleon.This famous Capra tear-jerker is a masterpiece of emotional manipulation, and incidentally a tremendous piece of cinematic craftsmanship.  The film has two premises, firstly that the fabric of the nation is sound so long as Americans stick to the early settlers' values of communal mutual assistance, and secondly, an enlightened liberal doctrine of the perfectability of mankind.  If ordinary folks are offered chances for betterment, by means of building improved housing and encouraging financial thrift, they will prove themselves to be sober, hardworking citizens, keen to advance the prosperity of their progeny.  George is the liberal hero who embodies these beliefs.  His dream is to raise ""dozens of the prettiest little homes you ever saw"", and when the Martini family takes possession of its property, George is on hand to see Giuseppe realise the American Dream - ""I own my own house!""The young George knows that he doesn't want to squander his life ""cooped up ... in a shabby little office"".  However, George is the responsible type, and to protect the working people from Potter, and put Harry through college, he assumes the burden of running the family's Building and Loans business.  He grows to realise that his father's legacy is a noble one, the foundation of America's future.George continues to dream of ""anchor chains, plane motors and train whistles"", but the thoughtlessness of others keeps him trapped in Bedford Falls.  Alone outside a house party, he reacts wistfully to the wail of a distant train.  His crisis of conscience when Harry announces the marriage and the new job is a tremendous piece of cinema.  Kind, decent George goes through silent turmoil as it sinks in that his hopes have been dashed again.If the propositions on which the story rests are simple folksy ones, the story itself is a strong one, told with great zest.  Pacy effervescence keeps the action moving snappily along.  Mary loves George from childhood, as we see in the drugstore sequence.  The prepubescent George shows the traits we come to love in him - industriousness, reliability and social conscience - and he saves Gower the druggist from committing an appalling act of negligence, at great cost to himself.  The tight narrative sweeps us from the kiss to the wedding, and from the honeymoon taxi to the run on the bank.  World war Two, during which ""George fought the battle of Bedford Falls"", is an object lesson in concise story-telling.One of Capra's narrative techniques is to exploit clashes of opposites. We plunge from elation to despair as Harry's triumph gives way to the financial disaster.  Christmas bonhomie is tainted by the chilling presence of the bank examiner.  George's desperate prayer in Martini's bar is accompanied by a jolly Italian ditty.  The 'drowning' drama is followed swiftly by a gentle comedy scene.The heart of the film is the relationship between George and Mary.  A silent look passes between them at the high school dance, and we know that they have fallen in love.  Their charleston dance (a superbly-choreographed sequence) cements the incipient romance and is followed by a great two-handed scene in which the lovers throw stones at 320 Sycamore, the house which will one day be theirs.  George's later visit to Mary's house once more blends romance and comedy with splendid success.  It is a joy to watch the aching desire of each for the other as they listen to Sam's phone call.Clarence the wingless angel offers George ""a chance to see what the world would be like without you"".  The nightmare sequence shows Bedford Falls (now known as Pottersville) to be a seedy Gomorrah of jazz bars and strip joints, peopled by a surly, unhappy populace.  George's creed is borne out - ""each man's life touches every other man's life"", and he sees that his patient, benign influence has worked its magic.  Bedford Falls is a better place for having known George Bailey.Watch out for a young Gloria Grahame as Violet, launching a career of playing bad girls.  And is that Donna Reed in Martini's, posing as the bar girl in the peroxide wig?",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Puerile nonsense,"Stewart plays the saintly George Bailey who, on the brink of committing suicide, gets sent an angel to sort things out in order for the angel to earn his wings. Hilariously parodied by more contemporary films and series, not excluding Married With Children, the idea and execution, let's be honest here, is trite and cloying. Stagy performances and a dragging screenplay is really all that there is for the viewer to mercilessly swallow while the lengthy running time of the film brutally tests one's patience. Had the director shaved off 30 minutes or so from the excruciatingly melodramatic and repetitive second act, the movie would have been far less exhausting, though the silly what-ifs the story puts forth wouldn't have been any less clunky and witless.Despite the technical achievement, which is impressive for its day and age, this is one of those classics the popularity of which simply lacks credibility. Perhaps Grandma and Gramps are still able to look kindly on this overblown, saccharine monstrosity, but anyone under 60 shouldn't be subjected to it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
it's a good movie,"I just saw IAWL for the first time last night. While it's not the best movie I have ever seen, it is very good and worth watching at least once. It is allegorical and thus shouldn't be held to exacting standards, as some reviews have done, in my opinion. The movie gets you to think about how your life impacts others and how we should treat one another better. For that I think it succeeds quite nicely. I think Jimmy Stewart did an excellent job of portraying George Bailey. He is fundamentally a good person, but like all of us, is given to bouts of anger and emotion, and lashes out against the people he loves. He quickly realizes his errors and apologizes for them. He is frustrated by his responsibilities and obligations intruding on his dreams, but he does the right thing in the end. We can all related to this and learn a few things by his example.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Warm, heart-wrenching and reaffirms our faith in ourselves !!!","I was very much aware of this film consistently being listed as one of the best movies EVER made. James Stewart has been one of my favorites for a longtime. This DVD had been lying with me for quite some time so I decided to give it a try. By God, I was stupefied, I did not write a review immediately just to see if this was not a flash in the pan, just an overdone, emotional blackmailer of a movie but this movie is simply brilliant. As an after thought maybe, its so hard to describe what one feels after watching this gem, this masterpiece. I am told it was a resounding flop when it was released, aah thats so unfortunate.Everyone goes through the vicissitudes of life, and many a times it is so tempting to end it all, to blame each and everyone around for one's misery that we miss out on the differences one's life makes to others.

One of the greatest movies ever made,My mom used to make me watch this with her as a kid and I didn't like it. But mostly because I didn't get it but as I got older and became wiser I really fell in love with it and the beauty of its message and characters. Truly a great inspirational film. I think Hollywood is starting to lose its way with the social justice propaganda they keep throwing out. This movie didn't need fancy special effects or an ulterior motive.

A nice family film. I understand why it is a classic.,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFEAnother classic film I dad never seen before. I liked it.The most I had seen of this movie before was in Gremlins, when Billy's mother was watching it in the kitchen.The movie is about a man who is completely selfless. He thinks about everyone else and other thing before himself... he gives up so much for other people. But when things start to go wrong for him, he feels desperate and tries to kill himself... until he is saved by an angel. The angel then teaches him what things would have been like if he had never been born.It is a lovely film. It has romance, comedy and drama in it. It really is a nice film to watch at Christmas time.The movie stars James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore & Thomas Mitchell. The acting was over the top a little bit, but back in the day when this was made, all acting was over the top in one way or another.I will give this film 7 out of 10.It is a nice family film that will have all the old women crying.For more of my reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Review (pan!) Pls publish this, for an alternate ""take"".","I've been collecting (& watching) old films for over 20 years, and have over 700 in my collection.  Call me ""Ebeneezer Scrooge"", but I think that ""Wonderful Life"" is one of THE WORST films I've ever seen!!!! (I'm not kidding).People today are amazed that it got such lousy reviews when it premiered; I feel that audiences THEN could see what a bad film it is!What's wrong with it?  First, the pacing.  The first half of the film (where all the ""bad stuff"" happens) is MUCH too long; it goes on FOREVER.  The part after his suicide attempt is much too short, and doesn't dispel the ""depressing-ness"" of the beginning.  Plus, the scene where the clerk hits young Stewart on the ear is an extremely brutal (& violent) scene for that era; it STILL bothers me!If you want to see GOOD Capra, check out ""Arsenic & Old Lace"", ""Lost Horizon"", ""Lady For a Day"", ""You can't take it with you"".....in fact, any film BUT this one!It may be a ""Wonderful Life"".....but, it's a lousy movie!",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Was an upbeat post-WW2 movie, now a classic.","My wife and I chose this for our Christmas night viewing even though we have seen it before. It is currently available on Amazon streaming movies.WW2 ended in 1945 and this movie was made in 1946. The premise is straightforward, George Bailey ( James Stewart, 38 at the time) had been a fine boy growing up and now as an adult often gave up his own goals for the benefit of others, like his younger brother. Perhaps too generous, when his Building and Loan business was in trouble he was contemplating suicide as a way out, thinking the world would be better off if George Bailey had never existed.An angel is sent down to intervene, in the last third of the movie George gets to see exactly how his town would have been and in the process gets his head straight.Donna Reed (23 at the time) played his wife Mary who would have been the stereotypical ""old maid librarian"" if George had never existed.Filmed in glorious B&W, the film holds up very well all these years later when one pits it against other very old movies.DEC 2022 update: I am now watching the colorized version on Amazon, it is well done and adds a bit.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It really is a wonderful life,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is an enduring classic that tells the story of George Bailey, a man who discovers the true impact of his life on his community. Directed by Frank Capra and starring James Stewart, the film is a heartwarming tale about hope, self-worth, and the value of human connections.While its central message and timeless themes are undoubtedly compelling, the film's pacing can feel sluggish, especially to modern audiences accustomed to faster storytelling. At times, the plot seems overly sentimental, which might not appeal to viewers who prefer more subtle emotional arcs.James Stewart delivers a memorable performance, bringing depth and sincerity to George Bailey. However, some of the supporting characters lack the same level of development, making certain interactions feel one-dimensional. The black-and-white cinematography, though charming, may also detract from the viewing experience for those who favor contemporary visuals.In summary, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a film with a powerful message and a heartfelt performance from James Stewart. Despite its slower pace and occasional sentimentality, it remains a beloved holiday tradition for many, deserving of its place in cinematic history. However, for those seeking a more dynamic and less saccharine narrative, it might fall short of expectations.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

A brilliantly made film about a truly disgusting character,"The James Stewart character is self-centred, obsessed with money, rude, short tempered, and regretfully drawn into his father's business, a housing and loan company favouring working class people by giving them mortgages they can manage, only because he feels obliged to do what his dead father wanted him to do (instead of racing off to Europe to play the university game). He does not manage things well, and is financially wounded (accidentally) by the villain (played by Lionel Barrymore: the dynamics are a lot like You Can't Take it With You, in that sense.)Failing at everything, he goes to jump off a bridge, is saved from suicide by an angel (not at all clear why heaven wd want to save this dreadful person), continues insanely, declares he wishes he'd never been born, is then thrust into a sort of non-identity existence by the angelic intervenor, finally does his one good deed and is returned to humanity (gratefully, God knows why).

My Favorite Movie,"It's Christmas Eve in the town of Bedford Falls and George Bailey, a man who has spent his entire life sacrificing for others, is thinking of taking his life. Knowing George is in trouble, though perhaps not the extent, his family and friends pray that God help him. And that's exactly what He does -- in the form of an angel named Clarence. Throughout the bulk of the film, Clarence is brought up to date on George's life (as are the viewers). From childhood to adulthood, he sees that George has been a heroic noble soul, giving until it hurts and then giving some more. In order to save George, Clarence must show him what an impact he has had on the world and those he loves.James Stewart's performance is flawless. One of the core strengths of the film is how it covers so much emotional ground. From happy to sad to angry to loving, Stewart masters it all. He's an actor who appeared in virtually every kind of film and that helps here as he has to handle drama, romance, comedy, fantasy...even a little action thrown in for good measure. His performance in this film is my earliest recollection as a child of being in awe of an actor.Lionel Barrymore gives a career-defining performance here. For generations to come, he would be remembered as the villainous Mr. Potter. He had a storied career, full of so many different parts and very few of them were bad guys. One of his best roles was the gruff but lovable and wise Dr. Gillespie in the Dr. Kildare series for MGM. So it's kind of ironic that Barrymore is best known for portraying a thoroughly rotten man. But that's the talent of the man. He breathed life into Potter and made him so hissable.Such a great cast. The wonderful Henry Travers has his career-defining role, as well. Who doesn't love Clarence Odbody, AS2 (Angel Second Class)? The heavenly Donna Reed. She positively glows in this film. As a kid watching I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. I think it again every time I watch this movie. Ward Bond and Frank Faylen as the ORIGINAL Bert & Ernie. Gloria Graham as the sultry Violet Bick. Samuel S. HInds and Beulah Bondi as the Bailey parents. The amazing Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy. Who can forget H.B. Warner's moving performance as Mr. Gower? William Edmunds as Martini and Sheldon Leonard as Nick the bartender. Todd Karns as Harry Bailey. And all those wonderful child actors playing the Bailey kids as well as those in the flashbacks. Just a perfect cast.Frank Capra, one of my absolute favorite filmmakers, does such a brilliant job at directing here. Amazing pace. The film never slows down but never feels rushed. He worked from a script that had many authors. Normally, this would be a terrible sign for a film and would almost certainly mean it was a disjointed mess. But that couldn't be further from the truth in this case. The script is tight, flawless even. Wonderful lines, memorable scenes. So many memorable scenes. It's hard to even pinpoint which to talk about because the entire movie is one classic scene after another. But I'll try. There are brilliant scenes like ""George Lassos the Moon,"" the bank run, the childhood confrontation with a grieving Mr. Gower, or the wonderful ending. But here are two of my favorites. The phone call scene where George and Mary share a phone. Such a sensual, romantic scene as they give into their feelings. The prayer in the bar is such a moving scene. Stewart's performance is so powerful here it's criminal he didn't win an Oscar for this role. So many more unforgettable scenes I could mention.I think of it as the greatest film ever made. I know there are some who will knock that. I realize there are all kinds of technical and cultural reasons that this film or that is the greatest. Citizen Kane, for example. While I love Kane or the Godfather films or countless other contenders, most of them are purely dramatic works that don't have for me what this film has: compelling rewatchability. It's my favorite film. It's as simple as that. I have seen it countless times. It's a beautiful story with Dickensian touches. A charming, funny, dramatic, sentimental, romantic, uplifting movie that makes me happy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This film is number eleven on AFI's list of best films of the century. I,"I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small- town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen-- before or since--more natural-looking on screen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not. Its message--that each one of us is important and has *something* to contribute to the greater good--is one about which the world could use some reminding from time to time.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I've always hated it, and I always will.","I realize that there is approximately four other people on the planet who think like I do and can agree that this film is terrible.  Everybody loves it for some reason, but I have absolutely hated it ever since I watched it for the first time.'It's a Wonderful Life' is so boring.  Now I've sat through some pretty dull films before, but this is unheard of.  The thing is, I can usually get into the older movies.  I just can't get into this one.  I first saw this film a couple of years ago in school, and have unfortunately, been forced to watch it a few more times just because everybody in the entire world thinks that it is wonderful.  I wouldn't normally comment on a film that is so bad, but being that it IS bad and entirely overrated, I am forced to voice my opinion.The cast is terrible.  I've never seen James Stewart in anything else and I don't plan to.  He starts off good, everything's fine, but as time progresses, he becomes so annoying that I want to jump up and turn the TV off.  What can I say about Donna Reed except that she is a horrible actress who manages to contribute very little to this horrible picture.  Well, that's about it for the cast, I suppose.  Minor role players such as Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, and Henry Travers are equally unimpressive.The writing and the script itself are mind-numbingly stupid.  'It's a Wonderful Life' is supposedly the tale of a depressed man who gets the chance to see what life would have been like if he had never been born. Okay, so how long exactly is it supposed to take to get to the damn point? The movie drags on and on and finally after about four hours (it seemed like that long to me), George Bailey meets Clarence, his angel, and is whisked away to the life where he doesn't exist.  So, basically the film tries to make a point and, I guess, finally does.There's a couple of people out there who think that 'It's a Wonderful Life' is NOT a Christmas movie.  Well, they're right.  Why is everyone under the impression that this movie is a Christmas movie?  It's clearly not.'It's a Wonderful Life', a terrible movie if there ever was one, currently appears on the Top 250 list.  It's also managed to jump onto just about everyone else's favorites list, but I don't know how.  Its nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, and Best Director, among others, is unbelievable and ridiculous.  The film is boring, slow-paced, and has no point to it for about the whole 130 minutes.  Frank Capra and this movie are overrated and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

Welcome to Pottersville,"The title is ironic since 'It's a Wonderful Life' - along with his earlier 'Meet John Doe' - is probably Capra's bleakest film and like 'The Wizard of Oz' has only become a timeless, much-loved classic due to repeated subsequent Christmas screenings on TV.Capra had become so unhappy with postwar America he had to resort to fantasy, and the graphic depiction of H. B. Warner as a broken-down alcoholic and Henry Travers' line ""those men all died"" reveal the pain behind the upbeat title.While as in 'The Last Laugh' (SPOILER COMING:) the 'happy' ending is in fact tragic rather than happy since in reality it's definitely NOT how the story would have really turned out.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An all time masterpiece!,"I have watched the movie twice. The first time i was not prepared for anything. I realized that it was not just a Christmas movie, but also a study on human relationships. It describes how the choices we make in life have an impact to ourselves and to other people, regardless if the choice is what we really want. The true value in life is having people that you love. All the other things, simply do not count, and that's why the choices we make in life, forced or not, false or not, are not so important, given that they do not concern the people we love. Only the choices regarding the people we love must be right and not forced. The second time i watched the movie i cried not only because of it's quality, but also because i had forgotten the above message, and the movie reminded it to me for second time.

When the bells ring you'll feel like maybe there is something beyond what we know on this planet - something beyond the kind of meaning we attach to things that might be about making money or getting rich. It's about human connection, compassion, and the best of people. And. Jimmy!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Artful and Chance-Taking Film; Powerful and Well-Acted; Capra's Best,"""It's a Wonderful Life""'s storyline stamps it a socialist-Catholic European confrontation between the despised peasant class and their feudal overlords. The additional character to this class warfare, the first of a huge series of downtrodden against the uncaring films, is George Bailey. What stamps him as a democrat are two things--he does not define anything; and he wants to help those ""in need""--even though what he actually does as director of a savings and loan is to invest in people he believes in--not for huge financial gain but to affect people's lives positively in the belief that a strong Bedford Falls citizenry living decently will enrich his life in the town and those of all his fellow citizens. His rival in the film, old man Potter, despises the poor and middle class and wants to keep them downtrodden and coming to him as infallible leader, to beg. The other amazing feature of the film is its flashback nature--2/3 of the film dramatizes Bailey's history; only in the last third do we see--through the bumbling agency of Clarence, George's guardian angel sent to help him on Earth--how important George's life had been to those touched by it. This was due to his work as much as to his nature; but I fnd this a difficult, jarring and very effective use of fantasy, especially in such an early film. How George got into trouble is a plot detail; he needs money, and despairs of finding it--leading to the sending of Clarence by the angel's bosses upstairs, whose voices are supplied by Moroni Olsen and Joseph Kearns. The film seems artistic to me from start to finish; its USerized and chance-taking script is also focused, purposeful and frequently very moving. Music by Dimitri Tiomkin and cinematography by Joseph Biroc and Joseph Walker complement Frank Capra's very sure direction, in my opinion. The story, adapted from Philip Van Doren Stern's ""The Greatest Gift' was written for the screen by Frances Hackett and Albert Goodrich, with additions by director Capra, dialogue by Jo Swerling and Michael Wilson. Art Direction was by Jack Okey, with set decorations by Emile Kuri, costumes by Edward Stevenson. Familiar faces in the minor parts include Marian Carr, Ellen Corby, Almira Sessions, Stanley Andrews, Charles Lane, Sarah Edwards, William Edmunds, Argentina Brunetti, Sheldon Leonard, Mary Treen and Beulah Bondi and Samuel S. Hinds as George's parents. Other showing well include Lionel Barrymore as Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, H.B. Warner, Ward Bond, Frank Faylen, Donna Reed, Henry Travers as Clarence and Lillian Randolph as the family's black maid. The film belongs to Jimmy Stewart, however; he is always interesting in the film and is given a wide variety of moods and challenges in the piece, from rage to surprise, to persuasion to sympathy to bitter complaint. Apart from the gaps in logic noted, the film has been given a powerful plot line, good acting and a contexted set of scenes that are frequently honest and always well-considered, in my view. Not to be missed nor overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wonder wonder wonder life!!!,"For my first time seeing this film, I think it was a nice two hours of my life. Personally I wouldn't have watched such an old film but I'm glad I had the opportunity to watch. I think the mora; of the story was very well needed for holidays because people fall on hard times due to the holiday stress. I really enjoyed this take on the value of family and community and how one person's life can affect the outcome of others. I think the only problem I have with the movie is the part when the angel makes the idea ""George Bailey"" nonexistent. I didn't like how quickly it was resolved. It was like George didn't see how his life changed his town and it was more like he wanted it to go back to normal because people didn't know him anymore. I think it would have been more impactful if there was a scene here he put the pieces together of how impactful his life is. Other than that this was a decent Christmas movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
slush,"I like a lot of director Capra's films - but not this one.This is among one of the most vile floods of slush ever to be photographed. The characters are simpering when they aren't whining. James Stewart give us the worst, most over-wrought performance of his career - high-school student do better. The camera work looks expensive - and dull. The editing is perfunctory. There's no effort to use film to tell the story.The story itself is a banal rip-off from ""The Christmas Carol"" - but the worst part of it is that Stewart's character spends his every moment visiting the 'alternate universe' (that would have happened had he never been born) trying to convince everyone that he really was born, and there is no 'alternate universe' - which makes no sense whatsoever, and completely blows any chance at insightful or revelatory alternate character development, and reduces his final submission to fate to a rather cheap, histrionic ""gee, I'm sorry; let's try it again, OK?""The raw cynicism that went into the making of this film - kept alive by generations of movie-reviewers as a kind of shared in-joke (""hey, let's face it, most Amereicans are just dumb"" - would be frightening if it hadn't sold so well - which is the really scaring thing about it.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the GREATEST movies of all time!,"This is definitely, without a doubt, one of the best movies ever made in film history!I watch this movie every year on the week after Thanksgiving, with my family. (It's been our little family 'tradition' if you will, for many years!)
Frankly, when I heard that this movie was actually considered a major flop when it came out back in those years, I was blown away. Those people had no hearts!😂

"George Bailey, I'll Love You Till the Day I Die","You want a shock? I think this is great film. I want to make some points clear. This is not a movie that I grew up with. It was by no means annual Christmas viewing like it is for so many families. The first time I saw this film it was summertime, and I was in college. So I can say this with absolutely no nostalgic bias...this is one of my favorite films of all time.Long before seeing the film, I had seen various cartoon spoofs of its famous premise. Its such a clever idea, I can see why it gets reused so often. I won't give it away, because that concept isn't actually used until pretty late in the film. Most of the film isn't focused on Christmas either. Most of the movie is focused on the life of George Bailey, played by James Stewart. Stewart does a terrific job; he is the perfect every man. Bailey is film's most likable protagonist, played by the world's most likable guy.Frank Capra's movie was not well-received upon its release. Yes, this film can be ""corny"". Critics in the 40's dubbed it ""Capra-Corn"". But because of how genuine the movie is, the corn always tastes good to me.I love how natural all the dialogue is. People will not hear each other, be interrupted, stutter, not finish sentences, the kinds of things that happen in real life but doesn't usually happen in movies. It helps Bedford Falls feel like a real place, with people you relate to and feel for.The movie gets better every time I watch it. When re-watching this movie, every emotional beat hits harder. The film begins with all these people praying for George Bailey, and gosh darn it, it gets me right in the feels.I know it may be corny to say it, but: ""It's a Wonderful Life"", it's a wonderful film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One Of The Best Movie Ever Made,"Absolutely, It's A Wonderful Life is in my top 5 movies of all time. Frank Capra also in my top 5 directors of all generation. Yet, James Stewart is one of my favorite actor. This was the best formation ever. Indisputably, Capra, without any serious contemplation, exalted as one of the most talented drama-director ever borne in this world. He was a master of film-maker. Any movies he touch, will always persist as classic for the next generation. It's A Wonderful Life, Casablanca, and Mr. Smith Goes To Washington was the prove. They were all masterpiece.The performance by two leads was Hollywood's's classic. Yet the plot was magnificent, i know this movie will be something since i watch the prologue (the bell ringing and narration). This plot style is one of the best, wide and depth but simple in complexity. Then it is bonded with strong drama-background. A man regret his life because of the problems within him. This film has very high moral impact to the audience. Maybe this is one of the most influential movie ever. This movie is about thanking your life to god.To be honest, this film was one of the most inspirational for me. This was one of movies that shaped my character. One of my good character and habits comes from this film. It shaped my moral. It taught me so many lessons in my life. How to struggle in the hard times, how to enjoy and share the happiness with others, how to become a good ones, how to diminish my bad feelings to others, and the most important thing is, how to always thanking my life, because without it, i wouldn't meet the person i truly love now, i don't know what is it to love and to be loved by someone you truly care, i wouldn't know of these feelings. Of course in our life, we will face the hard times sometimes, maybe for some people most of their live is hard times. But always remember, if you ever regret your life and choose not to live, you wouldn't feel the joy anymore. And don't forget, a small happiness can erase the whole pain you got before. Life is wonderfully beautiful.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a wonderful film,My favourite film of all time. George Bailey reminds you of what's important and what isn't. A film that still plays in cinemas 70 years later and which has been applauded at the end a number of times when I've watched it. We would all be happier if there were more George Baileys around and less Mr Potters; fewer Pottersville's and more Bedford Falls.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
An Excellent Film that Should be Enjoyed by All!,"It's obvious why when every time a ""Greatest Ever Movies"" type programme comes on, It's A Wonderful Life is always in the top 5. It's the perfect Christmas movie.

His guardian angel pays him a visit and shows him what life would have been like had he not existed. The build up to this event is a little long but that's what makes the film so successful and helps us to feel Stewart's pain.It's a heart-warming, feel good tale which should be enjoyed by generation after generation!Thanks for reading!",,Anonymous,Fantasy

See it for what it is,"It's a Wonderful Life is to cinema what The Fox and the Crow is to literature.Don't get me wrong: This is a gem of a film, definitely worth watching at least once, but it really is more of a parable or short story than anything else. Its biggest drawback (aside from its length, which could use a trimming of about 30 minutes) is its cheap sentiment, done in typical Capra style. Beyond that, though, is a very simple yet potent film that serves as a reminder that the stories that work on a simple, allegorical level are often the ones that work best. I believe that due to it being a Christmas movie, people are willing to overlook its multitude of flaws, from the hokey acting to the weak script. It's interesting to see the rather bluntly portrayed themes here still work well today, though thankfully with more subtlety and complexity, such as the childlike wonder in Amelie, alternate realities in everything from the Groundhog Day to the Matrix and of course the very obvious character arc no good story should be without (although Capra is hardly the inventor of this basic centuries-old device, as one reviewer stated).",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Good film (but no more),"I vaguely remember watching this once as a child but it left no lasting impression. Having just revisited it, I know the reason why. 'It's a Wonderful Life' is a good film that offers two hours of solid entertainment, but no more. It is well-acted, well-directed and has a nice Christmassy message that it drives home with absolute, unambiguous clarity. Does it deserve the hyperbole reflected in some of the reviews on this site? I don't think so. It is certainly NOT the greatest film ever made, and watching it is certainly no unrepeatable experience. Just look at the characters: They are static and (with the minor exception of Gloria Grahame as Violet) black and white: either entirely good (almost everyone) or entirely bad (Mr Potter). No one has nuances and no one changes. Parts of the film are kitschy, especially once the angel appears and shows George (James Stewart) how without him his small town has evolved into an early version of Hill Valley under the rule of Biff Tannen. And no matter how much I like James Stewart, he becomes slightly irritating when he is allowed to indulge in his mannerisms as unchecked as here. No wonder reviewers in 1946 were not enthusiastic. So why did the film become a Christmas classic in the US? According to what I read, that happened at least in part more or less by accident: Its copyright had expired and one channel took the chance to show it again and again. Still, for all that 'It's a Wonderful Life' must hit some kind of chord. Which chord is a mystery to me, but then I am not American. We have our own Christmas classics (for example 'Three Wishes for Cinderella', 1973), and I guess what we like about those would be just as mysterious to an American audience. In sum: 'It's a Wonderful Life' is nice enough but definitely overrated.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wasn't What I Expected,"I've only watched this revered classic film one time. It was okay but disappointing. I expected more after hearing of its great reputation. True, it was interesting but it had too many frustrating and annoying parts for my tastes. It was not the feel-good film I was expecting.I admit the ending was terrific and brings a tear to one's eye with an inspiring message but much of the film deals with tough breaks that ""George Bailey"" (Jimmy Stewart) had to face and also featured a very mean, despicable dishonest man in ""Mr. Potter"" (Lionel Barrymore). A lot of those scenes were not fun to watch; more frustrating than anything else. The movie has several scenes in which Bailey isn't the best person, either, but it could be argued that everyone has their moments, so why not him, too?Since this is so beloved a film, and such a Christmas favorite, I just expected more of a nice, lighthearted, good-natured story. Instead, I got a very dramatic movie with a number of unpleasant scenes.Interesting that this would be a Christmas favorite when Stewart's character admits he doesn't know if God answers prayer, or if He's even there. All of this coming from a guy who's attended church for years? Well, at least he found out, and it was a good message.The ""message"" was that everyone's life counts for something, that life is important and what you do with it especially important because it effects not just you but a number of other people many times in ways you could never imagine.To its credit, the story is an involving one. I will have check this out again and perhaps, with a different outlook going into it, will learn to like this film.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The actors show emotion well enough to make the viewers feel the same way. Throughout the movie you question why you would want to see such a story, however the end scene brings it all full circle. It's a great movie to watch during Christmas to give you that warm fuzzy feeling inside. This movie fortifies faith in human generosity and is the best feel good movie I have ever seen.

The story of how one often underestimates his/her own life especially under sickening burdens.The flow is quite a slow on the start, up to three-quarter parts of the movie. But it picks up at about the last half-hour and builds up a fast paced yet long and detailed finale.There are also things to compensate, regarding the age of the production, such as the color, the spoken accent which sounds quite stupid for the current times.

One year when watching this, my dad came into the room for the ending and with tears in his eyes turned to me and said ""they don't make films like that anymore"". He was right. Capra is a legend because of his ability to make a lovely film which paints the world as basically good with some rough patches to be overcome. James Stewart's skill is in making this world seem realistic instead of hokey, and convincing us to care about his character with it's good soul, kind manners and bad luck.For any person feeling glum, angry or disillusioned, this film is a direct injection of joy, love and triumph at a time when a lot of us need it most - it does not disappoint.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Good luck in not to cheer after watching this picture,"Greetings from Lithuania.""It's a Wonderful Life"" (1946) truly deserves all the praises and kudos it got true the decades. Seeing it first time this evening in 2015, all i can say that this is an amazing movie in every term. I won't going to into plot details as you all probably know it better than me. Try not to smile after this movie - it's impossible.This is a movie making at highest level. Acting is outstanding (it was made in 1946!), especially by a lead James Stewart - he glues the whole picture. Supporting cast is also great. Script is so simple yet so rich and combined with pitch perfect directing - near every scene (litteraly) in this movie clicks and it is just marvelous to watch this story unfolding. Before watching this movie i really didn't expect it to be THIS good, thought it could be a bit overrated, but boy was i wrong - this is a must see picture for every age, for every person.Overall, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has to be one of the finest pictures. At running time 2 h 10 min this movie never drags, and is superbly involving from start till the last frame. Every scene works here so well, because of great acting, superb direction, great script (simple, yet very involving). The ending is superbly inspiring. I do wonder however about age of some more old characters in this movie, as it seems like they never get old (and some of them should be at around 120 years old by the end of the movie), but it's not even a complain. Watch this movie if you haven't seen it yet - it is an amazing motion picture.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
an enduring classic that has only gotten better with age,"James Maitland Stewart was one of the most inspirational and admirable actors who ever lived. Although his range of talents allowed him to effectively play whatever kind of role he wanted, he is remembered most for the roles where he stole the audiences hearts. He was nominated several times for an Academy Award, but won it only once and at that time felt that his friend Henry Fonda deserved it more. In my opinion, James Stewart should have won the Oscar at the very least three times. He deserved the one who received for ""The Philadelphia Story"" (1940). And he should have won it for his performances in ""Vertigo"" (1958) and his most beloved classic, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" This improving-with-age classic is generally marketed as a Christmas classic, but that's very one-dimensional. Yes, the perfect season to view it is during the said holiday season, but it's about much more than that. It's about life itself and the ups and downs of life and no matter how heavy the latter may be at times, it's well, it's a wonderful life.In the film, James Stewart plays an ambitious young businessman who would rather do nothing but travel the world and build cities (perhaps a reference to Stewart's early ambitions to be an architect?) but his generous heart and the constant shortcomings of his friends continually puts him behind in his own life. When his troubles become so heavy and so depressing to the point where he ponders over suicide, he is visited by a strange man (Henry Travers) who turns out to be an angel wanting to show him how the world would have been if he'd never been born.I guarantee you that most if not all storytellers of the past sixty-some years wanting to generate a character that would win over the hearts of the audience have used this masterpiece for reference. Jimmy Stewart was just warming up at winning over your heart with another collaboration with Frank Capra, ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,"" here he just steals your sympathy with every scene he's in.As for Stewart's supporting cast, well, let's just say he had a great collaboration to work with. The enchanting actress Donna Reid is fantastic as his love interest, Lionel Barrymore is superb as the conniving greedy businessman Mr. Potter, the great Thomas Mitchell gives another fantastic performance as Stewart's bumbling uncle, Ward Bond is terrific in his supporting role as the kindly town sheriff, and of course, I cannot leave out Henry Travers who is absolutely lovable as the guardian angel who comes to teach Stewart about the gift of life.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of those rare films. Like ""Casablanca"", it does not wear down even as decades go by. It's only gotten better with age. James Stewart said it was his personal favorite out of all of the movies that he made in his illustrious career in Hollywood. Is it my favorite Jimmy Stewart movie? No. But I will tell you this. It is so sweet and moving and enchanting and wonderful that I held back a lot of what I wanted to say in this review because I don't want to give any more away than what is necessary. There's only a handful of movies that I will do that for. Because there is so much to be seen here and every minute is absorbing and beautiful.And one more thing. You know that feeling you get—that really, really good feeling in your soul—whenever you see a really, really good movie? If you want to revisit that sensation, see ""It's a Wonderful Life"" as soon as you can. And the beauty of it is, you don't even necessarily have to wait for the Christmas season to do that.Rating: 4/4",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Part of a staple Christmas Eve diet,"My family's annual viewing of 'It's a Wonderful Life,' on Christmas eve, has become as ritualistic as eating turkey on December 25. With the fresh smell of the tree in the corner of the room, a flickering candle on the fireplace and a mince pie soaked with brandy butter in my hand, relishing the spectacle of 'It's a Wonderful Life' is, despite the number of times I've now sat through it, something I look forward to and treasure each year. It is, quintessentially, a Christmas movie, and I'll never be able to bring myself to watching it in the middle of an August heatwave.I can't quite put my finger on what exactly makes this film so special. But surely the heart-warming plot, which proves to us that, us humans, we can always eventually triumph over despair, and the overall magical feel of the film, is a crucial element of Capra's masterpiece. It teaches us, as privileged westerners, many lessons about the true meaning of humanity and forces us, just as it does to George Bailey - played with relish and sincerity by James Stewart, capturing some of his finest moments - to appreciate, on reflection, just how lucky we actually are.There are countless of our favourite films that, through sheer force of habit, we find ourselves enjoying on a regular basis. But the very fact that, on the same day each year, I ensure that I savour 'It's A Wonderful Life,' proves that this film is really something quite remarkable with an ability to make its mark.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
A timeless enjoyable classic,I have only watched this film about 3 times but I like it for all sorts of reasons. It has an extremely powerful message and for me it is delivered in a subtle way by introducing it very early on in the film. Its almost as though its a very subtle product placement during one of the external scenes. All of the cast are perfectly suited and that is rare indeed. The film is a timeless enjoyable classic and it does not pull any punches when it could have. Due to the year it was made it could have been reduced to a slick waste of money but fortunately the professionals who were responsible for making this tale had the good sense to make it right and I suspect that the actors enjoyed the experience every bit as much as most of the people who have watched this film in the sixty odd years since it was made. At the time of writing this film is at number 30 of the IMDb top 250 and in my opinion it is there on merit. I would thoroughly recommend anybody watch this film but please pay attention and you will enjoy the experience that much more.,9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Bumbling Angel,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" tells the story of a down-on-his-luck family man who contemplates suicide. However, his guardian angel turns up at the last moment and tries to demonstrate how much worse the world would be if he no longer had a place in it.The director, Frank Capra, served in the US Army during World War II. Unfortunately, when he returned home, he got a shock. Even though Capra had won three Oscars before enlisting, Hollywood now regarded him a has-been. To be able to continue doing what he loved the most, Capra and his collegue William Wyler formed Liberty Films. They wanted full control over their future movie production.The company's first production was ""It's a Wonderful Life"". But the problems started immediately. The film takes place around Christmas, while principal shooting begun in the middle of summer. To simulate falling snow, tons of cornflakes were colored white. When the actors walked around in the ""snow drifts"", it crunched so loudly under their feet that it was impossible to hear the film's dialogue.Frank Capra began directing ""It's a Wonderful Life"" the same day his friend William Wyler started ""The Best Years of Our Lives."" But while Wyler's film was a huge success, Capra's movie failed even to cover its production costs. At this time, the Communist witch-hunt had begun in earnest, and the fact that the FBI called the film ""subversive Bolshevik propaganda"" didn't exactly help at the box office.At the age of 55, Frank Capra's effectively retired from Hollywood filmmaking. But then, in 1974, something remarkable happened. The copyright for ""It's a Wonderful Life"" lapsed, and the movie fell into public domain. That meant that it could be broadcast without licensing or royalty fees. And that, of course, turned the film into the Christmas classic that we all know and love today.",6.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Don't read reviews about this film. Just watch it.,"Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is simply a masterpiece. A perfect film.There's no need to take it apart scene by scene or examine its plot, its themes or do a character study of George Bailey. No need to attach more meaning than was intended, to imagine symbols where they don't exist, or to ignore the ones that do. No need at all. For if you are one of the many, the growing many who cannot watch this film without tasting tears, tears of joy, tears of sadness, then you know exactly what I am talking about - that further discussion would only serve to diminish the film's beauty.There are few films that are in this category, that hit notes as true as this. ""Casablanca"" is one, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is another, where everything comes together, where magic is not only seen in one scene, but in every scene, every line, every look and moment in the film. Pure magic. That's what this is, folks. Pure magic. It's the stuff dreams are made of.And the less talk about it the better. We talk too much nowadays, anyway.Just watch it and let it move you to joy, to tears, and tears of joy.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Greatest Film Ever Made,"So often the movies that claim the top spot on people's ""Best Movies"" lists are iconic films that are suitable to watch any time of year. ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Godfather"", and many more would easily fit into that category, and certainly those movies along with your favorite that I'm leaving out all should be in the discussion whenever we talk about the best movie ever made.But whenever I'm asked that question, be it now (five days before Christmas in 2014) or in mid June or July, the movie that I always come back to time and again is the iconic Christmas movie, ""It's a Wonderful Life."" This movie is the greatest film ever made.The film features James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who dreams of seeing the world only to be a victim of fate that finds him staying in his hometown and running the family business, the Bailey Savings & Loan Company in the fictional town of Bedford Falls. James Stewart turns out the performance of his career (barring no other role, including ""Mr. Smith Goes to Washington""). The tale sees him fall in love with Mary (Donna Reed, who offers a similarly strong performance as supporting actress). The two are wed and life goes well for a while, until a fateful day when George's world comes crashing down on him, prompting him to wish he had never been born...only to eventually realize what a wonderful life he has.The story is of course much more complex than that brief summary, but it's the story itself that is the most prevalent star in this movie. The script is a masterpiece in the art of conveying an entertaining and emotional narrative, taking the viewer on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Over the course of two hours you grow to love George Bailey for his character and his perseverance in standing up for the little guy against the tyrannical Mr. Potter, the film's antagonist. When George is elated, you feel it with him. When the frustration of life overwhelms him, you sympathize with him. When he finds himself in the midst of great despair, your heart breaks. And when his grief turns to joy, your heart swells....along with your eyes. I cannot watch this film without crying time and again in its final minutes.Along with the acting and the script, the other major contributing factor to this movie being such a wonderful film is its cinematography. I have seen this movie pop up on ""film noir"" lists from time to time, and I'm not sure that I would agree with that categorization at all, given that film noir movies tend to be more tragic in nature. That said, though, there are a few scenes in which the film uses strong shadow effect in a similar way that noir films are known to do. In at least two scenes, Stewart is shown staring prominently into the camera as he realizes the gravity of certain situations he finds himself in. Those scenes become impressed in your memory after you've seen the film a time or two, and overall the film is well produced with good scenes and settings, and good camera work.All of this makes ""It's a Wonderful Life"" my pick for the Greatest Film Ever Made. We may not always think of it immediately when we're sitting around the picnic table in the summertime thinking about great movies, but it's nevertheless a top notch movie that stands out for its artistic and cinematic value in a way that makes it much more than just a ""Christmas movie"". The wonderful story and well constructed script, the tremendous acting, and the excellent camera-work and film production all make this movie the cream of the crop.10 out of 10 stars!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Absolute Masterpiece,"'It's a Wonderful Life' is one of the best movies of all time. It is directed by Frank Capra and starring movie legends such as Donna Reed and James Stewart.It's a Wonderful Life shows the life of George Bailey, a kind, caring man. You see him right from childhood and even then he is giving to people. As he grows older, he has dreams of traveling. However, after a series of unfortunate events, he can't go on the trips as he has always wanted and he has to look after the family business - the bank. George gets tied down with a family and feels trapped in a world in which he doesn't want to belong and he finds himself trying to commit suicide.This is a beautiful, touching yet dark film. You see so many emotions, attitudes and values in this such as envy, love, corruption, joy, hope, faith and despair, all beautifully portrayed by the actors. It runs along at a fast pace and has a beginning, middle and an end. It also has a moral, which is lacking in so many movies today.It's A Wonderful Life is absolutely universal and timeless (you can enjoy it whether you are 8 or 80). I watched this when I was 12 and it became one of my favorite movies, which I know watch every Christmas. It sums up everything that Christmas is about.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Take the kids,"Just returned from seeing this at the AFI Silver -- had not seen it on the big screen before, so piled the kids into the van and drove down to Silver Spring to see it. What a movie! I'd seen it before, of course, but didn't expect to cry so much. The scene at the end, when the whole town shows up to pitch in to save the Building and Loan, was almost too much for me to bear. I just sat in the theater and bawled. It was a bit embarrassing.Impossible to think of anyone else but Jimmy Stewart as George. If Stewart had never been born, quite likely this movie would never have been made! One can't help but wonder how the world would be different...",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I cried. A lot.,"I don't think I would be able of ever cast an objective statement regarding the quality of this movie. It's not one of this movies I can objectively say which rating does it deserve in a 1 to 10 scale, because it reached something in me way beyond objectifiable maths and numbers. Yes, it may sound super cheesy, but it did reach my heart. I don't even know how it happened, but it was definitely a slow, progressive proccess. The more you get to know George's life, the more difficult it is to wish the best for that man even if he doesn't exist beyond the flat screen. Art is very much about creating an illusion of reality, and some say that if an art piece doesn't cast a spell on you that makes you believe you're appreciating the real world, then it is bad art. When you're reading a novel and you're able to abstract from it and make sense of the fact that all the characters are just plane words on a blank page, is because the spell was not correctly cast and the book you're reading is a bad one. Well, at some point during the movie I stopped to think why on earth was I so touched by just a bunch of pixels in my computer's screen, because I couldn't understand how could I care so much for a person that doesn't even exist. I guess that the answer to that is that people like George do exist, and we're surrounded everywhere by those people who make our lives better, and that sometimes life doesn't give back to them what they deserve. I guess that's the reason why, in the last scene, I just started to cry like a baby, not just a timid tear, but lots of them, up until the movie finished. I don't remember having cried this way for a movie before. I still need to digest this movie, it'll take me a while.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Rises Far Above Most Movies of Its Kind,"This movie rises far above most films of its kind.  Not only are all the important aspects of the film done with care and skill, there is much more substance to it than there is to most 'feel-good' movies or holiday stories. It succeeds where many similar movies fall short, and while it is ultimately a feel-good fantasy, many viewers who don't ordinarily enjoy such stories end up liking this one.One of the major strengths is that hero George Bailey is not a one-dimensional good-guy, but rather must combat his own weaknesses and disappointments at the same time that he is trying to help others.  He has his own dreams and hopes, which never seem to materialize, and this is a genuine struggle for him.  And it doesn't hurt that the character is played by a terrific actor like Jimmy Stewart, who brings out all the sides of George's character, and who gives almost any viewer something to relate to. There are many other positives as well - plenty of interesting characters, a very good cast, and a story that makes use of every available resource. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is an enduring story that is still worth watching and remembering.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
My mothers favorite movie!,"This is the movie my mom will not stop talking about until you say something like ""You need to shut up now"" no kiddin. Every Christmas we sit down and watch this movie at least once together as a family. It's a great story and has a wonderful lesson. I actually got to meet the lady that played Zuzu at a mother daughter lunchion my mother dragged me to when I was 15. She was also in The Bishop's Wife, which is my father's favorite movie, so it was such a big deal to her.

One Life Matters,"The strangest thing about life is how much one person can really be a importantly link to a whole. Whether it's by free will alone, divine design/power, or even both it will never been known, what is known are the results that one person does which can be extraordinary and part of what creates the whole. This is a Christmas/fantasy film I really like that I can come back to every once in a while. It really is a film that actually is pretty dark but also does in a way make you feel good, but most importantly causes you at times to evaluate your own life.There really isn't much I can really say that hasn't already been said. What really matters is the story itself which like all great stories despite how much time has passed it is timeless. The film in a way is kinda a Christian film since there are some Christian themes as well as influence that intervenes.George Bailey is kinda a Christian hero, and like most of them you actually feel a sense of heavy pathos for the guy. The guy had to unfortunately put all his dreams on hold, all to do the right thing for others. I like that he's a bit reluctant, he doesn't really want to be selfless, nor does he even enjoy doing the right thing which I'll admit is something I can emphasize with from time to time. However all the same he does it whether he wants to or not because there is no one else that will, or is even strong enough to. Like with most of Capra's films, they have one thing in common showing that being a good person isn't always the easiest thing to be.Even though George doesn't look like he has all the breaks, personally I think he does, his life actually is pretty good, he's got lots of friends, he's not boring, is active does things with himself, sure not the biggest adventure or exactly an event a minute. To me I always believed sometimes the smallest adventures are biggest, because of what you do during your lifetime. Unlike the antagonist Mr. Potter whom really just like his riches he holds doesn't do jack squat with himself, I can understand where the guys misery originates from but it's no excuse nor give him the right to ruin anyone elses life.Other than the drama, I really like the fantasy aspect which was the first or one of the first times they ever constructed an alternate scenario. This is a common place format now done in many TV shows even comic books, but this film was one of the first and I feel still the best. The alternate scenario I felt was believable because it sort of plays out the notion that we all think of everyday, what if we were out of the picture, or we made that decision instead, or did that. Indeed it would of been a very different world, and of course we see this world without Geroge which is practically a cesspool as we see the blowhole Mr. Potter has fraked up bad. It really is disturbingly believable as George and we see how miserable most residents are, grungy and dirty Bedford falls is, the people that have been deceased because he wasn't around.The film has two really good messages, the first on the importance of exercising selflessness, it not just benefits the people around you but yourself as a person. But also about valuing your life that it really does matter whether you live or die, because of how much it is connected and affect the whole.One person does matter because one can do a whole lot in a single lifetime.Rating: 4 stars",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A classic,"George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) thinks he has a dreadful life. He runs a loan association in the small town of Bedford Falls. The company is always on the verge of bankruptcy and is constantly fighting the evil Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). He is married to an adoring wife (Donna Reed) and has three children. One Christmas Eve he is on the verge of suicide until his guardian angel (Henry Travers) shows up to stop him.No other word for it--it's a classic! Hard to believe this was a bomb when it first came out...it's reputation didn't even start till the early 1980s with repeated television showings. Basically, there's nothing wrong with the film. The script is well-written with realistic well-drawn characters.What really makes it work is that the movie doesn't make Stewart a goody two shoes--he's really unhappy and mean in the first section of the film. It makes his ""transformation"" at the end more believable and realistic. Also it's one of the few movies that has an ending that will have the entire audience crying--out of happiness.The acting is just great all across the board, the set design incredible (Bedford Falls was on a sound stage!) and is heart warming without getting too sentimental. I usually hate films like this but I've loved this since the first time I saw it and make it a point to see it every Christmas. A true classic. Highly recommended.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Life - is what you make it (for you and for ...),"Is life really wonderful? I'm certain a lot of cynics would like to disagree from the outset. Sometimes I'm one of them it seems. But back to this and a man (Stewart, always good and good looking) that has done a lot of good ... but seems to get into trouble nonetheless. He's only human after all - but who could help him? Well other humans, but not in a direct way.Especially the later part of the movie takes off, giving us a payoff that we deserve I'd say. It's fascinating how much people seem to be in love with this movie, but it makes sense. It shows that through all the struggle, there can be hope. Even at your lowest point possible, never surrender, never give up, never quit (wait is that the Cobra Kai mantra? Also did I offend you by even comparing that? It doesn't make sense I know ... right? I think ... let's get back to the movie shall we?).So while there is a simple tale here (if you think about it), it is also a morality tale. It is a tale with a social but also personal message! And it is also a message of humanity and strength and the will and the mental strength to overcome hurdles ... A Christmas Carol has similarities to this, though I have to admit, I don't know how intended they are ... I'd guess more than intended, but that's just me. So sit back and enjoy a family film that has its ups and downs and may feel dated at times, not to mention predictable and putting the viewer ahead many times when it comes to knowing stuff way before our lead character does ... but one that is as feel good as they get ...",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""No man is a failure who has friends.""","After suggestions from many of my friends, I decided to finally watch this movie classic.Firstly, I was really delighted by the quality of the picture, sound and everything else. I expected it to be a low quality black and white film, but my mind was blown away by the fact that in 1946 the movie industry was so well developed. Frank Capra directed this movie so well, I might say this is the best movie I have ever watched. If not the best, then definitely one of my top 3 movies.Secondly, the actors were just perfect. Stewart really did a wonderful job and became one of the few actors that I really admire. Also Donna Reed did her part just as good as Stewart. Currently, there are no actresses that I can imagine playing that part.Lasty, everything I already mentioned would have no meaning without the story and message this movie sends to the viewers. This movie brings all the emotions deep down from you to the surface. I am not ashamed to say that the end made me shed a few tears. There are not many movies that could touch a persons's life so deep. If the movie does so, it is safe to say that it is a perfect movie. Because a movie should communicate directly to every viewer. Just like poetry, every person should be able to find what they look for. One movie, but many meanings. One character, but many lives.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Life Changing Experience!!!,"Simply 'The Perfect' movie experience of a lifetime. Then again, its not just a movie, but something you can actually relate to. The fact that it was made almost 65 years ago, doesn't have any bearing on its relevance. Like the saying goes, 'The more things change, the more they remain the same'.To be honest, I was going through a very similar situation that 'George Bailey' was in the movie, and I do have a habit of watching a 'feel good' movie to enliven my spirits whenever I am going through a bad phase. I must admit, it was one of the most sensible things I did in recent times. This movie has reinforced my belief that life is truly wonderful, and one should try to make the most of every moment. The old adage 'You reap what you sow' still holds true. Do good and no harm will come unto you.Everything in the movie looks so believable and the performances by the entire cast so natural.

The Official Start of my Holiday Season,"This is a charming and timeless movie that has had a huge presence in my life. It's a family tradition to watch this film on the evening of Thanksgiving every year as the start of the winter holiday season. Despite numerous repeat viewings it has never failed to bring tears to my eyes. There is a lot of heart in this movie, and the message this film makes about what it means to matter will always pull on my heartstrings. That said, at it's heart this is the story of George Bailey, who we all admire. It would have helped to see character growth and development from multiple characters, especially as we were able to follow along so many of them from childhood into adulthood. From a writing perspective the supporting cast more often seems like props in George's life. It's a beautiful story and accomplishes so much with what time it has, and certainly would never need a modern retelling (of note there are many characterizations of certain minorities in the film that would not occur in today's cinema, but that is not reason enough to discredit the entire heart of the film), but my largest gripe with it is how the supporting cast is used in contrast to George's life. Great film and will continue to watch it every holiday season.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Film,"When my father proposed this black and white film about a guardian angel for me to watch years ago, as a teenager, my initial reaction could hardly have been a more overwhelming 'no.' But after persistence that for weeks was just below the surface, waiting to be unleashed every evening pickings on the television were slim, one especially uneventful night I succumbed and with a sigh agreed to watch it with mostly the intention of getting him off my case. Little I knew it would be the best film recommendation I had ever, and likely will ever receive.Most of the superlatives have been used up when describing this film so I will not go into them in too much detail again. The term perfection is thrown around loosely but I believe this is one of the very few films that can claim wear that lofty tag with comfort. Jimmy Stewart gives a stunning performance as George Bailey, one of the most endearing characters in cinematic history. The whole cast is excellent and the on- screen chemistry between George and Mary is a sight to behold.The true power in this film is how it manages to, almost effortlessly but with complete conviction, leave a profound emotional impact upon the viewer. It is a film that the viewer can get so emotionally connected to and can relate to so deeply that it can become part of that viewers person and change their outlook, philosophy, and indeed, their life. Personally I have seen the film too many times to remember and it still manages to leave a lump in my throat and a tear in my eye.It is perhaps ironic that years after that first viewing, I mirrored my father in turning pest and badgered my group of college housemates into watching. It is perhaps the best measure of a film's greatness that six sceptical 20year old college students could sit down, abandon the alternative option of an alcohol-propelled night out, and sit in silence as the film happened and blink away tears in the semi-darkness as the bells signalling the end of the masterpiece tolled.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's supposed to be a classic...,"I'm surrounded by a lot of moviegoers, many of whom are watching this movie. And the topic of conversation often is whether this movie is a masterpiece or not so much fun as a masterpiece. I consider it more of a good movie, though not so much a masterpiece.
There's one part of the film that I'll never forget. It's what the bank is trying to do. I've heard that some American towns and streets are named after banks, and this movie made me realize that America was created by banks. A similar episode is also in ""Duel at Noon"". It was about a conflict in the city because they didn't like the city planning that the bank was aiming for, that one. I also heard that the famous Wyatt Earp actually had a fight with the bank after ""My Love Clementine"" and lost and left the town. In that sense, this movie gave me a good opportunity to learn about American history. The fact that it depicts such a harsh reality, and the fact that it's resolved in a gentle way through fantasy is why this movie is called a masterpiece, I guess.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only last 30 minutes is worth watching.,"I liked a heartwarming story that George Bailey gets to look back what he has done for family and the community with his guide angel and that he realizes what a wonderful life he has. However, 100 minutes narrating the whole life story of this middle-aged man building up for final moment is just lengthy.It would have been better approach to focus more on the ending. Mary's effort to loan the money from the community, Uncle Billy trying to make up for the mistakes he made, or retribution for Mr. Potter's misdemeanor. There are so many stories to tell and to wrap up the film completely rather than abruptly. However, this film spends 100 minutes describing only the protagonist in one-dimensional way.",5.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"If you can still dream, still hope -- this Masterpiece will Live!","""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a Work of Art and of Great Craft that will survive the eons for its many, many qualities -- acting, script, direction, details, clear commitment by all involved....and a rather 'eccentric' structure.It careens so closely to schmaltz -- no, to pure saccharine -- that one is surprised to not find goo on the sleeve after viewing it. But it stays just inside that sugary boundary for several reasons --The actors are absolutely committed to the truth and motivation of their characters. They don't judge their roles, they don't act at them, they strip down, then dive completely into them and make them live and feel and suffer.There is no more well-meaning, ethical, but often disoriented character than Jimmy Stewart's 'George Bailey'. As one watches all the shifts of emotion from self-control, to whimsy, to befuddlement, to searing anger, to sweetness, it is hard to remember that this actor is a Bomber Pilot just returned from World War II, from flying deadly B-17 missions through the terrible 'black blossoms' of flak over Nazi Germany. And more, that this is his first film since he returned!No meaner, nastier non-caricature of a horror than Lionel Barrymore's 'Potter'. The more infamous 'Ebenezer Scrooge' is a curmudgeonly, dismissive, venal and unsympathetic man. But he wants to be left alone. Potter is pure evil, while still able to remain in a society. Unlike Scrooge he is voraciously acquisitive, constantly intrusive -- an active predator and crippler of those whose shadow even falls across his view, much less his appetite. No scruples, no ethics, no empathy for anything or anyone. And somehow Barrymore and Capra make it work.No sweeter yet frustrating relative you have tried to rely on than George Mitchell's 'Uncle Billy'. No more uncertain but determined Angel than Henry Travers' 'Clarence'. No more interesting array of people who decorate George Bailey's life -- Donna Reed, so sweet, so pretty, yet anything but naive or simple ... Gloria Grahame, man-hungry, sensual of tastes, but whose heart and hopes just keep her from being one of 'those' girls ... Ward Bond and Frank Faylen as the Cop-and-Cab-Driver buddies, who look out for George, when they can.And of course the Center of this Life is Frank Capra -- directing, writing, bleeding, feeling, thinking at his very, very best. Clearly written, crafted, produced, directed with every cell, both cerebral and cardiological.A lovely film become rich in its details and contrasts.A decent George Bailey whom we assume would gave back Mary Hatch's accidentally dropped robe -- which leaves her apparently unclad in a large hedge -- is just about to, but then stops. ""You know, we have a very interesting situation, here....it's not every day a man...."" And actively toys with her over her desperate pleas (remember, it is the 1930's) right up until tragedy sticks a bony hand into the scene and wrenches the moment away.George at the kitchen table talking with his Dad (Samuel S. Hinds) and sees family housekeeper Annie (Lillian Randolph) doing a little eavesdropping through the kitchen door -- ""Why don't you just pull up a chair and listen...? ""....to which Annie replies -- ""I would if I thought there was anything worth hearing!"" A family.The film moves into ever darker hues, step by step, until plunging suddenly downward. George is pushed beyond even his elasticity, and snaps into a sequence of sudden and exploding rages, savaging even his own bewildered family, that is stunning -- the kind in real life that make you wince in embarrassment and turn away. And because the terrible moments are so very real in this film, you wince just as uncomfortably. This from the craft and the commitment of one James Stewart, the bomber pilot. Here you see the sometimes-dismissed as the ""Aw, shucks"" actor at an incredible artistic complexity, with a very large actor's toolbox.The interesting thing about the structure is this –It's a story about George's world (yours) would be like if he had never existed.But for 1 hour and 50 minutes, we are shown the 'before' that happens, what life was with George around. Then in the final 10 minutes we are shown that world without George Bailey, and his understanding of that consequence, and his reclamation.Life with George was complicated, often difficult, frustrating, confusing.Without him, it is cold, harsh, cruel and dead, except for the brassy, blaring glitter of a world gone to seed and sensuality, having lost its human way without him. And when Jimmy Stewart's face turns into stone as he first sees and tries to understand this other world he cannot possibly grasp, so do we.This is a movie about humanity challenged, of the heart being squeezed, of dreams being shattered or stolen. And yet the good in a few people – or just one -- can keep the endangered good in others alive. Alive until it can re-ignite and re-spread its warmth and light.Unless the shade of iron reality and cynicism has rung down around you, you can hope and dream with these citizens of Bedford Falls, because Capra and Stewart and Reed and the others hope and dream so very, very well.Oh, and if you can EVER see this in a real theater, please do so! I just did for the first time, and the silvered emotional reality that Capra paints on that big screen is almost overwhelming, it is so large.Capra will gently squeeze your throat and your tear ducts. He did mine and a lady friend's (though she can cry at a pantyhose commercial).",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Love it, except!!","We watch It's a Wonderful Life every year. It is a superb movie. The only thing that gets my goat is Potter never gets his comeuppance for keeping the $8000. I love the chemistry between Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed. I cry when Mr. Gower hits George on the ear. I know it was panned when it came out because it was supposedly against capitalism but I don't see it that way. I dislike Potter because he steals not because he's rich. The acting is great by everyone. I love the maid. We just never know the impact we have on other people's lives-for good, hopefully, not for the bad. I highly recommend the movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Stewart Is Wonderful,"Ever since Capra's 'It's a Wonderful Life' became a huge success, there have been numerous films that have borrowed its story. Though it starts off a little slow and some of the scenes seem rushed, the pace gradually picks up in the second hour. The small town is well structured and one does get the feel of it. The appearance of an angel is a little awkward but one gets used to it because of a charming Henry Travers. 'It's a Wonderful Life' tends to be melodramatic and loud at times but the lead performances somehow make up for the faults. Stewart is wonderful as an ambitious and good-hearted dreamer who loses everything and then finds his way back. Donna Reed is brilliantly subtle as the caring and supportive wife. This does not rank among my favourite Capra films but it is a good enough watch.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
What can I say?... a remarkable film.,"What can I say that hasn't already been mentioned? It's a Wonderful Life is a true classic in every sense of the word. Frank Capra's directing hits dead on and moves you like any great film should, and he injects just the right amount of humor at the same time. Jimmy Stewart.... well, we all know how great of an actor he is, and in this film his performance is perfection. Every time I see him as he runs down the streets wishing everybody a merry Christmas, I can't help but cry, I cry at the sheer joy that I am witnessing onscreen. It's moments like that, moments that touch you, moments that you never forget  that show how powerful film can be.Although ""It Happened One Night"" is my favorite Capra film.. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is without a doubt his greatest masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A christmas classic that you will adore.,"A beautiful sincere Christmas story that's practically flawless in every aspect. I have to give the movie special praise for it's casting, acting, script, pacing. There's a reason this is often considered one of the greatest movies of all time. The film explores the life of one man played by James Stewart before we begin to see the clouds on the horizon for him. The film asks a question we should perhaps all ask ourselves, what would life be like for others if we had never existed? The film is thoroughly sentimental but also has it's darker moments too. I really treasure this movie and I think it can be enjoyed by practically anyone.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
George discovers what life would have been like without him.,"I've been keeping a ""top ten"" list of movies which have affected my life for the last decade or so.  The first entry I added to the list was ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and it hasn't moved from that #1 billing.There is nothing complicated about this movie; it simply states in a very heartwarming and loving way that ""you"" matter.  The visual image of George Bailey running down the street of Bedford Falls will always evoke a positive warm glowing feeling in me.  No matter how discouraged you may be feeling it does help to stop and remember that you do have worth and can make a difference during your sojourn this life.Perhaps ""It's a Wonderful Life"" doesn't have the pizazz, action  and special effects of today's movies and may not be able to hold the interests of today's audiences but to that I'd like to say, ""Please slow down and just let the story enfold you.""  Watch it with a friend.  People matter and so do you.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"First Time View in Movie Theater,It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special","It's a wonderful movie, truly. One of my personal favorites. And a personal favorite for many, especially as a TV staple at Christmas, thanks to its lapsed copyright in 1974 (although that was successfully challenged in 1993). The director, Frank Capra, is in top form, as is James Stewart, who displays devastating depth as George Bailey, an ordinary man who aches to be extraordinary. Both deservedly earned Oscar nominations, out of 5 total, including Best Picture.Based on the short story The Greatest Gift by Philip Van Doren Stern It's A Wonderful Life is a true cinematic masterpiece that would melt the coldest of hearts. I know that statement is a tired cliche-- but it is very true. The heart of the film is Stewart's magnificent performance, his first in many years due to his WWII military service. Stewart shows excellent range in his ""everyman"" persona that that has made him a legend.It's a Wonderful Life was James Stewart's first film after four years of military service during World War II. It was also Frank Capra's first commercial film since filming for the war department. Although Stewart was the only name mentioned for the role of George after Liberty bought the story, several other actors and actresses were mentioned for other roles. In a modern source, documents in Capra's own hand mention numerous possibilities for various characters, the most prominent of which were Olivia de Havilland, Martha Scott and Ann Dvorak for the role of Mary. I feel the stars aliened as the lovely Donna Reed got the role of Mary his devoted wife. I have not seen many Donna Reed films but I have already been scouring the internet looking for her work !In the first half, she looks lovely. Modern hairstyle, flattering clothing, fresh and clean. But without George, she suddenly loses her sense of style?! Glasses, sensible clothes, hat, hair pulled back, gloves, no makeup. She is so covered up, almost hiding, with the hat and the gloves and the buttoned-up clothes. This image is the stereotypical prototype for all Spinster Librarians. This does make sense, as the Spinster Librarian is one of the character types that heavily rely on stereotypical visual cues: the severe hairstyle, glasses, and prim clothing.Now there is a wonderful treat in this film in the form on film Noir temptress star Gloria Grahame as the trampy Violet, the town floozy of Bedford Falls who tempted Jimmy Stewart in It's a Wonderful Life . She went on to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress in 'The Bad and the Beautiful ' in 1952. For years she reigned as the Queen of Film Noir. She appeared in countless films, television shows and on stage until her tragic death at age 57 in 1981.Part comedy, drama and fantasy film It's A Wonderful Life delivers on many levels. When watching It's A Wonderful Life it is easy to see that film is a legitimate art form . It makes you think and count your blessings. It's a Wonderful Life is something truly special and first rate film making.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Beyond my expectations (rental),"I have always heard about this movie as a Xmas classic (maybe because a clip is shown in Gremlins) and having watching it now, i agree: a bit like Scrooge, it's about a salvation in the holiday but unlike him, the guy is pure good while Scrooge is evil. For a movie fan, you will be happy because the movie has the same feeling as Spielberg comedies, it begins like Stand by me and ends like BTTF2: the nightmarish small town V2 is really well done. James Stewart looks like very much David Lynch and he is a true fine actor! The story is full of good values, hope and in addition is aware in punching greedy capitalism! So today you won't find a comedy so deep, so social while the situation would need urgently so have fun and a education with this one while you can!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A classic everyone should know about.,"I just saw it recent;y for the first time ever.And I'm very amazed on how well done this movie was made.It takes place from 1910s-1946.Jimmy Stewart portrays a man who wanted to follow his dreams but always ended up being a failure. He feels as if his life is falling apart. On X-Mas eve he thinks the world would be better off without him.When all seemed hopeless. A man named Clarence who is said to be a guardian Angel will help him change his way of thinking.Unlike other holiday movies, this one is one of those feel good movies and has a great moral to it. That every person who fails deserves a second chance.I think every person should know what this movie is. If you haven't seen it yet, do so, cause this is a must see classic. And it be a perfect movie for the whole family to watch.There's nothing too offending in the movie.

This classic got a big flaw,"When you cast characters as a family, or when you have different actors to play the same person when he or she was young, then cast another adult actor to play the same person as he or she grew up, there are two very important necessities whenever involved family and age growth.We have so many actors young and old cast as family members, father, mother, brothers young or old, there's consistence the filmmakers used to overlook: The people live under the same roof, coming from the same parents, the kids undoubtedly would inherit the accent from one of their parents; if the father often with the kids, then the kids, especially the boys, their accent and intonation when speaking would be very similar to their father's accent and intonation. Or if it is the mother who spend more time with her kids, usually, the kids would inherit her accent and intonation when speaking.But what we got here in this movie is a mess!
Samuel S. Hinds, who played Pa Bailey was born in Brooklyn, New York, so he got a Brooklyn accent. Beulah Bondi, she played Mrs. Bailey, was born in Chicago, Illinois, while George Bailey played by James Stewart was born in
Indiana, Pennsylvania. James Steward never bothered to change his accent in almost every movie he played, no matter what kind of role it was. His trademark heavy and weird accent and the way he spoke were so unique.
Robert J.Anderson, he played the Little George, was born in Hollywood, California. And Todd Karns, he played Harry Bailey as George Bailey' younger brother, was born in Hollywood, California.So we got so many actors came from different cities and states, and all of them got different accents and intonations when speaking the dialog. How come everybody lived under the same roof, with the same parents, their accents and intonations would be so different? None of them in this movie speaking with the least similar accent, especially George Bailey? It's just ridiculous!!There's one other big problem when the screenplay involves kids growing up into adults. No matter what, when kids actors growing up, the actors who played their adult roles, there must be some similarities between the kids actors and their adult actors. In ""Brothers Bloom (2008)"", when young Bloom grew up, the adult Bloom was played by Adrien Brody, a ridiculous casting job! How come a boy played by Zachary Gordon, his face would grow into such huge different facial parts? The huge hooked nose? the slant eyebrows? I just couldn't believe the transformations would be so huge.James Steward was a great actor with natural acting talents, but his never-changed heavy and weird accent was actually a big flaw in almost every movies he played.",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Potter probably would have won today,"This film probably ends more happily than any film in the annals of Hollywood, with that great sing a long of Auld Lang Sine as George Bailey discovers what a wonderful life it is. The drama, comedy, and heartfelt sentimentality are all woven together into a seamless masterpiece. It portrays the bitter struggle for the future of Bedford Falls between egalitarian Bailey and hard-nosed miser Mr Potter (Lionel Barrymore). One of the best of James Stewart's films, and that is saying something, and given a magic touch by director Frank Capra, with Donna Reed looking unbelievable, and Thomas Mitchell as the kindly but careless partner who manages to misplace the deposit that ultimately sends the picture into overdrive, it is the best holiday movie out there with the possible exception of the 1951 version of Scrooge.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A wonderful film. One of best i've seen,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time and a Christmas tradition in my household. This film is about sacrifice for the greater good. George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) having big ideas of the world around him and continually puts his desires behind the good of the town. Another thing this movie shows perfectly that no matter how insignificant we feel, we are all linked to each other and play a important part in each others lives. After George looses his way and a angel shows what the world would be like without him he soon realizes how important he was to the people and town around him. This will always be considered a classic in cinema and a great movie to watch every year during Christmas. So we can all remember the good and bad of the present year and when new years comes around we try to make the next year better for others and ourselves.

Review of the colorized version,"Review Date 2/19/2018PLEASE BEWARE OF SOME REVIEWERS THAT ONLY HAVE ONLY ONE REVIEW. I HAVE OVER 400 REVIEWS OF ""CHRISTMAS RELATED FILMS & SPECIALS"" WHEN ITS A POSITIVE THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THEY WERE INVOLVED WITH THE PRODUCTION. NOW I HAVE NO AGENDA! I REVIEW MOVIES & SPECIALS AS A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT I HAVE SEEN! I HAVE DISCOVERED MANY GEMS IN MY QUEST TO SEE AS MANY "" C H R I S T M A S "" MOVIES AS I CAN.Now Someone keeps reporting my reviews. I guess they are jealous because I do tell the truth. I want to point out that I never make snide remarks about actors weight or real life sexual orientation. If there acting is terrible or limited ""I talk about that"". If a story is bad ""I will mention that"" So why am I being ""picked on""? IMDB? When one of my reviews gets deleted IMDB will not even tell me what someone found offensive. Well on to this review.""It's a Wonderful Life"" was first seen in 1946. In the 1970's the copyright of the film was thought to have lapsed. So for ""Around 20 Years"" the film was seen almost everyday on any given television channel during December. It was this exposure that made America fall in love with the film. While thought to be in public domain the film was ""Colorized"" for the first time around 1985. In the 1990's the films copyright was somehow reinstated and re-colorized. Paramount now holds the copyright and they had Legacy films do a new colorized version of the film. The latest can bee seen in the current Paramount Home Video Dvd or Blu-Ray editions.Now I am not for colorizing films. Even if they are done well I still prefer seeing the film in its intended version.Now ""It's a Wonderful Life"" loses something in color. Since it has a ""fantasy vibe"" to it at times the color just ruins the emotions.I think the colorization should have had an ""oversatution"" in the part where George Bailey has an alternate reality of ""Bedford Falls"". What we get is not a shift in tone that the Black and White film seems to capture all so easily.Now this film is a true classic and should be seen by all every holiday season. You don't have to celebrate Christmas in order to enjoy the film.In this film George Bailey is a man who always dreamed of leaving Bedford Falls but for some reason he never can. One night out of years of fighting MR Potter George finds himself at the end of his rope and is about to jump off a bridge. An angel saves him and tries to convince how he does have ""A Wonderful Life"".Jimmy Stewart and the entire cast give Star Studded Performances. Keep in mind this film is still being copied in some form or another in 2-3 Hallmark films every year.

A Christmas classic,"It's a Wonderful Life is as much a part of Christmas to me as stockings, candy, snow dusted-trees and shopping. It was a tradition for our family to watch this movie every Christmas Eve before my two siblings and I were tucked into bed in anticipation for Santa Clause to visit our front door (we didn't have a chimney). I will admit that I am not usually a fan of films from this era (I gave Casablanca 5 out of 10 stars), but this feature is different. It's long, but it has to be. The storyline truly covers the main character's entire life. It all comes together in the end in divine detail. It's uplifting and romantic.

It Does Not Get Any Better Than This,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a super film whose impeccable timing (post World War II-1946) and outstanding story-line gave hope and joy to the whole country.

Enter guardian angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows Stewart how great his life has been and how his life has affected everyone else's for the better.  Frank Capra's direction is, well Capra-esque.  The screenplay is perfect and all the performances are super as well.

A Cute Film!,"I know a lot of people love to watch this every Christmas. Although it is not really a holiday favourite of mine, I do really enjoy this film in a non-Christmas related context!This film's moral and themes are beautiful. It must be why it is so beloved during the Christmas
time period. The film definitely has some character archetypes that are a little over-the-top, but I think it works for the more traditional narrative. Black and white films always look more stylish to me, even if it was just due to the technology of the time it was filmed.I do think that it takes a bit of a while to get into the main plot of the film. You do need a lot of set up for George Bailey's character, but upon rewatches it does feel like it could have been reworked or streamlined at points. Overall though, I do highly recommend this classic at any time of the year really!",7.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Movies in retrospect, viz-a-viz  'It's a Wonderful Life.'","I never really watched the whole movie all the way through; The only thing I remember is that there was a pharmacy & pharmacist in the plot(George Bailey?Right?) -- Or something like that -- I'm a retired Pharmacist so it attracted my attention. I was born in 1941, and this movie was made in 1947, so I was only 6 y.o.a. when this classic came out. Interestingly, Direct TV had it as a pay-per-view item(?), and I never really thought it was that good??!!(Or that people would PAY to watch it??!!). I prefer to watch something like 'Ben Hur,' or 'King of Kings,' for the religious aspect of the holidays. More to the point, I adore 'Ben Hur,' and think it's one of the most beautiful movies ever made. And, lest I forget, a Billie Wilder of note, the 'Big Country,' is by far my favorite of all time -- Jean Simmons & Gregory Peck worked well together, along with Charleton Heston, making this movie a classic of all classics, especially in the Western category.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Pass the Popcorn review,"It's a Wonderful Life is considered one of the best movies of all time, and also one of the most beloved Christmas movies in American cinema, even though it was a box office failure when it was released and received some negative reviews, and it won just the Academy Award for Technical Achievements, despite being nominated for five more. What I like about this movie is that it isn't a classic Christmas movie: the movie isn't about how things get better overnight for the main character just because he/she 'believes in Christmas', or some idiocy like that. Christmas just plays a small, but great role in the final part of the movie, which is, ultimately, about life.The movie starts with God and Joseph, explaining to the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) that he has to go to Earth and save George Bailey (James Stewart), who's contemplating suicide. God then begins to show Clarence George's most relevant moments in life, from childhood till the present. Most of the movie is actually spent showing us that George always wanted to travel but decided to stay in his hometown and save his late father's business, and that he's always been a good person, who's always thought more of the others than himself and has led a good life. But when he finds out he can't pay a debt, he wishes he'd never been born – and Clarence shows him what would have become of his town, had he never been born.As I've said before, It's a Wonderful Life is about life. When you're young you have your dreams and ambitions, and you're sure that you'll end up living an ideal life, just like the one you've always planned. But life just happens and you often can't control it, and one day you discover you're a completely different person from the one you wanted to be. Some of us can't stand this and eventually come to a breaking point: George in this movie wanted to end it all and thought everyone would have been better off without him, not realising he had done so much and that even the problems that seem insurmountable can be resolved, with help from friends and family.Because of its simple but timeless story, this movie has aged beautifully. Add to that the great acting and dialogues, the good sense of humour, the complex characters, the great cinematography – and you get a truly wonderful movie. It's impossible not to see and feel that George Bailey represents all of us, and it's easy to share his joys and sorrows as if they were our own. Ultimately, this is a movie that truly sums up what Christmas – but also all our lives – should be about: being a good person, because it pays off and because the richest people are those surrounded by family and friends, not the ones that have lots of money. It might be a naive and idealistic message, but it works amazingly for this time of the year.Rating: 8/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"The Best Movie I've Seen, Ever!","I have watched this movie countless times. It is the best movie for many reasons ever made in my opinion. The story, its values, acting, sets are marvelous. I rated it a 9 but I could be persuaded to give it a 9.5.
After all these viewings I have two questions for Frank Capra or anyone who loves this movie.
The first question is when George rescues his brother Harry. We are told by the second angel educating Clarence about George that he saved Harry's life - (George, Marty, Sammy and other friends were sliding down a snow covered hill on coal shovels onto ice and sliding across the ice covering a small pond open at the far end to the pond's water. Harry slid too far and fell in. George jumps in to save Harry), but he caught a bad cold and his left ear became infected and he lost his hearing in that ear. It was ""weeks"" before he was able to return to his after school job at Old Man Gower's drug store. The scene of the boys sliding was snow and ice - the next scene was George and his friends walking after school to George's after school job. The key word for me that raises my question is the word ""weeks"" because leaves were on the trees a very fast transition from the snow covered pond. I think a better word would be months. Another clue is that on the telegram the date is May. Any ice and snow would have melted back in March.
The second question is if Potter spends his time in a wheelchair, how does he get around with only the help of his large assistant? How would he AND the wheelchair get up the steep stairs at the Bailey Bros. Building and Loan? Does the assistant take the chair up first then returns and carries Potter. The chair looks like it's made of solid wood and is very heavy by itself. Are there duplicate chairs placed in Potter's office and places he does business so the chair does not have to be considered? And how does he get up into his horse drawn carriage? It seems so easy for Potter to be anywhere. Perhaps Capra is counting on our imagination? Any answers out there?",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Timeless Tale of Hope and Redemption,"Watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the first time was like stepping into a warm embrace on a cold winter's night. I remember curling up on the couch, the twinkling lights of my Christmas tree casting a soft glow around the room. As the film unfolded, I found myself enchanted by the story of George Bailey, a man whose dreams seemed perpetually out of reach.James Stewart's portrayal of George is nothing short of mesmerizing. He captures the essence of a man burdened by responsibility yet filled with an unwavering hope for a better tomorrow. There were moments when I felt his pain, his frustration, and ultimately, his joy. The emotional rollercoaster was so palpable that I found myself laughing and crying in equal measure.The film's message resonated deeply with me. It made me reflect on my own life and the relationships I often take for granted. Each character, from the kind-hearted Mary to the cantankerous Mr. Potter, felt like a piece of a larger puzzle that reminded me of the importance of community, love, and sacrifice. The scene where George realizes the impact he has had on the lives around him brought tears to my eyes. It was a poignant reminder that our existence is intertwined with those we cherish, and that sometimes, we need a little nudge to see our worth.What struck me most was the film's timeless quality. Despite being made in 1946, its themes are universal and relevant even today. It encourages us to appreciate the little things in life and to recognize the beauty in our struggles. By the time the credits rolled, I felt a renewed sense of gratitude for my own life, and I couldn't help but smile at the thought of how interconnected we all are.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is more than just a holiday classic; it's a heartfelt exploration of what it means to live a meaningful life. I walked away from the experience feeling uplifted and inspired, eager to embrace the world with open arms. It's a film I know I will return to time and again, each viewing revealing new layers and insights.

Every Life Makes A Difference,"For many this is a Christmas classic, watched every year and much beloved. For me, I've never seen it before. Heard of it; seen short clips of it; but never have I sat down and watched it straight through from beginning to end. Having now done that I can understand why it's such a beloved movie to so many people. It isn't necessarily a Christmas/holiday movie. The basic message would work at any time of the year; it just happens to be set (in its climax anyway) on Christmas Eve. And the message it presents is an important one that everyone needs to hear from time to time, in a world where it's so easy to feel discouraged: every person's life counts. Everyone makes a difference. That's the point here, and it's well made.The movie revolves around George Bailey (James Stewart.) George starts out as a kid with big dreams of escaping his hum-drum (to him) home town of Bedfork Park and seeing the world. But it never works out. He ends up running the small savings & loan operation his father started, while his brother and his friends all seem to go on to bigger and better things - becoming heroes; becoming famous; becoming rich. George has a good life. He's married to a woman he loves (Donna Reed) and he has great kids and a lot of friends, but it just isn't what he always wanted. It's not completely satisfying for him. Eventually it all falls apart when the local ruthless banker (Lionel Barrymore) comes up with a way of bringing him down. With everything apparently out of control, George decides to kill himself, only to be rescued by the angel Clarence (Henry Travers) who shows him what Bedford Park would be like if he had never existed - and it's not pretty.The story isn't complicated. It's simple and straightforward. Everybody does a good job in it. Personally, I thought there was perhaps a little too much emphasis on George's life and what brought him to the brink of suicide, and maybe not quite enough emphasis on George being confronted by the consequences of his non-existence. (And, in the alternative timeline, Bert the cop opening fire on George in the street seemed a bit - shall we say - excessive; not to mention dangerous!) Perhaps the opening, with God and the angels talking to each other as stars and other heavenly bodies was a bit too cute, but it's all within the expected standards of 1946.It is a nice movie, and it does have a nice message. Your life does make a difference to a lot of people - probably more than you know, so be satisfied with it and rejoice in what you have. I can easily understand why so many consider it a classic.

A Talk with Jimmy: Seeing a 'Wonderful Life' through His Eyes,"A VISIT WITH JIMMY STEWART: Inside 'Wonderful Life,' a Wonderful Life""'It's a Wonderful Life' sums up my philosophy of filmmaking ... to exalt the worth of the individual, to champion man ... and to dramatize the viability of the individual."" _ director Frank CapraJAMES STEWART, whom Frank Capra lovingly described as being ""unusually usual,"" the movies' quintessential Everyman, sat down to reminisce about ""It's Wonderful Life"" on Nov. 16, 1987, not quite 40 years after it had opened in theaters across the country. Then 79, Stewart, in his familiar crackling Indiana drawl, explained that the movie was never really intended as a Christmas film. RKO, the movie's distributor, originally planned to premiere it on Jan. 30, 1947. But its big color film set for the holidays, ""Sinbad the Sailor,"" had to be put on hold when Technicolor went on strike. Enter black and white 'Life"" instead on Dec. 20, 1946. ""Christmas was just sort of part of it, and a wonderful way to end the movie,"" Stewart said. ""The picture didn't do well when it opened because -- and I know Frank (Capra, the movie's director) feels the same way -- it was right after World War II, and the substance of the film wasn't what people wanted to see. They wanted something sort of relaxing, a rejuvenating film, a lot of comedy -- Red Skelton, Martin and Lewis, who were just coming into their own just then. The war was a tough thing to take for the people back home here. I think they wanted something sort of wilder than this."" Another thing didn't help box office when 'Life' opened: a real white Christmas that year. Snow blasted the eastern U.S. Ironically, the film actually had been shot from May through July 1946 at RKO's Encino Ranch during 80-degree weather. Snow was simulated by use of 3,000 tons of shaved ice, 300 tons of plaster, 300 tons of gypsum and 6,000 gallons of chemicals. The ""snowstorm"" that occurs when Stewart's character, George Bailey, attempts suicide took three weeks to create and required the largest special effects crew assembled for a movie up to that time. ""Frank didn't even have the story for 'It's Wonderful Life' on paper when he invited me over to his house one day. He told me, 'I have an idea for a picture,' and started taking about an angel named Clarence who hadn't won his wings, and that I'm gonna commit suicide, and he said, 'I'm not telling this very well.'' I said, 'Frank, if you want to do a picture about an angel named Clarence who hasn't won his wings, I'm your man."" The movie was Stewart's favorite. ""For quite a few reasons,"" he said. ""Number one, it was the first picture I got to do after the war, and maybe for that reason, it's sort of a sentimental favorite. But beyond that, I think the picture had the main sort of things that mean so much to me ... an idea with two basic points: There's no man who is born to be a failure, and that no man is poor who has friends. Now, from the those two sentences, the secret of the movie is made."" A number of things were improvised, like the recurrent bit where George keeps knocking off the knob on the Baileys' banister railing. ""The first time I walked by, it was loose and it came off when I grabbed it. We just left the bit in. Frank and I never discussed it.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

My Personal All-Time Christmas Movie,"What is there to say about this brilliant movie that hasn't already been said? The movie is nearly 80 years old at the time of me writing this and it still holds up today.I'll be honest I never actually sat and watched this movie until later in my life, I saw clips over the years but never watched it. When I watched it the first time I was so enthralled by James Stewart, never in my life did I ever experience an actor portray a character so convincingly than that of George Bailey. I felt every up and down the character went through and was so endeared towards him just like the residents of Bedford Falls. In my opinion it was one of the greatest acting performances I've ever seen, and I've since been working my way through James Stewart's other movies.Now every Christmas my family and I become temporary residents of Bedford Falls as watching this movie has become our tradition.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Classic Not Corny,"I have been watching this movie for decades. Each time I see it, I glean a little more from the characters and the story. It is simply the best Christmas movie ever made... period!Years ago, when my son became a young man, he watched this movie with me. His comment? ""It's corny and not a good movie."" My response was swift and simple: ""People who don't appreciate this movie have no souls!"" I have stuck by this comment for many, many years.While some of the dialog dates the movie to years ago, it is done in keeping with the theme which is universal. It has become a classic because the theme endures... if one has a soul.If you have never seen this movie (which I find impossible), give it a watch this Christmas season. If you have seen it, watch it again and see how many new details speak to you. It is classic, not corny!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Motherhood, apple pie....","It was Frank Capra's genius to translate America's fondest dreams into irresistibly emotional movies.  Maybe it takes a Sicilian to capture the essence of America.The movie's power is certainly enhanced by its terrific cast:  Lionel Barrymore as an irresistibly evil villain, Donna Reed as an imperfectly perfect wife, and Jimmy Stewart as, well, Jimmy Stewart.  (Like most movie-goers, I am enormous grateful to Tom Hanks for taking up this mantle.)I could go on, but why bother?  Get out the Kleenex and enjoy!

"It's the story about what is a successful life,","he Review of the Movie, 'It's a Wonderful Life', by Jennifer HeoI happened to watch this movie a few months after watching Avatar, which was very controversial about adapting a new technology of 3D in film making in 2009. Compared to Avatar, which is visually colorful and dynamic but it has an almost non-existent storyline, this movie not only is well played and matched in the stars' roles but also gives us a message about sincere and happy lives.The setting and costumes are so classic. It is a white and black movie released in 1947 right after World War 2. Each of the movie stars' costumes, the women's hairstyle in 1940s, men's suits, and settings can be boring and weird, but it can lead me to feel calm and refined.The movie was photographed in a small village of Bedford Hill in America. It was nominated for the academy award and won the director award. It is certain that a family can enjoy it together all the time not only for Christmas. When you need some refreshment in your life, it shows you how to lead your life to be successful. Of course a successful life depends on each single person. However, I think this movie shows us true success is not how much money we own, but how we spend the money through two characters, George Baily(James Stewart) and Henry F. Potter(Lionel Banymore). In addition, Mary Hatch Bailey (Donna Reed) shows how important and helpful a lovely lover, devoted wife, and dedicated mother is for a man's wonderful life.George Bailey is an optimistic and cheerful character throughout the movie. The man with a big dream adventuring a larger and wider world from his childhood days wants to be more educated. However, he has to choose another way that he doesn't want. It leads him to sacrifice his life for his family and some other people in the village. His sacrificial life brings about that he is well-known and respected in the small village, while he has to be against the richest and meanest Henry Potter, who lives in the same village. On the contrary, Potter without any children has over money enough to live, but he doesn't give any charity for others. He tries to take advantage of people in the village to make a fortune. He even tempts George Bailey, suggesting a job with some good conditions. That is because he thinks that George prevents him from expanding his business. However, he rejects it without any hesitation and always chooses the righteous and helpful life for other people.What I was impressed most by in the story is the scenes showing how much he and Mary love each other. He meets Mary at school dance party for celebrating graduation. They fall in love with each other and she chooses him to get married and fully supports him whatever he wants to do. It encourages him to work harder for the people. Yet, he plunges into the depth of despair because of his uncle's big mistake on the Christmas Eve. At that time, through his guardian angel called Clarence, he finds out that the people who he loves including Mary, his eternal lover and wife, lead desperate lives in the world without him and he realizes that he leads a great life. Especially, the last scene where his friends collect money to help him in despair and he is paid back from the people who know him makes us contemplate what a wonderful life is. I could not control the tears from coming down my cheek.The Christmas carol in the movie and the scenes of snow make us feel happy. I am often forced to grab it in the season of Christmas every year. This old classic movie adding folktale elements by an angel's appearance also tugs heartstrings and gives a profound message. Therefore, I can recommend you to watch with your family and whomever you want. I think George Bailey can surely be your life guide in a tough life.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"wasn't the first and won't be the last of the classic's I 'get around to', but so far, it's one of the best","I didn't feel comfortable in my skin a few years back. My friends and family considered me 'the movie buff'. In a way, I was. I'd seen about 4,000 movies, and covered literally everything worth watching since 1980, but I hadn't broken into the vault of classic films. I'd seen a few.Wuthering Heights(9.5/10) and The Wizard of Oz(10/10) were two of my favorite films, both from 1939. I'd also seen 1939's Gone With the Wind(9/10), Dark Victory(9/10), and a few other classics:The Killing, King Kong, Frankenstein, Dracula, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, War of the Worlds, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, and some Hitchcock.Citizen Kane, It's A Wonderful Life, and Casablanca sat embarrassingly on my watchlist. So did a litany of great classic films.My journey to fill this void has been an exciting one.It's a Wonderful Life is a great film for those who haven't given classic film a chance. It doesn't overstay it's welcome. The production values are strong, and the story is a template for many of today's films. Seriously, I can name 500 films from the last 2 decades that use this story/life-lesson, but I can't name one that does it quite as effectively as it's done here.It's a film that is practically impossible to dislike.James Stewart is fantastic, and many of the characters in the film teach us life lessons, not just the lead. Words like integrity, generosity, and sacrifice take on a whole new meaning.The film doesn't really have the holiday vibe I was expecting until the last 40 minutes. The holiday season is nothing more than a platform to remind us of all that is important in life. That aspect of the film surprised me.Good guys don't finish last. Why? Because when they're down, there's always someone there to pick them up.I can see all the reasons why there are those like me that shy(d) away from Classic film. You have to take some of the customs of the day and the production stuff with a grain of salt and get past it. Or better yet, understand it. If you do - you'll find what's underneath to be fantastic. A week before the release of ""The Hobbit"", I think it's important to remember that as much care or more went into productions like this back in the day.Now, I get all the references to this film that I missed over the last 40 years. I see the shots of the town and the snow that will forever be etched into my mind. It's amazing how all those ""production and technology"" issues from the time yield more memorable moments and shots than just about anything you'll see at the theater today.This is a fantastic movie. 95/100",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Essential Frank Capra,"This film more than any other is the reason we still hear Frank Capra as a famous film name. In recent years it has become a Christmas movie on NBC & the exposure at the network level has given this movie the type of fame enjoyed by The Wizard of Oz.It deserves the accolades too. Not only is this a great script with great Direction, but Jimmy Stewart is excellent & uniquely cast in the role as the hero. This film shows how good an actor he is. This film might just be the reason Stewart got the attention of Alfred Hitchcock which would lead to Rope, Rear Window, & Vertigo. It wasn't that Stewart was chopped liver before this film, but the way he carries it is a great acting job. Capra-Stewart just seemed to have the right chemistry together as they had already combined in some other roles too. It is interesting that Stewart was so good that he would work with nearly every great director of this era before he was done.Donna Reed has her best movie screen role here too. The script is just a wonder of all time. Capra seems to always get a hold of unique & powerful scripts & this one is no exception to that. Granted Mr Smith Goes To Washington & You Can't Take It With You are good scripts too, but this is the one which still invades the National stage most often today.This film rates a bravo from start to finish & may never go out of style. It is indeed a classic.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

More than Merely a Christmas Film – A Film for Any Time,"Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has become a staple of the Christmas season. It will invariably be played around the holidays, whether broadcast on T.V or picked out by a family from their DVD collection. But watching it again this year, I realized just how little it has to do with Christmas. To be sure, the famous final sequence takes place around then, but the full film is a broader celebration of life, humanity, and the human spirit. Confining it to simply a glorification of the Christmas spirit seems too narrow.Through the story of the life of George Bailey and the lives of those around him, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" celebrates basic human kindness and compassion. It praises selflessness and putting others above oneself, as George does time and time again – forsaking his dreams for the betterment of those more unfortunate than he in Bedford Falls. It condemns greed, heartlessness, and fierce manipulation of fellow persons on Earth through Henry F. Potter, the shriveled and devious old businessman played to malicious perfection by Lionel Barrymore. It extols the worth of the life of any living being, no matter how poor or pitiful they appear and whatever their flaws may be. Consider the way George extends a caring hand to his dearly daffy Uncle Billy or to Violet Bick when she has fallen on hard times. Think of what he saves them both from when he could have easily cast them aside on account of their vices and imperfections, turning them away.Are these values appropriate for Christmas? Yes, of course. But they are just as appropriate for any time. Calling this ""a Christmas film"" somewhat underestimates the power of its themes, themes that are ageless and universal (or so I would hope). This is a film that deserves to be kept in the heart all the year round.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Film!,"""Each man's life touches so many other lives."" ~ Clarence Oddbody, AS2I believe ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is a favorite of many. It is certainly a favorite of mine. James Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is, well, wonderful, and one of his very best performances. Lionel Barrymore is perfection as Mr. Potter, the richest and meanest man in town. Donna Reed is darling as George Bailey's beloved wife, Mary. And Henry Travers is charming and adorable as Clarence Oddbody, AS2 (Angel Second Class).In the spirit of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol"", this is the story of a man who gets a rare glimpse of what the world would be like if he never existed. Through the magic of Frank Capra, we take a glorious ride with Clarence, a guardian angel who has yet to earn his wings. In answer to many prayers from the folks of Bedford Falls, Clarence is assigned to help George Bailey, the town's hero, in his darkest hour.George Bailey is a man who has positively impacted many people's lives by putting the needs of others ahead of his own; but still, he has regrets. After giving up his own career aspirations, he steps into his late father's role of running the small Building and Loan business in order to continue his father's good work to help the folks of Bedford Falls and keep it out of Potter's greedy hands. He settles down and marries his childhood sweetheart and raises a family in the same small town despite his dream to travel the world and become an architect.Mr. Potter, the heartless villain in the story, tries everything in his power to take down George Bailey and the rinky-dink Building and Loan Company. George manages to keep the company afloat, even using his own money at times, and continues to be loyal to the people of Bedford Falls - who depend on him for a chance to own their own homes. But one fateful day, $8,000 accidentally goes missing from the Building and Loan and George fears the scandal will take them down after all. Distraught and defeated, George contemplates suicide, believing he is worth more dead than alive. Enter Clarence, the gentle and child-like guardian angel, who shows George the way.The sentiment in this movie is overwhelming and if it does not tug at your heart, you are not human. In classic Capra style, this film offers lessons in patience and perseverance, selflessness and self-respect, loyalty and compassion and faith and forgiveness. This movie is a magical journey of pure love.Even though I have seen this film many times over, I still watch it every Christmas. It is one of my essentials.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Hands down, nothing beats watching film to me, it's a beautifully crafted piece that was shot and acted brilliantly, and even though this film is shot in black and white it doesn't feel dated to me; it feels completely timeless still to this day. The message is both simple, yet extremely effective, as George Bailey learns the true meaning of life and the gift that living a life is. And I've always loved a film that has talky voice in it, y'know those old Hollywood picture voices that everyone seemed to have between 1920 to 1969. I just love it.

A Feel Good Classic,I rewatch this every few years around Christmastime and it's still a timeless classic to me about knowing and realizing one's self worth when shown through the lens of a stranger. It's also interesting to see how other films such as Back to the Future II derived some of its centralized plot points from this classic too about showcasing an alternate reality and such. The acting too from James Stewart was phenomenal too a times bringing to life a character who goes from top of the world to bottom of the barrel and it has such a heartwarming ending that gets me choked up every single damn time I watch it as it allows me to at least have restoration in my faith in humanity for at least a little while. And by a little while I mean 5 minutes tops. Overall if you haven't seen this classic I highly recommend it. I just watched it with the lady and it was her first viewing so it's never too late to help an angel get it's wings. Or a demon get its wings. Same concept.

It Truly Is A Wonderful Life,"In 1946, America, and the rest of the world for that matter, had just witnessed and won the most destructive war in mankind's history. They were trying to rebuild their lives from this and the Great Depression as well and as such, Hollywood got into the act by producing a number of movies that instilled hope in their audiences. Perhaps the greatest of these movies is Frank Capra's timeless film ""Its A Wonderful Life"" staring the late, great James Stewart as everyday man George Bailey in small town America, Bedford Falls. George has spent his entire life in Bedford Falls, longing to see the outside world but never able to get past the confines of the small savings and loans that he is in charge of. Then, one Christmas Eve, George's Uncle, Billy (played by the memorable character actor Thomas Mitchell) makes a terrible mistake that could ruin them both forever and George begins to think that everything would be better without him. It just so happens that heaven hears his and others' prays and sends an angel named Clarence (played by the understated but talented Henry Travers) to show him how wrong he is. In a Scrooge like role, we also have the great Lionel Barrymore in an excellent performance of Henry Potter, ""the richest and meanest man in town"" and in her most famous role, Donna Reed as George's loving and devoted wife. This is a movie that will make you laugh, maybe make you cry, and leave you with a sense that no matter how bad things get, there is always hope. ""Its A Wonderful Life"" is by far the greatest Christmas movie that has ever been produced and for that matter, will ever have been produced due to the time that it was made in and its message of how we all affect our fellow man, often times without even realizing it. So, I urge you to watch this movie and take in its message of hope and also, remember, no man is a failure as long as he has friends. 10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's Wonderful Tripe,"This is Hollywood saccharine at its most deadly.
Jimmy Stewart is the bumbling owner/manager of the local hick town's
Savings & Loan but his grasp of economics is so feable only a country of dirt farmers and unemployed laborers who think FDR was some kind of genius would buy this drivel. I was actually surprised to learn that upon release, movie-goers were wise enough to reject this movie. Only to see it revived for audiences decades later when it became part of the public domain so TV station could show it for free. Come to think of it, that explains everything - the movie sorta rests on a ''free sh^t for everyone"" theme so why shouldn't it have grown popular by being a feel-good movie families watched for free on TV at Christmas while the local TV station padded its bottom line at virtually zero cost to them.
The bank owner played by Barrymore is so broadly brushed as an evil capitalist I'm surprised Capra didn't get hauled in front of HUAC or Sen. McCarthy.
The first 2/3 of the movie where Stewart stumbles from one misfortune to another is so turgidly paced and insipidly acted I couldn't wait for him to, um, do something about it. The final 1/3 with the Ghost of Christmas Past shtick wasn't terribly fresh or interesting, either.

Classic,"Nothing brings a hazy tear to the eye like the dulcet black and white tones of Its A Wonderful Life, starring endearing adult cherub Jimmy Stewart as the ultimate Everyman, a guy so personally beaten down that he sees no way out of the snowdrift of holiday blues that he's left stranded in. I haven't seen the film since I was a wee youngin', but here's what I remember, in images and impressions: Stewart plays George Bailey, a kindly man who's spent his life looking out for others and putting his livelihood on the line to,help those who are less fortunate. The man is a walking ode to the meaning of Christmas, but when a financial disaster ruins his outlook on life, he contemplates suicide. A compassionate angel named Clarence won't have any of it though, coming to his rescue in a sequence that's now immortalized in cinematic Valhalla.

Too much sediment,"There is simply too much sediment associated with this awful film. Because ""It's a Wonderful life"" is looped 24 hours a day for three weeks prior and post Christmas people feel obligated to give this awful movie a high rating. Due to this films close association with Christmas I can only assume that people would feel guilty to call this film what it really is, BAD. Personally I feel that ""It's a Wonderful life"" has not stood up to the test of time and is a tacky film fit for the 40's and only the 40's. The acting is not incredibly impressive since the roles are practically made from character cookie cutters, the cinematography is simple and is not even creative for its time, and the plot is not creative or interesting since sci-fi had already covered time travel and ""what if"" situations by 1946. Therefore I feel that people should stop defending this garbage called a movie, in the name of religion and tradition. Due to situations like this not enough pressure is put on the movie industry to create decent films.

The meaning of life and of Xmas,"This is one of my favorite movies ever and definitely my favorite Christmas movie ever. Although I'm not American, this was part of my upbringing, and it was shown on TV every Christmas, it still does.This is, foremost, a great movie, with a great direction, a great story, great performances, great tempo and atmosphere, a glorious BW and a classic old glamour Hollywood melodrama. It is of course, very sentimental, but also very philosophical.I love James Steward. He was the quintessential good charming actor able to convey goodness with his mere presence; he becomes his character here in a heartfelt performance. Yet, this is a choral movie in which everybody shines and everybody seems to be doing the same. I have always had a weakness for Henry Travers, who plays Clarence, but everybody is great and believable in their respective roles.This is a movie about despair, that reminds us that, even in our darkest moments, there is always something or somebody that will help us if we allow ourselves to be helped.This is a movie about being mindful about what we wish for, and about what comes from our mouth, about being grateful about what we have and not taking it for granted.This is a movie about the power of family and community, and about the power of being a good human being and how goodness, our goodness, impacts other people in ways that aren't always evident to us.This is a movie about the value of leading your life in an ethical way, because when you do, people notice, and respect comes by the hand.Finally, this is a movie about the spirit of Christmas. These days the festivities have become part of frenzy of empty consumerism, lack of empathy for the poor, and another holiday. However, when I watch this movie it brings me memories of my childhood when Christmas was a magic period despite my family not having many means. Probably because of what Christmas has become today, I find it more relevant for the new generations. It has all the magic and values that I would like my children, if I had any, to grow up with.The movie is very sentimental, of course. It never fails to move me. But it is not cheap sentimentalism. It digs into what the meaning of life is, and comes up with an answer that surprises because it is obvious and we have it in front of us every single day.Unforgettable.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Beauty, goodness and truth make a masterpiece","I remember crying first time I saw It's a Wonderful Life. I remember crying n-th time when I saw It's a Wonderful Life. The only movie that made me and makes me cry, not because it's sad but because it's wonderful, is this movie. Every now and than when I'm feeling anxious or depressed I turn to the final scene of this wonderful movie only to remind myself of what in this short life really matters. People around us, friends and community, give value to our life. Every life matters because everyone has something unique to share with this world. If I were never born, world would be ripped off something unique. We have to learn how to appreciate everything that has been granted to us, even the most little things.Those were lessons It's a Wonderful Life thought me and reminds me every time I see it. Every movie which is somehow able to make you a better person deserves a ten. That's the whole point of art. Art is not a purpose in itself, but is an instrument which aims to help us better understand ourselves and the world around us. Real art can't be separated from goodness and truth. No matter how technically brilliant a piece of art may be, it still serves no purpose if it drags us away from truth. And if it has capacity to make us better as man, then it's rightfully called a piece of art. I think It's a Wonderful Life does exactly that: in a subtle and heartwarming way makes you a better man by telling you something about this world and that is that this world needs you and that in long term makes sense to fight for it.Given that, I'm not going to write anything about acting, directing or similar. Those technical skills from my standpoint are now not worth analyzing even though all of those are really good (five Oscar nominations, including best movie and best director). What matters are values and heartwarming atmosphere. I'm going to conclude with the following remark: ordinary people are very often very extraordinary.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Wise Words from C.P.A,I liked this movie a lot mainly because it had a bit of everything. It was fun because of the way the story was well made. And the music helped tie all the scenes together well. There was ad moments that were definitely shown and expressed really well. There's also very serious moments that were really well executed on the actors' part. And my favorite would have to be how funny this movie was. At moments it really caught me off guard and I think that helped increase how funny it was. And I liked the set up of this movie because of the homey vibe it gave off. And last but not least I just really liked how all the characters were different and all had a different way of tying everything together in the story. I liked this movie all together and I can't think of anything bad to say about it.,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Simply a Classic,"This is one of my all-time favorite movies. I watch it with my family every Christmas and still feel all the feels. It has a wonderful message and it really makes you think twice about all the things in your life that are there for your happiness. The dance scene with the swimming pool makes me laugh every single time. Jimmy is also the greatest. I am a huge fan of this actor because he brings something different to every role he plays. And his George Bailey is phenomenal. Potter is one of the best villains. I seriously can't stand the guy, so I guess he did his job well.

"Beautiful, timeless, heartfelt classic","I've no great culture of the movies of that time, but I'm sure I appreciated it just as much as the next person did during 1946 when this came out. This is a timeless, beautiful film that touches the heart in a way rare for any kind of cinematic production. Everything is perfectly constructed, thought out and executed - from the the very first scene and buildup to the ending, an emotinal climax in intensity and emotion I've almost never felt in any other piece. This is what I would call a ""perfect film"", in that it accomplishes everything it sets out to do, and what it sets out to do is of the utmost ambition. This is, in every little detail, a magnificent masterpiece, like a modern tale that never leaves you. From its criticism of the evil ways of greedy men, its depiction of the little guy against the oppressing giant theme, the importance of the individual and the sacred nature of life, Donna Reed's natural, authentic beauty in this film... this is precious, precious cinema like it seldom ever exists.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Frank Capra's favorite, James Stewart's favorite, Jim Henson's. Who am I to dislike it?","No doubt about it that Frank Capra was one of the best directors of all time and James Stewart was one of the best actors of all time, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that this is also one great movie to watch.This movie always on a lot of top-lists and many well known and respected film-makers consider this to be one of their favorite movies, including director Frank Capra and actor James Stewart themselves. And really, it's not all that hard to see why. No, I won't call it one of the best movies of all time but its themes, the characters, the story and its message make sure that this is a movie to enjoy, over and over again.Basically it's being a very warm, heartfelt and honest movie, about real characters in real life situations. The James Stewart character feels very humane and realistic and James Stewart was always a great choice for playing a sort of average Joe, everybody in the audience could relate and identify themselves with. It's also part of the reason why his character is often being voted one of the best out of movie history.It's sort of funny how this movie has grown into being a sort of a Christmas classic, while about two-thirds of the movie are totally not Christmas related at all. It isn't until it last 30 minutes or so that the movie is suddenly all about Christmas and its themes and messages of giving and sharing with each other. It's definitely showing some parallels to Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol'. It's what makes the movie a very warm one, even though the movie itself remains a drama and a quite heavy one as well.The story itself is just great. It's really typical for its time, with all of its drama and developments but with a great twist to it as well. The movie has a fantasy theme in it, which is not typical for its time or genre at all. It perhaps even makes this movie feel a bit like a 'modern' fairytale. Needless to say, it makes the movie a very original one within its genre and its where the movie gets most of its charm and warmth from.The movie is really a great example of some fine film-making and wonderful storytelling. It shows once more that you don't need all that much to create an unforgettable movie, that has an impact on a lot of people, even now days. The movie is about simple little things in life and perhaps that's the movie its greatest power. Everybody can relate to it, which causes them to be easily touched by the movie its themes and messages as well.Big part of the reason why it all works out so well is James Stewart but you also need to give credit to some of the other actors as well. I for instance, also really liked Lionel Barrymore in this, as the villain. I'm normally a not too big fan of Lionel Barrymore, or any of the other old Barrymore's (John and Ethel) but I must say he was perfectly cast in this movie, as the tough, old, mean Mr. Potter.Basically a wonderful made, simple, honest, heartfelt movie, with some great, effective and timeless themes in it, which all ensures that this is a perfect movie to watch over and over again.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Meet Clarence - An Angel With A Personal Agenda,"You know, at first I thought that this 1947 picture was a heart-felt story about good, old George Bailey and how he was driven (through certain escalating circumstance) to the absolute brink of desperation on Xmas eve.But, I now realize that this film's Christian-driven story-line was actually all about a calculating angel named Clarence who wanted to earn his wings. And so - With that agenda in mind - Clarence is sent down from heaven in order to assist George Bailey. And if he does so this will put him in favour with god and allow him to earn his wings.So, in other words - Clarence helping George has nothing to do with any apparent kindness, charity, or good will towards man - No. It doesn't - It's all just a selfish, self-serving act on Clarence's part to earn those wings that he covets so much.And so - With that in mind - I think that this covetous scenario reduces this manipulative, little tear-jerker to the slimy level of showing us all just how hypocritical and pretentious angels really are.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Years Later, It's A Wonderful Life Continues to be a Reassuring Holiday Spectacle!","What Christmas needs is schmaltz and snow and Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life has both by the hamper full.Set in Bedford Falls, New York, the movie follows common man George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), who after getting married to his childhood sweetheart Mary (Donna Reed) takes over the management of the building and loan association in his hometown that acts as a charity organization. He tries hard to buck a local Scrooge – evil rival banker Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore), who never misses a chance to jockey him into a position where he could be dealt misery. However, all his troubles come to a head as his mortgage company is plunged into financial crisis, after being broken on the wheel of capitalism. Prodded by failure, incompetence and deceit, our hero is soon brought to despair by fate and the machinations of Mr Potter and teeters on the edge of sanity one snowy Christmas Eve. It is then that George, in a moment of weakness, wishes he was never born. A genial, bumbling 292-year-old wingless angel from heaven, named Clarence (Henry Travers), who is assigned to watch out for him, grants that wish. In the fantastic events that follow, George is brought to a realization of how much his apparently aimless existence has meant to others and shows him the futility of feeling futile.What is remarkable about 'It's a Wonderful Life' is how well it holds up over the years. It has a simple message told elegantly, intelligently and with a whole lot of heart that never gets old. A socially responsible movie is entitled to the luxury of a heartfelt happy ending, especially if it has been earned! And this film so earns it! Capra's trick rests in the fulsome manner in which he allows a motion picture audience to share in the glory, investing the story with the tremendous heart that always stamps his offerings. This couldn't be other than a Capra picture, the humanness of its story the prevailing factor at every turn of situation. And essential to its extraordinary enduring power is the towering presence of James Stewart who with the supporting cast puts up an amazingly controlled performance, to give a simple but poignant script an unbending strength of character.All these carefully devised components make it an absolutely enduring classic which does not wear down even as decades go by. The movie that defined the term 'Capra-esque' - and cemented Stewart's position as Hollywood's favorite everyman - is the ultimate winter warmer.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
10/10,"It is simply the greatest American film ever made, beyond its earned status as the greatest Christmas film. It never ages, though it depicts a long ago small-town, which, remarkably, still exists in many places in the United States. The story is beautifully set up, from George Bailey's boyhood heroics in saving his younger brother to the final, magnificent scene of George's neighbors, friends, and family, showing the better angles of their nature - and the realization of how much George has meant to them, though he didn't realize it until it was too late. It is a kind of ghost story like Dickens ""A Christmas Carol,"" but far more layered, with a strong, passionate love story, endowed with warmth and beauty, and also a comedic film, a film noir film, an inspirational film - all contained within its magnificence. How was Capra able to pull it off? With first class attention to every detail - and, of course, a superb cast. James Stewart gives the best performance by an actor in sound film. He goes though more changes, from innocence and idealism, to maturity, to haunting despair, and, finally, elation. Name me another actor who could do all that. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" doesn't seem ""made"" as much as ""born"" - a miracle that has kept giving since 1946. And we needed it more in this year - 2023 - than ever before.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""I could never get past the title.""","So states Batman, who ironically embodies one of the central themes of this holiday classic: living in the service of others. Semi-esoteric way to start a review, but what can I say? ""Christmas with the Joker"" is the first time I ever heard of this film...Like Citizen Kane, It's a Wonderful Life ambitiously seeks to summarize the life of a man - or at the very least, a good portion of it - this time utilizing alternate realities. It's surprisingly dark, and it's also very organized. The acting is stellar, and characters are well-defined. I could see this film's message being interpreted in multiple ways; however you spin it, it's certainly philosophical without a shred of pretension.

A Christmas Classic That Everyone Loves!,"One of the best things to happen with It's A Wonderful Life is to fall out of copyright protection and enter the public domain. That meant any television studio could take the movie and play it essentially for free. It also was a bad thing because of the colorization process which took the film's magic away and was something director Frank Capra and star James Stewart opposed vehemently. At least I never lose that magic because I refuse to watch the adventures of George Bailey in color. But because the film was in public domain for nearly two decades, a forgotten film became popular. Popular enough where it became an annual Christmas tradition for many families. It was surprising to learn the film received mixed to negative reviews upon release. Today's general consensus has the picture as a sentimental, sweet-hearted film that delivers an important lesson or two...a sentiment I can certainly agree with. Think A Christmas Carol but in reverse. Even a grown man like myself can grow weepy to the contents of Capra's movie. Every...single...year.Capra did not set out to make this movie a Christmas flick. He was the golden boy in the director's circle during the 1930's with his social parables It Happened One Night and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington among others. He then went to serve in the war and was looking for a film upon return. He liked the film's themes as he felt it was appropriate for a time where people grieved lost ones from the war and atheism was becoming more popular, hence the spiritual tone. The story itself has been around for quite some time, and it has a local connection for me. People believe Bedford Falls took inspiration from Seneca Falls, New York. There is no proof of inspiration. Philip Van Doren Stern, who wrote the original story The Greatest Gift in 1939, always had Califon, New Jersey in mind. The bridge where Bailey contemplates suicide is eerily similar to the bridge in Califon. That town is only ten miles from where I grew up, so there is a connection I felt as it added to the magic.George Bailey (James Stewart) always gave his life to the people of Bedford Falls. He has always wanted to travel, but never could in order to protect his loan business and his community from the conniving hands of the evil Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore). On Christmas Eve, George's Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) accidentally misplaced a $8,000 deposit on his way to the bank. That means George is held responsible and will be blamed for the company's collapse and subsequent jail sentence. He feels like his wife (first role from Donna Reed), his children, and the town will be better off with him out of the picture. He goes to the bridge to end his life. Clarence (Henry Travers), a guardian angel trying to earn his wings, is sent down to help this poor man. He takes George on a trip to see what life would be like if he truly did not exist.James Stewart and Frank Capra previously collaborated on the political satire Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. They reunite for this inspirational drama. Stewart does occasionally go over-the-top but once Clarence comes into his play, I became more invested with his character. Stewart ends up doing an amazing job. Lionel Barrymore with his Scrooge mindset is excellent. Side note. How does his character get past the censors as he got away with robbery. Found that interesting. Donna Reed, in her first silver screen performance, delivers a memorable performance. It is all about James Stewart though. His final scenes are tremendous and enough to make any grown man cry.It's A Wonderful Life was not a popular movie upon release as it actually lost the studio money at the box office. It received some awards recognition, but it then became forgotten...until it was found. Once it became a part of the public domain, it instantly became the Christmas staple we know and love today. The film had some trouble during production as Capra was not looked highly upon by several key contributors (screenwriters, composer Dmitri Tiomkin), but that was overcome to make something truly special. If you are feeling down or in a similar position to George Bailey, take some inspiration. Your life is good and there are people who love you. It reminds me during my many tough times. A Christmas classic this is! Ain't need to say more.My Grade: A.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

When Mr. Potter offer to hire him with $20,000 per year, he almost fall for it because he weaks in money (he is young man , 27-28,married, making $45 a week, supporting his mother).

James Stewart's most brilliant performance...,"I think we could all relate better to ""It's A Wonderful Life"" if we lived in a Norman Rockwell type of world or small town where the George Baileys of America live. As it is, we have to take this slice of Americana as the real thing--and that's not always easy, given all the sentimentality on display here.Don't get me wrong. I like the film, but I think it has a kind of warm, cozy, cuddly look that becomes a bit saccarine and cloying by the time the film reaches its fairytale ending. It's impressively acted, photographed and scored and definitely contains one of James Stewart's most brilliant performances. He runs the gamut of emotions in close-ups that show the real genius of this actor. Behind him is a wonderful cast that is with him every step of the way. Donna Reed is especially appealing in one of her sweetest roles.But the Frank Capra/Norman Rockwell touch of small town lives gets a bit sticky at times--especially the falsity of the ending with everyone just opening their hearts to George Bailey. It's all a little too simplistic to swallow, like a pill that doesn't quite go down.It makes excellent family fare and will no doubt continue to be shown every Christmas--quite a tribute to a film that was not even a box-office hit when first released but did receive glowing reviews for James Stewart's performance in his and Capra's first post-war film. Despite its flaws, it has won the genuine love and respect of fans everywhere so let's leave it at that.I can't end this review without mentioning Henry Travers. His scenes with Stewart are the warmest, gentlest and wittiest ones in the whole movie. His Clarence, the Angel, makes the film the Christmas delight it is.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wonderful life and film!,"The film is full of delightful moments, from music and a dance sequence, funny comedy, and heart-warming romantic scenes. While, some critics might see this film as too sentimental and syrupy. In fact, in my view, most of the movie's vision is something out of a more modern complex, dark-edged sophisticated film. Yes, there are some really dated dialogue, sayings and behavior, but for the most part, I think modern audiences can still, watch this movie and find something about it, that they can related to. No matter how often, you get to see this Christmas favorite, there is always something timeless with this film, when you do. Important message about the value of an individual life and how one person's actions affect all those around him/her is a great life moral for people to take. Themes about family and friendship are also very important. Another great message is having faith, and belief in yourself and the future. After all, director Frank Capra himself said he made the film in large part to ""combat a modern trend towards atheism and Nihilism"". While, a lot of people say, that this movie isn't really a Christmas movie, due to the fact, that 90% of the movie is a story about George's life and takes place at some point in time other than Christmas; in my view, the whole Clarence arch, wouldn't had work as good as it did, on any other day of the year. There is something about Christmas, that makes the whole magically redemption story with Clarence somewhat believable. Based on the short story ""The Greatest Gift,"" by author Philip Van Doren Stern, It's a Wonderful Life was never intended to be the Christmastime staple that it is now. In fact, when the film was first released back in 1946, it was generally considered a box-office flop. This film had a resurgence for a while in the U. S. during the 1980s when it was discovered that the copyright on the film was never renewed, which meant the film was in the Public Domain and any television station could legally show it as often as they wanted without paying for a license. Many stations across the country would run it, around Christmas time, to the point, that people label it as a Christmas movie. No matter, if it's a holiday movie, or not. A lot of critics, has point out, that the film protagonist's action are very similar to a Christ figure in all. I have to say, they're somewhat right, but there were some moments that George Bailey got really problematic to sympathize with. Some people feel that brought all his problems on himself by choosing to run an over-leveraged, illiquid bank business even though he's given many opportunities to do something else. However, I didn't find it, too abrasive to watch. What I didn't like, is how he treat Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) for most of the film. He was a little too mean-spirited to her; mostly in the beginning of the film He nearly ruin his first date with her. I really didn't like that. Thank heavens, he got more likable, as the film goes on. Still, the drunk driving scene was a bit hard to watch. Anyways, Jimmy Stewart is wonderful as George. I'm glad, he didn't quit, acting after the war. He gives the performance of a lifetime, here. Alternately affable and bitter, he is the movie's little-man hero. All of his emotional were, mostly play as for real. Seeing this, Capra had to reframe the shot in order to get it closer than was actually filmed because he wanted to catch the expression on Stewart's face. At the time, this shot was an extremely time-consuming project, each frame had to be done individually, making it only one step away from stop-motion animation. Capra spent the whole night doing it.

I would say that this movie really did teach a life lesson about caring about life and what the actions and consequences could occur if something tragic or unexpected happened.

It is a movie that opens with a fantastical scene of a star, later revealed to be an angel, talking to a faceless God, the voice-over obvious, stilted in sweet humour, and immediately suggesting the film is going to be one that is too saccharine a pill to swallow. The thing is, beyond that, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the ultimate exercise in feel-good cinema, its virtue as such much parodied and referenced in TV and other films.The film presents George Bailey, played by James Stewart who would go on to refer to the film as his own favourite, who stifles his lifelong dreams of travelling and discovery in order to save and run his father's Building And Loan Association. It has long been responsible for the affordable housing in his hometown Bedford Falls and he cannot see it lost to the scoundrel of the piece, Henry F. Potter, who is a major shareholder in the Building And Loan and the only man residents could otherwise turn to. After a run at the bank leaves the Building And Loan on the brink of financial ruin, and George's Uncle Billy misplaces $8000, in an act of desperation he attempts suicide, at which time he is saved by the angel Clarence. Understandably confused, he wishes he had never been born, and so his wish is granted.If the plot seems familiar even though you have not seen ""It's A Wonderful Life"", it is probably because you saw the idea loosely re-worked in the Nicolas Cage film ""The Family Man"". For all its up to date technique, its colour, modern setting, etc, this version could not capture what made the original.So, what did make the original? What could surprise people is how Capra clearly believed in the notion that you have to suffer the low to get the high. The second act of the movie gets really quite dark, with Bailey seeing what the world would be like without his birth, coming to understand just how important a person is to everybody else's existence, and bringing him to a full appreciation of his worth as a husband, father and friend. The finale is obviously that classic scene that we all know, even if we do not realise it, with his daughter's famous, ""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets its wings"", and despite how much you might think the whole thing sounds cheesy, silly, saccharine and sentimental, the power of the film is to bring a genuine tear of pure enjoyment to your eye regardless; for a while you are full of the joy of life and completely happy, no matter what.A lot of the film's success comes down to how believable James Stewart makes the plight, and for any flaws you may find with it, its colourful characters, its tremendous performances, humour, heartbreaking moments, perfectly pitched highs and lows, and its' unabashed final sequence make this an inexplicably perfect film.No wonder it remains at the top spot of many people's favourite Christmas films, and so it should.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Cynical & Feel Good Holiday Film,"I've seen It's a Wonderful Life quite a few times over the years and I still really enjoy it. Although my take on it has evolved over the years. My initial viewings had me respond as most viewers who like the film respond - as a positive affirmation of life and the positive significance one life can have on so many others. But as I've grown and seen more of life I can still view it that way but I also see it as a recriminating take on the average person, who without the strong inspiration, leadership, guidance, what have you, of someone else, their cynical, tribal, suspicious qualities can rise to the surface and create a very unpleasant class of people. I of course prefer to focus on the first and far more uplifting aspects and I still derive pleasure from It's a Wonderful Life.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Touched me deeply,"Now that's what you call a classic movie. The deep emotions and the role one can play in life is well expressed in one of the most wonderful ways. The angel is just symbolic of what if not. George Bailey- not a rich man economically but certainly emotionally and socially. What else one needs if one has friends is the central idea of the movie.

Capra's Masterpiece,"Every Christmas Eve, I watch this film with my dad. Before I can remember anything else, I remember this film. I used to be bored of it, and leave sometimes, but this is the first time I can truly appreciate what an amazing, inspiring, heartwarming and perfect film this is. Without a doubt, It's A Wonderful Life is Frank Capra's masterpiece, and one of the best films of all time.In one of his most iconic roles, Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey, a noble man living in Bedford Falls. After an intro that already leaves you choked up, we see an otherworldly conversation in which Joseph sends Clarence, an AS-II, to help George, who is ""contemplating throwing away God's greatest gift"". From there, we see George grow up, seeing his dreams pushed aside to help the town face the greedy Mr. Potter. Eventually, we catch up to Christmas Eve, where one of the greatest scenes in film takes place- only to be followed by another. It is a dark film, but ends with the most uplifting message ever told convincingly on the screen.Everything about the film is perfect (except for 3 cuts). The acting, and the characters, are top notch. George Bailey is one of the most likable, developed characters of all time. He is a selfless man who puts the people first. As Clarence says, ""I like George Bailey."" I wish there were more George Baileys in the world. His wife, Mary (Donna Reed) is much like him- kind and gentle. Together, they're one of the classic screen couples, and we feel for them. The dinner scene in the abandoned house, and their first scene on the dance floor; it's... wonderful.One of cinema's great villains, Lionel Barrymore's Henry F. Potter is the personification of greed. He has no family and no need for money, but he needs more power and tries snatching it away from the Baileys for the entire film. He is a completely realized character. The film also has a great supporting cast- Sam, the one who did achieve his dreams, Violet, the head turner, Uncle Billy and Harry... everyone brings this film together.The location is a character itself. Bedford Falls, the fictional (New York?) town, is the backdrop of Georges adventure: he wants to leave, but can't shake the town. The strip, Bailey Park, Martini's and the bridge, it's a fully fledged town created on a set.Truly great films use every shot to show something, and It's A Wonderful Life is a part of that club. Mostly little things that you can't remember, but every scene, every shot, benefits the viewer. We learn a little thing about George, a little about the town, a little foreshadowing, this quality separates great films from fantastic films.Many films try to inspire, but this one puts all others to shame. For two hours, we build up, seeing why this good man is in a terrible situation, and then he is taught a divine lesson, and then you cry for a while as he understands the lesson and viewers wish to become better people- more like George Bailey. That's a factor you can't describe in writing, and the major reason this film is played every year. No matter who you are or what you believe, you can take something good away from this film.You can call this a Christmas film, and it feels great watching it in season, but It's A Wonderful Life is timeless. The greatest actors, the greatest story, the greatest message- if you haven't seen this film you have to.""To my big brother George, the richest man in town."" -Harry Bailey 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Good guy, George Bailey, explores what the world would be like if he never existed.","Revisit the classic Christmas tale: It's a Wonderful Life. This film earns a rating by offering all the traits and qualities of a great movie: humor is scattered throughout, love and affection are central to the theme of service and generosity, and the fulfillment of adventure is pleasantly summarized in the clever ending.George Bailey, from the beginning, is one of the unsung heroes that makes America great. His life seems to be solely dedicated to the service of others. George has a passion for travel and has big plans for the future. Early on, Mary Hatch develops an infatuation for George, and they soon fall in love and get married. George assumes control of the family business, Bailey Building and Loan. The business brings financial turmoil that puts George in a very tricky situation.It's a Wonderful Life incorporates clever humor at even intervals to keep the audience engaged throughout the film. George's honeymoon demonstrates wit interwoven into the story line. Slapstick comedy fits only a select group of films, but Director Frank Capra manages to seamlessly utilize this humor strategy along with several others. Scattered throughout the movie are iconic scenes. Perhaps the most popular, George offers to lasso the moon as a romantic gesture. The Prom Pool Party also builds catches our attention by showing George's spontaneous and contagious personality. After the gym floor divides and reveals a pool, George and Mary fall in and continue dancing. James Stewart's performance shines as he portrays local business man, George Bailey. Mr. Bailey's arguments with Mr. Potter highlight Stewart's command of the screen. Other stars, like Donna Reed, also demonstrate a mastery of acting. George's visit to Mary's home accentuates Reed's performance.The magic of Frank Capra's film is its ability to corral the better nature of mankind and instill a desire to be a better person. James Stewart's character demonstrates selflessness and community centered focus. All audiences can draw inspiration to become a better person from watching the feel-good ending. Although the theme and acting excel in this film, the time line is a little confusing. The first half hour explains George's life from childhood to adulthood, but the last hour covers a little less than a week. Watching It's a Wonderful Life in preparation of the Christmas season is a tradition for families across the nation. Its vast popularity is largely due to its ability to inspire kindness, service, and generosity in the name of Christmas. The only Christmas story more cherished is the story of Christmas itself.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The way to have a successful life is to help others, the helpless and needy.James Stewart is perfect as George Bailey, and is one of his finest non Hitchcock Perfromances.

"When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?","Voted as the ""Most Powerful Movie of All Time"" by the American Film Institute in 2006, Capra's masterpiece now seems redeemed once and for all after it had been considered a major disappointment at the box office back when it was released. Due to a clerical error (or should we better choose to say, divine intervention?) the film even went into public domain, and well, now that it can be shown by every station on the planet it has turned into the ultimate Christmas classic, all ages aboard. The picture might look a tad dated in parts, but on the other hand this is exactly what embeds this fantastic journey even better between fairy-tale and harsh reality. And thus it hits home when it is holiday season again, the Christmas tree is being decorated and the smell of ginger bread hangs in the air.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is about standing up for the community, for principles, for family and friends, for those things that are important in life. Now that all might sound commonplace, but every now and then we need a serious reminder, so it might as well be in the Christmas season. The movie builds up magnificently to its final third, when everything goes downhill at the same time, and America's most favorite son-in-law James Stewart as George Bailey finally loses it. At this moment an already great character-driven movie turns magical when all threads come together and lead up to a breathtaking finale one isn't likely to get tired of. The climax is engaging, uplifting, heart-warming, and the all around great photography further enhances the effect. I can't say if Jimmy Stewart got his wings with this one, and he's probably already immortal anyway for many a reason. For sure he got his place in the audience's hearts with the film, and someone up there gave us the chance to revisit his struggle every year and teach us that after all one's better off being alive. Just remember: When a man isn't around he leaves an awful hole, isn't he?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes...","Notes from my recent intro, I have five favorite scenes: the shared phone call; the hat tipping rainwater in the doorway; the prayer at the bar; when snow starts falling again on the bridge and the brother toast in the closing scene. IAWL partially succeeds because of its small town charm and values. James Stewart was from a small town -- Indiana, Pennsylvania (now his museum needs a Capra miracle). You may not know this but Stewart was a real WWII hero, enlisting as a private in 1941. He flew over 20 missions and when he finally retired from the reserves it was as a brigadier general. (true story) Frank Capra was from a small town, Bisacquino, Sicily and during WWII he made a series of films called, Why We Fight. And on a personal note, Frank Capra is my favorite director because his movies inspire me. Back in the 1980's I used to write him and call him on our birthdays to chat. Donna Reed in real life was an Iowa farm girl. She sweetens the film and is lovely, innocent and pure representing both Stewarts reward and proof that he made the right choice. Trivia: ""The Greatest Gift"" story did not sell so the author Philip Van Doren Stern had copies printed and included them in the Christmas cards he sent out in 1943. Just like The Wizard Of Oz, IAWL did not cover its high cost upon its original release and was deemed a box office flop. And although Oscar nominated for Best Film, Director and Star it received no Academy Awards. Frank Capra wrote in his autobiography that he closed his book on the film. He thought his dream was over But something had happened, fans found the film and wrote to him, mostly praising some complaining but they kept writing. Decades later he was still answering letters, but the studio forgot about the film and it fell into public domain. In the 1970s, hundreds of TV stations started to play it every holiday season because they did not have to pay royalties. And so people had the chance to see it more than once and with repeated viewings word of mouth began to build and spread. But I'm here to tell you it's not the only one. There are dozens, no make that hundreds of films nearly this good just waiting to be discovered. I'll toss out a few titles: MEET JOHN DOE; YOU CAN'T TAKE IT WITH YOU; MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON; LOST HORIZON and MR. DEEDS GOES TO TOWN. Anybody know who directed those masterpieces? I have a hand written letter I got back in the 1980s that reads,""Dear Larry, Frank Capra was a fine director with high ideals who was able to put them up on the big screen without preaching. Sincerely, James Stewart."" Well find some friends & family to watch it with you and then sit back for some fun, and enjoy this gift from Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart. Or better yet, see it the way they meant for it to be shared, on THE BIG SCREEN just before Christmas. And one last thing, I am sure they would want me to wish you  be sure to have a Wonderful Life!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Our Christmas Day treat,"We have a list of Christmas movies we watch every year during the season, winding up with Holiday Inn two days before Christmas, White Christmas on Christmas Eve, and A Christmas Story and It's a Wonderful Life on Christmas Day.Watching the special features on a DVD or Bluray of this movie unlocks a lot of interesting information, such as the fact that George Bailey running down Main Street in the ""snow"" happened during the summer in a heat wave. That when Ellen Corby asks for $17.50, it was an ad lib Frank Capra asked her to provide to surprise Jimmy Stewart, and his kiss on her check was an ad lib in response.I hope each of us may have a little George Bailey in them. It's not a mistake to sometimes put others first to make their lives and the world around us a better place.Merry Christmas and have a wonderful 2023!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A timeless Christmas staple! A triumph of the human spirit with a story that encompasses multiple layers. A classic that just improves with age.,"What a wonderful movie this is! Its a Wonderful Life is everything a christmas flick could possibly offer and then some. Its tinged with a delightful hint of fantasy that comes heavily into focus at the beginning and end of this movie. I'll explain the majority of the themes that play a major role before sharing what I loved best about it.The story is multi-layered and very well scripted. It doesn't dawdle on one scene for too long and alot of little details that become crucial plot points later come early but are not easy to miss. Its very easy to follow. The main themes involve: following your dreams, camaraderie in the community, honesty and values, wishing, rich vs. Poor, the worth of one's life, appreciation for what you have over what you don't have. Honestly there are ALOT. Bells also play a big part in this movie in many instances.So what I loved about it? Everything everyone else probably does. James Stewart as George Bailey is the everyman we all see in ourselves. A big dreamer with an even bigger heart, but somehow he's not convinced of his worth to himself and others and needs a little extra help to literally see the light. Its a spot on and flawless performance by Stewart with a splendid supporting cast surrounding him.The big turning point of the movie comes when Christmas Eve comes rolling around which is why this is a perfect movie for the Christmas holidays. Its uplifiting, disarming and honestly puts you in a good mood and ready for that time of the season. The end scene can absolutely bring you to tears.Yet another Frank Capra masterpiece among his masterpieces. I love his movies. Sooooo good. He knew the kind of movies that encapsulate what it is to be human. It's a Wonderful Life is an ageless marvel. A must-see! A very deserving 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Most human movie ever,"This movie is not easy to watch. Al least that was my experience. At first I saw it on TV long time ago and mostly paid attention to the snowy, Christmassy atmosphere. Then one year I got caught into really watching it and it was the first time I understood it. Or at least I thought so. Then I watched it with the people I care about and it was a shared experience and I felt a bit bad for the tears, mine and thr other person's. Because having a closed heart can provide the illusion of safety, and movies that open those gates are, well, an intimate thing, as well as a risky one. You may feel again things that took an effort to set aside, in a protective move. Then there was a time I would avoid seeing it at Christmas, and someone else insisted. But no, I did not want to go there anymore, thinking about humanity in sad, yet kind and blisfull terms. Or perhaps not thinking, feeling... The most recent time I watched it, I saw new things. It seemed to me the movie has Easter Eggs here and there, also the main character story, I just understood it differently. It is about a man (it can be a woman, just anybody in fact, the story is just a ""guide""), who lives his life while dreaming of living a different one. He has a job, family and children and he has to fight some really evil type of a man, runs into trouble and just wishes he was never born to begin with. For him, the life he lead was plan B, anyways. Surely, he got attached to it, but his dreams were so different! And then he gets the chance to see why things were the way they were, why it was so important for him to live this plan B life. Watch the movie. You might find it helps, if only by reminding us what being human may be all about.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
You can't always get what you want.,"My Rating : 9/10'George Bailey, I'm going to love you 'til the day I die,' whispers an adolescent Mary (Donna Reed) into George's (Jimmy Stewart) one deaf ear. Her words echo through time, imbuing the film with a sense of predestination. It's a good thing that George can't hear Mary, because he'd probably tell her to take a hike; he has other plans and none of them can be carried out in Bedford Falls. George wants to see the world: 'I...I want to do something big, something important,' he insists. Herein lies the conundrum of 'It's A Wonderful Life', which explains why the film wasn't popular when it was released. Though the luminous - and often sentimental- spiritual center of the film is the power of courage and friendship to surmount any obstacle, it is a dark film. What lingers even after George looks at how empty the life of his town, and his family, would have been had he never existed is the fact that George wanted more out of life, but fate always got in the way. Ironically, because of problems with the film's initial copyright, the movie fell into the public domain, and ultimately became extremely popular through repeated viewings. Having the film fall into the public domain seems like an act of grace performed by Clarence himself. Had we not had the opportunity to see it again and again . we would missed the indelible power of this film. Every event in the movie - George's rescue of his brother from drowning, his discovery of the poisoned medicine, his terrible disappointments about not being able to leave Bedford Falls - and the depth of his love for Mary speak of something fundamental, something true abut life. Like a great fable, it resonates with our feelings about living in the world.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Wonderful Christmas classic,"I've watched movie hundreds of times and I love all of it. The message is clear. Most people don't appreciate what they have until its lost.George Bailey was no exception, he wanted so badly to leave Bedford Falls and go live his life, away from his small town. Instead he remains and helps keep the town alive and out of the hands of the evil Mr. Potter.The only thing that made me cringe was the age of James Stewart at the time of the filming, he was 38 yrs old! And here he is playing a 22 yr old big brother to his 18 yr old brother, Harry Bailey, who was actually 25 at the time. My pet-peeve.Its more than a mere Christmas movie, it brings to light all of the things we take for granted everyday!

If you and your family have money problems like George Bailey it's not the end of the world because you have each other. Your children are everything and that's the feeling i got from this film.

This is an entertaining Christmas classic that is an absolute must see,"It's a Wonderful Life (1946) is a movie I recently watched on Amazon Prime.

He will put his future at risk for the town but may destroy himself in process.This movie is directed by Frank Capra (Mr. Smith Goes to Washington) and stars James Stewart (Vertigo), Lionel Barrymore (Key Largo), Donna Reed (From Here to Eternity), Gloria Grahame (In a Lonely Place) and Henry Travers (The Invisible Man).The gym/pool dance sequence was a great opening.

So blissful.,"You have probably heard that It's a Wonderful Life is one of the happiest, most uplifting movies ever made. This is so true. I watched this film for the first time last night on Christmas Eve, 2007, and all I have to say is that, besides being close to tears when it was finished, it made me feel blissful. Now feeling happy is not too exciting, but this film made me feel absolutely cherry. It is the kind of movie that, were I to be abandoned on an island and I could only choose five movies, this would most certainly be one of them. The film is oddly scary in that it is truthful...not in the sense that angels will come down and make a man continue to live, but in the sense that is shows what would have happened had someone never lived in a fashion that is entirely realistic.It's a Wonderful Life is remarkable, if not life changing.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Powerful film in all rights,"In looking at this glorious Christmas classic, it's easy to get so involved in the psychology behind it. We obviously become so caught up in our own lives that we often forget about how others around us have influenced who we become and vice versa. This film, which has been redone in many different forms, including taking popular characters from TV shows, both daytime and nighttime and putting them in the same situation as Jimmy Stewart, truly stands the test of time. Not only is it watching one man's slow destruction from things that seem to be beyond his control, it's seeing how one person can deal with the ruthless machinations of the pure evil around him and open the eyes of everybody else to see what's really going on.In a return to the Christmas theme that he earlier used in 1941 classic ""Meet John Doe"", director Frank Capra saves the seasonal Twist of the story for the film's last half-hour. An unseen angel is sent to a small town to aid a possible suicide victim when the actions of the greedy and evil Lionel Barrymore threatens to send him to prison for embezzlement. Stewart's life is seen in flashbacks for much of the film, but when the film joins the present day, it is almost like it has gone some 70 years into the future to today with Barrymore representing the truly evil Scrooge like banker who wants to control everybody's life.It is quite a shocker to see Barrymore playing such a nasty, evil man after playing the kindly Dr. Gillespie in the series of MGM medical dramas. He is basically expanding the role of Scrooge which he did on radio for many years and adds an essence of true malevolence to his characterization. Even Scrooge wasn't as crass as his character here. It seems to be a continuation of the role that Edward Arnold played so beautifully in Capra's earlier films ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" and ""Meet John Doe"".The lovely Donna Reed crosses over from MGM ingenue to classy leading lady, adding much depth to her role of Stewart's girlfriend, later wife, with Beulah Bondi saintly as usual his lovable mother. (Bondi played Stewart's mother in so many films and on TV that it is obvious that somehow in real life, he did call her ma.) Then there's Gloria Grahame as the town flirt, Thomas Mitchell as Stewart's rascal uncle, and of course Henry Travers as Clarence, the angel who desperately wants his wings. The smaller roles are filled out by many familiar actors, some of whom were in pretty much every Capra film, as well as Danny Mummert and Larry Simms, both from the ""Blondie"" series and Karolyn Grimes, an underrated child star who stole many movie programmers in the mid-1940s.There are so many other things to credit for this film's excellence beyond the cast and direction, namely the brilliant script, fast pacing and brilliant production design. This film holds up regardless of whether you see it in its original black-and-white form or it's decently restored colorized version. I'm not in favor of colorizing classic movies, but somehow this one actually came out all right. While I watch this one every other year rather than every year, I can say that I am continuously touched and discover new seems in its that I had not seen before. It is no wonder that this is on nearlt everybody's list of the top Christmas movies of all time.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Timeless!,"I am a film lover from 'way back, having even served a stint as a newspaper movie critic. Entries in my personal list of Greatest Films of All Time include ""Fantasia,"" ""To Kill A Mockingbird,"" ""Casablanca,"" ""Singin' in the Rain,"" ""North by Northwest,"" and ""The Sound of Music. But sitting atop all of them, as undisputed champ, is ""It's a Wonderful Life.""I have seen it hundreds of times (dating back to, oh, when I was a teenager I suppose, and our local PBS station ran it as part of a pledge drive). I drive my wife and family to distraction when we watch it together because I quote all the dialogue along with the actors.I cry every time--and this is after viewing upon viewing--when Harry Bailey toasts his big brother George as ""...the richest man in town."" The emotions in that scene are so true and pure that I can't help but be affected by them.The performances are unparalleled. Stewart is brilliant as a small-town dreamer who loses and finds his way. His superlative acting abilities cause us to identify strongly with him (how many of us have lamented--even to ourselves--that no one seems to notice the sacrifices we've made?), which is, I think, why the movie bears up under so many repeat viewings. Reed is just lovely here, the epitome of sunny girlfriend, caring lover, devoted wife, dedicated mother.Capra's talent as a screenwriter are all over this script. He knows just how hard to tug the heartstrings without becoming overblown or phony. And his technical wizardry is evident too. I've never seen--before or since--more natural-looking on screen snow.Watching IAWL has become a tonic, a pick-me-up when I really need one--whether it's the Christmas season or not.

If only you do not think seriously about this film...,"I have heard a lot about this movie as a great holiday film. And as I am marathoning the top 250 list I decided to watch it.
At first I have to say, I am glad I have seen it in colour. It would be pain to watch otherwise.
Beginning is fine. It creates the fairy tale mood. And if you percive this way you might like it. But after the ""childhood part"" the movie wants you to see it as a serious piece, rather than the fairy tail. And it is first problem.
The movie is 2 hours 10 minutes long and the pace so sloooow. That is the second problem. The cut of 30-40 minutes could easily be made and actully benefit the movie. The set up for the movie is half movie long.... That is ridiculous.
The third problem is simple. The main character is stupid. He is not a romantic and not a good samaritan. He is an idiot. His phrases and his actions made me sick. Movie wants us to percieve him as a kind fellow, but he is just the idiot.
There is actual villain of the movie, where he should not have been. Another proof that it is not a drama, it is a fairy tale, that tries to be a drama. Why? And that is the forth problem. What is the point of the villain? A cartoonish villain. It serves for me as a proof, that the movie is a fairy tail. But for the film storyline he is pointless.
I really wanted to like this movie, but as further I have been watching the movie the more I disliked it.
Probably it is the most boring and stupid movie out 101 movies from top 250 list. It is not bad, but should not be in top list.
I will not give it 1 to lesser the list position, I will put honest raiting, but it is deffinetly low.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Embodies goodness,"This is one of the best films ever made. Somehow by divine providence, this gem got buried after its initial (and somehow unbelievably unsuccessful) run, and seemed doomed to be a lost Capra classic. But then it came into public domain and was revived by TV where it came into classic status as a beloved holiday film. Having seen it so many times, I almost forgot how good the acting, set design, and direction are. Look and you will see the subtleties crammed into every nook and cranny. The movements of the extras. The lived in feel of the town. The sidewalk walkers and animals roaming around. Everything breathes realism, yet the story is not one of stark realism, but of ideals.And therein lies the classic feel of this film. Capra wanted a quasi real town that showed the ideal community he wanted to live in. Filled with flawed and normal people who are tempted to fall, but who rise to the occasion and help each other out. They don't do this of their own accord. They are inspired to it by the protagonist, George Bailey. It is his self-sacrifice that brings out the best of them. And then they get to help him out in his hour of need. It makes for a story that brings tears to the eyes every time I watch it.This is one of those timeless classics that gets better with age. You feel like your putting on your favorite album you haven't heard in awhile or pulling out a photo album of happy memories you haven't seen in a few years. All of the actors fulfill their roles, from protagonist to extras. Great detail was put into the character relationships, making them seem like a real small town community where everyone knows each other. And they embody the goodness of man that, although tarred by sin, was put in there by God. If it's idealism is not completely realistic, it is nevertheless inspiring as the American town that we all wish we had grown up in. In that way, it is even relevant as a film of happy ideals during hard times. We need this kind of communal inter-dependency as we enter into dark times of 2017.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It's a Wonderful Life"": A Timeless Classic That Continues to Touch Hearts","Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" has rightfully earned its status as a holiday classic that has stood the test of time. This heartwarming story follows the life of George Bailey, a man who has always put the needs of others before his own. As he faces financial ruin and despair on Christmas Eve, an angel shows him how different life would have been if he had never been born.The film's enduring appeal lies in its ability to explore complex themes such as sacrifice, community, and the value of every life, all while maintaining a sense of whimsy and hope. James Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey is a masterclass in acting, conveying both the character's innate goodness and his moments of despair with equal skill.The film's themes of gratitude, family, and the importance of community are as relevant today as they were in 1946, and continue to resonate with audiences of all ages. The film's final scene, in which George is surrounded by his loved ones and the community he has helped build, is a testament to the power of love and selflessness.""It's a Wonderful Life"" remains a classic that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face and a warmth in your heart. Its timeless message of hope and perseverance in the face of adversity is just as relevant today as it was nearly 80 years ago. This film is a must-see for anyone who values the power of community and the importance of love and generosity.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Few movies stay fresh forever. It's a Wonderful Life is in a very exclusive club,"It's hard to review a movie such as this. Everything worth saying about it has already been said. No words truly do it justice. It's one you have to sit down and watch. Every year without failure, millions of people plop down in front of the television to be spellbound by it.One only needs to refer to its ranking on the IMDb top 250 at #30 to see how well-regarded and beloved this classic is. It's one of those giants in film history that everyone needs to see.I wasn't introduced to this film by my parents like many were. In fact, I'm the one who instituted the policy that we must watch It's a Wonderful Life every December in my house growing up.This is the type of film which doesn't age. The themes and morals expressed in the film are the definition of timeless.I would strongly encourage anyone thinking of viewing this film to watch it in black and white. Some networks have aired the color version and the Blu-ray also contains the colorized version. The colorized version was not what the filmmakers and actors intended. Here's what James Stewart thought of the colorized version: ""I tried to look at the colorized version, but I had to switch it off--it made me feel sick."" James Stewart and Donna Reed are one of the best on-screen pairings I've ever seen. This isn't just a Christmas movie. It's every bit a romantic drama and explores some dark themes.Neither the director, Frank Capra, nor James Stewart knew what they had when this film was made. They hadn't discovered all the layers that existed within this movie. It took the viewing audience to find this classic on television for it gain the following it has today.We found it then and we do again every year.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The plot is a straight arrow without much in the way of clever twists. The attempts at comedy with Charlie the angel are truly awful.Most disturbing is the religious theme. This isn't a movie about a person who happens to be very religious (such as The Big Kahuna, or Contact, both of which I enjoyed). Rather, this film makes the assumption that the viewing audience will be touched by Christian metaphors such as angels. You could get away with that in a mainstream film back in the white male Christian dominated society, but it doesn't work today.Who should see this film:-- film buffs who can't help themselves-- religious types looking for a Christmas storyI believe that movie ratings should reflect a movie's impact on today, not back when it came out.

Parable about George from a fairy tale or Deservedly cult American classic!,"Tragicomedy, parable, drama. The film adaptation of the short story by the writer Philip Van Duren Stern ""The Greatest Gift"", and since I have not read the original source, I will evaluate the picture as an independent work. An American classic that all its residents watch on Christmas Eve, just like our "" Irony of Fate, or With a light steam!"". I wanted to see this picture for a long time, but all my hands did not reach it, and then they finally reached it, maybe not in vain. Maybe this time was needed? Who knows, sometimes accidents are not accidental! Here, I come to myself after watching this, I'm not afraid to say this word, ""masterpiece"", which was directed and directed by producer and director Frank Capra immediately after the end of the most terrible and bloody war in the history of mankind. And I took it off so that the lump in my throat does not go away for more than an hour after the end of the viewing. And here is my brief opinion for you - A deservedly cult American classic! I will say right away that there are no minuses in the picture, well, not at all, well, not a drop, well, not even a tiny bit, and do not even try to see them here - you will not find them, so I will dwell in more detail on the merits of this masterpiece, which I am sure will survive more than one century.So, here they are:
1. The script-the picture will tell us the story of George Bailey, a modest and honest man, his path from childhood to the moment when his life hangs in the balance due to a series of failures. Then a guardian angel comes to his aid and will try to bring the desperate George back from the darkness of sadness and love his life again, which seemed to him in vain. We will see the whole life of George, we will definitely get attached to him, we will empathize with him, we will love the small town of Bedfort Falls and its residents, George's friends, his family and warmth. The ending is logical and predictable, but it is so arranged and played that a lump in the throat from contemplating George's happiness will not leave you for a very, very long time. The script is perfect, there is not even a desire to find fault, because the characters of the characters are revealed, the dialogues, although they do not shine with originality and affectation, are taken seriously, because this is how people talk in real life. The picture ""The Family Man"" with Nicolas Cage clearly imitates this masterpiece by Frank Capra, and I realized this only now (because I watched"" The Family Man "" for a long time, but I still remember the warmth of my soul).2. The atmosphere is naivety, kindness, faith in the good, completely in the spirit of Soviet cinema. Yes, reality hit the hero hard and painfully, but thanks to his character and innate sense of justice, George does not hesitate to help other people to the detriment of himself. And the town looks almost like a huge ""gingerbread house"", where everyone is happy, where evil can never win - in short, Capra paints us a picture of an ideal life, and in it - an ideal ""little"" person who, despite his hardships, does not lose faith in people and the best. The picture can partly be called a fairy tale, the way is so, but this fabulousness is so lacking now for most people around the world, sometimes they want to dream about grandiose plans, but for the sake of their relatives or friends, they can sacrifice their last shirt, if only others would have at least a little better than now. The atmosphere of the picture strongly affects the viewer, and does not let go even until the final credits.3. Music-it was written for this masterpiece by our compatriot Dmitry Temkin, whom I have already mentioned and praised more than once in my reviews. It should be recognized that the music this time was only a pleasant addition to the general atmosphere of kindness and fabulousness, and did not pull the atmosphere, as for example in ""Unforgiven"" in 1960 with Audrey Hepburn. Dmitry Temkin wrote pleasant compositions that were only competently attached to the final work, and not a single composition stands out.4. Bright characters - both main and secondary. I have already said that they are written and played perfectly, and everyone is remembered, even if he does not have so much screen time. And the actors were picked up very colorful, this can not be taken away. Frank Capra did a great job and the result is on the face. There are no passable and ""cardboard"", and even more so there are no faded heroes here!5. Cult-for once, I agree with critics and viewers who put this picture at the top of all possible lists of the best. Although at first the picture failed at the box office, which almost ruined the career of Frank Capra, but in the seventies a miracle happened - the picture began to be played on American TV (like ""Casablanca"" by the way) on Christmas Eve, and since then it has become wildly popular, and without it it is now impossible to imagine Christmas itself in America (although the holiday itself plays a far from the main role here, a paradox, but this is exactly so). This masterpiece has earned such appreciation and love of the audience, and not only American. Yes, the picture reflects the life of the American province of the twenties and forties, but the thoughts and message that it carries will never become obsolete!6. Humor-I almost forgot about it, and although this picture is more with a dramatic bias, it manages to joke well and amuse the viewer in many moments. A nice bonus and attracting a new audience.7. Conclusions-appreciate life! Do not lose heart! Life is a gift from the Lord, and it is not for us to dispose of it! Our time will definitely come, and until then, live and enjoy those happy moments, whether you are even a ""big"" or"" small "" person! The picture clearly shows what despair and a rush of insane desire are. That it is terrible to lose your life and how we sometimes do not appreciate the small joys that every person has. Yes, life kicks us, who is hurt and who is not very much, but we must stand up, as George did, and be happy with what we have.A little about the main characters:
1. George Bailey, played by James Stewart , is a kind fellow, a shirt-a guy who helps everyone, even to the detriment of himself and his own family. Cheerful and cheerful, who, after a strong blow from life, despaired. George could have become rich, famous, but he preferred his hometown and friends who needed him, and with whom he survived both the Great Depression and the Second World War, and how good it is that this role was played by such an impeccable and honest actor as James Stewart. He didn't play George - he lived it on the screen. Such a type is now ""not in fashion"", because individualism prevails. Bravo James! Bravo!2. Mary Hatch (married Bailey), played by Donna Reed , is a beautiful girl, George's lover, who fell in love with him for his character and kind heart and carried her love for him for many years. She did not strive for wealth and luxury, only for family happiness - and this is the most expensive! Donna is a good girl! Just a good girl! A whole pen!3. Henry Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore , is a large and influential banker of the town who wants to absorb George's business. A sample of a typical ""business shark"" who does not care about moral principles and is driven by only one desire - to grab more money, although he has nowhere to spend it. The personification of ""typical America"", which is ridiculed by Frank Capra. And the actor coped with the role perfectly.The picture left a deep wound on my heart, and I will definitely review it and recommend it to friends and acquaintances, because everyone needs to see it, and I am glad that I myself got acquainted with this masterpiece of post-war Hollywood, shot by a talented and honest director Frank Capra, whose picture ""The Battle for Russia"" I will definitely watch!As a result, we have a real masterpiece of tragicomedy, parables, and fairy tales, with a touch of humor, with a great script, great atmosphere, great music, a good message and great acting works!My rating is 10 out of 10 and my recommendation for viewing!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What more can be said...,"There is a certain way in which some movies can have a very good but not perfect first half but then they are brought up a level by its masterful ending, It's a Wonderful Life is for me exactly that. This film of course that now is a staple of some peoples Christmas viewing is a favourite for some and it is not hard to see why, a sweet story but with an emotional and pretty thought provoking in hindsight back-story. The movie is legend in senses and to be fair probably doesn't need another review praising it but I will give it a go anyway, although as I said before the start for me is not flawless. I did feel the first maybe full half of it was although great, not at a level I expect from masterpieces but this movie showed me oh it did. The film suddenly jumps up in the second half and becomes a classic through that it's hard to find anything wrong with the finish to this film, high class stuff.The man behind this all is of course Frank Capra who directs but also co-writes this and I feel because he got to the writing of this too he creates a world that then fly's to life in his direction. Of course it's not hard to see the Judeo-Christian influences from Capra, after all he had a Roman Catholic upbringing and all the story people are praying to god and asking for help, there's even going's on that have the evident hand of god in the story but it is not a movie I would say is not for atheists. I actually think that this movie is fairly humanistic in its elements of just living on, don't think about death until it greets you, it also promotes ideas of bettering one's self and helping others in your community, not just asking god constantly, but in any case film should be able to be enjoyed by anyone of any belief.I'll try to move away now from that religious background of the movie because to say this is only for believers or even those who only celebrate Christmas is not right; this is just an excellent story all round. Its fantasy element is what truly makes this a classic and Capra and his co-writers get a story that is as sweet as it can even be dark too. James Stewart is one of the best in classic Hollywood and here he is no different, in fact I even think his performance is much like the film as it gets better as it goes on. Donna Reed as Mary is also good like Stewart and does do a fine job of not letting Stewart steal the scenes he is in, then cast like Lionel Barrymore and Henry Travers are finely cast and really the movie creates beautiful characters.I nearly didn't label this a masterpiece, oh so close I was to saying this was although fantastic, not quite as astounding as many claim, but the more I thought back on this the better it became. Its enduring popularity I feel comes mostly from the fact that the story is simple, its very end is extremely simple and yet the movie is easily re-watchable, the kind I think you can find more things with every watch. Capra knew exactly how to get us the audience to feel for those involved and from the moment George Bailey (Stewart) gets home from a certain little chat with his Uncle Billy to his home, the whole emotional drag of the film starts to kick in and come into full throttle all the way until the final scenes.Overall It's a Wonderful Life is one of the finest Christmas movies and is not just a top top Christmas movie, but is a top top movie period. The way in which Capra, the cast, the sets and even just the music is so well done, well it makes this movie special among many out there and it is incredibly easy to see why so many revisit this every Christmas to curse the name of Uncle Billy (or just to feel some joy)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Okay the first thousand times!,"At one time, before the advent of digital expansion television, every station in the Chicago area was showing this film-on one occasion, literally at the same time!

Bailey v. Kane,"An acquaintance of mine recently commented that she thought there was an interesting correlation between this film and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.George Bailey was the man that Charles Foster Kane would have liked to have been. Kane's tragedy was that like a hereditary king, he was thrust into the center of momentous events, and expected to live up to the duties. Unlike George Bailey, though, he had no real nemesis whose punches he had to block. Bailey was trying to better the lives of those around him, by foiling the actions of Potter.Also, while Kane became a more complex Mr. Potter, he never gave up the longing for a more simple life. This, of course, was personified by Rosebud; it was his Persian Flaw, but one which he never revealed to anyone lest they discover a chink in his armor. By contrast, Mr. Potter had no real longing for simplicity. He saw money and power as the only real gains in his life, and didn't care what anyone thought of him. Witness his speech in his attempt to woo Bailey to his side, ""...you know I own almost everything in this town and most people hate my guts..."". Potter, although powerful, like Kane, didn't have the same goals. He is very much the spider that Bailey says he is.Conversely, Bailey probably could do the job that Charles Foster Kane did. He was capable of handling a stressful job, and once warmed to it, did a good job. Unlike Kane, however, he would use the power of the Press for the common good, since that is his ultimate goal. That's a thought I find most amusing, actually: imagine Jimmy Stewart in the Welles production!",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Memories are made of this!,"Jimmy Stewart was not George Bailey. It was one of the reasons audiences of the time did not welcome back with open arms one of the stars of pre World War two. Although George Bailey was the almost perfected emotional core of every man and woman's heart, Frank Capra delivered the darkest yet of three movies featuring one of his best stars. It ruined his somewhat wholesome, small town man in the heart image that Capra had given his characters in their previous collaborations ""You Can't Take it With You"" and ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"".Angel, second class, is forever associated with ""It's a Wonderful Life"". A brilliantly silly Henry Travers as Clarence the illusive protector of a shattered man created an immortal legend. Donna Reed as Mary in her first notable role delivers on her promises, but outclassed by the deliverance of two of the most difficult roles in cinema history. Capra faves, Thomas Mitchell, as Uncle Billy and Lionel Barrymore, in a role a far cry from lovable Grandpa Vanderhoff in ""You Can't Take it With You"", is convincingly sinister as Mr Potter.In its imagery, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is frightening. Dark, grim, terrifying moments exceed the Capra trademarks. The comedic moments thrill, and there are plenty of them. Three viewings, the first not at Christmas, have imprinted the memory of unforgettable sequences into my mind forever.Few films were ever designed with a message to remain immortalised through the years. It remains simple and complex on certain levels however it is viewed, but the most important two are all there in the script. ""No man is a failure who has friends"", and ""Life is wonderful"". The film must be watched until on some personal level, the viewer connects with what the film is trying to say.The movie is the stock treatment I prescribe to others in times of depression. A decent dosage could bring a more positive outlook of optimism to even the most cynical prepared to look beyond the black and white images. There has never been a more capable Hollywood movie made to create tears and laughters in excessive amounts which makes it a masterpiece of the American cinema, and the definitive Holiday classic.It remains the most influential of movies I have seen in my life. I was originally one of those cynical with a refusal to view any movie made in black and white. With little effort, it changed my perspective on life, but however easily I have forgotten the lessons this film teaches, it just as simply reminds me of what I need to know. It holds the record for the number of times a movie has made me cry.""It's a Wonderful Life"" was a Christmas ritual I was never dragged through when I was younger. I wish I was.Rating: 10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Pefect for Christmas Eve,"No other movie is better to watch on Christmas Eve than this movie. It's full of laughs, cries, and other things. Only a person who has no life wouldn't like this movie. It's appropriate for children, unlike most movies being made today.***SPOILERS AHEAD***George Bailey, played by my favorite actor, Jimmy Stewart, the one and only choice of Frank Capra, is a banker who stays in a town called Bedford Falls his entire life. He never once leaves Bedford Falls, in an effort to save his father's business.Near the end, after George gets to see for himself what the world would have been like had he not been born, he discovers that life really is wonderful.THe message of this movie is what you see in the book that Clarence gives George: ""Remember, no man is a failure who has friends!""

the tale of the classic selfless man's conflicted mind-set and the town that's ingrained in his life,"I should be inclined to say that Frank Capra made his masterpiece with It's a Wonderful Life, and it would probably be the obvious, easy answer to make as a movie-lover. And shock of shocks, it wasn't until today (of Christmas Eve of all times, ho-ho-ho) that I finally sat down and watched it- it wasn't a 'family staple' in my house- but I knew I had to watch it, if only to see James Stewart in the seminal role of George Bailey. It is, no doubt, with enough fantastical scenes to make up a couple more movies, and the heart that sits right in It's a Wonderful Life beats with all the vigor and pride of the most schmaltzy- and rightly proud of it- American spirit. That I ended up not finding it to be a truly astonishing movie may be that I'm just a cynic deep down, or that maybe this kind of story, and how it plays out, has ended up being done so many times I practically knew what the story was before going in. It's the most amazing of credits to Capra and his cast and crew that it does hold up this well, and that the sentimentality stringing together much of what happens is actually well earned. But it does teeter on becoming a bit too dated, or rather that it's appeal of being a fable really only works best when dealing with the crux of the character George Bailey, and almost becomes weird in how it leaps from great happiness to the terrible bleakness of modern American life.Indeed, Stewart was not only the best choice for George Bailey, but the correct one, the kind we'd probably all like to have in our town as the man who despite his better senses commits his life to being there for the ones he cares for. It almost becomes a running gag, however not really funny as much as touching, the way he puts aside his own feelings and self-wants to help save the bank and Bedford Falls from the peril that could come from the dastardly Potter (Lionel Barrymore, cast perfectly for the role as well with his sinister eyebrows and cunning attitude). I first thought it would be all about George seeing life as if he had never been born, but really this is(wisely) kept to the last twenty minutes of the picture. This works because we see how Bailey gets to that point of almost jumping off into the river, which in its selfish way would be, to him, still a selfless act (i.e. worth more than dead). Seeing George's life is like peering into one of those tall-tale American stories where the little guy gets a lot done by just being himself- or at least his better self getting the better of him. All George wants to do as a young man is explore the world, make great buildings and things. But any lofty ambition becomes squashed by reality- of his father's death, of the very sneaky attitude imposed by Potter, and by the townspeople practically needing some hope during the depression. So it's up to him to not only save the town by making a section of the town named after him for low-cost housing, but to marry a girl Mary (Donna Reed) who's fallen totally for George.What ends up being most memorable, for me, about It's a Wonderful Life is the skill which Capra makes possibly one-dimensional figures very real and immediate, and that in this seemingly simplistic world of right and wrong and good and bad there are the slivers of gray that work their way in. I loved one scene in particular where Potter, desperate to gain back control over his possible monopoly in Bedford Falls, tries to will George away to work for him at far more an amount of money he would make on his own terms with his small bank. It's a tense scene in how devilish Potter comes off, and how Barrymore turns on the ideal of greed and necessity and the ego of a man over the higher principles that George ultimately goes for. It's always fascinating too to see how Stewart plays certain scenes and lines and inflections, moments of surprise and delight which probably hide just the bits of bitterness that build up in him. There's something about the American dream that is called into question in American life, even as Capra likes to jump from sweet touches of light comedy to stark tragedy or danger. There's a great juxtaposition that is made too with the characters of Harry Bailey, George's brother, who goes on to lead the life George might have led had he not saved Harry as a boy, and as well in a small part with Sam Wainwright.It's through the sort of realistic groundings then that Capra is able to get away with reaching for the fantasy structure that ends up coming out of the film, the typical 'what if' nightmare scenario that has ended up influencing countless movies and TV shows. Like Christmas Carol, though sort of in reverse, it's sort of meant as a lesson in humanity, and how what is carried in a man or what is lacking in it ends up bringing it out or losing it in others. It all builds to help Capra earn the melodrama and ultra-heightened emotions brought out with Clarence the angel. It doesn't mean that, at least for me, there aren't things that end up being dated (however, scenes like the dance-hall bit in 1928, is timeless in its humor), mainly in how the idealism and old-fashioned ways come out in this day & age. But still, it doesn't stop me from saying that It's a Wonderful Life is a must see, if only once, and there's no doubt why it's been revered as one of the great films about the triumph of the human spirit.

My favorite film of all time; inspired classic Americana,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946) **** James Stewart, Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Thomas Mitchell, Henry Travers, Beulah Bondi, Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond. MY ALL TIME FAVORITE FILM : Perennial Christmas classic about George Bailey (Stewart's best acting performance, one for the time capsule), an idealistic dreamer whose out-of-reach plans for himself are constantly set aside for his family and the town he helped in more ways than one. One of the best films ever made about a man's universal struggle with what he wants and what he does resulting with the immortal question: What would life be like if I were never born? Stewart's performance depicts every emotion superbly and facing suicide shows just what a complex character interpretation he has. His salvation comes in the form of Clarence, his guardian angel still trying to earn his wings, who shows him exactly how things would be had he not existed. Best scene: after Stewart is refused entrance by his mother he races into an intense wide/close-up and the registering of fear, horror and finally understanding that spreads across his face is ultimately moving, chilling and heart-breaking all at once. My favorite moment; if you're not moved by this, you 're simply not human. Dare not to sing along at the end to ""Auld Lang Syne"" and dare not to cry. Definitely a film ahead of its time (originally a box-office flop and snubbed royally at the Oscars losing largely to the WWII American classic ""The Best Years of Our Lives""). Frank Capra's masterpiece was his and Stewart's personal favorite films.*Trivia note: characters named Bert & Ernie would eventually be paid tribute as ""Sesame Street""'s immortal buddies and Stewart's and Reed's characters, George and Mary are also my parents' names.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
I'm nuts,"I have two competing trains of thought about this movie.  One is the obvious praise/adoration/no-holiday-season-complete-without that all of the other reviews have said.  The other is much darker.Does anyone else see that the point of the movie is divine intervention from holiday suicide?  Does anyone see this as a bad thing?  Let's examine the facts.  1.  George is unhappy with life.  2.  He gets in financial difficulty.  3.  Because he sees no way out, he decides to commit suicide. 4.  Divine powers intervene and save George from killing himself at the last minute.Does this happen in real life?  Ya, all but #4, which never occurs.  I hate to say it but this movie that we all love should be avoided by depressed people.  It is probably indirectly responsible for thousands of suicides. People aren't thinking clearly when they are depressed and seeing divine intervention save someone at the last second, if and only if they are good enough, is probably enough to push people over the edge.  That stupid 'Touched by an Angel' TV show is just as bad.People have a hard enough time distinguishing truth from reality without suggesting to the weak-minded that some supernatural entity is going to come along and solve all of their problems.All that having been said, I still love this movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Frank Capra's all time masterpiece.,"The problem is where to start. What can I say that has not alreadybeen said, about this superb film. I can still remember the firsttime , that I saw it.  My mother had seen the picture several yearsbefore, and knew that the family would enjoy it. So one Christmas,when it was being shown on T.V. We all sat down to watch.Littledid I know , that years later this would still be my all time favouritefilm. I must have seen It  at least 30 times, and it is still as good asever. Each successive screening , I see something more , than thelast time I watched it. Reading Capra's book about its  making, hephoned Jimmy Stewart, who was just back from the war, and triedto explain the plot outline. Stewart, who had already starred inseveral of Capra's films, interrupted him and agreed on the spot,to star in the film.Years later when asked, Stewart always said thatWonderful Life' was his favourite film, and if it is good enough forhim, then it is good enough for me. One other story that I heard, isthat when asked if Wonderful Life' was the best film that he hasmade, Capra is said to have replied, that it is the best film thatanybody has made.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Movie,"A beautiful, moving movie. It takes you on the journey again every time you see it. Every scene is a classic. Jimmy Stewart is quite incredible in this movie. If you ever thought classical actors couldn't rival method actors, see how genuine Stewart's performance is. Two special moments: Stewart's tears as he sits in martinis, and the scene where Mary and George both listen to the same telephone receiver. Its such a magical scene - one of the best scenes of all time. Neither of them listen to what Sam Wainwright is saying on the phone, because all of a sudden the two of them realise they are standing the closest they've been together in twenty or so years. He can smell her hair and she can smell his aftershave. The scene is played out in expressions and movements, and you can read their thoughts on their faces. A joy.This movie does a difficult thing, something we love to be reminded of each christmas, it makes you appreciate the important things in life. Its about falling back in love with life. Frank Capra was a master director. Not only are his movies brilliantly realised, perfectly shot and constructed, but they contain just enough awfulness to ensure that the endings do not seem corny - their positive messages do not seem contrived - they are a joy and a relief. Frank Capra doesn't pretend the world is a perfect place, but he does something many filmmakers can't - he actually provides answers as to how best to deal with the world's imperfect nature. If you're ever feeling sad and low, or too concerned with trivial things, watch Its a Wonderful Life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It is directed by Frank Capra. It has a good narrative as it shows the principle actor growing up and helping everyone as he does. The musical score is also very good written by Dimitri Tiomkin it adds to the atmosphere of the film. Just remember that no man is a failure who has friends !!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brilliant but hamstrung,"There are only two things wrong with ""It's a Wonderful Life"" - unfortunately, they are the beginning and the ending.  (I don't reveal what happens at the end, but I do reveal something about the feel of the ending, and those who wish to come to the film cold may wish to read no further.)To begin with the beginning ...  This is the story of a man's life AND of the way the town would have been had he never existed; but the device whereby we are shown that counterfactual is the most ham-fisted and grating one Capra could have chosen.  It involves a bumbling angel named Clarence who has yet to get his wings (and, if I were in charge of Heaven, never would).  Heaven (or perhaps God - it's hard to tell) appears to be the Crab Nebula and it flashes whenever it utters an accented syllable.  Clarence is a half-witted interstellar firefly.  I'm not making fun of the special effects: I'm questioning the fact that the deus ex machina had to be made into a character at all, let alone such an annoying one.But the ending is worse.  It's clearly MEANT to be a happy ending: the trouble is that it's no continuation whatever of the preceding story. Difficulties are vanquished by being ignored.  It's as if Capra visualised the scene he wanted at the end, and when he discovered it didn't fit, filmed it anyway.  A genuinely happy ending would have been great - even a tragic ending would have been less painful, and depressing, to watch.Now for the good news.  Between the faltering beginning and the sour conclusion it's sustained magic - one brilliant scene after another, to the point where it's difficult to believe that so many good bits found their way into the same film.  And I don't just mean that individual scenes play well, but to no purpose: there really is a fine and complex story supporting them. The ending is a genuine shame, but if you can get past it, good luck to you.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's a Wonderful Film,"For my generation - the MTV generation - there are certain things its cool to like and things that it isn't cool to like. We have to be able to look at the harder things in life and, if we want to be cool, take them head on. We have to be Fight Club members, listening to Jay-Z and spouting about how we're all atheists looking for anarchy. Luckily, for just 1 or 2 of us, we have a few embarrassing secrets. A few guilty pleasures in terms of music and film taste. On the music side we can see Beach Boys - PET SOUNDS and Elvis Presley or Frank Sinatra (it IS cool to like the BEATLES). But, like the 1st member of a cinematic rogues gallery, ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is the least cool film that has ever been made. BUT - No surprise - this film is magic captured on celluloid.I adore It's a Wonderful Life. It is perhaps my single favourite cinematic achievement. It takes a writer (if I do say so myself) to fully appreciate the power of this film. Recently, I've been working on a kind of Ikiru/IWAL Christmas story and difficulty isn't the word to describe it. Every step you take you have to stop and think ""this is so much better in It's a Wonderful Life"". Even everything in Ikiru is at least bettered in It's a Wonderful Life if not blown out of the water (but its cool to like Ikiru). As a piece of literature, it's a masterpiece. Every character is perfect and almost Dickens-esque in their individual necessity - I actually think that it is more effective and powerful than A Christmas Carol - and not just ANY film can better Dickens in my opinion. As a film - it is so perfect that I just want to feel it melt on my tongue. I want it to destroy me, I want it to build me back up, I want it to affect me. And it hasn't let me down yet.To conclude, It's A Wonderful Life is one of the most important and satisfying films ever printed. Fantastically abstract storytelling captures a mans entire life with miraculous ease. Barefaced and not embarrassed about any of its notions or characters, its complete lack of pretension strikes a chord with most viewers - it is the kind of movie most film makers are too afraid to make.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

""" You called me a warped frustrated old man, well what are you, but a warped frustrated young  man ""","The movie is called "" It's a wonderful life "" and stars one of Hollywood's favorites. Frank Capra chose James Steward to play George Bailey, a young idealistic young man who believes he is destined to travel the world and make a fortune. It's a great dream, but unfortunately will never happen. Instead, George is forced into an obscure existence, as he admires his father so much it dooms him to replace the old man in Bedford Falls. The Bailey family establishes a tiny savings and loan and attempts to compete with the richest man in town, Mr. Potter played to the hilt by Lionel Barrymore. Things are bad enough when Mr. Bailey dies, just as George is about to go to college, but then he is forced to replacing him as head of the S & L. Years go by and Mr. Potter takes advantage of the 1930's depression and his domination of the town is nearly complete. The second world war descends on the town and directly after a economic calamity caused by George's uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) threatens the family business by accidentally losing $8,000. Facing bankruptcy, George panics and believes he is going to be arrested. Knowing this will destroy his family, ruin his reputation and send him to prison, George opts to commit suicide. Praying for a miracle, George is hoping his insurance policy will save his family. However, an instant before he jumps into the frigid, frozen winter waters of the river, George is startled to see a strange little man jumping in first. That is when George's life enters the world of the ""What if."" The stranger (Henry Travers) turns out to be an angel named Clarence, who shows him what life would be had he never been born. In this alternative world George watches with astonishment as all those he knew are changed forever by his absence. Potter is in fact the richest and most powerful man who indeed owns the town. George on the other hand becomes a total stranger and terrorizes his own wife (Donna Reed), mother (Beulah Bondi) and children. He is subsequently run out of town by his former friends Ward Bond and Frank Faylen and neighbors. Repeated yearly as one of the finest Christmas films of all time, the movie has indeed become a family Classic. One of Jimmy Steward's all time favorites. ****",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Colorized Version VS Black & White,"I picked up Paramount's double DVD for ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to upgrade my earlier Republic release. This two disc set comes with both the original B&W edition and a newly colorized version on a separate disc. This is not the first colorization job on this film. Turner attempted it some years back and both James Stewart and director Frank Capra were appalled at the results. They did everything in their power to discourage this practice. Well the technique for colorization has greatly improved since those early attempts and I thought it worth taking another look at the results. It is quite amazing -- yet after watching it for about one hour I changed to the black & white version and have NO desire to watch it in color. Flesh colors are on the orange side and everyone has the exact same tone of color. The beautiful shades found in the b&w version are far more effective. Let's face it -- if a film was originally designed and shot in color then it should be seen that way. It's the same with watching a wide screen film in full screen or a full screen blown up to fill a 16:9 wide screen television set. The film itself remains one of my all time favorites -- and I will continue appreciate it in black and white!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A true classic,"Yes, it's familiar, yes, everyone has enjoyed it many times. The same can be said about the Ode to Joy or The Wizard of Oz. Like those things, It's a Wonderful Life has endured and been enjoyed because of its greatness. Its themes are timeless--that of the importance of family, of friendship, of supporting each other, of caring about each other, of learning about what really matters. The acting, writing, cinematography, and directing are all excellent. The best acting in the film belongs to the great James Stewart, in his most memorable role. His George Bailey is wonderful. We see in him all that a man can experience--joy, sorrow, love, hate, fulfillment, disappointment, despair, hope. We see what a good, caring, decent man he is. We see the effect he has on other people, and we see him learn just how important he has been to those people.One thing I want to address is the idea that George ""sacrificed"" to have the life he has. I would argue that he no more sacrifices than parents do when they give up certain things to have children. In the end, what he did and what he has is according to the things he values most, and that's no sacrifice. Suppose Clarence had said to him ""George, I will give you the life you said you wanted. You will be a world traveler who builds bridges and plans cities. You won't put down roots, and you won't be part of a community that cares about you. Most importantly, you will never marry. You won't have Mary or your kids"". Does anyone believe that George would take up the offer? No. Clarence showed him how valuable what he does have is to him.

A question many of us take for granted or even don't understand.This movie not only touches on the fact that each one of our lives are so intertwined that when you remove a single link, the whole chain falls apart, but also it touches on the importance of family, caring for others, and the most important fact, that without God, our lives are meaningless.Harry Bailey, Played by Jimmy Stewart, is feeling like hes more of a burden than a blessing, but through the grace of God, he is given a rare gift...a gift to see what the world would be like had he never been born.This journey is guided by the often misguided angel, Clarence.

Great Uplifting Story - Too Bad We See It Only 1 Time A Year!,"Possible Spoilers My favorite movie of all time and it has been that for decades.This movie makes one believe in heaven, angels, miracles, the good in the world, and other things that sometimes in our darkest moments we choose to avoid. This contrast of the heavenly optimistic and the down to earth pessimistic is the point and the reason this movie works. The powerful uplifting super-climax takes place because the movie will draw the viewer into the very bad down-to-earth pessimistic view of a situation, and the wrong way of seeing things, and then the movie lifts the viewer up in a way that seems almost beyond this world! To keep with the otherworldly concept, the movie at the same time teaches the viewer an over-arching life concept of spending life cultivating friends/relationships instead of money, as if we are listening to a voice from heaven that knows all.The movie was loosely based on the short story by Phillip Van doren Stern, ""The Greatest Gift"". This was the story of someone who got to see what life would have been if he never existed.The movie's climax for 1940's was and still is powerful. If one did a remake of it, today, you could add tremendous heavenly sites/colors and music to the climactic words that end the movie, but I really do not think it would add anything of value.I have read the negative reviews of the movie and I believe many did not get the main point or do not like a happy endings. Some people feel Peter Baily is too selfless. I am happy those views are in the minority.I watch this movie every time it is on, which probably totals about 1,000 times to date. I'll probably watch it many more times. The ending always is an uplifting experience. If you want to feel the uplifting power of the ending for yourself, watch the entire movie and when the ending comes and people begin singing the song ""Auld Lang Syne"" immediately turn the volume to the max and listen to the words and sounds until the ending credits start.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The best Christmas film?,"This might not be my most watched Christmas film ever but I can say that it is most likely the best I have seen.The dialogue in this film is amazing and the storytelling is as good as it gets. We are watching a man whose life is slowly falling apart, but don't even notice because his life story in itself is so well written and directed. We also feel so connected to the main character so seamlessly up to the end of the film, as despite his flaws, he is an honest, good manIt's a film so grounded in reality but still manages to stick the landing with the spiritual scenes which is what makes it stand out as a film and plays very well with the Christmas theme.It teaches the audience to appreciate what we have and to keep our heads up through life's adversities. It also teaches lessons of greed and how money, despite causing many issues in life, (which is an undeniable fact), isn't something you can let take over your life.It is a great film and one that focuses on substance over style, something where a lot of films do the opposite. There are a few editing/audio scuffs here and there and the cinematography isn't the most ambitious which could be score-lowering factors, but I just think there is way too much substance and care put into this film for it to be any lower. It is also worth noting the time period this film released in, which could of course play a factor.Overall, I think this is one of the most uplifting films ever and I'm sure at the time of its release it was huge for mental health and so on.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
See WONDERFUL LIFE on BluRay,"If you want to really appreciate this wonderful film, be sure to see it on BluRay.In 2009, the film was issued on BluRay in pristine form.The picture and sound are both clean and crystal clear and what you get is a better audio-video experience than theater audiences had when this was first released.I personally prefer the artfully colorized version and adjusted my TV with the color level up about 10% above normal. Film to video restoration/transfers do not get any better than this.Frank Capra's masterpiece honors the ideal of a good man who lives a good life but doesn't realize how blessed he is until it's almost too late.

It's a wonderful film...,"Well, to kick off, i had never seen this film before this afternoon (Im 21), when i decided to grab my mothers copy off the shelf and stick it on. Everyone saying that this was one of those 'must see classics' finally got to me.I was very pleasantly surprised. I must admit i tend to favour more recent films - these days i like to look out for groundbreaking acting, superb camera movement, stunning cinematography etc , but 'It's A Wonderful Life' just goes to show that all that does not make a good film. Its the story, its the characters.Released in 1946, a whole 36 years before i was born, i thought this would just be another film that the oldies loved, but is just no match for todays masterful film-making techniques. I was wrong, and that makes me happy...The film is all in the story, detailing George Bailey's struggle to get out of his small town, but always putting others before himself and continually sacrificing his chance to live his own life and see the world. By the end, his life takes a nasty turn or two, and he ends up considering suicide to make available his life insurance money to help his family - until a gentle angel named Clarence arrives to show him what life in his town would be like if he was never around...Very well acted (for its era) and very well told, 'It's A Wonderful Life' really is one of the most uplifting films i have ever seen. Frank Capra gently takes us from step to step with our subtly heroic lead, throughout the highs, the almost lows, and the real lows, and you really feel for the guy - He is never presented as perfect - he sometimes yells at his family, his friends, he gets frustrated like all of us, but always does what he can to right his wrongs, and help his townspeople. We like this guy because he's decidedly human, but a good man overall.The films big payoff comes in its finale - after George realises how much he has to live for, he immediately sets about doing just that, embracing his family like he hadn't seen them in years, despite his financial turmoil and seemingly grim future.If this film had been made today, no doubt the ending would be deemed cheesy and unrealistic - today it seems impossible to have a happy ending without the film being accused of taking the easy way out, which is crap - let people end their movie in the way that seems best to them. This film however, though simply shot and unremarkably acted, is truly affecting. George finally realizing that he was cherished and appreciated all along by his friends and clients is a touching moment, and to be honest, i was in tears, crying like a baby with a smacked arse by the end credits.I really urge anyone who has not seen this film to give it a go, even if you think its way, way off your normal movie map. I like Michael Bay films for crying out loud, and i still loved this! Go watch.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Overrated and Boring, at Least Until the Third Act","It's a Wonderful Life is not only a massively overrated Christmas film, but it is just overrated in general.Around three-quarters of the film was filled to the brim with annoying intricacies about the bank system and all of these stupid terms that I really could care less about. I was really joyful to find the scenes that included our main character's interactions with his soon-to-be-wife, but they were always sacrificed for the boring and less interesting scenes.Also, while the film teases us about the angel from the start (and is kind of found in every plot summary), we don't actually see it until the very last half our of the film, which is unanimously considered to be the greatest part. The final thirty minutes are so well done that I shed tons of tears and will take a lot from it in my future life, but the one hour and forty-five leading up to it were really boring. And while it may be argued that the ending means nothing without the rest of the film, I bed to differ to the max. The ending will forever stand on its own, and to be quite frank, that is all people seem to remember anyhow.All in all, it took an hour and a half before we actually get to the interesting part of the film.... And that last part was definitely a masterpiece in its own right, but taking the rest into consideration, most of it was an utter bore.Will give this a rewatch in color next year.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Terrible Life,"I did not enjoy It's a Wonderful Life because I did not understand what was going on. This film was a little dragged on to me. It also does not get me into the Christmas spirit at all. The acting was also very bad to me even though it was acted out by some very well known actors. Some of the most boring parts went on for so long and then the scenes that were the slightest bit entertaining were cut so short so after a while my attention went elsewhere. I will definitely not be watching this film ever again and I honestly would not recommend this to anyone. If I could give this film a negative rating, I would.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Featuring the story of an individual, George Bailey, who has spent his entire life in a small New England town helping others while letting his own needs go by, this film allows the character to see what would have happened had he not been there.  Maybe George's life was not a financial success, but in the things that truly mattered, he was certainly blessed.Jimmy Stewart turned in the zenith performance of his career with this 1947 film classic.

A classic film with a powerful message,"I was never much of a fan of older movies, especially not movies as old as It's a Wonderful Life. Being the ignorant teenager I was, I was turned away from the black and white film. The only other film I had ever seen in black and white was 12 Angry Men, which I had to see for my American government class. Although I surprisingly really enjoyed that film, I was in no hurry to see another like it.Years later, while going through a rough time in my life, I came across this movie on this very website. I had known the film existed for years, but upon reading the IMDb page I became curious. Maybe it was just because I was lacking direction in life needed an inspiring message, or the fact it was one of the most redone plots in cinema history. Whatever it was, I set all my ignorance aside, looked the full movie up online and gave it a watch.The outcome was nothing short of life changing. George Bailey (James Stewart) was a very likable character, which made him easy to feel for throughout the movie. The other actors were great as well, making the film feel natural. Hailing from a small town myself, I could relate the family-like atmosphere of the townsfolk. Capra did an excellent job at capturing that quality.But what truly made the film the greatest of greats was the fact it delivered a message we can all truly relate to and appreciate. It was a message that left me feeling that maybe my life wasn't so bad after all. It left me feeling I had purpose.This film now holds a special place in my soul and I've grown to greatly enjoy classic films, possibly even more so than films today. If I were to recommend just one film for everyone to see before they died, without any shadow of a doubt my answer would be Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
one of the best,yes indeed its one of the best movies that goes down in history...yes..you're no man until you have friends....its stunning how one can change the others life by simply his presence and moreover sometimes his actions driven by his judgment of things....clearly the best part of this movie is the 4th quarter...George Bailey is a troubled man because of his current financial situation.....and the angel comes down to show him how the others life would be if he never existed....we really should stop and think what we have done in the past...and know that we've all changed the life's of others...maybe u're giving an advice to someone to go someplace and there he will meet a person who will change his life for good of that fellow...the angel is a psychological creature that we all have in mind...by reflecting on our good things that we've done in our past we should really feel better...everyone carries this angel but not everyone uses it....,10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
My Favorite Movie of All Time!,"This is not only the best feel good movie of ever, but my personal favorite movie of all time. The story of the movie is great, and the moral that goes along with it is excellent. The movie makes you feel as if you are a very important person, and it is one of the very few movies that can do that. It was nominated for 5 Academy Awards, and didn't win any, which is a little sad considering it is an absolutely fabulous movie. In this day and age when movies are all about sex, drugs, and alcohol, I know that I can watch this and feel a lot better about cinema, and also feel better about myself.

One of the best third acts in film history.,"It's A Wonderful Life has a, well wonderful third act that truly, almost magically brings the entire thing together in a way where it minimizes the rest of the film's shortcomings. There's a reason though that no one really talks about the rest of film.It's because a lot of the movie is a bit slow and plodding, perhaps the norm for audiences in the 1940s, but as a modern viewer, I found trying at times. That's not to say that this aspect of the film isn't good - I found uncovering George Bailey's (James Stewart) life fascinating. It just felt poorly paced and could've been told in a less linear way.Stewart's performance is honestly fantastic and he really lives and breathes his character. He's supposed to be 22 and it's um...not convincing, but other than that, he's incredible. Really, all the performances are top notch; Donna Reed shines as Margaret, George's love interest, and maybe set the template for generations of young men hoping what their wives may be like.But yeah, it feels strange even reviewing this movie. It's a cultural institution and so undeniably influential on film and Christmas media generally. While it's pacing will probably bother some people it's definitely worth sticking out for.

Very good and very overrated,"This is a very good movie. Period. A ""classic"", I don't think so. This is a movie whose actual quality has been exceeded by its hype--though NOT because the producers or actors hyped it (like the typical overblown and over-hyped Hollywood film). In fact, when it was released it was not particularly successful (especially compared to other Frank Capra flicks).No, instead it reached legendary status for TWO reasons alone. It was a public domain video (hence NO ROYALTIES REQUIRED FOR SHOWING IT) AND its setting for the movie's conclusion was the holiday season. These two factors worked together to BLITZ the American public from the 1980s to the late 90s (until its copyright status was restored). I remember these dark days, when It's A Wonderful Life was literally shown on half a dozen channels at the same time!! Not even GREAT movies should be shown that much! As a result, many began proclaiming it a classic while some others got awfully tired of seeing it--which is a shame because it's a very good film.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Film!,"This film is just an absolute joy to watch.  I will not deny it, I shed a few tears at the end every time, something no other film has ever managed.The acting is superb and the story, although dark and foreboding at times, is perfect.  True, the Heaven scene effects at the beginning are lame, which is a real shame, but they certainly do not spoil the movie.  Frank Capra has created a movie that tugs at all your emotions without even trying.  One cannot help feeling anger when life doesn't happen the way George Bailey expects it to, or elation when life does.  No-one else could have portrayed George Bailey quite like the late, great James Stewart - perfect casting. And, as for the rest of the characters, one couldn't want for anything more. Marvelous.  Lionel Barrymore even manages to out-scrooge Scrooge (which is surely no mean feat!) as Mr Potter.Overall, this is a film to watch over and over again.

The story of George's life (magnificently played by James Stewart) developed beautifully, as he met each situation with amazing courage and humility, putting others feelings before his, leading upto the wonderfully happy climax when all the people he's helped in the past come to his aid.Special mention for Donna Reed as Mary, I can only imagine at the time she was a huge star, as not only did she perform superbly throughout the movie, she had the most beautiful face I can ever recall.  The combination of Reed & Stewart were essential to this film feeling so warm, but the assorted cast all put in great roles too.What an absolutely beautiful story, not only at Christmas time, but all year round, and it makes you think how even the littlest thing you do can impact on many other people.I don't think i've cried as much over any movie ever as I did today, it was so emotional.Thank you Capra, Stewart, Reed, et al, you made my Christmas!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

What happens when a film slips into the Public Domain...,"As everyone as heard by now, this film slipped into the Public Domain in the early 1970s when it failed to be renewed for copyright. This was both a blessing and a curse. There are many other great films like this one which deserve to be shown more often on network TV. But they never will because of the royalties involved and the fact that they would never make that money back. But when a ""forgotten"" film is shown regularly on TV it can trigger a positive audience response and get a fan base for the film that it would not have otherwise had, as was the case here. But what about when there are no royalties to be paid? The film can be run over and over, into the ground, until it loses all freshness. With this particular film there seems to be people who need to watch it religiously each year, and others who get frankly tired of it. My opinion is that IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a very good film. Certainly a very emotional ending. But labeling it a ""Christmas"" movie is nonsense and it was never intended to be shown only at the holidays. It is a motion picture, just like any other, and deserves to be watched objectively. That's what I'll do here. How does it compare to other similar films? Well, for one thing, I find that this film can convey some very strong emotions for a nearly 60 year old film. Another example is CITY LIGHTS, by Charlie Chaplin, which can still move audiences to tears 70 years after its release. I find the acting to be quite good, but it's worth noting that this shouldn't be surprising considering the first-rate cast (especially Stewart and Barrymore). I find the script to be generally rather weak, incidentally. I feel that the sheer great acting manages to overcome some fairly cliched lines and situations. Still there are also some memorably original sequences like the high school dance. The direction by Capra is excellent as always. It is not without good reason that he is considered one of America's foremost filmmakers. He definitely is not afraid to play scenes for ultimate emotional content which adds strongly to the personal and human element of his films. From a technical aspect, I find this film to be quite well made, especially given its low budget. The giant street set is quite convincing in creating a whole little ""world"" inhabited by the movie's characters. The location footage of the early suburban neighborhoods is an interesting record. The story itself is good but I feel that the entire concept of the angel was simply a cop-out. In earlier Capra efforts, the main character overcame adversity with effort and common sense. But this ""guardian angel"" device is complete fantasy. I guess it works to some extent but I found it to be an easy out. How does it rank against Capra's other films? Well, obviously nothing can touch the brilliant, landmark IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT. One of the very funniest films ever made, and one of the very best. Also, I don't think IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is as successful in maintaining a theme as MR. DEEDS (1936). I would rank it after those two, earlier Capra efforts. Generally if I *have* to watch a ""christmas"" movie it would be Laurel and Hardy's BABES IN TOYLAND. IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a very good film, and deserves to be shown. But so do many other films. I feel another release of 1946, DETOUR, by Edgar G. Ulmer, is a much better film.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Just try to hold back the waterworks at the end, I dare you","To my utter dismay and disbelief, I recently discovered that a friend from work hated this movie.This friend, whom we will call ""Jean"", says she saw it for the first time recently and absolutely hated it. ""What a crappy movie"" or something to that effect.Not that it's important how old Jean is, but let's just say she's had ample opportunities to view the film in previous years, and by her own account she feels her parents had the good taste to protect her from this film.I can only react in shock as one of my most beloved film experiences is torn asunder in such a harsh way. But perhaps I'm blindsided by the tradition of the film, with it being a staple for Christmas fare. Maybe I'm being merely nostalgic. Maybe I can't see it for what it is.I tell you something dear friends, I hated Christmas this year.It seemed to be one obligation after another that nearly stamped out any Christmas cheer I could usually muster with the greatest of ease. My beloved wife and I were busier than ever before and didn't even find the time to put up a Christmas tree, much less enjoy ""It's A Wonderful Life"".You know something, I think it's because we didn't take the time to enjoy the finer points of Christmas, and part of that is Frank Capra's delightful film, which I've just acquired on DVD and plan to watch just as soon as I'm able, despite my hectic schedule.I don't know if Jean will ever give this film another chance or not, I hope she does. Because nothing on film can compare to the touching scene at the end, where George Bailey discovers just what kind of an impact he's had on the lives of the friends around him. Just try to fight those tears, but it won't make you feel any less choked up, no matter how many times you see it, whether you start at the end or not, it doesn't matter.

The Miracle at Bedford Falls,"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (Liberty Films, released through RKO Radio, 1946), directed by Frank Capra, is a heartwarming story about how one man's life touches so many others, and without that one solitary life how circumstances and events could have turned out so differently. Quite an original premise that in many ways reflects the lives of every human being. In spite of some flaws (women's 1940s hair styles during the 1920-30s settings), it remains a true masterpiece, thanks to frequent revivals over the years, especially during the Christmas season from which much of the story takes place.Story opens on the night before Christmas and all through Bedford Falls, a small town where prayers are being said for a good-natured man named George Bailey (James Stewart), whose life is in jeopardy and intends on destroying God's greatest gift, his life, through suicide. Voices are then heard communicating from the great beyond as Joseph, the head angel, proposes to answer the prayers by sending a guardian angel. The chosen one is Clarence (Henry Travers), who has yet to earn his wings. Before assuming his Earthly mission, Clarence is given an hour to learn the life story of George Bailey, beginning in 1919 with George, age 12 (Bobby Anderson), becoming a hero by saving his little brother, Harry, from drowning in frozen water, and preventing Emil Gower (H.B. Warner), druggist and employer, from unwitting making a serious mistake that would have sent him to prison; moving forward to 1928 with the courtship of George and Mary Hatch (Donna Reed), their marriage the at the start of the Depression of 1929, taking up residence in an old house at 320 Sycamore; George taking over his late father's (Samuel S. Hinds) building and loan business which millionaire banker Harry F. Potter (Lionel Barrymore), wants to monopolize, as well as the entire town; the birth of the couple's four children, their happy and troubled times leading to the present day of World War II where George finds himself in desperate need of $8,000 misplaced by his Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), and appropriated by Mr. Potter, or else his shortage of funds will lead to financial ruin and a stiff jail sentence.For an American movie classic, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE has all the elements of several Charles Dickens novels combined, namely ""David Copperfield"" where youngster George falls victim of child abuse in the Mr. Murdstone fashion as he gets his face slapped numerous times by Mr. Gower to a point of causing his deaf ear to bleed for not delivering the medication to a customer, but unlike the evil Murdstone, Gower, a troubled old man who had just lost his son in the war, realizes his trial and error after learning the pills he accidentally placed in the order were actually poisoned, thus hugging the boy in gratitude; and ""A Christmas Carol"" where the adult George, the hero, not Scrooge, is given the opportunity from his guardian angel to see what the world would have been like had he never been born. Also borrowing from ""A Christmas Carol"" is the characterization of Barrymore's Mr. Potter in a Ebenezer Scrooge-type fashion (""the richest and meanest man in town."") Unlike Scrooge, Potter has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The only time he shows a touch of kindness is when he wants a favor from George, knowing full well that once that's accomplished, he'll have nothing more to do with him.For first time viewers, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE comes across as dark, gloomy and depressing story, atypical for a movie categorized as a comedy, particularly with its 1940s ""film noir"" trend, with off screen narration and flashback sequences. Aside from these basic elements, there are many key scenes (crowds gather together singing ""Hark the Herald Angels Sing') and classic quotes (""Every time a bell rings, an angel gets it wings.""), that make this a timeless classic. Aside from Frank Capra's commendable job with this production, the supporting players, including Beulah Bondi (Ma Bailey); Gloria Grahame (Violet); Todd Karns (Harry Bailey as a man); Ward Bond, Frank Albertson, Sheldon Leonard and many others, are also first rate. Larry Simms, best known as Alexander in the ""Blondie"" movie series, assumes the role as the eldest Bailey son, Peter. And who could forget Karolyn Grimes as Little Zuzu with her famous closing line of all?The film did meet with controversy in the 1980s, falling victim to public domain, poor video transfers and shorter prints from its original 130 minute theatrical release, having every commercial and cable TV station (American Movie Classics included) over exposing it throughout the month of December, and even worse, colorization, in spite the fact that its black and white photography is so right for this film. Currently, DVD transfers have improved and television revivals became limited.IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE is a type of movie that can be made once. Regardless of imitations as well as the 1977 television remake, ""It Happened One Christmas"" with Marlo Thomas, the major preference continues to be this 1946 original. It still a holiday classic that doesn't seem to ever go away, thanks to viewers and film historians who continue to find something special with a film based on a short story titled ""The Greatest Gift,"" the gift of life.

One of the best movies ever,"Truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. I had to watch this movie for my schoolwork, but before I had to watch it I never knew this movie was such a big inspiration for filmmakers these days. After seeing the movie I finally understood what all the fuss was about. It's quite a simple movie, and in black and white, but still really incredible to watch. And I'm so glad I did! You get sucked into the story and walk out of the cinema with a great feeling. Needless to say, It's a feel good movie you just have to see. And I believe every film fan should have seen this movie at least once! So to everybody who is reading this as research and hasn't seen the movie yet....Watch It!!!",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Is this the best ever made movie?...,"Anyone who hasn't seen that movie doesn't know anything about the movie art. This is one of its masterpiece that makes you feel nostalgic of the time we knew what was really important in a film. Frank Capra, after few tries on former films, directed what everybody who worked, played in it considers as his biggest achievment. And anyone who has seen it- even guys who are delected by the empty hollywood big productions- have been shaken by it. A must see for thousand reasons -Stewart's performance, Mary & George 's first wedding night scene, ...- but the main one will remain a wonderful lesson about people's life. To share it with your beloved friends is the best message of love you can make.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Mawkishness defined,"Frank Capra was derided by his contemporaries as producing ""Capracorrn"", deeply sentimental films. Yet he always seemed to know his limits, producing films that made us proud, filled with tears of joy. He probably reached his zenith in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939). Yet his next film came perilously close to the edge of mawkishness when he didn't let John Doe commit suicide. After the was, he seemed to lose his touch completely. It's a Wonderful Life is deeply over the edge of mawkishness, a sickly sweet, deeply marred film, totally unbelievable. In my opinion, it's the worst film made by a major director for a major studio in the history of film. It's too bad it fell out of copyright, allowing it to be plastered across TV screens without end during Christmas, to create a ""classic"".Unbelievably, Capra passed up directing It Happened on Fifth Avenue (1947) to do Wonderful Life. Here was a story of comedy, romance, sweetness and pure joy, that was nominated for best screen play. It's my favorite Christmas film. On the other hand, perhaps we're lucky he didn't take it. What a tragedy to be ruined by a director who had lost his way.",2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Uplifting holiday favorite praises value of an ordinary life,"Yes, it's indeed a wonderful movie, an old black and white classic that tells the story of an ordinary man whose unheralded life makes such a difference to his small town. This man feels that he has wasted his life, but a dramatic turn of events convinces him just how significant he has been, not only to his own family but also to so many of the town's inhabitants.The film chronicles the life of George Bailey, who, upon the untimely death of his father, forsakes his dreams of traveling to remain in his hometown of Bedford Falls and take over the helm of the family business. George is not really content, but marries a nice, pretty local girl, embarks upon raising a family, and becomes a respected community member, especially when he refuses to sell out to the local bigwig, a rich miser named Potter, who is willing to do anything to enable a takeover. Disaster befalls George's business and he despairs, contemplating suicide. This situation calls for dramatic intervention by a particularly endearing angel...What an inspiring theme and so well captured. The value of an ordinary life lived with decency and integrity is portrayed with quiet brilliance by that very decent actor, much respected himself, James Stewart. He masterfully conveys George's joys, sorrows, regrets, sacrifices, frustrations, all the aspects of everyday life...and that is what makes this film the classic it is. That scene where George is irritated and snippy with his young daughter, who is proudly and diligently plonking out her recital piece on the piano, what parent can't identify with that type of normal and later regretted frustration?Donna Reed is also wonderful, both as the lovely sweetheart and later the seemingly ordinary but moral wife who supports George and helps raise their four children.It is a timeless piece of cinema that our hearts can turn to any time for inspiration, but especially at Christmas when people tend to look for the important truths in life. It's a traditional holiday favorite with many, including myself. You just glow all warm inside like a cozy fire every time you watch it.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A pretty good movie builds up to the one great scene on the bridge,"This movie feels just the same no matter when you watch it, but today it's viewed mainly as a Christmas movie.  Still, no matter when you watch it, you can't help but like it and get something out of it, unless you have no heart at all or have an absolute, unshakeable hatred for movies like this. Throughout the movie, you think George Bailey's a nice guy (James Stewart was great in the role).  You may get a little tired of the endless flashback scenes, but you'll undoubtedly not really be that bored, especially in the electrifying telephone scene with Donna Reed.  Once the flashbacks are dispensed with, you feel sorry for George as he begins a sudden downhill descent.  You hope (okay, you know) his lovable, bumbling guardian Angel Second Class will be able to talk sense into him by showing him what the world would be like had he not been born.  And then it all comes down to the scene where he almost goes crazy, runs back to the bridge and begs God to let him live again.  That is one of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever seen in movies; unless you're one of the above-mentioned people with no heart, there's no way you will be able to keep at least a couple of tears from falling.  You will almost certainly be pulled into the scene, right alongside George, begging God to let him live, too.  But if somehow you can prevent the tears from coming, then they'll immediatly come flowing when he runs back home rejoicing and yelling, ""Hello, Bedford Falls!""  Yeah, it is what's come to be called ""Capracorn"", but it's utterly genuine and very emotional.  The mood is masterfully orchestrated by Capra and masterfully performed by Stewart.  It's the most, well, wonderful way to close a movie.While that scene and the performance in it are the best things about the movie, that does not mean they're the only good things.  Donna Reed makes a great companion with Stewart (witness that telephone scene), Henry Travers is a pleasent diversion as his guardian angel, and Lionel Barrymore is wonderfully wicked as the devious Mr. Potter.  The whole film is pretty well-done.  Even though everything seems happy, you still do get a little sad knowing George gave up everything.  There is a dark edge to this film, especially when he contemplates suicide.  Nothing happy there at all, but still well-performed and genuinely sympathy-provoking.  While it may be at its best when viewed at Christmas, it's just as good any time of the year and should have a lot of meaning, especially to a depressed or bereaved person.  It's just as wonderful as you've heard, honestly.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sentimentality as a valid subject,"It's a wonderful life is a magical piece of film-making that has entertained and inspired several generations. While it is easy to be critical of technical and creative aspects of the film., anyone who thinks this is less than a classic can only be seen as a cynic and totally devoid of any heart. The inability to appreciate the warmth and heart on display here is sadly a reflection on a persons bitterness about life in general and a need to drag down anything that smacks of ""sentimentality"".As a person who chose a career in film and has studied film history I stand proudly on this movie as a genuine classic. Of course this film is subject any analysis. It can even be rated a B-, but to rate it anything less than a 7 out of ten speaks volumes about the critic's lack of any true feeling for the emotion of film.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Incredible movie.,"James Stewart and Donna Reid at their respective bests. A heartwarming tale of a status we would all aspire, to be loved by many and respected by all. And, to have the ability to realize first hand, the impact our lives had in this world. I've watched this movie literally, hundreds of times and do so, every time it is on television.Some years ago, I found a copy of this film in the bargain basket at a mall media store. Amazingly, I paid a fee of less than five dollars for a movie worth more than most of what comes out of Hollywood today. Few places can you find a movie that will make you cry as well as making you feel exhilarated and good about yourself as ""It's a Wonderful Life"".

"One man's life touches so many others, when he's not there it leaves an awfully big hole","There are some little gems in life that help make life pleasant. It is not officially the Christmas season without watching this little gem. The supporting cast is perfectly matched. Donna Reed is wonderful as well as all the characters of the town. This would be a great movie, even if it were not in a Christmas setting. The holiday flavor makes it even more charming and memorable. A angel trying to get his wings is a little far-fetched, but Capra pulls it off. The impact of living a good life cannot be underestimated. What would life be like for your family if you had never been born?  The values of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" still hold true today. Yes, I'll say it, it's a wonderful movie and is one of the few that you can watch again and again and walk away with the same glowing feeling as you did when you first watched it. I challenge anyone to watch this film and not be touched, if you can, you have no heart!In this film James Stewart  acts so naturally you forget he's an actor playing a part, you really believe his story. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" details the life of George Bailey, a man who put the needs and well being of others before his his whole life.  Later in the film he feels he is a failure and is on the verge of suicide. He is taken by his guardian angel in need of his wings, Clarence (Henry Travers), who shows him just how important he has been. You're pulled on a roller coaster of emotions throughout this film.  Ultimately, it is perhaps the most emotionally moving film ever made, and it offers insight that everybody can use about what's important in our lives.  To phrase a heavily used cliche, this is one of the few movies that gets better with every viewing, and never loses any of its power. And the icing on the cake is where, after George finds that he has his daughter Zuzu's petals in his coat and runs home to his family to find how much they love him, many of his friends come to his aid to help him in replacing the $8000 that went into Mr.Potter's hands before.  This part of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" moves me to tears and can help many people look at their own lives in a new light,especially when one is in despair and feels that their life is worthless.  10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A film about socialism and altruism,"It's a wonderful life is not a Christmas movie.
It's a film about altruism and putting others before yourself.
How many who watch this film actually understand it?
George Bailey is the screens finest example of a socialist. He is continually troubled as he fights his inner demons and innate desire to make his community a better place for all.
The films allogory is clear. On the one hand you have pottersville with all the evils and debauchery that capitalism brings and you have Bedford falls which is an enclave for the caring.
Is it any wonder that the FBI tried to get this film banned?
If only the world was made up of people like George Baileyovski.

The Greatest Film Ever Made,"I have watched this film every year without fail, and I cannot watch the end without crying. AFI says Citizen Kane is the greatest movie, but it takes someone in film school to explain the techniques that make Citizen Kane great. The greatest movie should be one that anyone can see and realize that it's beyond a regular movie. This film is the greatest work of an amazing director and transcends all other films. I've heard people say it's depressing, but what movie is less depressing (as a whole) than this? There are times, yes, that are necessarily very strikingly sad, but it shows how little by little one can forget the plethora of blessings of which a modern life is composed.

A better cast could not have been assembled. The story is simple at that's what makes this film great....a simple device, excellently filmed.

A Walk On The Wild Side With Frank Capra,"A glance at the calendar tells me that we are now safely into February - Christmas and New Years have retreated back to wherever it is that they go to.... and the large balance of the year lies before us until they will intrude again. The smell of holiday ham and homemade pumpkin pie has been extinguished like a used up candle and the strains of Yule melodies have fled the air. Just the perfect time to take a look at ""It's A Wonderful Life' from a different perspective and at an angle which is free from the traditional Christmas messages of redemption and human charity that the movie is usually seen to offer. What I am talking about here is...lechery.....lechery and lasciviousness pure and simple. I am referring to sexual degradation not only in the speculative chimera of Pottersville but also in that great American expository small-town oasis of Bedford Falls.If Frank Capra bothered to read the reviews of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" at the time the picture was first released at Christmastime in 1946--there is little doubt in my mind that he would have been at least slightly disturbed by the assessments made that his new movie was nothing more than just a slight variation from his past efforts. His penchant for fashioning heartwarming films that championed the individualism and strong character of the ""little man"" against the vagaries and injustice of the ""system"" had, after all, given rise to the pejorative term ""Capra-corn"". By 1946, however, it appears that Capra was working hard, if not to change his modus operandi, then to at least ""spice it up a bit"". That is part of the reason he gave us a view into the ""dark side"" of American society by highlighting the filth and sordidness of Pottersville. What few people remark on, however, is that dribs and drabbles of the parallel universe represented by the cesspool of Pottersville can be whiffed every now and then in Bedford Falls itself. You don't believe me? Well let me give you an example.Do you remember the scene in the movie where George Bailey is standing on a street corner shooting the breeze with his pals, Ernie the cab driver and Bert the cop? Yes --another nice sunny day in Bedford Falls. Then Violet Bick strolls by. She is accosted by George who has the impertinence to remark: ""Say Vi that is some dress you got on there."" Violet puts her hand on hip and protests: ""This old thing--I only wear this when I don't care what I look like."" She then shimmies across the street.... the camera following her receding wiggle for almost a good half block. Capra provides some cover for this ogling by having a middle aged bank clerk type pass by and then crank his head around to closely inspect her saunter. He, in turn, is almost flattened by an automobile that is crossing the intersection in the other direction (the sex as death ethos). But this exercise in venality is not finished. The camera then switches back to George and the boys still staring at Violet....... who at this point must be nearing the edge of the horizon. Ernie pipes up: ""How would you like to.....?"" George cuts him off by blurting, ""Yes!"" The trance is broken and Bert stumbles away commenting that he has to go home and see what his wife is doing. Sly and sick Ernie then sarcastically cracks ""family man"". This is a scene fraught with sexual tension, voyeurism with masochistic tendencies and it is occurring in real time in broad daylight on a street corner in Bedford Falls.O.K.--want another example? One without that sexpot Violet Bick---who some reviewers have painted as the ""Mary Magdalene"" to George Bailey's suffering ""Jesus"". Well how about that virgins of virgins--little eighteen year old Mary Hatch? Everyone has witnessed the famous high school dance/pool scene where George and Mary end up soaking wet. The next scene shows them walking home in the dark--George is wearing an over-sized football uniform in lieu of his wet duds and Mary sports nothing more than a robe. This sweet couple gets right down to business by breaking out the windows in a neighborhood house. Then George tries to put a move on Mary at the instigation of a peeping-tom yelling from a nearby porch. Mary jumps out of her robe in the ensuing mêlée and is left shaking and naked in a nearby hydrangea bush. The use of the hydrangea represents, of course, only the most demented form of erotic symbolism. I always send my kids out of the room in anticipation of this scene.I could go on and give more examples --but I think you get the point. Even ""old Annie"" the house-maid is not immune from this carnival of lust and immorality.Please don't misunderstand me- here. I am not condemning the whole picture. I do indeed accept that ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is the ""American Christmas Carol"". It echoes the central idea of the Dicken's tale that we are all responsible for each other and it also adds to that idea the very American conception that ""no man is a failure who has friends."" Wonderful stuff really. But be aware when admiring the glitter of this holiday gold that it also contains the base alloy of sex and sin. Or put another way--it's o.k. to enjoy the rustic pleasures of walking across a beautiful, green farm pasture ----- just be careful to hold your nose and watch your step along the way.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
One of the finest movies ever - a masterpiece.,"I'm not one for watching black & white movies. In face, I specifically turn off when one is on. So when I saw the tail-end of It's A Wonderful Life I quite liked it and thought I'd give it the chance when it came on at Christmas a year later. By the end I could only say it was one of the finest feel-good movies ever, and one of the finest movies ever - period. It's a simple tail of a man called George who's reached his wits end with life and feels everything is going wrong. The story is told in flashback from the point of view of an angel, Clarence, who's been sent by God to make George realise certain things, and gives him the chance to see things from a different perspective. The story is extremely well-told, and the ending will have you cheering. It's heartwarming and was recently rated as one of the top 10 movies ever made.

Over rated because it so darn good,"Once, in the mid 1980's I was visiting someone at a gated community where Frank Capra owned a home and there he was standing by the guard gate talking with the gate keeper. There was Frank Capra, the director responsible for such films as It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith goes to Washington, Meet John Doe, Lost Horizon, You Can't Take it with you, Arsenic and Old Lace, Platinum Blonde and so many others but as I passed by the first film that came to mind was It's a Wonderful Life. Is this film just too indoctrinated in my mind or is it that good of a film? Well, maybe a little of both but it is that good of a film. Is this film over rated? Maybe so but even at it's critical worst it's still a great film. Jimmy Stewart shines as he leads an excellent cast of Donna Reed, Lionel Barrymore, Henry Travers, Ward Bond and Frank Faylen among others. This film was nominated for three of the major Academy Awards including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Jimmy Stewart. It was also nominated for Best Film Editing and Best Sound. Well photographed by cinematographer Joseph F. Biroc who would have a long career in film and beautiful art direction from veteran art director Jack Oakey with music from Dimitri Tiomkin this is a well balanced piece of American Cinema. It's amazing that Capra, who would live until 1991 would only direct five more theatrical features after Wonderful Life in his long life. My only fault with this film is of no fault of the film itself but because it has become somehow the benchmark of Christmas movies and gets too much airplay during the holiday season while other great and near great Christmas-themed movies get overlooked. It's a little sentimental but dark enough not to be a Norman Rockwell painting on film and as over rated as it has become I still can't give it less than a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Only cold hearted people will rate this below 9...,"Frank Capra's ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is completely surprising. This is a time of Film-noir movies where there is a love in the air, mystery lures and the atmosphere is thrilling. But this movie was completely different from it's time. That's the reason why it failed at the Oscars (the same happened with Inception). The story is amazing and it is based on George Bailey's life.We live in the age of action movies with gore and love movies with dirty scenes and all... But still this movie will get you.

Sublime eloquence,"Jimmy Stewart's rendition as George Bailey is staunched, in a heart warming, provocative and emotive semantics, parallelled only in the sublime eloquence that the director has encapsulated an audience for over sixty years. Truly a focal point in the 'golden era' in Hollywood history, oozing and rich in sensual pros, this flamboyant director has mesmerised millions, spurned in conjunction with the diligent personification of co-star, Donna Reed. Perfection at it's best.To coin the phrase, It's a Wonderful Life,is perhaps an adequate sentiment to conclude, therefore no variety of lexical linguistics can do sufficient justice to a movie that has spurned film buffs and critics alike to hail this sublime eloquence.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

On Christmas Eve George is struggling, he feels that he is a failure, and wants to end his life. What happens next is what we all wonder, what would life be like if I was never born.

Inspiration or horror film?,"This piece of Capra-corn certainly inspires a lot of thought. many of us watch it over and over every single year.

Then, I'm comin' back here to go to college and see what they know. And then I'm gonna build things. I'm gonna build airfields, I'm gonna build skyscrapers a hundred stories high, I'm gonna build bridges a mile long.""Mary wishes that he would stay, and he ends up in the Building and Loan with Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell) trying to hold off Old Man Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Why didn't he just run off with Violet (Gloria Grahame) and have some fun? Maybe if he had traveled like Harry (Todd Karns) and Sam (Frank Albertson), he might have learned some things that would have helped the whole country instead of just Bedford Falls.Oh, well, that wouldn't have worked for Frank Capra, but it's fun to dream. While I'm dreaming I just sit back and watch it again.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"It's A Wonderful Picture-""Wonderful Life"" Terrific ****","Who can ever imagine what life would be like without them had they not been born? A very clever idea put to the test in the classic 1946 film, ""It's A Wonderful Life.""As George Bailey, James Stewart truly shined. Anytime he was about to leave his town, tragedy struck and poor George could never leave.Lionel Barrymore steals the show as a cantankerous businessman nearly succeeding in bringing ruin to Bailey.Donna Reed is marvelous as his George's wife. Remember that famous dance scene as the boards open and the young teens fall into the water? That scene in itself is a classic.If we could only see what it would be like had we not been born. We could see that our beloved ones and others may have lived totally different lives with divergent personalities.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Brought a tear to my eye.,This is one of the only movies I bought before I saw it and let me tell you that it is worth it.  Jimmy Stewart IS an actor.  His performance was the driving force in this picture.  The story is so heart-warming that I could feel tears building up inside me.  Possibly becoming one of my all-time favorite movies.

"""A life lived for others is a life worthwhile"" - Albert Einstein","It's a Wonderful Life is a classic movie with a simple plot that, now in the 21st century, may seem clichéd with scenes that are somewhat corny, but take into account the year it was made (1946, making it ""new"" and refreshing, though not necessarily an instant classic at the time of it's release) and more importantly, the message it conveys, and you realize it's more about the message of the piece rather than (as I see it in hindsight) the little quirks that I found so ""corny.""The opening sequence which turned me off at first initially left me questioning those who claimed this work a masterpiece. ""Is this what everyone talked so highly about???"" As the story progressed though, I began to enjoy the story more and could not help but cheer on George Bailey (James Stewart), an everyman who sacrifices his ambitious dreams to help others and subsequently, has a huge impact on his town of Bedford Falls.James Stewart is fantastic as George Bailey! This is his first movie after the war and he felt insecure with his acting abilities, but that definitely doesn't show on screen. Instead, he effectively delivers both sides of Bailey's personality: righteous, loving, ambitious, sacrificing and confident as well as bitter, frustrated, with high temperament and vulnerability. These juxtaposed personalities show James Stewarts versatility and raw talent in one of his most beloved roles.Donna Reed, who plays Stewart's Wife Mary Bailey, and Lionel Barrymore, who plays the wicked, monopolizing antagonist Mr. Henry Potter, both deliver fantastic performances as well. Donna Reed and James Stewart's chemistry is believable as seen in one of my favorite scenes-- the ""telephone scene."" I was surprised to find out it took only one take to film such passion and emotion. And Lionel exudes such evil that you cannot help but feel angry towards him.The acting is excellent, the direction by the great Frank Capra amazing, the scenes breathtaking and set magnificent (4 acres of RKO's Encino Ranch!--see trivia). This film just wowed me on all different levels of technicalities.But on top of all of that, this movie made me see my life in a different light. It made me want to help others more than I already do, just the small things even and appreciate the people that I come into contact with everyday of my life, learning that they have had a major or minor impact on me, an impact nonetheless, and I on them. To want to waste or give up on Life is to waste away or give up something so Wonderful.A movie is truly great if it moves the human soul and this one is one of them. If you haven't seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"" ... I strongly suggest you do-- during your highest or lowest, it will only bring you up. =)",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Big-Box Swindle of Bedford Falls,"For many, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a staple to their holiday traditions. With all major networks vying to get their hands on this mediocre blockbuster, this little film transforms from ordinary to cult status every holiday. As a viewer, outside of the final act, this Jimmy Stewart classic is more than just a Christmas movie, but instead a powerful Capra film that demonstrates an America from long ago. It shows a small-town America, without the plowed Wal-Mart roads or big-box makeovers. For this critic, it demonstrates the power of independent business, and why we may never find this type of service ever again. As an independent, downtown shop owner of about a year and a half myself; ""It's A Wonderful Life"" transformed this viewing from holiday pastime to dedicated film exposing the corruptive nature of capitalism as well as the realism of independent business. With this change in tact, Jimmy Stewart's words become more emotional, Donna Reed's actions become more honest, and our little Christmas film transforms into a man's journey to search for himself. I cannot denounce that this is a holiday film, Stewart screams ""Merry Christmas"" throughout the entire ending, but before that final conclusion there are about two hours of small town America and one man's struggle to escape. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a powerful blend of realism and fantasy, individualism and community, dreams and truth, as well as frustration and joy. The cast is superbly placed in their respective roles and Capra's action behind the camera stands boldly in place. This is not just a movie, but an experience coupled with foreshadowing  giving George not just a glimpse of a world without him  but also a glimpse of a world without small business""It's A Wonderful Life"", the film itself, is beautifully crafted. With new editions being released each season, one can easily see the crisp beauty of Capra's image. Its characters; George Bailey, Mary, Sam Wainright, Potter, Bert and Ernie, and even Clarence seem to jump from the screen, giving us imaginative citizens to this quaint town of Bedford Falls. Capra not only gives these characters spirits and souls, but also the town. Capra built three blocks of Bedford Falls so that he could capture the honesty of the town that Stewart so adamantly wanted to leave  and upon doing this gave this little town a soul of its own. Watching this film, Stewart's portrayal of George Bailey runs the gambit of powerhouse acting. Stewart, freshly back from the war, was worried if he could carry the weight of Bailey's cynicism. His ability to care for Bedford Falls, while always dreaming of wanting to escape could only be portrayed through Stewart's Americana eyes. When he screams at Mary, denouncing his desire to be on the ground floor in plastics, or when he yells at Potter's bid to join him  we scream with him. This film works from an acting standpoint because we believe in the characters  we trust the actors to give us a slice of their souls for these roles  and they do. One cannot fault anyone in this film for their acting and that is a rarity in today's Hollywood.Capra's eye in this film seems far more advanced than the credit he has received. His enormous sets, the birth of a new ""snow"", and his ability to create a world we care for without having to travel the globe. What I enjoy about ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is that Capra tricks you by the end. Here we believe, outside of the brief opening, that this is just your typical drama, a man's life is shown in scope so that he can see his full worth, but then sneakily Capra brings in (depending on your religious basis) a huge science-fiction element that was unheard of during the time. One cannot argue the validity of science fiction vs. religion in this film  since Joseph is portrayed by the stars and planets. Sure, Clarence was an angel, but there is this aura of the supernatural. Clarence offers no evidence that he is, in fact, sent by the man upstairs, so one has to question the time this film was released, the faith in spirituality, and the fact that Capra's Clarence could be alien, vegetable, or mineral.Overall, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" remains in constant rotation no matter the time of year in my home. The acting is superb, the sci-fi element seems fresh every time, and the growing fact that George Bailey is pro-independent business means quite a bit in this rushed Wal-Mart world. Bailey, and this film, is the voice for the little man, the quiet shopkeeper who doesn't want to sell to Potter, but instead dreams of keeping their home-style values. The spark between Potter and Bailey can be seen in every facet of today's growing world, as the rich continue to get richer  the less fortunate work harder and feel more held back. Dreams are traded for jobs  communities are strengthened by friendships. This film is a time capsule for the future, as we discover convenience overcomes customer service; it is nice to look back and see a world like Bedford Falls. The science fiction element to this film, yep  that is what I am considering it  comes in sharp and remains powerful throughout. Did anyone else see Jimmy Stewart's eyes throughout those scenes? Brilliant! While this film will remain a staple through the holidays, I persist that you watch it away from the holiday to see the real message behind the film. Capra was a genius in creating this film, and subsequently crafted a cult film that will remain forever. Even today, nearly thirty years since my first viewing, I am more impressed that ever. It is a film that grows with you, and that is quite a rarity in today's cinema.Grade: ***** out of *****",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"A good message film which I really wanted to like, but I just wish that it hadn't been so boring","It's a wonderful life chronicles the life of George Bailey (James Stewart) from his early childhood right through to his adult years when he ends up taking over his father's building & loan business after his father passes away.This was a film that I really wanted to like since it does have a lot of heart & warmth to it, but the problem for me is that it was so dull and tedious. I understand that everything that is depicted in George's life did eventually serve a purpose in the context of the narrative, but if I'm being honest I found the journey from A to B to be rather uninteresting. The other problem is that this uninteresting aspect of George's life is dragged out for about 2/3 of the film (had the film been 90 minutes long that probably would have been just about OK, but in a film that is over 2 hours long it's just unforgivable). I just couldn't get involved in the story, I didn't care about the characters and pretty much lost interest in the film.Focusing on the positives, I thought that Stewart was excellent and this is probably the best I've ever seen from him. Likewise, Donna Reed was also really good and I thought that they both had really good chemistry together.Another big positive to be taken from this film is its message and the best way I can describe it without spoiling anything is 'Be Careful what you wish for'. The last 30 minutes of this film were excellent and if I was to rate the last 30 minutes alone I would give it a 9 or a 10. The ending of the film is particularly good and is actually quite moving and it's just a shame that the first 2/3 of the film was so boring.Even though I've only rated this film a 4 out of 10, I would still recommend watching this film because as a 'message' film it's absolutely first rate. However, no matter how good the message is with this film, for me, it didn't make up for how tedious and boring the majority of the film was as a whole.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Frank Capra's masterpiece is a joy to behold,"It's a Wonderful Life tells the story of George Bailey, a man who lives in the small town of Bedford Falls. George has one big dream, that being to escape Bedford Falls and explore the world, but sometimes life gets in the way of our dreams, and things don't always work out as planned.From pretty much the first scene this film puts a big smile on my face, with the ballroom scene being a particular favourite of mine. There's a wonderful pacing throughout, with the story told at a decent pace; every minute having a purpose and moving the story forwards.Jimmy Stewart, one of the greats, puts in a performance for the ages as George Bailey, a wonderful blend of sensitivity, vulnerability and frustration. In Stewart's hands, George becomes a truly 3-dimensional character, a flawed human, but made all the better by those flaws. Someone all of us would be happy to have in our lives.There is, of course, a deep moral undertone to this film, that can come across as a little bit heavy-handed. However, the message is so universal and told in such a beautiful package that it's easy to forgive any slight missteps.It's a Wonderful Life isn't a perfect film, but like it's central character, in many ways it's made all the better because of its flaws. It's immensely rewatchable, but still manages to give something on each viewing. Also, however many times I watch it, it never fails to make me shed a tear. Our lives are even more wonderful because we have amazing pieces of art like this film in it, and for that I'd like to thank Frank Capra, Jimmy Stewart and everyone else involved in creating this masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Holiday Classic,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" delves deep into the human spirit, showcasing the profound impact of individual lives on a community. Directed by Frank Capra, this film stars James Stewart as George Bailey, a man who comes to understand his significance in the world through an unexpected guardian angel, Clarence. George's journey from despair to renewed appreciation for life underscores the film's central theme: the value of selflessness and community.Capra masterfully blends humor and heartache, creating a narrative that resonates universally. The film's portrayal of Bedford Falls and its inhabitants offers a microcosm of post-war American society, yet its messages of hope, resilience, and the importance of human connection transcend time and geography.The cinematography and iconic scenes - such as George running through the snow-covered streets of Bedford Falls or the dramatic moment on the bridge - are etched into cinematic history.

It's a Wonderful Life is a wonderful film!,"I know I should probably give this movie 10/10 but the only things that I don't like about it is that it's not as Christmasy as I thought it would be and it takes a long time to get to the punch line of the film about what a miserable place Bedford Falls would be like if George Bailey was never born.But it's still a classic and it's a real heart- felt movie! And what makes it a Christmas classic is that it's all about caring for others and how important family and friends are.James Stewart (one of the greatest actors of all time), gave a lot of classics and memorable performances in his time, and George Bailey is truly one of his best. It's a crime that he never got an Oscar for it. George Bailey, ever since he was a kid, wants to go traveling and build bridges and buildings and make something of himself. But something that had to do with either his friends or family got in the way of living his dreams. But what makes George so memorable is that he always puts others before himself.The supporting cast like Donna Reed (Mary Hatch), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy) and Henry Travers (Clarence) all do wonderfully in their roles as well. But Lionel Barrymore as the mean and greedy Mr. Potter (who reminds me of Mr. Burns from The Simpsons) shows how despicable a person can be. And Frank Capra's directing is masterful. And the ending is what always makes me smile and feel good because George realizes it's a wonderful life after all.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
When You Wish Upon A Star,"Why should any open-minded open-hearted person want to dis this particular film? The same as with millions of other people it's my favourite Christmas film, and a classic I've always enjoyed for all kinds of wholesome reasons, with a heartwarming moral I know I am and which everyone should be the richer for the experience.James Stewart has plans to do what he wants to and travel the world but is constantly thwarted with those plans and ends up not going and staying all his life in his crummy little town as a bank manager. His is a long story of self-sacrifice until a crisis is reached and the film veers into a charming and cathartic fantasy. Everyone played their parts perfectly, but Stewart was the essential part: it wouldn't have worked as well without his usual affecting intensity, the gulping emotion he displayed was knockout. The story was an excellent All-American updated retread of Christmas Carol with the moral surely just as decent and incontrovertible. It's worn very well, and I've never needed to watch it with rose-tinted spectacles or an excess of seasonal slush – the first time I saw it UK Channel 4 showed it one July presumably after the copyright had been allowed to lapse in the 80's. On the other hand as the decades have gone by the hype has been ratcheted up to hopefully sell Christmas DVD's, streams etc; there were only about twenty people in the local cinema to see it last night – a ten-day run is probably too much.I like slushy sentimentality with a strong and timeless moral – that is if it's handled well, as was this lovely little film.

Review,"The movie It's A Wonderful Life reminds me of movies such as The Christmas Carol, The Polar Express, and related movies. It is one centered a round Christmas and the feeling of giving, being happy with your family, community uniting, and the theme that good wins over evil. It lightly touches on the reality of being in the battle field when in times on war but mostly focuses on the reality of staying in one's hometown while the war is ongoing to keep the community safe from greedy business people. In addition, a religious belief is mixed in with the characters backstory which makes sense towards the end of the movie where an angel comes to Earth to save a particular someone. The movie clearly is made to give hope and optimism for the aftermath of the war that was happening at the time. A lot of people were struggling with poverty, paying inflated taxes, and having a hard time to find food. Much of this was seen in the film which is why I think made it relatable for the audience at the time. With so much darkness and negativity that had happened with the war this movie helped entertain the people for a short time. If I lived during that time and were to watch It's A Wonderful Time in theaters, I feel that I would tear up from having a film somewhat understand and lightly showcase the challenges of the citizens. This is movie I would recomen to watch again.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Capra's Best Film,"Well, I thought Mr. Smith Goes to Washington was going to be Frank Capra's crowning achievement. I hadn't seen It's a Wonderful Life in a very long time, knowing it through cultural osmosis, and I was genuinely surprised at how into the struggle of a life for George Bailey got to me. The one film that was supposed to mark his independence from studios (after having left Harry Cohn and Columbia after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, he only made a couple of films with Warner Bros. Before partnering with William Wyler and a couple of others to make Liberty Films), but it famously underperformed at the box office, failing to make back its production budget in rentals. If I were to point fingers, it would be trying to make an expensive movie and trying to work around the studios, that owned most theaters, at the height of the studio system. It needed to break further before this sort of thing could work financially.Everything about this film is small in scale, but it's written on the epic scope of the human face of George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart), resident of the small New York town Bedford Falls who dreams of leaving the little life he leads as the son of a man who runs a Building a Loan, Pa Bailey (Samuel S. Hinds). He's going to go off to college after having delayed it to help Pa through the difficult times. He has to give it all up, though, when Pa dies, giving up the money to his younger brother Harry (Todd Karns) to go in his stead. This is one major event of George's life where he has plans on leaving Bedford Falls, and he ends up finding reasons to stay.And that is the heart of the film: George Bailey giving up his own dreams to see the world and build grand things in favor of staying behind to look after the Building and Loan. The life he builds is happy, including marrying Mary Hatch (Donna Reed), having two children, and seeing the Building and Loan through a series of bad times, all of which the wannabe oligarch Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore) tries to take advantage of to buy up the Building and Loan in an effort to wipe out his one major competition in the town since he also owns the bank. Through it all, we see George's dreams slowly die, carried remarkably well by Stewart who has these quiet moments in between the modest joys of a small life well-lived where you can see that he's just crushed by the dissolution of his dreams one more time.All of this is told in flashback as angels, represented by stars and galaxies in the sky, explain to the lesser angel Clarence (Henry Travers), George's life and how he got to the point where the final act takes place, where his uncle, Billy (Thomas Mitchell), has lost eight thousand dollars, a situation that Mr. Potter will use to try and get rid of George forever by calling the police and sending him to jail, a situation that takes this ground down man, though he may be leading a life he can enjoy it's not the life he wanted, and sending him over the edge.It's really kind of a weird movie, but it's so rooted in character that it works amazingly well. That central character, George, is such a good man, the kind of guy who can talk about lassoing the moon to win Mary's heart as both a heartfelt gesture to a pretty girl after he and her fell into the high school swimming pool at a dance as well as an expression of his desire to flee Bedford Falls at the same time. He's a man with conflicting desires, and he always ends up having to tamp down on the one side of him that he thinks he wants most. The portrait of Potterville that Clarence shows George, should George never have been born, that he had built something: America as Capra envisioned and desired.There are several ironies running through the film, and the first one to point out is that Potterville is effectively just the worst drags of New York City. It's not some futuristic vision, it's just pulling the outside world that George wanted to go to and bringing it home to him, bringing the corruption of the big city and the outside world to the little towns of America, which was prescient in its own right. George hating the invasion of the outside world, as Capra shows it, is a wonderful irony just under the surface. The other major irony is that George expressed desire to build great things with a college education, but all he had was Bedford Falls and running the Building and Loan, though which he helped build Bedford Falls.The emotional catharsis that works through it all is that George is a good man who sacrificed everything he wanted to lead a small life when he wanted a large one. He had small successes instead of massive ones. He led a good life, a wonderful one even, and he couldn't see it. The whole thing is about how he helped the world around him, largely thanklessly, heading off bank runs and other disasters in order to keep his father's business open and providing the capital necessary for people to take on debt at reasonable rates in order to pull themselves up the social ladder in ways that Potter won't.Potter continues the portraiture of the uncaring rich in Capra's vision, and George continues Capra's vision of help coming from the people themselves. George isn't anything more than an everyman who does the small things everyday to help those around him, the personalization of the people who run into the bank in American Madness to deposit rather than withdraw during that bank run. Capra's is a vision for how the American people are their only savior for their own troubles.There's so much joy in the film's finale, but it's a counterbalance to all the frustrations and terrible luck that George has had through his life. The film isn't saccharine in the least. It well earns its feel good ending by showing George being a good man beset by bad luck and making the most of it along the way. He's helped people because it's in his nature, and they come out to help him, showing that he's not as alone as he thought.It really is heart-warming and joyful and life-affirming in all the best ways. If George were simply a good man who got good things in the end, it wouldn't work. But he's a good man who's beset by troubles, finds how much his own life has been worth, and is rewarded for it in the end. That works wonderfully well.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The film is simple but charming, well written, well directed and well acted.

I also agree that it is one of the greatest films ever made, its just I see the film a little different when taken as a whole.Where most people see this film as a happy one for all the obvious reasons, including that ending, I see it as one of the most depressing and sad stories ever made. Ask yourself the question, why did he want to commit suicide in the first place. The reason is that throughout the first half of the film/story, all you see is everyone doing what they want, including his brother. Whereas he is forced via circumstance or emotional blackmail to stay and cater to the wants of everyone else. Where were the 'friends and family' when things got bad, why didn't anyone see what was going on. The main reason was cause they were more concerned with themselves. The outcome of all this is the famous bridge seen. And in my eyes, even Clarence ended up using him to get his wings.By showing him what life for all those he has helped, would be like if he hadn't existed, is if anything, another case of emotional blackmail. He is again made to feel bad and ungrateful for his lot.My point is, why didn't anyone ask him what he wanted and then help him go for it etc.My final comment is, when you next watch this film, or read this comment, take a look around you and see if anyone you know and care about is quietly sinking and give them a helping hand before it gets too bad. The chances are if they are your friend or part of your family, they have already helped you and now they quietly need your help.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Heartfelt Experience,"What an amazing piece of cinema; with a deep perspective on human nature. Right from the get-go this movies creates such a humane feel.I watched it in August and it had such a profund effect on me, it brought me to tears and I haven't been able to do that in quite a long time. Some important realizations came to me after watching it; like how I approach life in general, how do I feel about other people, am I happy with how things are ?Last, but not least, this movie portrays how connected we are with each other; the way we reach our highest potential is by relating with one another and by giving more, rather than receiving.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Inspiration,"I usually do not enjoy old movies but my acting coach had recommended me to watch this film as I was going to produce, write and act in my own film. This film was not only inspirational but beautifully written. It was heartfelt and was very touching. I especially loved the scenes containing conversations between the stars in the universe. That really added the comedy aspect of the film.The message of the film was moving and relatable to life in general. Furthermore, the music composed really added a great touch to the underlying emotion and setting of the film.

A Christmas carol done poorly,"There are so many weird directorial or acting choices in this movie that it really draws you out of the story. Does he like Mary or hate the idea of her? Not obvious. Are they 52 but in high school? Random crow for....??? It's a mediocre version of A Christmas Carol. Jimmy Stewart knew how to act at one point I guess....but if this is good acting, then I'm glad this era is gone. Mary carries the movie, she's a decent character and well acted. She's the hero.

Luckily, the end scene where everyone chips in money and sings auld Lang syne is actually quite a great scene and effective only scene in this version of a Christmas carol that would be worth working into other version somehow.",4.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Life,"I don't know how many times I've see It's a Wonderful Life over the years. But after seeing a clip from it in The Ref a couple weeks ago and after hearing references to it in various findings on the internet, I got a hankering to watch it again over the holiday season (I was a day late for Christmas, but close enough). This was the first time I'd watched it in years, and I was amazed how much more you pick up in such a familiar film when you're older.I was surprised by the overt sexual overtones in at least two scenes between George and Mary that I was to young to recognize in years past. And, while this was more of a reminder than a realization, the depth of darkness this film reaches is quite shocking, especially for its time. And yet there was always a shimmer of light in that darkness. I was struck by the scene (major spoilers if any of you haven't seen this classic film) when George is contemplating suicide. Even at his darkest hour, at the lowest point in his life, when he sees Clarence jump in, he doesn't give a second thought to go in after him and save him. What a testament to the ultimate goodness of man.Not only is It's a Wonderful Life a classic holiday film, but it's also an all around great movie for anytime. It is a wonderful story filled with many great characters. It contains many thought-provoking themes on how we effect the lives of others, even if we don't realize it, and what would happen if these effects were taken away or changed.On a side note, I was extremely disappointed to see that the DVD release of this film includes a colorized edition. It's sad that in this day and age we feel like we have to change things to make them more appealing rather than appreciating it the way it was intended, for it's original artistry.Check out my other reviews at whatnot at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

An abouslte classic,"This is a really good movie. I honestly Don't think it is really a Christmas movie but it is still a movie I only watch at Christmas time. Personally I think that this movie has one of the best messages in a movie ever. Also you can only watch it in black and white. It's a rule.GREAT:
The last 30 minutes is just amazing. Clarence helping George show him that he's had a wonderful life and that he is important is really compelling and I think it is easily the best part. Honestly they movie is worth watching just for that. Also the ending is really really good and is such a beautiful conclusion to this beautiful movie. I think George Bailey is a really complex and honestly really tragic character and it makes the ending so much better. He finally gets his time to shine and I think it is awesome.BAD:
The beginning, and middle, is really really slow. It is a kinda fun life film but it is still just really slow and honestly boring. Now for the time I think it was awesome but now it's kinda hard to get through.Now why did I give it a 8/10? The end is just that good. That last 30 minutes is worth watching this film for and just that. It is also such a classic and gives me memories about watching ot with my Grandpa. And that's the reason I love it.

It doesn't take anything special to live/make a wonderful... life/movie.,"The movie is beautiful. Although it took 1 hour to get me interested on what was happening on screen. Afterwards the film is a bit intense but kind of plain.It's a Wonderful Life is like a fable.

A Christmas Carol in Reverse,"Supernatural fantasies were popular on both sides of the Atlantic during the late forties and early fifties, possibly because the heavy death toll during World War II had made people think about the possibility of an afterlife. ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is one of a number of such films from this period; others include ""Portrait of Jennie"", ""The Ghost and Mrs Muir"", ""One Touch of Venus"" and, from Britain, ""A Matter of Life and Death"" and ""Pandora and the Flying Dutchman"".This is also an early example of the Christmas film, a genre which has today become ten-a-penny. The main action takes place on Christmas Eve and it was first released on December 20th 1946. The film was originally a disappointment at the box-office, but quickly became one of the most loved films in American cinema, and the tradition has grown up of showing it on television during the Christmas season. The plot has something in common with that other Christmas classic, ""A Christmas Carol"", although it might be truer to say that ""It's a Wonderful Life"" is ""A Christmas Carol"" in reverse. Dickens' story tells the story of a selfish, greedy man who is saved from greed and selfishness by supernatural intervention. Frank Capra's film rather tells the story of a man who has tried to live a selfless life but who needs to be saved from despair when he comes to believe himself a failure. The film also figures, in Henry Potter, an antagonist who has similarities with the unreformed Ebenezer Scrooge.George Bailey is the manager of a small Building and Loan Association in the small New England town of Bedford Falls. We see his life told in a series of flashbacks. George was originally a man of lofty ambitions who, as a boy, dreamed of becoming a famous explorer and later wanted to be a great architect or engineer. The early death of his father, however, led to him taking over management of the Building and Loan, a business which his idealistic father had started with the express intention of helping the ordinary people of Bedford Falls to build or buy homes at moderate rates of interest. George, however, faces opposition from his arch-enemy Potter, a rapacious slum landlord and grasping capitalist businessman; Potter hates the Building and Loan because it can undercut the extortionate rates charged by his own bank. Potter's dishonest machinations lead to the Building and Loan facing insolvency and George himself facing criminal charges of embezzlement. In despair, George resolves to commit suicide. What saves him is the intervention of his guardian angel, Clarence Odbody who, by showing George how different life in his community would be had he never been born, persuades him that he has done an immense amount of good in his life and that life is worth living.The above synopsis could have formed the basis of a horribly sentimental story, and the film is not entirely free of sentimentality, particularly in its idealised view of small-town life and its treatment of the courtship of George and his wife Mary. The picture drawn by Clarence of what Bedford Falls would be like had George never lived also seems exaggerated; the town, renamed Pottersville, is dominated by Potter, who has filled it with sleazy nightclubs, gambling joints, pawn shops and bars. Its people are cynical, selfish and immoral. It struck me as rather extreme to suggest that the life of one good man was all that stood between Potter and his ambition of turning Bedford Falls into the Las Vegas of the North-East. (For one thing, small-town businessmen, however corrupt and unscrupulous, do not generally possess the political muscle to overturn State anti-gambling laws).What saves the film from turning into pure treacle is the characterisation of the two main roles. Angels have traditionally been portrayed as young, beautiful, all-wise and androgynous, but Clarence is an elderly man who is not even very good at his job. He has been in Heaven for two hundred years, but has not yet earned his wings- according to the film angels are only given their wings after performing some meritorious deed- and his mission to save George is his chance to redeem himself. Although George may be an idealist, he is not idealised, and is far from flawless; he can, for example, be bad-tempered. It is the interaction between these two characters, Henry Travers' shambling, kindly, eccentric angel and James Stewart's flawed, frustrated idealist which lies at the heart of the film. Both actors are excellent, and Stewart earned a ""Best Actor"" nomination. Donna Reed is rather bland as the impossibly perfect Mary, but there is another memorable contribution from Lionel Barrymore as Potter. Stewart and Barrymore had earlier worked together with Capra in his ""You Can't Take It with You"", and Stewart had appeared in his ""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"".Capra was born in Italy, but became an ardent patriot for his adopted country, and many of his films celebrate what he considered to be American values. (""Mr Smith Goes to Washington"" is another example).The lasting popularity of ""It's a Wonderful Life"" can perhaps be attributed to its quiet celebration of small-town values, of basic decency, of friendship, of generosity, of idealism, of community spirit and of faith in a benevolent providence. Yet Capra is not afraid to criticise other cherished American values- the figure of Potter can be taken as a critique of untrammeled free-market capitalism- nor to face up to the darker side of life, to despair, to selfishness and to villainy. The false values of Pottersville may have been vanquished in Bedford Falls, but as audiences in 1946 would have been aware, those values still prevailed in many real-life communities. In the contest between good and evil, victory can never be taken for granted. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a wonderful life - Gelmi review,"Probably when it came out (1946) this was the best film made up to that time (although they probably didn't think so at the time, as the influence of Gone with the Wind was still strong) so it deserves a 10, considering its age, but gets a 9, as it is not a film that can stand the test of time. Let's be clear, it is a film that is still spectacular to watch today, only it is made as a fairy tale, a method that is now in disuse. It's a wonderful life is a film that gives hope, unbelievable but true, this film manages to convey hope in a person, thanks to the last scene in which the protagonist realises the beauty of life. The film has an improbable ending, but little does it matter (after all, it is still a fairy tale) James Stewart's exceptional performance demonstrates how versatile an actor he is, from going from remarkable westerns to sentimentally committed films like this one.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
the film reminds viewers of the inherent goodness of humanity and the power of kindness to triumph over despair,"""It's a Wonderful Life,"" released in 1946 and directed by Frank Capra, remains a timeless classic that continues to touch hearts and inspire audiences decades after its initial release. Set in the fictional town of Bedford Falls, the film follows the story of George Bailey, portrayed masterfully by James Stewart, a compassionate and selfless man who finds himself at the end of his rope on Christmas Eve.The film beautifully captures the essence of the holiday spirit, emphasizing the importance of love, sacrifice, and the impact of one's actions on the lives of others. Through a series of events, George Bailey is shown what life would have been like had he never been born, leading him to realize the profound effect he has had on his community and loved ones.James Stewart delivers a captivating performance, perfectly embodying the earnestness and resilience of George Bailey as he navigates through the trials and tribulations of life. His portrayal evokes both empathy and admiration, making George Bailey a truly unforgettable character.The supporting cast, including Donna Reed as George's devoted wife Mary, and Lionel Barrymore as the cantankerous but ultimately redeemable Mr. Potter, further enrich the narrative with their nuanced performances.What sets ""It's a Wonderful Life"" apart is its timeless message of hope and redemption.

Classic Capra-Corn,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" is probably the most cherished of Frank Capra's trademark feel-good movies of the 30's & 40's. James Stewart plays George Bailey, a compassionate small-town businessman who becomes despondent when faced with a financial crisis. When he decides to do away with himself for the insurance money an angel arrives to convince him to reconsider.James Stewart, in the lead role, gives a legendary performance, one which was recognized with an Oscar nomination. That being said, the supporting cast is also well-stocked, including such notables as Lionel Barrymore, Donna Reed, Thomas Mitchell & Henry Travers. That's not to mention some others in smaller roles like Gloria Grahame, Ward Bond & H.B. Warner.Capra's direction is as good as always and resulted in an Oscar nomination. The editing & sound were also recognized with Oscar nominations but Dimitri Tiomkin's stirring score was not. The screenplay, based on a story by Philip Van Doren Stern, contains some quality material but the fantasy elements could be considered a bit corny by some.Overall, ""It's a Wonderful Life"" still delivers the goods as a feel-good holiday classic more than sixty years after its release.

No such piece of art has ever before combined laughter and tears of sadness in me before and that is the miracle of the movie.

The Squirrel,"Every holiday season It's A Wonderful Life is dragged out and played multiple times ad nauseum for the easily entertained masses who gush about it being their ""favorite movie OF ALL TIME!"" (Even better than the christmas movies made in the 13th Century? After all, we are talking ""of all time"" here.) The suicidal and the religious crazies like the idea of an ""angel"" in the form of a bumbling simpleton swooping in to save their pathetic lives, but don't hold your breath waiting for your Clarence. Up your meds and talk to your shrink instead. There are many christmas movies much better, but this grossly overrated film generates the most comments. Evidently, the die-hard fans don't mind seeing a boy being physically abused until his ear bleeds or listening to the annoyingly shrill and screeching manner in which James Stewart often delivers his lines. What's most puzzling is why Mary is attracted to George in the first place. He has about as much sex appeal as a wet fart. Others have written that they ""like the happy ending."" WHAT happy ending? Mr. Potter gets away with stealing $8000. If he had been arrested and sent to prison or had his wheel chair rolled off a cliff with him in it, THAT would have been a happy ending. The cornball ""hee-haw"" thing was especially annoying and overdone, but other cornballs out there probably think it's hilarious. Personally, the only thing I like about this ""classic"" is Uncle Billy's pet squirrel. He out-acted them all and should have won a special animal Oscar.

A Timeless Tale of Hope and Redemption,"Watching ""It's a Wonderful Life"" for the first time was like stepping into a warm embrace on a cold winter's night. I remember the anticipation building as the lights dimmed, and the familiar opening notes of the score filled the room. I had heard so much about this classic, yet I was unprepared for the emotional journey I was about to embark on.From the moment James Stewart graced the screen as George Bailey, I was captivated. His portrayal of a man burdened by dreams unfulfilled yet rich in love and community struck a chord deep within me. The way he navigated the trials of life-his aspirations, his sacrifices, and ultimately his despair-felt achingly real. I found myself reflecting on my own life choices, the paths I had taken, and those I had left unexplored.The film's message resonated with me in a way I hadn't anticipated. It wasn't just a holiday movie; it was a profound commentary on the value of life itself. The moments of joy, the struggles, and the connections we forge with others are what truly define our existence. I felt a wave of gratitude wash over me as I watched George realize how many lives he had touched, how his seemingly mundane existence had a ripple effect on his community.The cinematography, though simple by today's standards, had a timeless charm that transported me to a different era. The small-town setting, the bustling streets, and the warmth of the Bailey household felt like a nostalgic trip back to a simpler time. I found myself smiling at the little moments-the laughter, the love, the shared struggles-that made life so wonderfully complex.By the time the credits rolled, I was left in a contemplative silence, my heart full. I couldn't help but think about the people in my life who have made a difference, the simple acts of kindness that often go unnoticed. This film reminded me that every life has value, and sometimes, we need a little nudge to see just how wonderful our own lives truly are.""It's a Wonderful Life"" is more than just a film; it's a reminder to cherish every moment, to appreciate the connections we have, and to recognize the impact we can make in the lives of others.

This Movie Hits You Hard if You've Been Hit Hard By Life.,"Just a note, don't watch this in color! The first 2/3 of this film are so powerful, I could not stop crying at times, even now, I cry thinking about some of these things. When I was a teenager, I didn't get it, I thought ""Well, that was a decent movie, but I don't understand why people think it is amazing."" Flash forward 20 years, and I get it now. I grew up faster than most and had a lot of life experience compared to my peers, but even then I still just thought it was a ""good"" movie"". I can see now that this is a lot more than that and I get why people have been touched by it over the years.I have watched quite a few movies with Jimmy Stewart, and yes, I do think this is his best film and his best performance. The raw emotion in some of the scenes, particularly where he is yelling at his family and taking his frustration out on those around him is palpable and real. I can say in my life I've seen people act exactly like this, and he nailed it 100%. The courtship between him and Donna Reed has a lot of chemistry as well, it is just really well acted. Even Mr. Potter is well played, and even though he is quite the jerk, he isn't played so much like a ruthless evil person, but almost like an Ebenezer Scrooge who never realized the error of his ways.This is a drama/fantasy made in the 1940's, but the themes are just as relevant as they were in 1946, I would argue even more so. With the government over the last year violating the constitution and threatening people with fines and other things to force people to stay home or wear a mask or attempting to force vaccination, there has been a HUGE uptick in suicide and drug or alcohol related deaths, these things have been muted by the media, or blamed on other things, but the government overreach is to blame. The people hit by the heaviest tyranny sometimes don't see value in living, and it is easy to understand when the life you knew was wrongfully stolen away. However, these people should watch ""It's a Wonderful Life"" all the way through, ideally sober. Our lives DO have meaning, and yes, just one person can and does make a big difference to the people around them. There is no better film that shows this than ""It's a Wonderful Life"".This movie is timeless, and it should rank up there as one of the greatest films of all time, not just the greatest Christmas film of all time, it is that good. The story, despite differences in society, is every bit as impactful as it was 85yrs ago, and the themes are 100% applicable to today. I don't recommend watching it alone, watch it with family or really close friends.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The ultimate Christmas movie,"George Bailey lives in a small town, Bedford Falls, with his wife and children. He has spent most of his life preserving Bedford Falls' almost idyllic existence and preventing it from effectively being taken over by Mr Potter, the local bigshot. Then one Christmas Eve, George makes a massive blunder, one that has dire financial consequences. He contemplates killing himself, thinking the town and his family would be better off without him...The Christmas classic. Yes, it's overtly and unashamedly idealistic, sentimental, schmaltzy, emotionally manipulative and a bit cheesy, but it's impossible to dislike. The movie's sheer sweetness, innocence and joyful purpose ensure it hits the spot. Very emotional.Jimmy Stewart's signature role and the role he was born to perform. I couldn't think of anyone else who could have played George Bailey.Good supporting cast, especially Donna Reed.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Christmas,"I was not a fan of this movie. It's an older film, so that could have been another factor of why I didn't enjoy this movie. But, I will say what I enjoyed about this film. I enjoyed the main idea that, when it seems all is lost, hope kicks in to show you that there are many things in this world that money can't buy. This movie I feel like is more for audiences who are over the age of fifty. The story was also really slow and the pacing of the movie was not fast at all. Back to some good things I enjoyed about this film. It did a good job putting you into the Christmas spirit. It's definitely the typical old Christmas movie that you think of. I would say this is more of a one and done type of movie. You watch it once and that's all you need. If you like the classic type movies, give this a watch at least once.",3.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

It's a Wonderful Life,"It's a Wonderful Life (1946) was produced and directed by Frank Apra. The film is about George Bailey, played by James Stewart, who dreams of leaving Bedford Falls, his home town, to travel around world. Unfortunately, a chain of events prevent him from realizing his dream. His father, who owned the family savings and loan, had a stroke. After the death of his father, George agrees to manage the savings and loan until his brother graduates from college. However, his brother gets married and accepts a job working with his father in law. George continues to run the family business. He eventually marries Mary, (Donna Reed) his childhood sweetheart, and they settle down to raise their four children.On Christmas Eve, Uncle Billy, played by Thomas Mitchell, loses the $8,000 bank deposit. He absent mindedly placed the money in a newspaper, and gave the paper to Henry Potter, (Lionel Barrymore). Henry Potter was the major shareholder in the Bedford Falls Building and Loan. Potter keeps the money because he wants the bank to fail, and George to go to jail. George and Uncle Billy are unable to find the money. George asks Potter for a loan. Potter turns him down, and reports him to the authorities. George gets drunk and tries to commit suicide by crashing his car into a tree. After realizing that his plan did not work, he staggers to the town bridge. Before he can jump, Clarence, (Henry Tavers) his guardian angel, jumps in and pretends to be drowning. George rescues him and he discovers that Clarence is his guardian angel. Clarence convinces George that he has a wonderful life, by showing him what life in Bedford Falls would be like without him.The theme of the film is that every life is important. Everyone is important, and everyone contributes to the greater good. George based his worth on the things that he did not accomplish. Therefore, he believed that Bedford Falls would be a better place without him. George was so focused on the negative that he forgot about the good things that he had accomplished; and all the people that he had helped. Through a series of flashbacks, Clarence convinces George that his life was important. Sound was used throughout the movie to provide transitions between two sequences. The actors projected naturalness, sincerity and truthfulness. Henry Potter and Clarence Odbody provided the theme of good and evil throughout the movie. The movie reminded me of Ebenezer Scrooge, by Charles Dickens. The movie shows us the importance of recognizing the good that we do in life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart's It's a Wonderful Life is my all-time favorite,"Since I first saw this classic in 1981, I've seen an episode of Laverne and Shirley with this premise (it's Laverne who imagines this scenario), a musical version on stage with Ernie the taxi driver-not Martini-owning a bar, and last year a Baton Rouge Little Theater presentation with dialogue almost taken verbatim from the movie. Nothing however compares to the original film interpretation. How can one not laugh when George (Jimmy Stewart) and Mary (Donna Reed) accidentally fall into the high school gym swimming pool after Mary ditched a potential suitor (Carl ""Alfalfa"" Switzer)? Or not get touched by George's speech defending his late father to Mr. Potter (Lionel Barrymore)? Certainly the last hour as George feels the world tumbling before him and his eventual appreciation of his life are some of the most tear-and-laugh inducing scenes I've ever seen in the movies or television. It's a Wonderful Life has always been my favorite movie and nothing I've ever seen has even come close. Kudos to Stewart and director Frank Capra for such a life-affirming project. Thanks also to Barrymore, Reed, Switzer, Samuel S. Hinds (George's father Peter), Beulah Bondi (George's mom), Thomas Mitchell (Uncle Billy), H.B. Warner (Gower the druggist), Gloria Grahame (Violet Bick), Lilian Randolph (Annie the maid), Sheldon Leonard (Nick the bartender), Ward Bond (Bert the cop), Frank Faylen (Ernie the taxi driver), Bill Edmunds (Martini), and Charles Lane in his role as the guy who tells Potter about George's Bailey Park plans for filling the picture with, in Nick's words ""a little atmosphere"". Add to that all the various kid and adult actors I can't remember right now. And finally, special thanks to Henry Travers (Clarence) for making us all believe in angels. No truer words have ever been written as the one in Clarence's book gift (The Adventures of Tom Sawyer) to George: No man is a failure who has friends. Though one may quibble about Harry not being saved without George despite other friends near him or Mary becoming an old maid, It's a Wonderful Life is a flawless masterpiece that has stood the test of time for the last 60 years. May it stand forevermore. P.S. Look for the Blondie movie series' kid stars Larry ""Baby Dumpling/Alexander Bumstead"" Simms (George's son Pete) and Danny ""Alvin Fuddle"" Mummert (Little Marty Hatch). And Ellen ""Grandma Walton"" Corby as the woman George kisses in the run-on-the-bank sequence. Update: 12/25/2020-I just watched the colorized version from Legend Films. While I noticed some detail concerning background and extras I hadn't previously noticed before, I didn't let myself get too distracted by that colorization since except for the skies during the night scene, I didn't notice any scenes that seemed to still be in the original b & w like I did when the first colorization was done by Hal Roach Studios during the late '80s. In other words, I still enjoyed the film enough with that alteration.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"This world needs this measly, one-horse film if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to jaded, cynical hard-heartedness and despair","By Stephen ThanabalanIn a George Bailey-esquire manner of speech, I say: ""This world needs this measly, one-horse film if only to have someplace where people can come without crawling to jaded, cynical hard-heartedness and despair."" And that's not sentimental hogwash.Frank Capra's 1946 initial RKO Pictures box office flop really has become a must see film, might well change one's outlook on how valuable a man's life really is, and is a wonderful story about how important our lives can be, with the blend of human tribulations, angels, and God- bringing faith, and an endearingly effervescent message of putting others beyond oneself that still resonates after exactly 60 years.Polished as a both moving character study of one man's life story (like Citizen Kane), as well an overwhelming combination of emotional reality that will gently tug at your heartstrings, what makes this film stand the test of time and remain uplifting is that it celebrates triumphantly that 'NO MAN is a failure who has friends.' It then wraps this in a most touchingly dramatic story that at times veers into borderline 'noir' about the trials and unrequited dreams of a common man's life, with believable main characters instead of outlandish heroes, dealing with the harsh realities of giving up Anchor chains, plane motors, and train whistles for commitment and love, and exploring the psyche of a human's grasp of the meaning of life.Yet, the greatest aspect of this plot about George Bailey (played by James Stewart with relish, sincerity and an emotional range of characterization that will enthrall), is that it does not drivel to get to its climax- of Heaven sending a guardian angel, Clarence (it helped that Travers seemed like a Disney fantasy character) to goad him to appreciate on reflection, his wonderful life as a result of being given the chance of looking at an alternate universe if he didn't exist (in a fantastic sci-fi twist). Instead, it takes the viewer on an enchanting journey of the protagonist's life in order to allow one to feel his pains (father's stroke, Building & Loan payouts, Mr Potter's insults); romance (with beautiful wife Donna Reed complete with Charleston dances and a humble dilapidated house); share his disappointments (contrasts with Sam Wainwright and Harry); and understand why eventually having to come to the crossroads in facing the insecurities and issues of having believed he had wasted potential, he was willing to choose oblivion rather than existence. Most effective of all, whilst weaving the tale in lovely cinematography, it crosses the various eras that audiences all identify with (Depression, War), helping it strike chords all over.Stewart's and Capra's favorite, this film boasts some incredibly emotional scenes that linger in film history, including the best one-take embrace scene by the telephone (Rob Reiner cries watching it every time!). The Casting (even Billy & the Raven) was magnificent: the otherwise unknown Reed has a chemistry with Stewart that conveyed a love of the purest kind that really epitomized that George didn't need to build airfields to have been a hero to the ones who mattered in his life, that he'd, albeit unwontedly, already lassoed the moon.The main qualms with the show lie mostly with people upset at its moral/religious tones due to unrescinding belief that no such good character exists, exacerbated by the fact that its rerun prior to Christmas engenders a huge misconception that it is a festive movie per se (giving it some innuendoes that are as boring to hear as the perpetrators claiming the very film supposedly is). It is cynical ignorance neither to contextualize this film nor to even bother to understand the purpose, approach and point of this film without even the slightest vestige of educating oneself about what this film stands for. Some critics have not even watched it in its entirety! A cyclical corollary of finding it boring in the first place- disconcertingly hypocritical!Now, critiques of its kitsch over the top 'Capra-Corn' Americana or even its 'subversive' political agendas bearing the peasant class and their feudal overlords may find their cases warranted to some degree. Even so, in the end, these critics are actually forgetting the deal. Who cares if Stewart's character reeks of being a democrat? That's missing the dish!! Why? Well, to find out you've got to discover the film's purpose.Capra wanted to blaze positivity when he released this right after traumatic WWII (using his new soul-searching company aptly called 'Liberty Films') in an upheaval climate of fear and anxiety to discuss life and meaning out of hardship. Themes of commitment, hope, ambition, depression, loneliness, loyalty, sacrifice, love, pain, despair, insecurities, hurts, and forgiveness and ultimately, redemption are the under girding basis for its purpose. The very point was to prove that life was not about mercenary gain, worldly status achievements or success by anyone's standards- it was and is about the true joys of life if we open our hearts and minds to realize what we have: contentment, and simple childlike love. It's about the greater purposes beyond our own. As for the film being depressing, only those who fail to believe in its very message will find it as such. Plus, it was not meant to be a quintessential 'feel good' Christmas movie, it was only as such because years later a network aired it seasonally- cruelly ironic in that that very gesture was a complete and injudicious affront and lack of appraisal for the film. However, again, the film doesn't need anyone's approval, ratings, or Oscars to prove its value. Anyone who can breach the cynical ignorance and enjoy its message can enjoy it because the film, albeit non-esoteric or 'film school technically gifted', was nonetheless intended for that very lot of people who got it, who understood its magic- people who could appreciate its true meaning of being a crescendo of an affirmation of life, for auld lang syne.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Timeless Celebration of Hope and Humanity,"Frank Capra's It's a Wonderful Life is a heartwarming classic that continues to resonate across generations.

'The Greatest Gift' that became 'IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE',"There is no film quite as fantastic as 'It's a Wonderful Life'. A beautiful script from Goodrich/Hackett and of course Frank Capra, the magician. The person who turned Phillip Van Doren Stern's short story 'The Greatest Gift' into a masterpiece. And of course lets not forget Jo Swerling for the additional scenes that made the movie an American classic. Acting was another grand part of the story. Full of great actors such as Ward Bond, Todd Karns, W.B. Warner, Thomas Mitchell, Gloria Grahame, Frank Faylen and Frank Alberson.

A Movie To Love,"It's impossible to hate ""It's A Wonderful Life"". Even if you hate all the sweet in the cartoon movies, you  can't be of stone in the great end of this movie: it is one of the biggest and sincere moments of happiness in all the story of cinema. It's the zenith of the philosophy of a master of happy life, who was Frank Capra: a story of a good man, George Bailey, who decides to commit suicide, when the family's factory is going to bankrupt. An angel without wings, Clarence, will save him and he will show him the world without the presence of George Bailey, a world of corruption completely in the hands of his enemy Mr. Potter. George Bailey is interpreted by the man with the right face for this role, James Stewart and his wife by the sweet Donna Reed. Lionel Barrymore portrays Potter, a sort of Scrooge without possibility of redemption and Henry Travers is the old, sweet and naive Clarence, desperately seeking wings. Then we mustn't forget the contribute of a great task force of actors like Thomas Mitchell, Beulah Bondi, Sheldon Leonard, H. B. Warner and the up-coming Gloria Grahame. Really the perfect story for Christmas, pure and sweet. Merry Christmas Frank and James wherever you are.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Masterpiece, classic or both...","What can I say about 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I have just watched the film this evening on Christmas Eve 2012, and every time I watch the movie, it just gets more powerful and grander each year. The film is on top of thousands of peoples lists around the world as the greatest film ever made. It is definitely my favourite film. I am seventeen years old, and you would think the magic of 'It's a Wonderful Life' would die out in the older generations, but no, it gets more magical through every generation that comes.Have you ever herd the expression, ""They don't make films like that anymore."" Well, the thing is, they don't. And really, there is never going to be anything in the whole history of motion pictures that will be greater than this masterpiece classic. The moral to this film is that no man is a failure who has friends (as written by Clarence inside the 'Tom Sawyer' book in the film).The film is brilliantly casted with exceptional roles from James Stewart (who should have won an Oscar for the role, never mind just getting a nomination), Donna Reed (the smart and beautiful actress who every man would love to be an ideal wife or mother), and Lionel Barrymore (for his exceptional role as the wicked Scrooge like character, Mr. Potter). The film was nominated for five Oscars without winning any, you can thank 'The Best Years of Our Lives' (1946) and the film critics for that. Really nowadays, you don't hear anyone talking about that film. A lot of films that are at the top of polls have never won an award anyway, like 'The Shawshank Redemption' (1992). Both 'It's a Wonderful Life' and 'The Shawshank Redemption' topped a poll in the Empire magazine for the greatest film never to win an Oscar (IAWL came second). But gladly, the film did win a Golden Globe for Best Directing (Frank Capra) in 1947. So not all was lost.Overall, this film is a masterpiece and a classic, and for those people who have voted the film under seven, what are you thinking? 10 out of 10!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Greatest Film Ever Made,"Frank Capra produced a quartet of timeless films that managed to combine a heartwarming sentimentality with hard edged social commentary. ""It's A Wonderful Life,"" which was initially a box office disappointment, is his masterpiece. In my view, it also represents the apex of cinema, the finest achievement in the history of motion pictures.The irresistible plot borrows heavily from Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol,"" but manages to put a unique twist on it; instead of Ebeneezer Scrooge being reminded by the spirit world of just how horrible a person he's been, George Bailey is reminded by the spirit world that he has touched the lives of countless people, and that the world would be a horrible place without him.James Stewart is perfect as Bailey, somehow 'aging' throughout the film, beginning as a believable college aged man even though he was thirty eight years old at the time of filming. Donna Reed is lovely, and the rest of the cast is filled with the type of character actors Capra's films were noted for. There is an interesting cameo from Carl ""Alfalfa"" Swtizer, grown from his ""Our Gang"" days into a gangly, rather homely teenager, whose prank sets off the unforgettable scene where Stewart and Reed Charleston their way into a swimming pool.""It's A Wonderful Life"" is that rare film that never gets old, never ages. The viewer can jump in at any point in the movie, and feel satisfied. The movie used to be played repeatedly by numerous channels during the holiday season, but in recent years copyright issues have reduced air time to only one or two broadcasts by NBC.Everything about this movie is first rate. The dialogue can be, and should be, quoted endlessly; it is filled with Capra's trademark pro- little guy populism. The final scene, where the cast sings first ""Hark The Herald Angels Sing,"" followed by ""Auld Lang Syne,"" never fails to bring a tear to my eye, from the moment younger brother Harry Bailey proposes a toast, ""To my big brother George, the richest man in town.""Capra's movies always inspired, but this one is in a class of its own. To watch James Stewart, cradling little Zuzu in his arms, while his friends and neighbors shower him with money and affection, is to understand how powerful this medium can be, and how in the hands of a truly good soul like Capra's, that message can be positive and uplifting. The lesson everyone should take away from this film is: ""It IS A Wonderful Life.""",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

This guy finds out what the world would be like if he was nver born.,"It's a Wonderful Life.This movie is about a man named George who, on Christmas Eve is shown by his guardian angel what the world would be like if he had never been born.

Because it shows us what really matters in life. For example family and friends. And being civil to our fellowman even when the chips are down and the going gets tough.Its a Wonderful Life has a very well thought out plot line without those annoying useless scenes that only complicate the film with their stupidity. It also has great acting; it is not like other old movies that have a tremendous amount of over acting. Instead the characters are developed.The setting in which the movie took place fit perfectly into the storyline. A quaint little town where every body knows every body.

It's a Wonderful Movie,"Sweet. So very very sweet. The quality and style of James Stewarts performance in this movie cannot be underrated. His quick wit and dry delivery are perfectly coupled with Capra's directing style and the result is a magnificent piece of artistry that has withstood time and critics alike.The scene where Mr Gower smacks a young George round the head and makes his ear bleed, for me, provides the most insight into his true character. Trapped in his little head, George faces yet another taste of the constant battle between right doing and wrong doing. A way of thinking that embedded itself into his character and ends up being his greatest strength, and paradoxically, his greatest resentment.But he wears it well.I was given a copy of this film as a gift from a dear friend 9 years ago. Sadly this friend is no longer in my life. But I remember unwrapping my Christmas present at the time and thinking ""why'd you give me this? Musta been on sale at Woolworths"".Today i know.

"Slightly overrated, but only slightly","I love this movie.  I did get a bit sick of it a few years ago when it played on just about every channel at just about every hour just about every day from Thanksgiving to Christmas.  But I never quite got to the point where I hated the movie.This movie, like a lot of Frank Capra's, is sometimes thought of as sentimental almost to the point of schmaltz.  It is true that a first glance this seems like a ""feel-good movie"" to use the present-day parlance.  But, again like a lot of Capra's movies, it has a dark side lurking under its sunny exterior.  It's usually not patently obvious, but rather subtle.  In this case, James Stewart's dark hard-edged side is most notably seen in the scene where he goes home and abuses his family before going out to get plastered.  It's only a small part of the movie, but it's there, nicely complementing the sweet, nice, aw-shucks good-guy character he portrays throughout the rest of the movie.  It also shows what an actor of range Stewart was.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

Deserves its 'Classic' label...,"I have heard many times that this is a classic Christmas film over the years but it has always evaded me, until now. I decided it was time I saw what all the fuss was about and took the plunge when it came up on the TV schedules recently. To be honest, it's better than what I was expecting, although still a little too saccharine in places for my taste. But I digress, here's a very brief summary before I give you more of my thoughts (summary haters please save that drowning angel while I write the next paragraph).George Bailey grew up in the small town of Bedford Falls. He has always wanted to leave and travel the world and find his fortune but the fates have always prevented his leaving. His father runs a local Building and Loan company with George's uncle Billy and when his father dies it is George that is chosen to carry on the business. His brother, Harry, who was supposed to take over when he left college, gets a better offer. Even when he gets married himself, to Mary, and they are about to leave on honeymoon, he is drawn back to the town. When a local businessman, Mr Potter, refuses him a loan after some money is lost, this is the last straw for George and he decides to take his own life, thinking he is worth more dead than alive. At this point an Angel (second class) called Clarence intervenes and shows George what life would be like if he had never existed, and I'm here to tell you it ain't pretty. Better not say any more, don't want to give the ending away.This is a very well made film, with excellent direction from Frank Capra and a tremendous performance from James Stewart as George Bailey. He really steals the show here and, not surprisingly, was nominated for the Best Actor Oscar. Honourable mentions must also go to; Donna Reed as Mary Hatch, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy and Henry Travers as Clarence.As I said at the beginning, I found this film a little too saccharine in places, but it's still a great film and deserves its 'Classic' label. It is a very long film which mostly deals with events in George's life that lead up to his attempted suicide and it is all very well done. If you haven't seen it before I can highly recommend this film. I am not a religious man myself, but still enjoyed it.My score: 8.7/10",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Timeless Masterpiece,"""It's A Wonderful Life"" is one of the glories of American cinema, to be ranked with ""Casablanca"", ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Citizen Kane"", a work of art and entertainment that seems to be destined to last forever.It's a movie that not only doesn't age but gets better with age.High praise for a (deceptively) simple three-act 1940s ""Christmas movie"" about an angel who comes to Earth on Christmas Day to convince a suicidal man that his life is worth living.The movie opens with a conversation between two celestial bodies as they hear prayers for a man on Earth and appoint him a guardian angel. The guardian angel is shown his charge's life in flashback, up until he stands on a bridge contemplating suicide. Then the guardian angel comes to visit him and shows him what would have happened to his community and family if he hadn't been born. The man sees that (here comes the message of the movie) he has had a wonderful life and that the world is a better place for his being in it.This is a virtually perfect movie. Yes, it is unabashedly sentimental but anything but corny, shameless or naive. It couldn't have been improved in any aspect-except one. The angel in this movie is the soul of a dead man from the nineteenth century. Any Christian child knows angels are beings created by God for companionship before He created humans and are not former humans but apparently the director, writers and stars did not. This movie is theologically absurd and what's worse every single crappy Hollywood movie involving angels coming down to Earth to help humans (like ""The Preacher's Wife"" spit, spit) has copied this!When I saw for the first time ""It's A Wonderful Life"" as a 13 year old, I saw it as a lovely and triumphant movie about the difference one man can make in the world. Now, I see it more as a movie about a talented, ambitious, extraordinarily kind man of superior intelligence with big dreams who sacrificed it for a few ignorant, unintelligent, ungrateful and selfish losers. It's unspeakably sad that a man like George is forced to spend his entire life in a small town as a savings-and-loan manager and even sadder that the people of Bedford Falls have so little awareness how much he gave up for them and how much they owe him. Well, that's a true sacrifice, one that is offered willingly and selflessly, whether the receiver is aware of it or not and expecting nothing in return, not even recognition or gratitude.In real life It's NOT A Wonderful Life. One person's life is completely insignificant in his/her own lifetime, much less on the spectrum of seven million years of human history, where it isn't even a fourth of an eye blink. Whatever you may think, you are not important, your life has less than zero impact on those around you, even the closest.It would be a priceless gift to be able to see what you life would be like without you in it. Very likely, it would be exactly the same-the same teacher in the same classroom teaching the same students, the same neighbors, your friends would be the same, the same city. Only your parents would have one child less.To use a line from the movie you think the whole world revolves around you, well it doesn't, in vast configuration of things you aren't a scurvy little spider, Mr. Potter and that goes for you too and for you too, George Bailey.Is life, pointless, useless and insignificant, well living all the same? Absolutely.Life is a great gift from God to the individual and if you had never been born, you would never have been born and missed out on all of it. It Still Is A Wonderful Life.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A powerful piece of cinema that shows how our lives are more important than we think they are.,"This is a wonderful movie. It goes beyond the typical holiday special, and gives us something to think about. Rather than giving us that jolly feeling of Christmas through something visual or emotional this film gives it to us in more of a mental way. It makes us think about how important our lives really are, and that we should be glad to be alive. It makes us think about how we have changed the lives of people though we wouldn't realize it. It gives the mind a message that is received the brain and stays there. Yes it does give a heartwarming feel that I love, but I feel the main focus of the story was lesson it wanted to teach its watchers. They deliver that message stronger than any other film I have ever seen. You learn from this movie. This is really one of the best I have ever seen. The cast delivers wonderfully, the script is strong, the cinematography is excellent, and as I said the message it gives is genuine. I love this movie.4 stars out of 4",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Truly wonderful.,"I was in elementary school when I first saw ""It's A Wonderful Life"".  My teacher (or perhaps a substitute) had little to do in the last day before the holidays began, and so she decided that the class would spend the entire morning watching ""It's A Wonderful Life"".  I had, of course, heard of the film, and seen several parodies and takes on its ending (on Tiny Toon Adventures, for example), but I had never seen the film itself.  Seeing that movie was a life-changing experience.  Simply put, ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is one of the greatest movies ever made, and one of the few black and white films that can hold my attention. Jimmy Stewart gives the performance of his life as George Bailey, the humble man from Bedford Falls who sets aside his life's ambitions in order to help others.  Stewart is truly phenomenal, even if the spectacle of him playing the ""young"" George is a bit difficult to accept.  Also in fine form is Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter, the nastiest and richest man in town.  Mr. Potter is the very embodiment of the self-satisfied aristocrat, and an easy man to hate.  Donna Reed is great as George's true love, Mary, although (like Stewart) her unchanged appearance despite the passage of many years requires some creative disbelief.  Particularly heartbreaking is Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, the good-natured but forgetful man who nearly ruins the family. The plot of ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is well known, and has been frequently imitated, but never surpassed.  George Bailey decides to end his life, and God sends an angel to help him.  George then becomes convinced that the world would have been better off he had never been born, so the angel Clarence transports him into an alternate timeline where he did not exist, and shows him how George's selfless life altered so many people's lives for the better.  George returns, and is greeted with the results of his compassion. I watch ""It's A Wonderful Life"" once a year, when it aires at Christmastime, and it always brings me a great feel of renewal.  This is a true classic, one that all people should watch, regardless of their faith.  10/10, and a cheer for all those involved.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The best movie ever!,"If there is one movie that viewers need to see during the holidays it is `It's a wonderful life.' George Bailey gives up his dreams for a family and his family business. One Christmas eve he becomes short 8,000 dollars, and considers suicide. Clarence an angel with ` wit of a rabbit, and the faith of  a child' is sent down from heaven to help George. He then shows George how he has impacted a countless number of people's lives. The real meaning of life is shown through George's experience and is  a message to all people. America today is described as being selfish or greedy. In `It's a Wonderful Life' Mr. Potter represents this idea of America, because he is the business man that does not care about people, only money. This is the complete opposite of George Bailey, who even loaned out his honeymoon trip money to save his business and friends. Mr. Potter is America as the world views it,  selfish, unkind, and greedy. But many do not think about the individuals of America who care and love this country and others who live in it. Though Mr. Potter owns most of the little town of Bedford falls, George is responsible for the happiness and lives of its citizens. Many people forget this as they think about America outside or inside of the United States. The acting of `It's a Wonderful Life' is wonderful, the sweet love, and simple mind of Clarence could convince any scrooge to love life. As he takes George through scenes of his life there is never an unkind word and always patients.  James Stewart however makes this movie come to life for the viewer. He is a man with a wonderful home, family, and job, when everything seems to go wrong he wonders what good he has done for the world. Every person has asked this question one time or another, this relates the viewer to the movie and its actors. The holidays is a time for love, excitement, and family. This movie emphasizes this concept in such a way that all who watch it are effected. There are many people out in the world that are feeling down or lonely during this time of the year. They may wonder what they have really done, or who they have impacted. `It's a Wonderful Life'  demonstrates that everyone is important and needed. It is  a message of hope, of which people can look to and remember their worth as individuals.Rating of 1-10 is a 10",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"Still wonderful, 55 years on","There are many things to rave about in this wonderful classic movie: the competent direction, the detailed creation of a town on a 4-acre lot, the sheer amount of hard work, love and inventiveness that went into its conception and completion.I wish, however, to restrict my rave to the (previously unrecognised) dramatic abilities of the lead actor, James Stewart. If there's one reason to watch IAWL again and again and again (all the other wonderful factors notwithstanding), it's for the amazing performance Stewart turns in as George Bailey. The nuance and subtlety captured in the actor's performance is wonderful, just as the desperation he shows at the end of the film when he's running through Potterville looking for traces of his old life. Watching Stewart play college-age at the beginning of the film takes a little getting used to, but it's the end of the film that truly establishes him as one of the finest actors of his generation. His performance is an absolute marvel, and just as it's a crime that Cary Grant never received an Oscar for his amazing work, the fact that Stewart didn't win an Oscar for this shows how meaningless award ceremonies can be.A beautiful, heartwarming movie. 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Movie,"What an absolutely wonderful movie, the first Frank Capra film I have ever seen and I am impressed.  The story line is a breath of fresh air from the usual Hollywood story, and the fact that a movie that was made in 1946 would tackle the subject of suicide is remarkable. I have only seen James Stewart in a handful of movies, the last being 'Rear Window', and I have to say that he is one of the finest actors I have ever seen.  This is also the second time I have seen Donna Reed in a movie, the other time being 'From Here to Eternity'  and she delivered an even better performance in this film. This movie is a ""Must See"" for anyone of any age.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Terrific,"People often forget the true meaning of Christmas. It's not about getting presents or going shopping; it's about what God has gifted you with. Not taking things for granted and appreciating what someone already have. Frank Capra's film It's a Wonderful life is a masterpiece reminding the people who watch it to think twice about what they've received. The characters are lovable and anyone could fall in love with this movie.This film was made post World War II and the American people really movies that touched their emotions and made them feel good.The story starts with George Bailey (James Stewart) who has had anything but a good time and things aren't exactly going his way going down hill. Everyone in the town of Bedford Falls is praying for George to make it through his dilemma. Angels who are represented by constellations of stars or galaxies get together to talk over what they should do. Clearance (Henry Travers) who is an angel who has yet to get his wings is called and is informed about George and is then told of his life. The movie cycles through his life as you watch George and his family struggle to keep their business afloat from the corrupt Mr. Potter. George never seems to be content with his personal possessions but always longs for materials. George has always had the big dreams to travel Europe and the rest of the world his whole life but are all crushed when his father passes away. He is the only left to keep the building and loan running and he is made to see that you don't need all the money in the world to be rich. George struggles to see this until his guardian angel is sent down to help him. This movie will make a person feel things that most films would never make them feel. It really makes a person think of how much movies can sometimes be a work of art, molding and shaping characters and putting you on an emotional roller coaster. This movie gives an awesome life lesson and I would recommend it for all ages.This film gets a 9.5 out of 10 because it has to be one of the best movies ever made. The casting was terrific, the plot and storyline were absolutely wonderful. This film plays with your emotions and touches your heart.

Holiday Classic!,"It's A Wonderful Life (1946- Directed by Frank Capra) I suppose most of us are familiar with this holiday classic.  It's hard to believe that on it's initial release the movie didn't really do well at the box office. Jimmy Stewart plays the Job-like George Bailey who gets taught the lesson of a lifetime by friendly angel Clarence Oddbody played by Henry Travers.  With Donna Reed playing his wife Mary and a host of other familiar character actors, Capra weaves a tale of the importance of a single human life. Old timer Lionel Barrymore (great uncle of current Charlie's Angel, Drew) gives the quintessential performance of a rich soulless banker.What's so great about this movie after repeated viewing is how well the story is constructed.  Every scene ties so well into the overall plot and gives information about the action about to take place or explains events in the past.  So many lines from this movie are quotable that it's hard to chose one for inclusion here.  Although one of the sweetest is early on in the movie, when our heroine Mary, as a child whispers into her already man of her dreams, George's bad ear, ""George Bailey, I'll love you till the day I die.""Don't rent this video.

"Librarians, Boogie Woogie","I watched this again yesterday. I've been sucked into watching this (sometimes up to eight times when it was still public domain) every December for about 40 years. It's that good.I always enjoy this movie, but there are two and a half elements that stop me cold, leave me cold, make me not like the scenes I'm watching:1) The climactic horror that Mary is a librarian. And presumably single. And wearing white lipstick before 1964. Alternate scenarios? An early death? An an abusive marriage? At least she wouldn't be an ""old maid.""2) That the music in the bar sucks because George exists. I guess the ""Bailey exists"" music is coming from the juka boxa of final scene fame. Martini's is depicted as a reasonably earthy neighborhood bar otherwise, with forties guys in hats ordering shots, but their audio ambiance is Deanna Durbin. If George had not been born the bar would have been a tougher hangout, but there would have been a live piano player performing good boogie-woogie.1/2) Since it's not integral to George not being born, this doesn't divert me quite as much: Annie's idiotic line about ""savi'n' up for a divorce i'f'n I ever get married"" is the sort of ""humor"" that mars movies up to the sixties. Capra has mitigated this somewhat, it's Annie's only embarrassingly stupid line, and he shows sane African-Americans, albeit only as as extras, in other scenes. For a brief example, an attractive, not overweight/mammyish, 40's ""New Negro"" lady donates money to the George basket soon after Annie's ""comic"" turn.",,Anonymous,Fantasy

The truest meaning of Christmas....,"""It's a Wonderful Life"" epitomizes the true meaning of Christmas. Hope, understanding, forgiveness, friendship and sharing, all of the attributes we strive to achieve the whole year through, though somehow they manage to elude most of us. However, we come closest to being all the best we can be, at least once each and every year, at Christmas time. Frank Capra struck a chord, I would hope, in every cynic, miser, curmudgeon and Scrooge among us, when this film originally made its debut in 1946. The war was finally over, those who were lucky enough to be coming home were home, and the world was struggling to get back some semblance of the joy and peace in life, much the way things were in a prewar America. Although the innocence of that generation was gone forever, great movies like ""It's a Wonderful Life"" helped to restore some faith in mankind, as well as joy in some of the simple pleasures in life. Films like this one are milestones in history and a credit to humanity itself.There are a few films of this type that come to mind which epitomize the nature of the unselfish heart and giving spirit: ""The Bishop's Wife"", ""Scrooge-A Christmas Carol, 1951"", ""The Bells of St Mary's"", and ""Going My Way"" to name a few, there are others, but these along with this film sticks in my mind as being the paradigm of hope, generosity and the truest nature of the Christmas spirit. These films are precious, their stories immortal, their moral lessons invaluable, and the genius behind these films are, sadly, of a bygone era. Hollywood ""broke-the-mold"" with these productions offering us wholesome family fun, genuine entertainment bearing an endearing notion while teaching a valuable moral lesson. It is this type of film that truly makes the ""Holidays"" fun. Bravo! A perfect *10*",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
Loved It,"I haven't watched this film in about 4 years. But I love the film. Sure, there are things borrowed from previous stories, but there are certainly things unique in this film. Jimmy Stewart was great in his role as the troubled George Bailey. He was not the typical ""good-guy."" He has flaws. The subject matter is dark which may be the reason the film didn't hit well after WWII. If you look at the movies that were made in that time period, they were upbeat and musicals were hitting their stride----again.I had a problem with the film, though.....When Bert is going after George, why did Bert shoot at him with innocent bystanders in the way? Could you imagine the lawsuits had he hit one of the pedestrians?I thought Capra did a wonderful job with this movie. Geroge has dreams of travelling the world but the death of his father postpones his plans. Then he falls in love with Mary and they get married. On their way to the honeymoon, George is sidetracked again, by the crash of the market. Then George is ready to leave again to fight in WWII and he's sidetracked---again because the army can't accept him the the hearing problem. All the while, George is helping people. He just doesn't realize his contributions until a hapless, wingless angle named Clarence shows him just how meaningful his life is. The end of the movie IS uplifting.

Western Values,"James Stewart, The Legend.How does one begin to describe those moments when a scene of a film just captures you; moves your soul into a realm of emotion you weren't remotely near the hour before? I'm not sure myself, but this film nails it.Even if most see Stewart as the bumbling nice guy (and find it annoying) one must admit this role was made for the guy. And to also note that this was his first role after the war--and to top that off his first intimate scene he partakes in with the beautiful, lovely Donna Reed is a complete showstopper. Seriously, the only prop is a phone and just reading the desire on Reed's face and watching Stewart change from stand-offish to surrendering to his own deep desires, is something I can say is rarely achieved. Capra & Co., I say again, you nailed it!The crazy thing about watching ""It's A Wonderful Life in the 21st Century is that we can certainly comment on how times have changed for better or for worse, and concerning public discourse and general values, I think mostly for the worse.""It's A Wonderful Life"" is definitely a product of it's time, but it is much more than that in the sense of morality, mortality, and the influence of early 20th Century Western values that have been slowly stomped on and questioned over the years since. In today's world of nihilism and ""the end is nigh"" and ""humans suck"", I think most folks have lost sight of what good there is in living. Instead, we virtue signal and hate our neighbors while we should take a second to see we are more alike than we want to admit. This film has all of this presented in George Bailey's story; that he has sacrificed time after time his personal wants in the sake of helping others (great moral compass), and also proving (unbeknownst to him) that he's greatly affecting everyone around him. So by the time he is looking back on his life and it isn't how he originally planned it out, he is deeply upset and sad, because well, who wouldn't be? Not everyone will ask God for help (as Bailey does) because we are all different and believe different things, but it takes some deep inner reflection for George to realize he's had it really good. There is not a better film out there that represents these values and helps us formulate the very same conclusions with our own lives. It is a vast understatement that our minds can not wrap themselves around how different things would be if we didn't meet or help the numerous amount of people we've come in contact with in our lives.At the core of this film is the solid, concrete foundation of Western Values that seems a lost concept to all the millennials my age who demand the ways of socialism, are secular, and statistically claim the future is dark and weary. A far cry from the message of George Bailey's revelation that he himself fights through the tears to see his friends and family gather around the Christmas tree at his home.In other aspects, take note, Henry Travers is one of the best character actors of his time, and his presence is always welcome on-screen. Usually playing the lovable-fatherly type. The stunning Donna Reed does a great job as George Bailey's wife. And last but not least, Lionel Barrymore, who perhaps plays one of the most vile characters to grace the silver screen, is perfectly cast in his role as Potter. When you put all the above together (amazing story, acting, production) what do you get? The winning formula for Frank Capra who is the mastermind to really give this world a movie that sincerely touches the heart in more ways than one.The whole scene toward the end pretty much had me in tears... and that's what a great movie's capabilities should be. Something that has you ask yourself questions and really make you think, 'Life IS worth living"" or ""I really do effect everyone that knows me whether they recognize that or not."" And that's everything Capra's film did to me.I hope we never lose sight to the greater things in life; friends, family, love-while we are in a world buried in dirty politics, polarizing figures, partisan smear jobs, cynicism and hate because there are so few movies out there where you can walk away saying, ""I want to really live my life.""As the old man in the film says,

"A fabulous ode to life, love and solidarity","A fabulous ode to life, love and solidarity.It is one of the most beautiful Christmas stories, although not exactly about Christmas. It is about how real miracles happen in our daily life. It shows us how to live life in happiness, love and solidarity.In a small town in the United States, George Bailey, a man who tried all his life to be fair, honest, caring and good, has reached the limit of its mental, physical and financial strengths. It's right on the verge of losing everything he has and leave his family destitute unless a miracle happens this Christmas. But as George does not believe in miracles, he decides to commit suicide by throwing himself to the icy river. When he is about to jump he is prevented from doing so by a stranger named Clarence, actually an angel trying to earn his wings.

It's A Wonderful Movie,"Stepping away from the holiday clichés attached to holiday movies, Capra delivers It's A Wonderful Life, an original and heartfelt piece easy on the eyes, and entertaining enough for the whole family to enjoy.Focusing more on the ups and downs of life and a the value of having a little bit of faith, rather than Santa Claus and Jingle Bells, this film exposes the audience to a much more realistic Christmas environment, filled with laughter, tears, and heartache.  We're not all Barbies and Kens living in a dream house with smiles painted on our faces, we're real people who deal with real problems and this is a movie anyone can relate to.  The acclaimed director shows us another side of Christmas, which at times are a little rough on the edges.  From financial problems to suicidal tendencies, Capra really knows how to bring the heat to the viewers!  One would think that this movie would be a downer since it's plagued with trials and tribulations, but the goal is not to focus on the negative things happening to the characters' lives, but more on how the characters deal with these hurdles in their lives and what good or bad emerge from their actions.George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is a down-to-earth family man who, along with his eccentric Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), runs the town's Savings & Loans, which was left to him by his father.  George fights many uphill battles.  One of which are financial problems and the other is one that has lasted ever since he was a boy.  Mr. Potter, the richest and meanest man in the town virtually owns everything, except of course, George Bailey's little bank.  Refusing to be bought over by Potter, George bailey is content with working hard in order to keep the last honest business around to serve the public.  But when George's dimwitted uncle losses a large amount of money they owe to the government, tensions rise which drives George to question the value of his life.  He gets an answer, but in the form of a wingless cross dressing angel named Clarence with an eerie revelation...Stewart definitely did an excellent job at portraying both the good and bad sides of George Bailey.  You could feel his excitement and joy as well as his heartache and pain.  The despair of this broken man really came through when he allowed the audience to see his morale dwindle down to nothing during all of the yelling, binging, and overall decay of the blissful character we first saw.  This is hands down Stewart's best performance.It's A Wonderful Life is the epitome of the perfect Christmas movie. Without getting too tacky, the obvious ending is forgiven by this reviewer since it produced a very important message pertaining to the significance of human life and a strong faith within you and God.  This movie is highly recommended for anyone who's up for a little uplifting in their spiritual and/or emotional lives.Grade: A-",,Anonymous,Fantasy

"It's a Wonderful Life is smart, legendary, and inspiring.","It's a Wonderful LifeThe snow falls on a dark winter night, and lands on even darker waters.  A lone man stands on the bridge above a swirling black river, at the end of his rope.  He feels like he would be better off not born at all, so it becomes up to a goofy, guardian angel to show the hopeless George Bailey that the world needs him.George Bailey is played by Jimmy Stewart who is brilliant.  The audience follows him through his whole life of dreaming about the outside world, being held back in Bedford like a prisoner.  Years later, an unfortunate mishap brings the strong George to his knees.  `I'm worth more dead then alive,' George says when he hits rock bottom.  On every line, it sounded like Jimmy Stewart believed it.  He showed a range of real emotions from love to anguish, and he nailed each one of them.  He delivered legendary lines masterfully like, `You want the moon?  Then I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you.'  Jimmy had a supporting cast that told the beautiful story like it was meant to be told.  George Bailey's rival, Mr. Potter, was perfectly evil.  He had the whole audience grinding their teeth with indignation every time Mr. Potter appeared on the screen.  Because every great protagonist needs a great antagonist, Mr. Potter was perfectly cast and perfectly acted.And what would genius acting be if we the audience couldn't see it? Because the photographers of `It's a Wonderful Life' captured all the great moments very smartly.  It showed the story and brought the pages of the screenplay to life, with close ups of George in tears, and wide shots of the quaint Bedford Falls.  The sets of Bedford falls were all very charming and a good representation of the times.  A time when whole towns were owned by corporations or old men in suits.The suits and dresses of all the characters were real and didn't take any attention away from the story.  The aging make-up on George's friends in the future was believable on everyone except on Marry Bailey.  She still looked young as an `old maid', and all the make-up in the world couldn't hide how hot Donna Reed was.  Musically, `It's a Wonderful Life' was perfect and timeless.  The director (Frank Capra) chose to use a beautiful orchestra with arrangements that matched every mood of the story.Once in a life time a story like `It's a Wonderful Life' comes along, and when Frank Capra held the pages of this tale in his hands, he didn't let go of it.  Frank once said, `I've been waiting my whole life for a story like this.'  In fact, he took full advantage of the situation and he made this film into the work of art that it deserved to be.  The poignant tale of a man finding hope at the end of a long and hard road, was nothing less then heart warming.  This poorly written review isn't worthy to analyze such a masterpiece of the cinema.  And a masterpiece can't be enjoyed by reading about it, so I recommend everyone to see this A+ film, `It's a Wonderful Life'.",9.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A Heartwarming Tale That's Filled With Love,"As much as I love the cinema and all the gossip that comes with the cinema, I must confess that I had never seen It's a Wonderful Life until just recently. That's shocking for me because I love movies so much and I'm a big fan of the classics. I had heard that the film was a Christmas classic and one of the most heartwarming films ever made and I must say that everything that people say about this masterpiece is absolutely true. It's a Wonderful Life is filled with so many great things that one cannot feel humbled to be watching such a brilliant film. First of all, Jimmy Stewart's performance is one of the best ever given in the history of cinema. His portrayal of a broken-down loan officer named George Bailey is profound and deeply moving. He captures the essence of the character's personality and makes the audience literally weep for this man. The character of George Bailey is written as if he was the nicest and most generous person you could ever meet in your lifetime. And yet for some reason he is never able to catch a break and every stroke of luck that he receives just vanishes into thin air. Jimmy Stewart is perfect for that part because it seems as if he is just the sweetest guy you could ever meet in your lifetime and to witness him being swallowed into an inescapable black hole of bad luck is heart-wrenching and sorrowful. We feel sorry for George Bailey because we know how great a man he is. So when Uncle Billy misplaces that $8,000 deposit and George is literally petrified of what could happen to him, he loses his mind and contemplates suicide. Without the assistance of George's guardian angel named Clarence (who is only a second-class angel because he doesn't have his wings), George would never have realized just how great a person he really is and how wonderful a life he has. Jimmy Stewart's performance is richly detailed and he plays the nice-guy level so perfectly in this film that it makes the audience cry at the very end of the film. Frank Capra's direction of the film is flawless as always. He uses many layers of film-making to tell us this imaginative story and creates a masterful work of art. There are terrific supporting performances from Donna Reed as George's wife, Mary and especially from Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter. Barrymore is perfect in this film as the villainous Mr. Potter who controls everything in Bedford Falls except for the Bailey Bank & Loan. The scenes with Barrymore and Stewart are absolutely unforgettable and you love to see Potter suffer at the end of the film because he is indeed the meanest man you could ever meet in your life. The writing is masterful and imaginative and gives the film its heartbeat. It tells the story of a man who deserves to be rewarded in life but instead stands aside and cares for the welfare of others. He doesn't realize that his life is worth something until the very end of the film when everyone in Bedford Falls (except Mr. Potter) bails him out of his problem. It is then that he realizes that his ship has come in and he is now being rewarded for all the good deeds he has done. The film is inspirational and makes us realize that we should always have hope because without hope, we can never be able to realize just how wonderful life can truly be. ""No man is a failure who has friends"" That is the basic moral of It's a Wonderful Life and it teaches us that you don't need money to be happy. The film is not necessarily a Christmas movie but it still preaches the ideology of the holiday and that is what characterizes it as a Christmas film. Indeed, it is perhaps the greatest Christmas movie of all time and one of the best films ever made in my opinion. Thank You Frank Capra and Jimmy Stewart for giving us this masterpiece of the cinema.Lenny's Grade: A+",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
It's a Wonderful Movie,"First watch all the way through at 44 years old in 2024. I had been put off by many differing opinions. Its old and black and white being some of the war crys. Or it's just depressing being another. I myself was put off because of how revered the movie is. I am not one for following the crowd and with the general train of thought putting this movie as completely untouchable and to not appreciate it would be sacrilege really made me avoid it for many years. I knew the premise and have watched segments of it throughout my life without paying much attention. I can now say that I truly enjoyed it. I watch many old movies and some of them can be hard to get into. IAWL was easy to watch and the story was a real moral escapade that does capture the tribulations of human existence. I do have some smaller issues with it. I felt the final 30 minutes sets it alight and until this point . I was beginning to lose my way a bit. I think the build up. Although making sense during the last 30 minutes was at times a little convoluted and drawnout. The final part of the movie is where it really comes to life and it is here that I can see why so many hold it in such high regard. A really solid 8. Finally I have to throw this in here. Some people will argue that Die Hard is not a Christmas Movie, even Willis himself. But I would suggest that IAWL falls under the same umbrella. It's not about Christmas. But it's based at Christmas time. They both feature Christmas music and follow a narrative that has nothing to do with Christmas. I'll leave that simmering. IAWL. Added to regular Xmas playlist.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"Absolutely fantastic, feel-good stuff!!","I have seen this wonderful film 11 times-this Christmas (surely it should be the law that British TV shows it every Christmas!) I will be watching it with a tear in my eye, because, at Christmas last year, I was depressed, and thought, like George, of killing myself. Then an angel-in my case a gorgeous girl- came onto the scene, lodged herself deep in my heart, and we hope to get engaged at Christmas!!! I'd LOVE to officially ask her to marry me when this film's on!! Then, it REALLY would be ""A Wonderful Life""!",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"I Believe in Possibilities, therefore I love this Movie","I am a little shocked by the criticisms of the portrayal of George as being selfless amid so much opportunity. I'll admit that I'm nowhere near that level of dedication toward improving the lives of people in a community, but I've known several people of that caliber and have always been in awe of what they do. If you watch George at the very end and all you can think is that he short-changed himself in life, you're overdue for a thoracic stone removal. I, like many, have made ""It's a Wonderful Life"" a Christmas tradition. One of the bits of magic I appreciate more and more in movies is when the ending brings such a sweet atmosphere that stands as complete resolution to all the bleekness and despair that permeates the plot. In the end I have nothing but admiration and gratification for the character of George Bailey.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

GOOD MOVIE!,"A true Christmas classic, `It's A Wonderful Life' is a poignant, heart-warming story.  Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed have great on-screen chemistry, which helps the audience to get involved.  Not that it's a hard story to get involved in, it's written well and has a really well thought out plot.  There are a few rough spots in editing and one scene that could use a little improvement, but the positives outweigh the negatives and leave the audience mesmerized.Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed play George Bailey and Mary Hatch the lovers of the story.  They have such strong chemistry it's almost hard to remember that it's a movie not real life.  To watch the pair grow-up together and to see him reunite with her at a party and suddenly see `Little Mary' in a new light, builds up the romantics and tension until the fateful long awaited kiss. 	 	Ah yes, the kiss, which is supposed to be one of the most romantic and emotionally involved moments in a movie turned out to be a dud.  Being of the female mind and body, this reviewer was starting to really feel the anticipation of the kiss.  There they are, George and Mary, huddling close to the phone, both trying to listen to what the man on the line is saying to them.  George smells her hair discreetly, Mary looks longingly at George and they both grow ever closer, closer, closer WHAM, a hard kiss on the cheek/lips and a strong hug, talk about the perfect example of anti-climax. Yes, kisses at that time were the strong kiss, sway your head side to side and hug, but this was a little ridiculous for words, this reviewer was truly disappointed.The only other part of this movie that got this reviewer down was the bank scene in which Uncle Billy and Mr. Potter run into each other and have a brief conversation.  The problem in this scene was simply editing; it was choppy they would change the camera angle for unnecessary reasons or just cut to the same angle which served no purpose.  It was a bit distracting, a little annoying, and gave the impression that the actors may just have had a hard time delivering the lines in this scene so the director had to `cut and paste' to make it work.But that's where it ends; those are really the only things that would be irritating to the audience if they were picked up.  The story is wonderful, no pun intended, and tells more of than just Christmas spirit but of appreciating what you've got and who you are because you do make a difference and matter in this world.  This reviewer gives this movie top honors and believes that every person needs to watch this movie, especially if they're having a downer day and just need to take a step back and look at the whole picture.  As dumb as this may sound `It's A Wonderful Life' really does help you to appreciate that it truly is a wonderful life.",,Anonymous,Fantasy
Sorry Still Not Seeing It Earning The Classic Must Watch Status......,"Okay let's get the usual Positives Out Of The Way First. I have to admit there are a few scenes that I like. Especially that Scene where Gorge was so Stressed out that he goes off in his family and his kids teacher's husband. Just because how understandable it is. And that's about it sadly I kind of wish there was more for me Personally.And now for the Negatives *Deep Breath* and hare we go. The first definitely is I find that Donkey thing that one of his Friend always does through out the film Annoying, Idiotic, and it Literally Simply Means Nothing to me as a Viewer. Then I find the Ending Really Extremely Convent after when Gorge Losses all of the Banks Money or whatever but in reality it was Stolen by a Rival Friend. And as a Morden Viewer I really disapprove of the scene where Gorge and his then Girlfriend are essentially vandalizing that home and no one really Caring not even the Adults or that near by Senior. And that other scene where somehow Gorge somehow got the Dress Off of his again then Girlfriend and Future Wife, and him being so Immature about it every time she demanded her Dress back due to her having to hide because of a passing cop I think or whatever. I Generally started Losing Attention and Very Slightly Regaining it, constantly through out the whole movie. To the point where it took me at three try's to actually watch it the whole way through over the expand of Eight or Nine years. Try watching it twice for one year didn't like it, and didn't give it another chance until last year (2020) and even then it was tough like trying to eat a really thick and dry cake with no frosting or cream of any kind just plain cake. Anyways back to the film itself, I just don't feel the scenes where the Angle is showing Gorge Bailey an alternate what if reality, wasn't all that helpful or all that life changing or even all that Visually Interesting or Emotionally Interesting. To me Personally all it Showed was that everything Revolves around Gorge Bailey, the World would literally Tear Itself Apart with Gorge Bailey. And speaking of I'm just not feeling a change in Gorge after aside from him not wanting to kill himself any more. And that one Female Friend of his not only comes off as that kind of Woman but also I don't feel she contributed much to the film. And finally with out looking at the Runtime of the Film it almost Feels more closer to a Five Hour Film to me Personally. And unless I'm missing something else that should be it.Final thoughts, when it comes to Christmas Must Watches give me almost any version of 'A Christmas Carol' Thank You. Not only it takes place in Christmas unlike A Wonderful Life which only takes place on Christmas in the Third Act Only. But A Christmas Carol also has 'Christmas' in the name. And also plus A Christmas Carol has so many Variations and Versions you are free to Pick and Choose which ones you like and want to watch, just to name a few Reasons.",1.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Can One Man Really Make a Difference,"What can be said about its A Wonderful Life that hasn't already been printed a thousand times? I don't know why but it took me years to get around to seeing this film but finally I decided to give it a go, and how much have I missed out! The central character in the film is George Bailey (played masterfully by James Stewart) a small time dreamer who has lost his way after a lifetime of disappointment. We follow George through the eyes of his guardian angel Clarence from childhood right up to the point where he has to make his most important decision while stood on the edge of a bridge.Copra has forged a gem in celluloid, he has been smart enough to pull the sob strings with the audience but never too much so as to go into farce or seem phoney. The film is by no means a masterpiece in terms of cinematography or musical score although these are executed to a good standard. Copra captures the close nit community spirit of the small town superbly, and focus throughout on the 'David versus Goliath' relationship between George and Mr Potter excellently.The stars of this film are most certainly Jimmy Stewart and the story itself. Never have I warmed so much to central character, George Bailey is without doubt one of the most lovable screen figures ever written. I really enjoyed the performances of the supporting actors in the film mainly Thomas Mitchell as Uncle Billy, Lionel Barrymore as Mr. Potter and Henry Travers as Clarence Oddbody, Donna Reed also puts in accomplished performance as George's wife Mary as do the films child actors.It's a wonderful life is a charming heartfelt film which can be enjoyed all year round but with special meaning at Christmas time, and sparks the question 'can one man's life really make a difference?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
The Best Movie Ever Made!!!,"This is the greatest movie ever. Jimmy Stewart is the absolute best! I first discovered this movie as a junior in high school; it was actually part of a school assignment. I was hooked! Back then, it was shown on several stations throughout each day around Christmastime because its license had run out. I drove my family crazy watching it so often. I still love it. I watch it every year around Christmas and once in awhile at other times, too. I finally bought a DVD player this year and, of course, bought It's A Wonderful Life on DVD right away. I can't wait to watch it during my Christmas vacation. Everyone should watch this movie and pass it on to their friends, relatives, children, etc. It's a great movie with a great message. It leaves me feeling all warm and tingly every time I watch, even after all these years.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""You've been given a great gift, George, a chance to see what the world would be like without you.""","It's a Wonderful Life is such an amazing movie, B/W or in color. I have seen the movie both ways and both of them are enjoyable in their own way. The colored version makes it feel like it was made in my generation and made for us. But, the black and white version gives it that classic feel. It's something you can't get from the colored version and it's really nice. It's a Wonderful Life is one movie I watch every year along with Christmas Vacation and Home Alone. The dialogue is perfect from what I know and the camera quality isn't even bad for being filmed in 1946. My favorite character is George Bailey (of course). He does a really good job of fitting into his role and he is my most favorite part of the movie. I would really recommend this to anyone if you don't mind watching something in black and white.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
"""It's a wonderful life"" is a truly perfect name for quite a perfect film.","`It's a wonderful life,' is a truly perfect name for quite a perfect film! There is no doubt that this movie is made for any stressed out, overly depressed and wants to give up on life too soon, kind of person.  Don't be scared though, this movie isn't depressingly sad or makes you want to go home and slit your wrest.  `It's a wonderful life,' is quiet happy and funny for the most part.  The film is very straightforward and doesn't leave a complicated mess for you to figure out.  `It's a wonderful life' stars, Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Lionel Barrymore.  Frank Capra, the director and producer of the film, does a great job getting the point of the film across to audiences. The title describes itself fully, `wonderful.'  The film takes place, for the most part during the great depression and takes you through many time periods.  George Bailey (Jimmy Stewart) is an upbeat, funny character, for the most part of the movie. George is known by everyone in the town and is well respected.  Since growing up there is whole life, it was natural for him to want to get out.  Traveling from place to place without a care in the world was his dream.  Until he met his future wife, Mary Bailey (Donna Reed).  At a school dance,  Mary and George instantly fell in love as they spotted each other from across the floor.  Though it wasn't until three years later when they got married.  They went on to have a family and live in a big and beautiful house, though George wasn't too happy.  Things weren't going too well for him, one Christmas eve night.  I guess you could say things took a turn for the worst and it took one big wish for him to realize, what he had was what he needed! Released in 1946, right after WWII, `It's a wonderful life' was a nice family film everyone could enjoy, especially after such a tragic time in history.  Its message gave such a positive outlook on even the most bittersweet events in history.  By taking a regular guy, in a little town and giving him problems most people could relate to, the film adapted well with audiences.  Besides the fantastic story line, the cast added an amazing appeal to the film. This is a cast that complements each other easily.  Jimmy Stewart is a profound actor.  He sucks you into the movie so well and brings George Bailey to life.  Donna Reed is a delight with her performance.  She plays the perfect part as George's wife, Mary.  This reviewer loves the cast ensemble and the chemistry flows great on screen. `It's a wonderful life' gives a good look into what Christmas should be about.  It's about family and appreciating what you have.  It's an old classic with a lot to tell.  This movie is an enjoyable family film for all ages. This review gives `It's a wonderful life' an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

d,This movie is really interesting to say the least. It is definitely an interesting kids movie. I had never seen it before until now. In general though I did not like this movie. I did not understand a good bit of the movie or plot. I thought the one dude who wishes he was never born was relatable. I think it was interesting how an angel was sent down from heaven for him to show him what life would be like if he was never born. I thought the dude's funny voice in the movie was entertaining. I also thought it was interesting how the angel was frustrated with him for wishing he was never born. I also thought it was interesting how it was a christmas movie.,2.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

magical,"It's A Wonderful Life tells the story of George Bailey, an honest, hard-working resident of Bedford Falls who dreams of seeing the world. We learn in flashback how circumstance and his own good heart have prevented him from pursuing his dream until one Christmas Eve, when a dark night of the soul pushes George to the brink of suicide and he is saved by divine intervention. George gets the chance to see what life would be like in Bedford Falls if he had never been born and realizes the true importance of his life.It would be easy for people to miss the true meaning of It's A Wonderful Life and dismiss the film as sentimental nonsense due to the corny opening scene and the appearance of a supernatural angel. However, it is hard to think of another film that examines the overwhelming complexity of one individual's life so deeply or questions how our choices affect the lives of others.It's A Wonderful Life contains some of the most unforgettable moments in cinema. Once George is redeemed, we are treated to a moment of life-affirming splendor which suddenly lifts the spirits of the viewer after the relentless darkness and gloom that has preceded. The snow-storm that only hours earlier mirrored the bleakness of George's situation has now converted Bedford Falls into a winter-wonderland as George races through its streets with a renewed joy for life and all its miraculous beauty.I don't think I will ever tire of seeing the truly heartwarming final scene in which George finally learns his reward for the sacrifices he has made in life. The best line of the film comes when Harry returns early and offers a toast (`to my big brother George - the richest man in Bedford Falls') recognizing the real treasure of the friends George has rather than the superficial treasure of material wealth. An impromptu and communal singing of `Auld Lang Syne' then swells into a euphoric crescendo to close the most perfectly crafted film ever committed to celluloid.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

The acting is perfect, and James Stewart and Donna Reed shine out with their own light. The script is funny, witty and sometimes even sad. But what's most important about this film is its message; that life is often hard, but always beautiful, and something you should never give up on. Definitely, this movie is a classic that should be celebrated for the years to come. No matter if you're an adult or a child, you'll enjoy it.10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

"There's no way this movie will ever be topped, it's the king of its genre.","With many movies around winter coming out, the usual standard is the persona of a feel-good movie with a smiling Kris Kringle and a happy, married, Caucasian, job-holding man.  ""It's A Wonderful Life"" throws that stereotype out the window.  It's a movie relating to the Christmas season, but the only reason that is true is because Christmas occurs in the movie.  This film is one of the best movies a person of any age could watch, with an easy plot, and lovable characters.George Bailey, a small town boy with big plans, runs out of his luck. Seeing the world and bringing down the moon are dreams that could come true in his eyes.  Full of spirit and charm, the character of George Bailey brings tears and laughter within an hour.  Going through tough times, George and his family struggle to keep away from the evil Mr. Potter, and can't seem to float.The aspect of a wonderful life is in the perception of the living.  George Bailey not only had troubling seeing the amazing parts of his life, but also felt guilty and incomplete when material possessions were unavailable.  The morals and finesse of this story shows that not only is a movie a movie, but it's an act that can alter moods, and really express a certain value to the viewer.  ""It's A Wonderful Life"" is a great movie and will indefinitely be enjoyed by many viewers to come.On a scale of one to ten (ten being the best) this movie is rated a ten. Not just for its ability to move emotions, or its great roles, but the idea that the public is so busy, it forgets to look at the good things.  Even something as small as a first ride on a bicycle, or the scary feeling of a bloody nose.

One of the greatest films of all time,"It's hard to capture exactly why It's a Wonderful Life is such a fantastic film. On the surface, its sentimentality may seem overboard, its view of the world grossly idealised, but somehow it all comes together perfectly. I had for many years not bothered watching it, as it is portrayed as the stereotypical Christmas movie (not a genre I have any particular fondness for). After finally getting around to seeing this film several years ago, I went straight out and bought it on tape. Likewise, the first time I saw it on DVD I purchased it straight away. This is both an uplifting and edifying film to watch.This film had a profound effect upon the way I see the world. If ever there was the perfect role model for how to behave like a decent human being, it is George Bailey.This is, and always shall be one of my top ten films of all time. If you have never seen it I highly recommend doing so. Don't be put off by its age, it is one of the truly timeless works of cinema.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
A True and Timeless Classic.  It Can and Will Endure the Test of Time.,"It annoys me to no end to see movies like ""My Cousin Vinny"" depicted as a ""new classic"" on certain cable stations.  I mean, no way can that movie hold up to TRUE classics such as It's A Wonderful Life.  Sure, I can understand certain films being deemed ""new classics"" considering times change and so do our interests in movies and their plots.  But It's A Wonderful Life can and does withstand the test of time and will forever be a True Classic.  Very few movies can surpass generation after generation and still hold up as one of the all time best movies ever made.  This movie certainly accomplishes that...and this is after watching it 9.2 million times a year around Christmas time for the past 20+ years (only a SLIGHT exaggeration).The acting is phenomenal, and throughout the sometimes depressing story there are bits of humor sprinkled in...simply perfect!  Clarence is one guardian angel I would LOVE to have for no other reason than his humorous outlook and childlike demeanor.The storyline depicts a real man struggling to maintain his values and responsibilities all the while putting aside his own dreams, only to find that all he wants and needs he already has before him.  He is a real hero in a realistic world and can still be identified with today...even though times HAVE changed.I watched this film time and again growing up and it has become a tradition...like with many families.  Now, my husband and I enjoy this movie with our kids and they love it as much as we did.  This is definitely a movie the ENTIRE family can watch and enjoy...from the oldest to the youngest.Few movies are able to be so profound, entertaining, and yet still reach out to all audiences.  It's A Wonderful Life has done that time and again.A definite 10 stars out of 10 and a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy

Until he met his future wife, Mary Bailey (Donna Reed).  At a school dance,  Mary and George instantly fell in love as they spotted each other from across the floor.  Though it wasn't until three years later when they got married.  They went on to have a family and live in a big and beautiful house, though George wasn't too happy.  Things weren't going too well for him, one Christmas eve night.  I guess you could say things took a turn for the worst and it took one big wish for him to realize, what he had was what he needed! 	 Released in 1946, right after WWII, `It's a wonderful life' was a nice family film everyone could enjoy, especially after such a tragic time in history.  Its message gave such a positive outlook on even the most bittersweet events in history.  By taking a regular guy, in a little town and giving him problems most people could relate to, the film adapted well with audiences.  Besides the fantastic story line, the cast added an amazing appeal to the film. 	This is a cast that complements each other easily.  Jimmy Stewart is a profound actor.  He sucks you into the movie so well and brings George Bailey to life.  Donna Reed is a delight with her performance.  She plays the perfect part as George's wife, Mary.  This reviewer loves the cast ensemble and the chemistry flows great on screen. 	`It's a wonderful life' gives a good look into what Christmas should be about.  It's about family and appreciating what you have.  It's an old classic with a lot to tell.  This movie is an enjoyable family film for all ages. This review gives `It's a wonderful life' an 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
What it is to be loved,"So much has been said that all I can say is this : If you can watch Geroge Bailey charge down Main Street yelling, ""Merry Christmas, you wonderful old Building and Loan"" without your eyes filling up, you don't know what it is to be human. Well, I'll guess I'll say more, because some silly rule prevents me from being succinct. ""It's A Wonderful Life"" shows us that we are all heroes, in our own right. How many lives does each of our own touch? Like George Bailey, I've wondered if everyone would be better off if I'd never been born. Thanks to Frank Capra, I know what an awful, selfish feeling this is. Here's your hat, what's your hurry?",10.0,Anonymous,Fantasy
