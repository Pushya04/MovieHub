An absorbing film-drama,"From scene one, this film delivers a long slow burn as the tale of power and corruption unfolds. There is little action, but the film is steeped in an atmosphere of tension and high drama. The direction by Michael Mann is masterful, an object lesson in how to frame shots and let silence, as well as words - and music - work for the story. Al Pacino is once more the great actor of early films such as 'Scarecrow', instead of the theatrical performer of recent films.  Russell Crowe shows his solid 'ordinary guy'character as more tortured through losing his family than any of the macho scenes he portrayed in 'Gladiator.'  A superb film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Smart film making.,"""The Insider"" in many ways reflects the golden days of American cinematography, where every scene serves a purpose, dialogue is sharp and poignant, and characters and events remain true to their emotions and nature.The film presents certain questions throughout its duration that are intended to invoke thought in the viewer, and at the same time explores them to unprecedented depths which are by no means native to the film industry. The story is of a quick-paced nature, and demands that the viewer pay the utmost attention to every single line and image presented;  it flabbergasts in its unparallelled structure of continuity and coherence to those sentient enough.After watching this film, it became apparent why Crowe was so reluctant to play the role of Maximus in ""Gladiator"" after acting the part of Jeffrey Wigand.  It appears more or less as if Crowe had been this character in reality, and it really inspires to see that such a talented actor is finally beginning to  enjoy the prominence that he deserves.In the past decades, there has been a progressive decline in the number of intelligent films making it onto the market, but the success of ""The Insider"" will hopefully serve as a shout-out to all the film companies and directors reluctant to tread on such sensitive ground.  This movie could not receive a higher recommendation!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intensity beyond intensity,"The Insider is the only film I remember having seen where I walked out of the theatre with a headache because of the intensity of the story. Michael Mann is one of few directors who has such an in-depth understanding of both the subject of his film and the nature of that subject, that he is able to portray a realism that is nearly impossible to match.There is real skill displayed in the way in which the Insider weaves through the aspects of both Bergmann and Wigand's lives. Whereas a lesser director would have thrown the characters at each other in an artificial collision, Mann introduces each character as being average professionals each living in their own respective stable lives. It is only when their chance encounter creates a subtext that could consume them both does the real chemical reaction in the story take place.Bringing life to these fantastically written characters are two of the most talented 'big-name' character actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Surprisingly, it is Crowe that drives this film forward, and his portrayal of Wigand is spot-on perfect. His is an honest humanity, both a loving father and a flawed husband who never fully balances his life under the pressure of circumstance. Crowe nails the performance by not hamming-up the character, but rather by understating his personality. This works in that it is the character that is elevated while the actor disappears.That is not to ignore the excellent work by the remainder of the cast. Pacino's performance is accented and accentuated beautifully by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Most notably are several standout scenes mixing Pacino, Plummer, Philip Baker Hall and Stephen Tobolowsky that ground the underlying tensions of the film fantastically. And the juxtaposition between the cold, hard New York settings and the organic nature of Mississippi further press this film beyond standard non-fiction works.Easily one of the best dramas of 1999, the Insider is a standout member of that elite club of great historical dramas such as All the President's Men that are few and far between. It is for that audience that appreciates skilled performances meeting skilled direction and restrained, mature writing.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The film that keeps on giving,"I first wanted to see 'The Insider' because it professed to show the truth behind the lies of the Tobacco Industry. My wife and I saw it and were thoroughly impressed. In fact we've now seen it 5 times (I think, though I may have lost count).If you go to the movies to be entertained mindlessly, do NOT see this movie, you will bored. This movie is for people who like to think, and who like to receive superior presentation of thought provoking material. The Insider has all that.The movie gets you thinking about mankind. The obvious problem with human nature is obvious in this movie. The Tobacco companies knowingly selling addictive product, whilst claiming it is not. And then almost, almost but not quite, getting away with ruining an individual's life, an individual who's conscience was pricked by what they had seen.But then it moves into the CBS drama, where again the hopelessness of mankind in general shines through. The strength of two individuals though manages to win the day, which is what makes this true story so unusual.I found that (contrary to those who complained of the movies length) every scene that Mann has given us has a reason. A good reason. From the opening scenes depicting an evil far from USA. To the hints as to why we didn't hear anything about the drama when it happened, because the OJ murder story and media frenzy drowned out what should be to us all a much more serious matter.For me the crowning moment in the film was when Russell Crowe (as Wigand) was about to dig into a hamburger when behind him on TV a newscaster reported findings about him, bad (though unfounded) findings. Crowe put his knife and fork back down in a way that told us all that he had no more appetite, in fact all the will left in him had been violently thrust away, thrust away by the selfish interests of the Tobacco companies.All in all this is a complete movie that deserved its 7 nominations and should have gotten some awards. The sound was great, as was the camera work. If you love an artistic movie, you will love this one. Crowe is thoroughly believable and has cemented himself as a first rate actor, capable of playing just about any part put his way. Pacino is very well cast, Plummer is a class act, and a host of supporting cast did themselves proud.What we can't forget about this movie, for all its drama, and for the pointed view it gives us of the nature we bear, its a TRUE STORY. Thats what really makes it shocking. And only those driven to the ends of despair and loneliness such as Wigand and Bergmann were, can really truly realise another fact pointed out in the movie, in the end of it all, we are nothing anyway, so what does it all matter?See it!",,Anonymous,Biography
"A Great Movie, Very Underrated, Due To Poor Marketing","Russell Crowe at his best as a Kentucky tobacco executive in Eric Roth and Michael Mann's masterpiece, ""The Insider,"" is one of the most underrated American films ever. Not only is it important historically for its political implications - not about tobacco, but about conflicts of commercial interest that control freedom of speech along the airwaves in the U.S.- it is a great story and it is true. Disney had no idea how to market ""The Insider"" and essentially sold it as tobacco movie and it is so much more. Pacino gives a grand A plus performance as a Long Island Jewish producer and halfway through the movie I forgot he was Al Pacino. Even better Christopher Plummer masterfully captures the full essence of Mike Wallace. Gina Gershon could turn lust from a stone as always. Michael Mann seems to always pull strong performances from his actors, and Eric Roth who brilliantly adapted ""Forrest Gump"" did the same here with Mann. Though long, ""The Insider"" is never boring and a movie all Americans should see twice to make sure they fully comprehend regardless of how you feel about the tobacco debate.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
SMOKE 'EM IF YOU GOT 'EM!!!,"I'll make this simple for you with short attention spans: Al Pacino's best performance of the 90s. Russell Crowe's best work on par with LA Confidential (if not better) and a gripping shot by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace.For those who can handle it, read on:Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) has been fired from his job. He has to break the news to his wife (Diane Venora, who I believe should go on to be one of the best actresses of all time) that their beautiful home, swank cars and health care plan (their oldest daughter is athsmatic) are about to go down the tubes. He's been given a severance package but that's about to fall apart as well.Enter Lowell Bergman (Pacino), producer for CBS Television News' bastion of journalistic integrity, 60 Minutes. Bergman's doing a report on fires that were started by careless smokers and has been given a report so huge and full of technical jargon he can't make heads or tales of it. Through a friend he is put in touch with Wigand in the hopes of finding a translator. Wigand thinks Lowell is coming after him because of what he knows about his former employers, a major tobacco company.It is at this moment that director Michael Mann institutes a trick, the likes of which hasn't been seen since All The President's Men. The two exchange a cat-and-mouse conversation via fax. Bergman finally calls Wigand's bluff by daring him to meet him the next day. He does.What does Wigand know? Well, its all over the papers these days about how the tobacco industry lied about manipulating the leaves to make them more habit forming. We have Wigand to thank for that. But that isn't where the story ends. This is a two-fold tale; on one hand you have the self-destruction of a man who put everything on the line just so he could do the right thing. On the other, you have a television producer who so believes in the integrity of himself, the network, and his show that he is willing to risk everything he has to fight for the protection of his source. I haven't seen this much commitment outside of Woodward and Berstein's staunch protection of ""Deep Throat.""The trump card of this film though comes in the form of Christopher Plummer playing one of the most visible news figures of the past 25 years, Mike Wallace. Wallace teeters on the edge of looking like a foul-mouthed, celebrity hungry, media hound who's only thought is about ratings. However, before its over, he evokes the ""integrity of Edward R. Murrow,"" a line that gave me chills and made me pray for an Oscar Nomination.Director Michael Mann is known chiefly for his Action/Thrillers. This 155 minute film is slow paced but gripping for ever second it is on the screen. A lot of people have complained over the past 7-8 years about Pacino's ""staccato"" performances, suddenly shouting at the slightest provocation. This film returns him to his prime form, a style he hasn't walked in since Dog Day Afternoon, ...And Justice For All and Serpico.Anybody got a light?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting from start to finish,"This is a movie that I was on the fence about seeing, simply because it seemed like just another movie about a whistle blower. It is so much more than that, and it is a movie worth watching time and again because of its complexity. It is about journalistic integrity, corporate greed, good vs. evil, and standing up for what you believe in, no matter what the cost. It pulls no punches about how far the tobacco industry would go to hide the truth from the American public about cigarettes, but it never seems propagandized.Russell Crowe gives a top-notch performance of Everyman scientist Jeffrey Wigand that meets Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer's portrayals of 60 Minutes Hotshots Lowell Bergman and Mike Wallace frame by frame. These three actors have the perfect blend of chemistry and timing, and fit their characters like a glove. They completely inhabit their roles and at times it seems more like a documentary than a fictional story.From beginning to end, it has the kind of edge of your seat tension that keeps one glued to the screen. Despite being a fairly lengthy film, it moves at a quick pace, and is absolutely riveting. The direction is superb, the camera angles are fast and furious, and it is a delight to watch.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Ambitious, brilliantly-cast recreation of true events...","Russell Crowe disappears inside the role of Jeffrey Wigand, real-life ex-corporate head for the tobacco giant Brown & Williamson who was fired after opposing the company's ""impact boosting"" of cigarette tobacco (enhancing the nicotine to be more rapidly absorbed into the smoker's system) with flagrant disregard for the public's health considerations. Wingard is contacted by ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) who convinces Wingard to tell his story to 30 million viewers, this despite legal action and ugly threats from his former employer. Director Michael Mann takes his time setting up this character-driven piece; he's careful to include lots of high drama, though one must wade through many story incidentals to get to the meat of the piece (the television news show caving under pressure from the network's legal advisers, and then admitting their cowardice and doing the right thing). The performances (which really drive the picture) are outstanding. Pacino is able to root out the helplessness of the producer's situation, feeling great empathy for his client but also with the knowledge his own career is on the line. Ethics and morality come in second in this man's circle, and standing up for one's principles is to be labeled a martyr. Christopher Plummer gives an Oscar-worthy performance as ""60 Minutes"" anchor Mike Wallace, and Philip Baker Hall is equally strong as show-creator Don Hewitt. Wallace and Hewitt's loyalty to each other--and how that affects their working relationship with Pacino's Bergman--provides riveting drama, while Crowe's floundering Smoking Gun (one with a hair-trigger temper) is completely realized by the actor. Though assembled in a smoothly astute manner, ""The Insider"" is quite long. It takes at least an hour to get cooking, yet the final events are truly gripping and moving. *** from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exceptional,"This movie is genuine art - unlike 99% of what is out there. This is the best movie I have seen. Casting excellent. Script excellent. Cinematography excellent. Soundtrack excellent. Every one of the characters is robust and phenomenal. The main characters in most movies are not as developed as background characters are in this film. It took me a while to even believe that Russell Crowe was the same person as the lead in Gladiator. While I feel that Pacino plays more or less the same way no matter his character, he really suits this movie. Even supporting characters have memorable scenes and dialogue in this movie, my favorite being the courtroom deposition of Wiegand (Crowe). This movie provides intensity on so many levels. There is action (not shootouts or car chases...), suspense, heroism, depression, hope - you name it. There is abundant complexity in the plot, especially in regard to Wiegand being pushed to the edge of sanity. Lisa Gerrard (vocals) is perfect as usual for adding drama and feeling. The camera work in my opinion - while a different beast - is on par with Saving Private Ryan, Gladiator, and other famed movies. If you prefer movies that don't follow the conventional, cliché plot, this is one you must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Michael Mann understands human psychology better than anyone.,"An excellent drama with a film score that sounds like the music from Gladiator. The plot is easy to follow but hard to predict. The first act was far too intense and exciting for my own good. I think my feelings were intensified as the film is based on a real event and I had no idea how it would end as the plot of the film teetered between disaster and success.In one corner are Russell Crowe and Al Pacino, and in the other corner are all the greedy businessmen. Crowe has been fired from his job as a chemist at a tobacco company and he is sitting on a lot of secrets that he should tell. The company does everything it can to get him to shut up, while slick journalist Pacino tries to get Crowe to appear on his news show. Crowe finally decides to tell the truth and the consequences are devastating.No one portrays rounded and interesting characters like Michael Mann. The characters are so ruggedly well written with motives, unique personalities, and stories that are smoothly shown during the course of the film. Mann understands human psychology better than anyone. The characters in the film are indeed real people, but it is masterfully directed by Mann.It's very interesting how the different men think and reason, as well as how they develop through the film. Crowe is unsure if he made the right choice. Perhaps he made the right decision, but at what cost? His wife just wants to keep the family together and keep the nice benefits that his old job still provides the family with. Crowe gets into real trouble because he did the right thing. Not all stories like this always end well. Is it worth the risk to say something, or should you continue to live the lie?Crowe does the right thing and is promised that things will happen, but when it comes down to it, it doesn't turn out quite as he predicted. All the characters have their interests, but Pacino is the one who acts the least selfishly. Or does he? It's a question that Pacino wrestles with a bit in the film. Is he doing this to help Crowe? Or does he do it because he likes the kick it gives him? Or is he doing it to get a good show and make money?The film is about what the consequences can be for a man when other men forget their moral compass and do everything they can to climb higher in the workplace hierarchy. Pacino has a clear code of honor that he maintains. We have a good man there. The Insider is a riveting drama with superb characters and fine photography. 7.6/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Michael Manns Best Film With Career Best Performances,"For me personally I've always been a bit off and on with Michael Mann what few films I've seen from him I'm not a big fan (even Heat) but I was still desperate to see The Insider and now haven seen this masterpiece I will always give him credit as The Insider is now one of my all time favourite movies with amazing performances. The characters in this movie are incredibly investing because Mann doesn't paint them as perfect they're all making mistakes and screwing up which makes them seem more human. Russell Crowe is absolutely amazing in this movie with Gladiator also being one of my favourite movies I wasn't sure if I'd ever see a better performance from him but here he is just as good not only is his accent convincing but the toll taken on him is perfectly conveyed through his masterful performance. Al Pacino is every bit his equal he perfectly conveys his no nonsense, experienced character making you believe that no one else could have played this part. The tension in this movie is done just right every time Crowe puts his (or his families) safety on the line you feel it you are worried as to what the company is going to do to him next. Is also a very interesting film, to see all the ways in which Crowe and Pacino are trying to combat Big Tobacco using the law in very specific way and it further enthuses Pacino's experience and Crowes vulnerability. When things do go Crowes way you feel it the writing in this movie is so good that you are desperate for Crowe to succeed because overall you see that he just wants to do the right thing.I absolutely adore The Insider it's suspenseful and heartbreaking and in many ways also uplifting it's got some Career best performances and makes me desperate to see more films from Michael Mann.100%-A+",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
i must agree - good not great,"The insider, although wonderful at some parts, in my opinion, is not all it's cracked up to be. Russell Crowe and Al Pacino do give stellar performances, but I found this movie to be extremely slow! To give an example, the scene at the driving range is one of the longest and most unneeded scenes in film history. The entire scene could have been cut in half, at least. As a movie fan, I am all into long shots, but this was ridiculous!!! The story was indeed intriguing, but the way it was presented was nothing that needed to take 2 and a half hours of my time. I believe the actors did well with  what they were presented, however, and I cannot state this enough, it was just way too slow and long!!!!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Much of this is excellent, and yet...","I hope I can say this under IMDb guidelines, but THE INSIDER is a little disappointing after the mighty HEAT.  It's not that it's a bad film  - on the contrary, it's a rare Hollywood film that treats its subject with seriousness, irony and complexity.  Unfortunately, it shares the classical epic's delusion that somehow length confers greater worthiness, and so we get a lot of dragged out scenes of people just staring, which perhaps gives a truer sense of what it must be like for ordinary people in such circumstacnes - the sheer tedious dread - but dissipates, in contradiction of the closing credits, the film's 'dramatic effect'.In many ways similar to ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN (as has been pointed out) - an investigation into 'respectable' corruption (in this case the Columbia-like addiction-mongering of tobacco companies) - it is also that film's complete opposite.  Whatever its flaws, Pakula's film was shaped as a thriller, had the exciting momentum of a thriller, the driving sense of two detective figures bringing enlightenment to a depressingly murky situation.There was always a large element of wish-fulfilment about this.  For a start, the case had already been won, the film felt like retreading old victories.  But most seriously, the shadowy Establishment network that allowed Watergate to happen was never punctured - Nixon was a scapegoat, things were allowed to get back to normal.  This is half-suggested in Pakula's tireless determination to make a conspiracy thriller out of everything, but the essential American faith in right and truth outing was generally asserted.Michael Mann is too good a director to settle for this.  His film does follow a feel-good arc - revelation of corruption, suppression of revelation, eventual revelation of revelation - which suggests that men of truth and honour can defeat proto-fascist corporate power.  And there is, like THREE KINGS, a sense that audiences wouldn't be able to handle a more realistic ending.But Mann ironises this arc at every turn.  His hero is Lowell Bergman, a CBS news producer with a reputation for securing great stories in some of the world's most dangerous hot-spots.  He is played by Al Pacino, an actor in the grandstanding manner, who, despite many villainous roles, carries with him a dogged, Spencer Tracy-like integrity.  In following his point-of-view, we get to see the development of the plot and the workings of corporate power.In the opening sequecne, as Bergman is being driven through Iran, we see what he sees - when he looks in a particular direction, the camera follows. The thing is, he doesn't see anything, he is blindfolded - the traditional treatment to the Hollywood hero has been brilliantly subverted, and undermines Bergman as a hero thorughout the film.For instance, when Bergman, trying to persuade Wigand to talk, suggest, idealistically, information is power at a Japanese restaurant.  Mann frames the two men sitting in the traditional Japanese manner, almost legless, not looking very powerful at all.So in a film where there is an awful  lot of talk adn exposition, it is crucial that Mann's irony gives us, the audience, the real view, as in that first sequence.  A recurrent motif is Bergman standing godlike from a balcony looking out over a huge city - he does not survey all he sees; it's an impenetrable blank to him.  Just as the plot slips away from him, he talks to Wigand on the phone on a beach- Mann cuts to him wading in the water like King Canute.  This subtle ironising makes it all the more credible when this blustering hero, totally in control, driving the plot with ariculate confidence, is suddenly shown to have very little real power at all.Wigand isn't ironised in quite the same way - he is in a more passive position, defending his family, repository of information.  BUt his introduction also shows how removed he is from the real world.  WE see him first in his office which looks onto a staff canteen - the realms are only separated by a glass wall, but they could be two different worlds - his dark, lonely,furtive, suffocating, sinister (we don't know what he's doing, but it looks very secretive), dislocatingly cut with the friendly, communal, human babble of the canteen.  WHen he goes to leave the building, the camera slows down, the sound is blocked out, the light brightens, adn Wigand looks like he's entering a dream or fairytale world.THis ironising is crucial, because the film takes on a feel-good turn.  At first it suggest taht truth can be recorded, delivered to the public, despite the flexing of corporate muscle.  When this threatens , there are alternative means of diffusion.  BUt look  at thow Wigand's testimony is recorded.  We see the testimony split into different screens, teh 'real' Wigand and his screen image.  Lter we see Bergman editing the piece, rearranging the truth to achieve it more powerfully.  There is no such thing as an unmediated 'pure' truth, and although this might seem rather obvious, it sours the heric sense of the truth finally getting out to the public. Also disturbing is the possiblity, that never actually occured to me until the smear attacks, that Wigand might be lying.  WE are given no evidence adn are expected to take this man's word.  THE idea of anyone's 'word' being simply enough is so rejected by the film that itt further undermines the optimistic intentions, and this is never resolved withing the film.  Is there somehow an abstract 'truth' thast can be extracted from the deeply compromised eople that utter it?All this is great - and there are some interesting insights about families (although not, as ever with MANN, women) adn imiplications about the wider sphere of political and media corruptoin - but the film is too subversive for its own good.  It undermines its heroes, its themes, its genre, its mode of representation, its setting.  THis is all necessary adn brilliant, but it doesn't leave much for a film, certainly at this lentgh.  Unlike ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN - a film about actively seeking a well-defined truth - THE INSIDER is about defending a compromised truth - and this passivity means that it can never work as a thriller - you keep waiting for something to happen adn it doesn't.  It can't.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Michael Mann does it again!,"I have been a huge Michael Mann fan for years, but I do have to admit that I approached his latest film ""The Insider"" with just the teensiest bit of trepidation...after all, Mann is the godfather of the thinking man's action flick, and I've even heard it said that his action sequences are so integral to his movie that they are practically another character in the film...with which I completely agree.  So I was wondering how a movie with no chase sequence, no gunfights, basically no action whatsoever--well, how could that possibly qualify as an authentic Michael Mann signature film?Yes, the action, per se, is missing, but Mann still brings his signature directorial style to life with lots of wide shots, intense close ups, and indirect focus, all bathed in cool blue light and threaded together with an inventive soundtrack (including a reprise of a former track that was used so effectively in ""HEAT""; sorry, I can't recall the title offhand).And what the movie lacks in ""action"", Mann more than makes up for in high-wire tension.  He pulls us into the drama of an ordinary man's life by portraying the myriad humiliations, both large and small, that assault Wigand from the moment he is fired from his job as an R&D VP for a major tobacco company.  The detoriation of his life, from his finances to his marriage to his belief in himself, is explored with the sort of atmospheric detail that is Mann's trademark:  the play of light or lack of it; the familiar sights and sounds of everyday life, from the patterns of rain on a windshield to the rush of wind through the trees; and camera work that ranges from tight, out-of-focus shots to sweeping panoramas of razor-sharp clarity...all of this creates an environment of realism that puts you into the film.  You can't just observe Wigand's struggle; you experience it with him.  My movie-watching partner observed as we left the theatre that he felt exhausted from the tension, as if he'd just been through the corporate wringer himself.  I knew what he meant!But atmosphere isn't all Mann delivers.  Once again, this genius director has placed an unexpected actor in the lead role of his film, with amazing results.  Before Daniel Day Lewis was ""Nathaniel Poe"" in ""The Last of The Mohicans"", no one would have believed he could pull off a major hunk-o-rama role...well, guess what?  He ended up defining the hero of the adventure/romance genre!  In ""The Insider"", Mann has opted for the opposite effect, casting  young, potential hunk material Russell Crowe as an older, slightly-pot-bellied father of two.  Wigand doesn't look like anyone's hero, and perhaps that's actually the message of the movie:  an ordinary man--a nobody, really--caught up in extraordinary circumstances.  And Crowe delivers...in a major way!  Personally, I can't remember an acting performance that mesmerized me to this extent...unless it was the last time I watched Crowe, in ""L.A. Confidential"".  He evokes his character in this movie with the apparent ease of a magician doing card tricks:  the illusion is complete and appears to be effortless.  Even with silver, receding hair and twenty extra pounds which, we are shown, is not the result of costume padding, but Crowe's own amplified flesh, he is imminently watchable... almost hypnotically so.There are, even as I post this, whispers and rumors about this movie being an Oscar contender.  Best director, best actor, best supporting actor. Again, I can only nod my head in complete and total agreement.  Russell Crowe will blow you away, and Al Pacino gives his best performance in years.This film is quiet, intense, and ultimately, extremely moving.  I literally burst into tears twice, the way you do when you've recieved bad news or seen something dreadful, so complete was my empathy for the character of Jeffrey Wigand . The anger, helplessness, and puzzled confusion at being punished for telling the truth felt all too familiar to me.In summary, I was not at all disappointed in Mann's direction of this film. Even without the phenomenal action sequences he's known for, this film had the same visceral effect on me that I experienced when I saw Manhunter, Last of the Mohicans, and HEAT.  I'm a born-again fan!",,Anonymous,Biography
Just Great Film-making......Period,"Not always, but usually a Michael Mann-directed film means good things for movie buffs, and this is no exception.Tremendous acting highlights this movie about a behind-the-scenes look at a ""60 Minutes"" story of a man who blows the whistle on a tobacco company. Al Pacino, as the TV show producer ""Lowell Bergman,"" Russell Crowe as the whistle-blower and tobacco scientist ""Dr. Jeffrey Wiegand,"" and Christopher Plummer as ""Mike Wallace"" all are riveting in their performances. They are intense characters, as are many of the supporting characters in this involving film.There is little action in here but a ton of tension in the first hour of this long (158 min.) film. The story held my interest even when the tension left, thanks to the acting, the great cinematography, involving music score....well, just about everything. It's simply a well-done movie, similar to Mann's ""Heat,"" except without the violence.The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias, but that's not surprising being it's about ""60 Minutes."" I wasn't surprised when Ken Starr got a cheap shot, for example. This film bias could have been a lot more blatant so I'm not complaining. Obviously, they went a overboard in their stand against the tobacco industry, repeating the same damaging scenes over and over. However, I appreciated they didn't shrink from pointing out how the network was covering its own behind even though it was hurting its most successful program.Photographer Dante Spinelli did an incredible job making this look fantastic despite the fact that there was no great scenery or exotic sets. As mentioned, this is just great film-making. What else can you say?",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Movie and Why it Failed Commercially,"This is an excellent, riveting movie based on true events and yet failed at the box office, failed commercially. It failed because it's about Honor and Prostitution and the American population no longer knows the difference between those values or cares, which is worse. Prostitution, hypocrisy, deception, betrayal, these are the current reigning mores of American society along with profits at the expense of human life. In the America of the 1930's or 1940's, this movie would've been a smash hit success. Those days are gone from the United States. How sad for great creations like this...and for us.

An in depth and provocative and compelling legal emotional drama that fights for answers while wanting a search for justice.,"Finally after many years watched Michael Mann's legal drama 1999's ""The Insider"" and it was clearly a well done legal drama that searches for answers and blows the whistle on those in power who try to hide corruption that blends greed and power. The film recounts a chain of events that pitted a guy against the giant tobacco industry. And this film would really be in depth and drag the characters thru a fight of their lives.Al Pacino(still one of the best actors in the business)is in top form with a strong performance as veteran ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman and Russell Crowe(is the man affected by it all the insider himself former tobacco executive Dr. Jeffrey Wigand). The story is pretty cut and dry when Wigand is fired by the tobacco company, he agrees to become a paid consultant for a story that Bergman and ""60 Minutes"" is working on about the unethical ways within the tobacco industry. This all leads to a long battle between all with a lot of legal cat and mouse games which puts everyone's reputations on the line.As expected the tobacco industry will use any legal and corporate means they can to help save a billion dollar a year habit. Still both Bergman and Wigand are fighters that are searching for answers and they want justice in the form of truth as with every little bit more evidence is uncovered.Cleraly this is a harrowing drama with legal and emotional twist and turns it has an in depth cold hard edge that keeps you glued while searching for answers and fighting for the truth with twist.

A very good thriller,"The Insider is a 1999 movie directed by Micheal Mann based on a segment of CBS TV Show ""60 Minutes"". The movie depicts the true events that happened in the background. It is a about an interview of a tobacco company whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand portrayed by Russell Crowe. Al Pacino stars as Lowell Bergman, the producer of the show. There is nothing flambuoyant, nothing extravagant, just true events although dramatized for the sake of a movie.The movie is a fantastic, pure thriller. It will grip you to the seats till the end. The screenplay is really brilliant but the standout factor is the acting of the two titans, Russell Crowe and Al Pacino. I was amazed by their performances.I am not going to elaborate on the storyline here. You just watch and enjoy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An awfully well made film,"Excellent casting and distinctive directing.  Amazing appearances by Christopher Plummer, Colm Feore, Michael Gambon and Gina Gershon.  You wouldn't think music by Lisa Gerrard, Michael Mann's outrageous colors and Russell Crowe playing a man several decades older than he is would work together, but they do.  The story itself is not done as much justice as Bergman's Frontline piece gave it, but a lot of the important info is there. Wigand did a brave thing and the drama of the movie comes from his agonizing over why he did it, if it was worth it and how did he find the will to go through with it. Crowe's Wigand is a much more interesting accomplishment than Spacey's detached smartass in American Beauty.The extreme close-ups of peoples' faces got really old really fast though.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
You will be able to get some Courage from this movie!!,"This movie has an air of tension from beginning to end. I was excited about the battle of two men up against the tobacco industry. And I'm surprised that this movie is based on a TRUE STORY.Russell Crowe played ""Jeffrey Wigand."" He's a good scientist who works for a tobacco company. He's an ordinary man who loves his family. One day he learns secrets inside of his company. Therefore he is discharged unfairly. The company uses the duty of confidentiality as a shield. They threaten him. He is caught in a moral dilemma between releasing the truth and protecting the secrets. His conflict is painful.Jeffrey meets Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino)who is the producer of a news program for CBS. Jeffrey decides to release the truth,being encouraged by Lowell. Lowell and Jeffrey continue fighting with the tobacco industry. They use neither violence nor a gun,Lowell believes in the power of journalism.The two men's courage and beliefs,and the image of them fighting against the wall of power are so strong that you will be greatly impressed. When you finish watching this movie,you will be able to get some courage from them.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Good acting, boring story","All of the actors in this movie did a fabulous job, which is not an easy feat since the storyline was so incredibly boring. I know it was a true story, but parts were fictionalized to make it more interesting. I can't imagine it being much less interesting. This type of story has been done many times in the past, Silkwood, and Norma Rae come to mind. I don't understand why Russell Crowe was nominated and not Pacino. I think the voters get used to our best actors and actresses always doing such a good job, that when a younger newer actor stands out people fall all over them. At least when there are two good performances in the same film. In summary, I know this is an important story, but it would have been better as a TV movie of the week.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography

Truth always trumps fiction.This movie was very well directed and well filmed, but above all it was well acted.

"A story worth telling, a story well told","It will come as no surprise to faithful readers of this column that I like good movies. I also like that even rarer event, the important movie. Rarest of all is that special movie that is both good and important. Michael Mann's The Insider is just such a film.Mann's best-known efforts to date are the films Heat and Last of the Mohicans. This film demands a more subtle and sophisticated guiding hand and Mann clearly rises to the challenge. The Insider is the somewhat fictionalized, but basically true, story of Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe), a tobacco executive turned whistle blower. It is also the story of Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a passionate producer who becomes a whistle-blowing insider in his own right.The subject matter of the film places it in the tradition of films like Silkwood, The China Syndrome, and A Civil Action. When Wigand agrees to go on the record exposing the cover-ups and perjury by tobacco industry executives he is harassed, threatened, betrayed, and abandoned. The real story here though is how CBS was bullied into softening and burying the story. Pacino's performance as the passionate producer with integrity provides the moral center of the film.It should come as no surprise that this is a good film. In addition to Mann's capable direction, there are some excellent performances by Crowe (who viewers might remember as Bud White in LA Confidential) and Pacino. Christopher Plummer also does superior work in his less than flattering portrayal of Mike Wallace. The screenplay is adapted from a short story by one of the masters of adaptation, Eric Roth (Forrest Gump, The Horse Whisperer). Cinematographer Dante Spinotti uses color, light, and shadows to infuse the story with rich visual symbols. This is a good film by a team of gifted artists.But this is also an important film. It would be a mistake to see this film as simply a film about the tobacco industry or the co-optation of the news industry. Ultimately, it is about corporate power in its broadest sense. It was especially interesting watching this film on the weekend of the Microsoft monopoly ruling. The clear message of this film is that we all lose when the bottom line of corporate profits is our only moral compass. We live in a society desperately in need of prophetic critique and moral pronouncement. The Insider does not say all that needs to be said, but it provides a welcome start to a much-needed dialogue.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Thoroughly engrossing account that works on all levels,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsA searing insight into the corruption that festers throughout the whole of the tobacco industry,The Insider should prove riveting even to those put off by lengthy films.For this is told with such invigorating style and uncontendable compassion the running time of 151 minutes will pass like nothing.It's filmed in a completely different fashion to any other film before it as well,with almost non-stop camera angle close ups on the characters and soft lensing on the dramatic scenes.Michael Mann's style of direction works far better here than it did in his previous feature Heat,and he manages to make Al Pacino's lead performance far more involving too.Pacino is portraying,in what is alledgedly a true story,a complex man,with varying degrees to his character and personality,torn between his job at the TV station and his concern for Russell Crowe's character,who also turns in a quiet,genuine performance as the beleaguered former chemical researcher.Michael Gambon is convincing as the American head of the firm,putting on a first rate accent too which gels with his voice magically.The frustrating,not to mention bewildering,thing for viewers in the UK is that for some reason,the film is only availible in widescreen.It is worth looking past this descrepancy to enjoy what is easily one of the finest films of the year.*****",,Anonymous,Biography
A Michael Mann film without the shoot out.,"I started watching this at midnight, not knowing it was nearly 3 hours long, and did not feel urged to divide it into an additional viewing.Everything you have heard about this movie is probably true.Mann crafts a wrenching tale of two men's plight to adhere to their personal ethics. One a Newsman, Pachino. The other a scientist, Crowe.If the satirical lunacy of ""Thank You For Smoking"" could be akin to the easy goings of Gerber Baby sauce, then this indigestion in the form of a laxative.Mann's uncanny and infamous eye for precision and uncompromising realism is a marvel of stylish substance in itself. Almost like it's own thematic element regardless of what it's attempting to illustrate or accompany as a motif.Unfortunately, I had been preprogrammed by his former films; ""Heat,""0 ""Collateral"" and the often overlooked, ""Miami Vice,"" to expect some sort of climactic hell-storm of machine gunfire. At first, I was actually--prematurely, at that--deeming this destined to be a stop-gap film in Mann's career. By mid-way, the sentiment of how wrong I had been was becoming more than embarrassingly palpable with each furthered development in the plot.The film could have ended several times. It could have inferred several completely differing resolutions. It proceeds despite itself to formulate it's plot out of significant character's arcs and roles, rather than playing to simply Crowe's predicament. Mann's narrative and subject matter is so layered and sparse with an unrecognizable plot at first glance, it could have properly faired well as a mini-series, similar to that of ""State of Play.""",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Russell Crowe shines as another glowering protagonist.,"""The Insider"" is a good movie about the topic of tobacco manipulation. Most people that I know have been aware of the dangers of smoking for a very long time and so it's really no surprise to learn that major tobacco companies make it so that cigarettes are highly addictive. Apparently this isn't supposed to be fair, especially since the CEOs of the 7 major companies all swore under oath that they didn't believe nicotine was addictive. This movie is about a scientist who worked for Brown and Williamson, the #3 tobacco company, who had knowledge that his CEO lied and therefore cast doubt on the veracity of the other 6 CEOs. So, in a nutshell, if they lied and knew their product was causing cancer deaths worldwide, they would therefore be liable and could be sued for billions of dollars. The movie centers on Al Pacino as ""60 Minutes"" segment producer Lowell Bergman, and glowering Russell Crowe as Jeffery Wigand, the scientist with a conscience, as they struggle to come to grips with the truth as it relates to the law and their ethics. Christopher Plummer also shines as Mike Wallace.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Al Pacino doles out some righteous anger as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who went to the mat for whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), and there is certainly inspiration to be found from the courage and conviction of both men.

Lowell Bergman, representing integrity, remains one of the most memorable characters in American cinema.",,Anonymous,Biography
Fine piece of filmmaking that doesn't leave a lasting impact,"Whilst expertly directed by seasoned dab hand Michael Mann, it's debatable whether The Insider justifies its existence by the end, given it's working with such a slight story, and a relatively minor chapter in history, however it's testament to Mann's detail-rich prowess that he's able to mine the greatest amount of tension possible to create what is in some movements a very nerve jangling, and exhilarating experience (even though some of his digital cam shots and new-age soundtrack, in the context that they're given, verge on overwrought pretension).We also get some great emoting and monologuing by some of the best in the business in Russell Crowe (whose physical transformation into Jeffrey Wigand, just a year before Gladiator, is startling and utterly convincing), Al Pacino, and Christopher Plummer, that lends a sense of urgency, and their own distinctive charm makes for compulsive viewing.What perhaps convinced me less was how some of the supporting actors are utilised, e.g. Diane Venora (who in her earlier scenes especially bares an uncanny resemblance to a young Jessica Lange), much like how she appears in Mann's Heat, is given the thankless role of the wife who's either crying or flipping out in every other scene, making out as if she's the real victim here, and just generally feeling like a spare part. I get why she's there; to represent the personal collateral and fallout to Wigand's decision to blow the whistle (however righteous it may be) but she's more a cliched stock character whose presence feels like it's there purely for contrived drama.Also I don't even know why Rip Torn is in the movie; sure he was never an A-lister but he has a recognisable face and demeanour that surely you'd want to capitalise on to some degree, not just to plonk in the background in a couple of very brief scenes (so brief it's not explicitly clear what his position is) that amount to about 20 seconds of screentime. That again just feels like a cheap ploy to keep the audience interested; i'll always maintain that JFK and Oppenheimer have the two best ensembles not because of star power alone but because how each and every actor has a memorable impact regardless of how long they feature, in a way that furthers the story. Michael Gambon too feels like a random pick in his part of a tobacco baron.This isn't to say any of these actors are unwelcome; in Torn and Gambon's cases especially they're unconventional choices so when the opening credits rolled their involvement piqued my curiosity, but they felt wasted. Bruce McGill fares much better though, and his outburst at B&W's chief attorney during Wigand's testimony is a highlight of the film.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Captivating; enrapturing and enthralling legal thriller, with which the superlatives just about run out as some terrifying dramatisations take centre stage.","Michael Mann's The Insider is perhaps one of the most accomplished thrillers I've ever seen, a nigh on two and a half hour battle through turmoil; plight; anguish and terror so as to show up those evil enough to do what they do. The film, one of the very best of not only its respective year but the decade of the 1990s, is a thrilling; alarming and intuitive legal thriller based mostly on fact about the proverbial little guy suffering from fraught attacks of the conscience where those in the past have blazed through unabashed before eventually going on a campaign with the view to triumph over megalomania. In all of its runtime, there is barely a dull nor uninteresting moment; Mann effectively going on to tell two tales of hard-edged and immense confrontation that is never anything less that wholly fascinating as it juggles character with narrative with a real sense of filmmaking.One of the two chief protagonists is Al Pacino's Lowell Bergman, a journalist more specifically tied to a television news production named ""60 minutes""; our first sight of this man highlighting his unwavering ability to deal with what seems a rather hair raising situation when he occupies a small room, blindfolded, and manages to swing an interview with a stiff and uneasily moved Lebanon based Sheikh. Once a worker for a publication entitled 'Ramparts Magazine', the inferring that he has come a long way in his chosen field feels prominent. As things unfold, he'll go on to become more deeply involved in the affairs of Russell Crowe's Jeffrey Wigand; a recently fired tobacco company executive whom drives home to distorted editing and cold blue hues as the reaction to being let go settles on his mind. The few fleeting moments we see of the man at his office has him observe the staff party going on next door as he packs away his things alone, the sense of him being an outsider; disconnected or disenchanted with those of whom he works prominent - nobody is seeing him off, and this disconnection or alienation to his workplace or company comes to feature prominently later on. His wife is Liane (Venora), one of his two young daughters is Barbara (Eisenberg) whom suffers from asthma.Their coming together is through a series of crude and unspecific faxes they send to each another, Bergman's receiving of numerous tobacco company documents sees him contact Wignard for specificities on the subject. One thing leads to another and his ex-tobacco company, representative of Michal Gambon's cold and methodical in tone but large and imposing and authoritative in figure, megalomaniac calls him in to reach some sort of confidentiality deal. Crowe's character is seated in-front of his former boss as another employee looms anonymously as well as ominously behind Crowe whilst cut off at the shoulders; the deal he's called in for breaking down and causing all manner of antagonism and conflict. The resulting threats cause them to revoke his medical related compensation after being fired, meaning they are effectively targeting doing young Barbara harm and are therefore even more efficient as the villains of the piece.Mann's film is a documenting of the plump, bleary-eyed and somewhat weedy looking Wignard going up against this company with the keen and effectual Bergman. On most of the occasions Crowe's character occupies the screen, he's shot in an unflattering manner; his ambling and stumbling frame not particularly complimenting his overall build and going hand-in-hand with the relatively concurrent close ups of his facial features that dominate the frame: his expression rendered desperate and this working particularly well during the instances in which Wignard is on the telephone so as to capture this grossly unflattering look. The interplay is illuminating, the observing of this man in Wignard just having his life crumble in-front of him born out of the threats his ex-company implant onto him and the paranoia he carries that Bergman is merely in it for himself as a journalistic coup is morbidly fascinating.Mann balances each of the respective plights ingeniously; where he has his audience sympathise with Crowe, he has them associate themselves with Pacino as this outsider to both the story and the finer details of the case. Where it's established the tobacco company are evil, sinful, grotesquely amoral, loathsome and downright putrid in their actions anyway, Mann has them simultaneously deny nicotine as a suspiciously addictive material as well as demean the war dead when a small but revealing little moment sees Wignard's vehicle pause beside a Second World War memorial graveyard as Wignard sits in the foreground while the man travels to speak openly about things his ex-employers would prefer aren't revealed: the exercising of one's freedom of speech over which those in the graveyard we have resonating in the background essentially died for, and the same freedom of speech the imperialist mega-corporation essentially wish to suppress or take away, feeling prominent. Mann's The Insider is a quite brilliant dramatisation of some eerily true-to-life events, one of the best legal thrillers of recent times and a powerhouse of the filmmaking hallmarks in editing; direction; acting and cinematography combining to form something quite special.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Re-watching 'The Insider',"I distinctly remember seeing 'The Insider' for the first time in an old traditional theater on the main city square of Santa Cruz, Bolivia, sometime in early 2000. I'm sure I went back to see it a second time while it was still showing there.I know I must have seen it several times more since then, because I can remember almost every important line from the movie. But re-watching it now, it still amazes me with its freshness, intensity, and artistry. The camera work and shots are surprising, and really caught my attention this time: the extreme closeups, the contrasts between light and shadow, as well as between the extreme focus and blurry parts of the shots.'The Insider' was a commercial failure. A flop. It lost at least $30 million for Touchstone Pictures and Disney (the film's distributor and the bigger studio behind Buena Vista Pictures). The film also didn't win any Oscars (it was nominated for 7) but was beat out in every category that year by 'American Beauty' -- by comparison, an inferior, over-hyped picture. And so 'The Insider' -- a movie with a serious grown-up story about a real-life issue with the most serious implications; a story touching on health, business and the news media; a complex film for thinking adults – couldn't attract audiences to the theater, without any shootouts, car chases, or explosions.It also happens to be Michael Mann's best film, for all the reasons just mentioned. Everyone involved rises to the occasion and is great in this: Bruce McGill, Diane Venora, Michael Gambon, Mister Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Colm Feore. And the major players have some of the best roles of their careers, playing real-life figures. Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace: smug, vain, and yet crotchety. Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand: an anal, worried, stand-offish but tormented witness, trapped somewhere between his conscience and his comfort; his anger and resentment and the stable family life he once had. And Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman: the driven, self-righteous crusader for the freedom of the press, who has built a career seeing himself as the insatiable hound hunting after the truth -- And damn the consequences! (Best Pacino-as-reporter line: ""Everything interests me."")Watching it now, supposedly from the moral-high-horse perspective of a smug ex-smoker, is also new for me. I started smoking -- like most young idiots -- to look cool. Which was something I learned at least partially from images of smoking I saw in the movies. The media image of smoking on screen seemed to communicate something adult, sophisticated, mysterious, cool – all the things that I wanted to be.... I was a heavy smoker over a period of about 18 years (on and off, quitting for at least 2 of those years). I smoked hundreds of packs, thousands of cigarettes in that time: Marlboro Reds, Gitanes Blondes, Gauloises Bleus, Marlboro 'Lights.' I only quit (this time, hopefully the last time) about a year ago. I am almost 43 years old. Statistically, this means I will probably die of some later medical problem related to those years I spent smoking. Fully 1/2 of smokers now living and smoking will die from smoking-related illnesses. Fifty per cent. Take a coin out of your pocket and flip it. Call it: heads you live, tails you die.I was smoking away years of my life, deliberately ignoring reality. I think about these things, too, as I re-watch this film.It's only right that Hollywood tries to even the score a little in this case. It would take another six years before the comedy 'Thank You for Smoking' appeared, in 2005. Two films: that's it. Two movies in the entire one-hundred-year history of cinema. Only two films to question the deadliest drug ever shown on film -- as opposed to the sanitized, idealized, romanticized version shown in thousands of films, over more than a hundred years. Another thing to think about as you watch 'The Insider.'",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Engaging and impressive across the board despite a few niggles,"Fired from his vice-president research job with a large tobacco firm, Jeffrey Wigand accepts a temporary consultation role for Sixty Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. During this comparatively straightforward role, Wigand catches Bergman's interest by clearly stressing what he can discuss and not discuss. From this casual comment, Bergman starts asking and learns of Wigand's opinion that the CEO of his former employer perjured himself because the firm is very much aware of the addictive effect of their product. When Wigand decides to move forward with Sixty Minutes and act as a whistleblower, pressure is very quickly brought to bear on him, his family and all the companies involved in the story.There appears to be little debate on this site as to whether or not this film is long and slow  it almost certainly is both. However where there is a lack of consensus is over the question of whether this is a problem or not. So we get comments saying how engaging it all is contrasted with those bemoaning it for its length and how boring it all was. I cannot say who is right or wrong, all I can do is add my opinion to theirs and say that to me there was the risk of this being quite hard work and I think it is credit to those involved that it is not. I was surprised by the fact that I still had not gotten round to seeing this film almost a decade after it was made, but in my defence the subject does make it sound like it will be dry as sand and as exciting as ironing. Still, given the stuff I do watch it is a real oversight on my part not to have seen such a high profile film.Watching it for the first time is to be impressed. As someone else has said, most people will know how it ends but yet the film still manages to grip the viewer. The story itself is fascinating not only in regards what happens but also its wider meaning. The script allows the viewer to understand the commercial forces on the tobacco companies but also on the news firms and this helps to make the film more interesting than just the very specific story of Wigand. However the central story itself is still interesting and it does fill the time with a steady (albeit slow) pace throughout. The liberal bias inherent in the telling is a little off-putting as the film seems to be aiming a bit too squarely for corporations and those making the money rather than just letting the audience draw their own conclusions. That aside though it is still a quality piece of work across the board.Mann's direction draws out strong performances and also puts the audience into the action even when, technically, there isn't any. He is greatly helped by cinematographer Spinotti, who delivers corporate blues and greys as well as alternating between a static camera in some scenes and a unsteady handcam that matches the increasing stress and strain being put on Wigand. The lead two are both excellent. Pacino of course chews the scenery but he does so in a way that is comparatively restrained to when he is particularly hammy  here he is just right, a strong presence but not to the point of being detrimental. Crowe is just as impressive but provides a very subtle performance that has the material but lacks the flamboyance of Pacino's performance while being just as good. Support is solid with turns from Hall, Plummer, Gambon, Gershon, Torn, Tobolowsky and Venora and the cast doesn't really have a weak spot.It is long, it has very little in the way of ""action"" for those looking for explosions and such and the political slant on the telling is very much to the Left, but yet it is engaging and professionally done. The cast are impressive at best and strong at worst while Mann and Spinotti have produced a film that is beautifully crafted and uses the camera to engage the audience as well as the performances and story. Don't follow my procrastinating example and seek this film out soon.",,Anonymous,Biography
Overly long film that fails to escalate,"The Insider was the first of three films Russell Crowe was consecutively nominated for an Academy Award. He received the Best Actor Oscar the following year for Gladiator. Russell Crowe was thirty four when he played the role,eighteen years younger than the real Jefferey Wigand. A grey haired wig and some makeup was used to make him appear older but it really looks like a younger man wearing a wig. He still is a talented actor and delivers with a meritorious performance.This film starts off on a prosepectible trajectory but it quickly evaporates. This film doesn't progress or escalate and merely circles about. It doesn't sail forward but drifts sideways. Initially the plot is more centered on Wigand and his family. However,as it continues its focus centers on Al Pacino's character and his conflict with CBS and Brown & Williamson. As a matter of fact, towards the end you start looking back and wonder if that was the same movie.Wigand's whistleblowing lead to lawsuits of hundreds of billions of dollars and the way governments view the tobbacco industry. But how much did this affect the public ? Cigarette consumption didn't decrease due to these events,at least not by a sizable margin. It's something worth noting.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Pretentious, over-serious, over-acted","In The Insider Michael Mann exposes the big bad evil of corporate America. Not that anyone would have realized that the tobacco industry was just trying to make people addicted to nicotine in order to sell more of their product without watching this hard-hitting docudrama expose.  And in case you don't get this message in the first fifteen minutes of the film, Mann goes to great detail to drum it into you in every other scene.  For example, we are shown--over and over and over-- the scene where Jeff Wigand (played so constipatedly by Russell Crowe) is being interviewed by Mike Wallace on 60 Minutes while a camera softly pans the other characters' faces again and again as they poignantly watch the interview.  I guess this is supposed to be like, a collective realization for all of us that yes, corporate America is evil and we, innocent the American citizens and liberal media have been duped by this evil force.  Yes, Michael, I understand.  Big tobacco = bad. Liberal media and American citizens = good victims.  Deep.  Very, very deep, Michael Mann.  And I really dug the way Mann used the handheld camera for 3/4ths of the film, making some scenes so jumpy that I was wondering if the characters had nervous ticks or were jumping up and down for the camera.  It was just like, so realistic and raw.  And I really enjoyed the post-1960s Baby Boomer guilt of Al Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman.  It's like, ""Yes, I am a Yuppie who has a mulimillion dollar job, house, and life in New York city, but I relieve my 1960s liberal guilt by saying Herbert Marcuse was my mentor and proclaiming myself a 'liberal journalist.'""  Wow.  I guess that makes everything OK.  And then there was Al Pacino's screaming like 50% of his lines in the film.  That really brought out the ""meaningfulness"" of the whole ""liberal media fighting evil corporate America"" theme.  And I just liked the way most of the characters were really unempathic to one another's nurturing needs, especially during the moments when they needed to cry or be held.  It's always great to see Hollywood churn out another damaging image-fest where there's lots of yelling, advice giving, and abandonment when characters need to listen to one another.  It really excites me when these images are held up for the whole world to see (especially when the images proclaim themselves to be examples of ""real life"" behavior, as in this flick) so kids and adults alike can imitate them and unconsciously internalize the oligarchical/patriarchal power structures which they represent.  There were a few nice moments in the soundtrack--the opera piece stands out for me here--but overall, that ended up coming across as pretentious as well.  I am definitely not in tune with the ""Academy.""  I can't believe this film was nominated for 9 awards.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Crowe revelation,Intrepid '60 Minutes' producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) gets Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) an interview with Hezbollah. He wants to do a story about cigarettes accidentally setting fires and receives a stack of technical documents. He seeks out Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) to translate the jargon. Wigand just got fired from Brown & Williamson Tobacco Company. His daughter suffers and he needs the medical coverage in his severance package. The company is playing hardball with his confidentiality agreement. The pressure is overwhelming and from all sides.This is a terrific Michael Mann movie. The story doesn't have natural kinetic energy. However he creates such tension from the story. Al Pacino gives his usual power acting. Russell Crowe is a revelation as a haggard middle-aged family man. The subject matter could easily drown in white collar gobbergoob talk. However Mann makes it a great character study and an energized thriller.,8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Slow and no action : boring.,"Slow, no action, below par performance by the big names, too long for the plot to come alive and when it is its already dead.

Smoke 'em out,"I still remember when ""60 Minutes"" interviewed Jeffrey Wigand, and I thought that Michael Mann's ""The Insider"" did a swell job telling the story. I'm not a bit surprised that the tobacco industry did what they did. According to what I read, General Motors tried to stop ""Roger and Me"" from getting released, so it should be no shock that Brown & Williamson tried to go after Jeffrey Wigand and ""60 Minutes"".I recall that Russell Crowe had to gain a lot of weight for his role as Wigand, only to lose it to play Maximus in ""Gladiator"". I guess that it's debatable whether or not Al Pacino eclipses him as producer Lowell Bergman, but both men do very well in their roles. I agree with a previous reviewer that Crowe's role here deserves more recognition (maybe even more than ""Gladiator"").Anyway, this is a very important movie. It just goes to show what these corporate industries are really all about. Once again, Mann shows himself to be a capable director, as he did with ""The Keep"", ""Heat"" and ""Ali"".Also starring Christopher Plummer, Lindsay Crouse, Philip Baker Hall and Gina Gershon.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Tense from Beginning to End!,"I am often suspicious of docudramas because sometimes they take so many liberties with facts or revamp and combine events for their own purposes. Oliver Stone is frequently guilty of this. This film portrays an event that I remember like it was yesterday. The subtle portrayal of a man who must face the horrors of our modern age, disgrace, divorce, dishonor, and lack of health insurance, is right on and Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are incredible in their roles. It becomes a battle between the integrity of modern journalism, the entrenched tobacco industry, and whether one man can change anything. It is believable because this is the way it happened. There are even disclaimers at the end dealing with a couple of shady issues. I was also incredibly impressed by Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Mike Wallace. Except for the voice, I almost felt he was there. I didn't even remember this film existed until I saw it recommended in a ""best of"" list. I'm so happy I got to see something that really is for an adult viewer, not unlike ""Good Night, and Good Luck."" Keep these kinds of things coming.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
An Example for Future Films,"This film, like ""Good Night and Good Luck"", sends a clear message to me and hopefully to movie makers everywhere: we need more movies highlighting social and political issues, and we need more media outlets with some integrity.This film, directed by Michael Mann (""Miami Vice""), has given me a new respect for Mann and also for Russell Crowe, who I thought was not good for much besides getting sweaty and punching people. Crowe is a winner here, and alongside Al Pacino (who can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned) we have a dynamic duo on par with Batman and Robin.The story is of a tobacco executive (Crowe) who turns against his former employer with the help of a media producer (Pacino). With lawsuits a death threats the tobacco industry tries to stop them. I was not sure how the film was going to end because it keeps twisting and turning and although the true story did not happen long ago it was not one I was familiar with.I'm not going to critique the music or the directing or the acting or any other aspect of this film, other than to say it was excellent. The film was a bit on the long side, but this was not a bad quality in any way. I never felt a scene was wasted and the pacing was good enough to keep me engrossed. I admit I should have been sleeping for work but this movie held me to my screen.The Pepsi girl was in this film... who is almost as creepy as the Welch's grape juice girl. I don't know why I feel the need to mention that, but I do. Someday when I can't remember those commercials any more I will probably appreciate this actress more.Anyway, great film.

Stinging indictment,"Before I start, I should declare my bias up front; I have never understood the appeal of smoking.  Granted, I didn't grow up during the time when it was made to look cool in the movies, but I don't think it looks glamorous or stylish or any of that.  I can understand how some people will drink too much in that many alcoholic beverages actually taste good(I hope no one sees this as an endorsement of alcoholism, because it isn't), but cigarettes don't even taste good; it's just smoke.  I've always liked this routine I once heard where a comedian talked about smokers and their attitudes:""Smoking doesn't affect me, I can still exercise,"" they say.  Then you walk up a flight of stairs with them, and all of a sudden they turn into Darth Vader(heavy breathing).  Meanwhile, there's Yoda on the railing going, ""Stunt your growth, it will.""All that is to say I was predisposed to liking THE INSIDER before I even saw it, since it goes after the tobacco industry(anybody who thinks legalized drugs would improve things should consider how the tobacco industry has handled its own legalized drug).  But if that was all it did, it wouldn't be a complete movie.  Instead, THE INSIDER, and Michael Mann, also make this an indictment of the news industry, which is more concerned with industry than news, and a complex character study of two men.Admittedly, there are a few facts fudged here.  The most surprising thing is an omission; I'm not entirely clear on this, but wasn't one of the CBS executives related to someone at Brown & Williamson?  Also, while it's not true the movie gives credit to Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) for manipulating a Wall Street Journal story(he merely gives them the other side of the story they were about to print), it doesn't give the paper enough credit for its own investigation(as Bergman in the movie points out, the Journal is not exactly known for going after big corporations).Still, this is a powerful movie.  One thing, as I said before, which makes it powerful is how it also goes after CBS, and in particular CBS News, for caving in to the possibility of a lawsuit(not a lawsuit, just the possibility of one).  And while Mike Wallace has criticized the film(though he has retracted that somewhat), the fact of the matter is if he had made a stink about it, CBS might not have caved in so easily.  And yet the film doesn't portray him as a bad guy, just someone who doesn't know if he has the fight left in him.And as a character study, of course, it's riveting.  Some people think this film is a departure for Mann from his usual crime dramas.  But Mann has also made films about flawed heroes(MANHUNTER, THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS), which Jeffrey Wigand certainly is, and like the characters in Mann's more famous films(THIEF, HEAT), Wigand is a man good at his job, but not good at expressing his feelings, and backed into a stand he didn't know he was going to have to take.  Russell Crowe has not always played characters with simmering intensity(think of PROOF, THE SUM OF US, or THE QUICK AND THE DEAD), but as L.A. CONFIDENTIAL showed, he's masterful at playing them, and shows it again here.  He walks like a man defeated at the beginning, when he's fired, and you can feel the longing he has just for things to be normal again.  But you can also see the intelligence and the man who refuses to be pushed around by anybody, whether it be the tobacco company or Bergman. Pacino is also quite good as Bergman, playing not a hero, but someone who also is pushed into a stand he didn't think he'd have to take.Oh yeah, and as usual for a Mann film, this looks incredible.  Just as ALL THE PRESIDENTS MEN(which this is being compared to) director Alan J. Pakula and cameraman Gordon Willis was able to visualize the creepiness of Watergate, here Mann and his cameraman, Dante Spinotti, emphasize how there's no black and white here by showing the gray areas visually.

"""We are in the nicotine delivery business"" Based on a true story about the secret injections of highly addictive chemical ingredients in cigarettes by the tobacco industry.","One of the best movies by director/producer/writer Michael Mann of his entire carreer. How can a movie about a lawsuit be so captivating, astonishing, touching and thrilling from beginning to end? Well, seeing is believing and watching ""The Insider"" is the ultimate proof that a seemingly boring story about a lawsuit can have such a powerful impact. This movie is many things, it's a drama, a thriller and criticism of the suffocating entanglement of corporate industry with journalism.The true story by itself is already amazingly shocking, but the way it is directed, photographed, acted and scored is truly magnificent as well. Lots of praise for the terrific acting performances by Al Pacino and Russel Crowe, who lift this movie to a higher level.This movie is based on a true story about the secret injection of chemical ingredients in cigarettes, which were added by the tobacco company with the sole effect/purpose of enhancing addiction to smoking. One insider scientist (Russel Crowe), who worked for the tobacco industry decides to become a whistleblower and consequently gets attacked viciously with all means possible by the tobacco industry. Al Pacino plays the part of a 60 minutes news reporter who wants to air an interview with the whistleblower, but suddenly finds himself entangled with corporate powers who try to stop him.Endnotes: in 1998 in real life, the tobacco industry settled the lawsuits filed against it by mississippi and 49 other states for 246 BILLION DOLLARS.The deadly impact of its tobacco products cost the world's economies more than 1000 billion dollars annually in healthcare expenditures and lost productivity.

One of the most intense movies ever made,"I'm not big on movies about journalism, but ""The Insider"" is interesting for its genre. It is more than just a movie for those who want to learn how to be a journalist (which is not my case). It is a very intense movie. The whole movie is full of tension, which is combined with strong suspense, comparable to a thriller (except with no violence). Not the most exciting thing to watch, but definitely a powerful film which happens to be based in a real story.The big downside of this movie is its long runtime of almost 2 hours and a half, which makes it become a little tiring during the last 20 minutes. If only Michael Mann had give me the script I would have deleted 20 minutes of it and made it a shorter movie. I can't lie to you: this movie requires patience. Once you get used to it, things become more natural, but still... lots of patience is needed to watch this movie, as well as a good mood.Besides the intense story, this movie has also solid performances by the actors. For example, Al Pacino is great as usual. Russell Crowe is really good in this role, much better than in any of those which he was nominated Best Actor. Cristopher Plummer has a strong presence too. And Bruce McGill is terrific, being simply incredible when he loses his temper and shouts the line «Wipe that smirk off your face!»The soundtrack is good. The dark/noir-like atmosphere is good too. The quotes are, most of them, very good. The scenario varies a lot - it goes from exotic places/sceneries to extremely simple and sometimes crude backgrounds, but this combination doesn't work badly.The nervous and tense Jeffrey Wigand is the main character of the movie. He lives such a conflict situation that I wouldn't want to be in his skin. I wouldn't want to go through a dilemma like that.Despite being a quite dramatic and intense film, it also has its big moments of comedy.

Nothing Black and White About This Film,"If there's one thing I hate about certain movies, it is that they are too ""black and white"". I'm not talking pigmentation, though, but rather the depth of the plot and characters. Life is too complicated and filled with shades of gray to be simplified at the theater, and I'm glad ""The Insider"" doesn't pander in that fashion.For a basic plot summary, this movie focuses on Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former ""Big Tobacco"" scientist who must decide whether to keep the trade secrets, or blow the whistle on the most powerful business entity in the U.S. On the story is journalist Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who (against his ethical code) becomes personally involved with Wigand and as such gets drawn even deeper into the business intrigue.There is nothing simple about this film: Should Wigand do the interview and put his family in danger all in the name of ""ethics""? Should Bergman take the case to another level at the expense of HIS future? Nearly ever situation in the movie will make you contemplate what is ""right"" or ""wrong"".What really makes this solid film into a 5-star experience, though, is the acting of Pacino. I never really got into Pacino's earlier mob flicks, but his later-years work (like here) really impresses me. Does he play essentially the same character all the time? Absolutely. But it doesn't matter in the slightest because he is so incredible at it. The most natural ""intense guy"" actor I've ever seen.Thus, ""The Insider"" is a great movie that will draw you in with the engaging plot, incredible acting, and the real-life setting based on a true story. I can't vouch for the film's historical accuracy, but as a stand-alone film it deserves all the Oscar nominations it garnered.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Two Men, Two Fights","I love movies that are based upon real events and go into detail about the event being covered.""The Insider"" is about two men fighting two battles against two corporations. One man is Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe) who was a scientist with the tobacco company Brown & Williamson. He had critical knowledge about the chemicals being used in cigarettes, but was not allowed to share it due to a confidentiality agreement he had with the company.The other man was Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) who was a producer for the show ""60 Minutes."" CBS corporate wanted to squash the Mike Wallace interview with Wigand that would expose the entire tobacco industry and Lowell was trying every trick he knew to get that interview televised.This movie was about the importance of the media in bringing certain scandals and travesties to light while also showing how the media can be controlled when certain interests are threatened. Running parallel to that was the story of a man conflicted. He could violate his confidentiality agreement, possibly be imprisoned due to such a violation, and lose everything or keep quiet and let the multi-billion dollar tobacco company continue to do what they do.This movie reminded of movies such as ""All the King's Men"" and ""Kill the Messenger"" which focused on relentless journalists exposing government corruption. I like the idea of journalists not beholden to the state who go in and expose corruption to the American people.""The Insider"" was properly done. They took the time necessary to develop the plot and hone in on details to stress the significance of it all. Pacino was wonderful as the idealistic SJW producer willing to stand up to the likes of CBS and Crowe was a close second to Pacino.

Truth is Stranger Than Fiction!,"60 Minutes is one of our finest television hours today. It has been around since the late sixties and has become a fixture on Sunday nights. As it gets older, it gets better. If you are not a fan of 60 Minutes, you might be after this film. It's one of the most incredible news hours on television. I always watch the show on Sunday nights. Anyway, this film is inspired by the actual events that brought a segment to life despite the possible devastation and possible ruin of CBS and 60 Minutes. Russell Crowe played Dr. Jeffrey Wigrand, a tobacco industry scientist, who gets fired and realized his industry's lies. Somehow Pacino played Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer, who gets the story with Wigrand's interview which could shatter the tobacco industry's image as ignorant about the effects of smoking. Well, I think this film belongs to Pacino because he's brilliant in the role. Crowe does a brilliant performance as Wigrand, torn between his family and the truth. Christopher Plummer should have gotten an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his performance as Mike Wallace. There are not many actors who could have pulled off Mike Wallace but Plummer does a brilliant job that was ignored at Oscar time. Still the cast is brilliant with Lindsay Crouse as Bergman's wife; Debi Mazar as his assistant; Diane Venora as Mrs. Wigrand.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A very well-done movie about the expose' of the dirty, cheating, lying tobacco industry.","Although somewhat dramatized, ""Insider"" is based on the real events and real people which resulted in the mid-90s expose' in the USA by TV's ""60 Minutes"" of the dirty, lying, money-grubbing tobacco industry. Since I am not a smoker, and have little regard for long-time smokers, I paid very little attention to the real events when they happened. However, this movie provides a fascinating insight into the TV news business, and the tactics of the dirty, lying, money-grubbing tobacco companies and their CEOs and their lawyers.Al Pacino as usual does a fine job as the ""60 Minutes"" producer. Interestingly, the insider, Jeff Wigand and the B&W CEO are both played by British actors, Russell Crowe and Michael Gambon, but they both do credible jobs with ""American"" accents. Crowe, especially, is superb as Jeff Wigand.I saw this on DVD. Although it has a couple of interesting extras, including glimpses of some of the real characters, the DD 5.1 soundtrack is disappointing.  Except for a couple of early scenes, one in a cafeteria and one with rain, there is virtually no sound in the rear channels.  Not up to today's standards for 5.1 sound.Overall I rate this movie ""9"" of ""10"" and one that everyone should see.",,Anonymous,Biography
"I'm running out of heroes, guys like you are in short supply.","'The Insider' is as stylish as it is thought-provoking. Based on real-life events makes the film timeless, but more, the overall message the movie carries beneath its devastating true story makes the film even more poignant today - the era where corporate greed has grown, and manipulation with media is so out of hands that they barely try to hide it anymore. Michael Mann uses magnificently his trademark action film aesthetics to bring this deep humane crime drama on to the screen. Stylish editing, novel camera movements and slow-motion don't draw any attention from the story, but it enhances the fear that the characters are going through. The visual style adds just another layer of intensity to already a suspenseful story and wonderful acting works.

Like any movie-going experience, the audience yearns for a film to be artistic, educational, and informative. In The Insider, director Michael Mann executes these subjects flawlessly on screen as he relies on these subjects to convince the audience that nameless, faceless, and voiceless characters shall prevail over greed and evil.

"Not all that remarkable, but still well-made","Based on the way they set up the plot of The Insider, I was expecting more of a man-on-the-run type of story. They certainly make it seem like there's some significant danger for the main characters. I think the primary reason that I found the film a bit underwhelming was simply because it didn't feel like the stakes were as high as the movie was implying. Yes, the men involved faced severe opposition and standing up to the tobacco industry caused them great personal frustration. But it never seemed their lives were in danger. Likewise, the content of their ""groundbreaking"" story is such old news to me, and I struggle to understand why it mattered so much. Was it really that shocking to people in 1996 that cigarette corporations knew their products were life-threatening and that they actively worked to make them more addictive? I was in my late teens at that time, and I'm pretty sure that I assumed all of this was true.Despite all of my issues, when I was able to go with the flow and accept the story of The Insider as a high stakes endeavor, I found some enjoyment from it. The tone and atmosphere is excellent and offers plenty of nervous tension throughout. I appreciated the performance of Al Pacino, because he isn't over-the-top and crazy like he has become in many modern movies. I do wish they had cast someone more charismatic and interesting than Russell Crowe to play the lead role. However after watching the actual interview, it doesn't seem like Wigand is all that exciting, so perhaps Crowe was delivering the performance just right. Which brings me to my other important positive about The Insider. It was not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it did interest me enough that I made a point of seeking out the original video of WIgand's 60 Minutes interview. I suppose, for a movie based on a true story, that's a big win. The Insider might have lacked something for me, but at least I was intrigued.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
An important film.,"In telling the story of Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman's struggle to get the truth out, director Michael Mann was presented with two distinct goals. For one, he took on the duty of telling this important, human story to the audience. Also though, he had the difficult task of taking this story and turning it into an engaging, thrilling piece of film. There's a scene where a character discusses with Bergman how this story is something that matters, something has a national impact. For 60 Minutes, it could just be a piece of ""Sunday night entertainment...something to put on between commercials"", a story to grip the audience while they're eating their dinner. In creating The Insider it could have been the exact same thing, and part of it has to be that. Mann is given the difficult task of not only creating a piece of entertainment, a film to bring in audiences and keep them engaged for the 157 minute running time, but in taking on this particular story he also has to keep the integrity of it in tact, to make the audience aware and educated on the importance of Wigand's journey. In creating the film Mann found himself in a similar position to Bergman himself, and he pulled it off magnificently.Here Mann tells a story that really matters, something that resonates within the foundation of the American public, pulling apart a lie told against the foundation of our legal structure and shaking up the tobacco industry which had been man-handling people like Wigand and the American public for decades. This is a story that has to make a difference in the world, beyond just being a piece of entertainment. Michael Mann was the perfect director to take the wheel here because he, working from a script co-written by Eric Roth, knows just how to create a distinctively cinematic thriller but also has the intelligence to do justice to the real life people involved. Mann pieces together a precise, incredibly exciting thriller that's never dull for a moment but he also doesn't overly exaggerate events to the point where he betrays the people he is capturing on screen. He creates a film that is very cinematic, with his excellent staging and use of hand-held cameras, but is also very true. This truth then adds an even higher sense of tension to standard thriller scenes like the moment with Wigand at the driving range or searching for someone in his backyard.There is a scene where a lawyer, played by Colm Feore, that Wigand is working with talks to him about what Wigand is going through. He compares it to his experience in combat, noting the difference in the fact that combat lasts only a few seconds whereas Wigand's struggle lasts day after day, month after month and sinks into his entire life, leaving an impact on his family and his financial future. Watching Crowe's face in this moment, you can truly see the level of that impact on him. He is a good man in an unjust system, and Crowe takes us thoroughly into his anguished mind here. The extensive running time of the film gives ample opportunity for the audience to feel those walls slowly closing in on him. Nothing feels rushed or too undeveloped, but instead Mann and Crowe bring us on a slow descent with this character and watching him finally explode is a shattering moment.It's no secret to say that Al Pacino's work has taken quite the decline since his tremendous emergence in the '70s. Still, despite disappointing on most occasions he manages to every so often give a performance that is worthy of his legacy and remind the world what a powerful talent he truly is. His work as Lowell Bergman is one of the best examples of just that, portraying the former radical journalist who know works for the giant corporate network of CBS. Bergman is a man who constantly fights for what he believes in, fighting to tell the important stories and using the broader audience that CBS allows without giving in to the restrictions that come with working in such a large corporation. Taking on Wigand's testimony, Bergman is told for the first time that he's going to have to betray his word to a source and this doesn't sit well with him. There's an interesting parallel here again between what Bergman goes through and what Mann must face as well, working in the film industry. He is told to put his beliefs on hold, to sacrifice his word because CBS is too afraid of the consequences and in his riotous, dismayed reaction you have to wonder if Mann himself has ever given similar speeches when being told that he can't do something.Ultimately, Bergman and Wigand share a lot of things in common as human beings. They come from incredibly different worlds, Bergman being groomed on the streets and knowing the ins and outs of the industry, whereas Wigand is just a doctor from Louisville, Kentucky who is thrown in over his head with all of these large men with larger wallets. Despite their backgrounds though, they are both men who have their pride and their integrity and they are fighting for what they believe is right. They see these men of Big Tobacco lying on national television, lying in a court of law, and they know that it isn't right. They fight to get their story out, to expose the truth and force these men to face the consequences and it's a story that Michael Mann knows was important to get out to the film-viewing public. He does it with great stride, creating a film that is not only human and important, but also a fully engaging and tense thriller. I'm a large fan of Mann's work as a director throughout his career, but there is no doubt in my mind that this is his true masterpiece.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Role reversal,"Many great actors fall into self-parody atone time or another. Brando did, Orson Welles did, and so has Al Pacino.  A frequent criticism I've heard of Pacino over the last ten years or so is ""now he yells all his dialogue"", which is the layman's way or saying just that- that Pacino is playing some facsimile of himself, leaning on some remnant of past glories. Yet when we see Pacino in a different role, somethng unexpected of him, as the PC mayor in City Hall or the sleazy near-Satanic attorney of Devil's Advocate, the audience doesn't quite accept him.  Of all the big actors, Pacino is the one most identified with a particular character, the crusader who fights the corrupt system- even if he's corrupt as well, as he was in the Godfather movies or Dog Day Afternoon.  He now plays nearly everything over-the-top, like a Frank Gorshin doing an Al Pacino imitation (Glengarry Glen Ross was the last hint of subtlety or pinpoint anger), which is why his performance in ""The Insider"" comes as a pleasant surprise, even if the face is tired and the features slung low, he gives enough combative vitality to hearken back to the old days.The thing I found interesting here is the casting:  Russell Crowe, a man in his 30's playing a 50ish scientist and Pacino, a man of about 60 playing a 40 or so TV producer (even if he does look like he ought to be wearing glasses-on-a-chain).  This time the ""system"" is 60 Minutes, who has Pacino working on an expose of the tobacco industry, then after Pacino gets a top scientist (Crowe) to go on camera with damaging information that will ruin the scientist's family and work life, 60 Minutes honcho Don Hewitt, kowtowing to corporate interests, decides not to run the interview.  I'd like to think Hewitt and Mike Wallace in particular are not as bad as they come off here (Wallace is a brash egomaniac who ponders his legacy, his great gift to history and Hewitt so pragmatic and bottom-line-conscious he should be running a CPA firm).The two lead performances are terrific: Crowe is superb as well as the true crusader that's in all of us; we want to be brave but with an eye toward the consequences.  Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace imitation is downright hysterical, although I swear to God he sounded more and more like the real Wallace by the end.  The negative to the picture is Michael Mann's direction.  His snail pacing is ponderous and he tends to present events as though they're Grand Opera.  One scene where Crowe returns home to find his wife and kids have left him is so laughingly overscored, so superfluous in its indication of a great moment that it spoils the delicacy of the simple emotion.  Mann, who also directed Pacino's cracked performance in Heat, seems to think he is creating epics, when, in fact, a movie with a theme of journalism should have been made to meet a deadline.  I thought ""Shattered Glass"", another movie about journalism, was better crafted, more taut and concise.

"Based on truth, pulling no punches, brilliantly made top to bottom. Amazing.","The Insider (1999)Wow, this is a searing, amazing tour-de-force. It comes across as fearless, and you wonder just how it got the okay to tell as much truth as it does. It slams the tobacco industry and CBS Corporation equally (though CBS News, as such, rises above). It creates a fluid, fast, intelligible, and moving story involving several key players. And it avoids sentiment, cliché, and shock, which is sort of amazing for a Hollywood film right there.Add three amazing, central performances by men who take on their roles as if they needed to for their lives. First is Al Pacino, who often plays the righteous and indignant voice of justice, and he plays it with more justice here than ever. Then there is Russell Crowe, playing the ""insider"" himself, a tobacco industry chemist who spills the beans about the lies in the industry, and with real psychological subtlety. And then, in more of a surprise, Christopher Plummer plays one of Pacino's counterparts with perfect pitch.Anthony Mann deserves a huge hand for his role pulling this together. He has a deft touch. He handles big material (spectacular stuff, really) with a steady beat of conviction, as if the point is not drama, but resolution. The music is superb, making clear that this is of course still a drama, and the editing, easily overlooked, creates a relentless but not distracting pace, leaving little things hanging just enough to keep us in suspense without obscuring the narrative.I sound breathless in praise, and I suppose my one reservation is that the movie, since it is based on known facts (and uses real names throughout), lacks imagination. That's a bizarre comment, and not a complaint, exactly, but there is a sense when all is done that it was already known from the start. Getting there was amazing, but the result is a heightened version of what we know and see all the time in the news and in the corporate worlds. And sometimes elements are repeated too often (the video tape), so you can see a trimmed down version having even more impact.But let me go back to being breathless. This is an overlooked, wonderful movie. That it holds interest so well after a decade is only proof that it might continue to work as a movie, as a drama, long after the events are in textbooks, and CBS is bought up by someone else. And so the world turns. Check this out. You won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Riveting,"Michael Mann's The Insider is a well done drama that looks into whistle blowers and the truth.  The film isn't fast paced or electric, but the way it is put together gets my attention.  The acting, the directing, the photography and the atmosphere bring this film to a fine touch (not to mention 7 Oscar noms).Based on a true story, the film circles on a scientist (played great in an Oscar nominated role by Russel Crowe) who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and a persuasive TV producer (played well by Al Pacino) wants him to tell on his news show 60 Minutes about what effects smoking does to your body.What the film shows is a startling trip in 2 parts- 1: scientist Jeffrey Wigand's trouble with being a whistle blower (he wound up losing everything, but gaining everything); 2: producer Lowell Bergam's struggle to get Wigand's testimony on 60 Minutes without being sued.

Well made but where is the surprise?!,"""The Insider"" details the back story about a segment that ""60 Minutes"" aired back in the early 1990s. A fired vice president of the Brown and Williamson tobacco company talked with CBS--even though he was forbidden by a confidentiality agreement to talk about the company to anyone. His conscience was bothered by some of the unscrupulous and dangerous things the cigarette industry was covertly doing that made cigarettes even more dangerous. The film stars several Hollywood heavyweights--Al Pacino (the head of ""60 Minutes, Russell Crowe (the whistle-blower) and Christopher Plummer (as Mike Wallace) and is a rather straight forward version of the story.I agree with most of the reviews--""The Insider"" is a very well-crafted film. However, it's also a case where the story, no matter how well made, is seriously flawed--at least to me. The theme of the film is how evil the tobacco companies are and how they knew that they were killing folks with their product. And, how this industry did its best to stop this story from being released by ""60 Minutes"". This is about as surprising as learning that pirates love booty, Nazis are evil or crack addicts love crack. Where is the story and where is the surprise?! Of course tobacco companies have been minimizing and denying that tobacco kills...DUH!!! They sell a product that kills people and they've been making it seem fun and glamorous for as long as they've been selling the product!! To me it's a no-brainer and frankly not that interesting. Plus, anyone who does choose to smoke is amazingly stupid--as we've known that cigarettes kill for many decades.

Dull. Empty.,"Pacino, Plummer, and Crowe ... even great actors cannot counter a poor story. It simply does not work.Here's my breakdown:STORY:
Many whistle-blower stories have been told and made into feature film e.g. ""All the Presidents Men"" (1976),
but you need meat in the story and not just great acting. The latter film is superb, but not because Hoffman
and Redford were gifted actors, no, but because they also had an excellent story to work from.Note: I'll say a bit more in Director and Writer comments, but Michael Mann is not a good storyteller, and this
has his ""mark"" of story-suffocation all over it.ACTING:
As written above, the acting is fine.ENTERTAINMENT:
Low - moderate depending on standardsTEMPO:
SlowCINEMATOGRAPHY:
This is Mann's strength, he does excellent camera workMUSIC / SOUND:
As I've said in other reviews, incessant music to create non-existent drama dilutes a story's tension, and is
invariably a signal that the story is lacking.DIRECTING / WRITING:
Director: Mann is a very capable director, but here again he takes on writing and producing roles ... rarely does
this work. When it does work consistently it's because the director is also a gifted writer, e.g. Steven Spielberg,
and a small cadre of others. Mann has directed and written successfully before, ""Heat"" (1995), but that was an
anomaly. Too much of his TV pedigree comes through, and TV-style-writing kills good story.Writers: This was Roth's first story for film, and if she was the primary writer, then that may explain the poor
quality of the story. But my bet is that Mann exercised too much control, and quashed her work. Dunno.Is it a good film? Borderline, but I would not call it ""good""Should you watch this once? No, too many similar films that are far betterRating: 6.0 (good camera work)",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

The price of being honest.,"This movie tells the intriguing story of mainly two normal individuals and their struggle to unveil the truth behind the lies of the tobacco industry, to the world.Michael Mann movies are often told slowly but they are never boring. This is due to the intensity it is told with, the realistic cinematography by Dante Spinotti and the editing by three different editors. On top of that the two main actors constantly keep the movie in motion. Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are both outstanding actors and are truly dynamite in this movie. Both are acting so powerful that they take the movie to an even higher level. Another fine 'villainish' role is played by Michael Gambon and lets please also not forget the wonderful Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace.The way of story telling makes the movie intense and tense at the same time. Only a director like Michael Mann could pull this of. It makes ""The Insider"" truly one of the greatest and most powerful movie of the last couple of years.In my view the movie can be split in two different parts. The first part is about Jeffrey Wigand, his family and the pressure he is put under while the second halve of the picture mainly focuses on Lowell Bergman and his struggle to get the taped interview with Wigand aired on television. The balance between these two parts is perhaps not always perfect and the movie at times focuses a bit too much on Wigand and his family. I know that it is important for the story and the character of Wigand to also tell the story of his family but I felt that at times it took away some of the continuity and pace.The movie works well and shows what the price of just wanting to be honest in a corrupt world can be.

Honestly, I often forget just how young he is given his roles.Al Pacino delivers the standard Pacino acting job as Lowell Bergman, the former ""60 Minutes"" producer who wants Wigand to be a whistle-blower. He understands that Wigand is being threatened, but he doesn't anticipate CBS not wanting to air the interview. This puts Wigand in danger, and destroys his family life in the process.

He has a surprising depth and sensitivity that makes his role a memorable one. Al Pacino toned down his usually flamboyant acting style into a more quiet, but convincing performance. Their crusade is fascinating to watch, and you'll find yourself totally engaged in the story.Complex issues are being explored, and the moral dilemma that characters are facing in their professional and personal lives makes this movie an excellent, spot-on portrayal of media business and corporate politics.

"An outstanding movie, not to be missed!!","After I have seen so many poorly written and directed movies, I was so pleased to see an excellent movie as The Insider. This movie is a superb example of what all movies should have regardless of the genre: well-crafted directing, scripting and acting. The Insider provides an intensely sustained drama from start to finish. Russel Crowe and Al Pacino give superb performances. I was even delighted with Christopher Plummer's performance as Mike Wallace. If you haven't seen this gem of a movie, GO SEE IT!!5 stars!!!",,Anonymous,Biography
Thoroughly well done and gripping.,"This is a film worthy of the great talent used in it. Mann is an outstanding director and this is one of his best. Pacino and Aussie Crowe are both on top of their form as are all the supporting actors and actresses.The story is well paced and deep and you end up really feeling for the central character who is putting everything on the line for the public benefit ...and probably for some measure of getting even after getting canned by his former employer - the Brown & Williamson tobacco company.For those weaned on non stop action flicks with explosions, fights and gun play in virtually every scene, this is not the movie for you. For you cerebral types who enjoy a twisted, deep story with multiple layers, this is one to get your teeth into. Another review compared it to ""All the Presidents Men"" and I couldn't agree more.I didn't give it a 10 only because it was a dark story about a truly despondent man who loses everything when he chooses to do the right thing. In that regard it depresses many folks. But, hey, this was a true story that portrays the vaunted CBS 60 Minutes in a very bad light as a gutless TV show managed by gutless producers afraid of being sued for telling the truth. If the truth is more than you can handle, look elsewhere.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
See it for the performances...but bring coffee,"There is just no way that a movie about '60 minutes' should be 3 hours long, yet Michael Mann finds a way to drag this out, much like he did in Heat. Yet despite the fact that the movie moves with the speed of a three-toed sloth on a NyQuil bender, the performances are absolutely hypnotic. Pacino, who is usually either great or cartoonish, delivers an adequate performance, but an unrecognizeable Russell Crowe is simply phenomenal.  But the most spellbinding character belongs to Christopher Plummer, who steals every scene he's in with an astounding take on Mike Wallace.  This isn't a bad movie by any means, but it's an actors movie; the performances really redeem what is otherwise an overlong exercise in directorial self-indulgence.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Intense, realistic, and brilliant","Normally, films that use a lot of hand-held camera or oddly-composed shots really bother me.  Michael Mann's use of the two in The Insider, however, is nothing short of brilliant.  This is not a movie.  It's an intense, visceral immersion in what it's like to put your future on the line for something you believe is right.  The audience does not watch The Insider - it walks alongside the camera as two men, 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and tobacco industry whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), put everything they have at stake to make sure the world finds out that the tobacco companies deliberately misled the public over the knowledge they had of their product's effects.  It is a raw, powerful, engaging experience, with Pacino and Crowe at the top of their game (as well as a fine supporting turn by Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes anchor Mike Wallace) providing masterful compliments to Mann's blistering direction.  Possibly the best film of 1999 (jockeying with American Beauty), The Insider is one of the ten best films to take its story from actual events ever made.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"""I'm alone on this""","One of the top performances of Al Pachino in any movie, they should teach this stuff as a reference in acting schools. In front of him, the great Russel Crowe seemed like a child playing with toys. Pachino was just on a different level. 👏🏻A real treat from start to finish. The legendary director Micheal Mann had me on the tip of my toes once again. The story constantly shifts its focus point over these two guys, one scientist who put all his life in the line of fire, blindly trusting the other guy, and the other one, the journalist who is tougher than rock not letting his whistleblower burn, and the friendship that's made in between. The story was so pulling I was extremely excited to see how the finale will be.In 1999, Insider walked so that 16 years later a film like Spotlight could run! What a great subgenre are these investigative journalism films. Count me as a fan.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Direction and Editing -- The Lost Arts,"Once again, Michael Mann illustrates clearly that has a film director, he sure knows how to do videos and car chases.

Disappointing because there were some excellent moments here, but far too much detached misanthropy.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Crowe's finest performance to date,"This is a fine film and in my opinion it is Russell Crowe's finest performance to date. Crowe is Jeffrey Wigand a top scientist working for a tobacco company. The senior bosses are not pleased with Wigand and drive him out of the company and then gag him by forcing him to sign a confidentiality agreement.Bergman is a producer at 60 minutes who contacts Wigand and realises he has a story to tell. This is an emotional roller coaster for Wigand who is an ordinary person under extraordinary pressure. Having got Wigand to tell his story Bergman must then fight the corporates to get the story aired. A fine movie and it's electric when Crowe is on screen. It can't be that often that Pacino is outperformed, but he is here and it's not that his performance isn't good, it is Crowe's that's excellent. Gripping entertainment.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping All The Way Through,"There's hardly a flaw in this true account of the 60 Minutes expose of a tobacco industry cover-up.Al Pacino is brilliant as Lowell Bergman, the 60 Minutes producer who struggles to convince former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand (equally brilliantly played by Russell Crowe) to grant an interview in the face of the industry's attempts to silence him, and then has to fight CBS management to put the interview on the air. This is just a marvelous film.From the beginning scenes of the setting up of an interview between Mike Wallace (played by Christopher Plummer, who does a valiant job in a difficult role, playing someone as well known as Wallace) and an Arab sheik involved with the Hezbollah movement we get a sense of the point to come: that dealing with Middle East terrorists is a lot safer than taking on the tobacco industry! We're also hit right off the top by the irony underlying everything. Wigand, who worked as a senior executive for a tobacco company, is a health care specialist with a seriously asthmatic daughter.The first part of the movie plays like a spy thriller, as it focuses on the threats made against Wigand and family to silence him, and the pressure this puts on his family life as we literally see the man begin to crumble under the pressure. The focus of the second half shifts to Bergman's desperate attempts to get Wigand's interview broadcast after everything he has risked to blow the whistle. The battle between Bergman and CBS, also under pressure from the industry not to air the story, and vulnerable due to the network's impending sale, is well portrayed.This movie is absolutely worth the watching. It is vaguely ominous as we're confronted by the power not just of the tobacco industry, but of big business in general. Definitely a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Truly superb drama with excellent performances by Pacino, Crowe and Plummer","Michael Mann follows his superb Heat with an excellent if more cerebral drama.Firstly, the script by Eric Roth and Mann brilliantly distills a complex story into narrative that is suspenseful, emotionally effective yet highly thoughtful and sophisticated. It certainly has a lot to say about the shady worlds of US corporate, legal and media culture. Despite this complexity the film zips along at a terrific pace, mainly due to the excellent script being supported by great direction and first rate acting by the whole cast, albeit special mention has to go to Pacino, Crowe and Plummer for truly outstanding performances.Certainly that fearsome intangible of powerful corporate forces working to destroy an individual's reputation comes across very strongly, and Russell Crowe's intense performance is key in selling this to the audience. It is also fascinating to see the situation that Pacino's Lowell Bergmann's character is put into by these corporate forces, and these two character's willingness to hold onto their integrity and beliefs is genuinely affecting despite the great personal cost it has on their characters, particularly Crowe's.Crowe's and Pacino's excellent portrayals are well complimented by Plummer veteran reporter/correspondent character, and the journey this character goes through while different, is nevertheless fascinating even if his character doesn't generate the same levels of sympathy for his plight – in fact it is his initial actions at a key point in the story that generate a great sense of disappointment in his character Mann orchestrates proceeding with bravado and panache, though not forgetting that this is a cerebral drama where ultimately it is the actors' performances that will lead to the success of the movie. However, Mann is a master of embedding slick film-making around excellent dramatic performances. Not only does he get the actors to shine, but he yet again draws excellent work from both the photography and editing teams, and huge credit has to go to editors William Goldenberg, David Rosenbloom and Paul Rubell, musicians Pieter Bourke, Lisa Gerrard and Graeme Revell, production designer Brian Morris and particularly Mann regular director of photography Dante Spinotti. It certainly deserved its 7 Academy Award nominations and in my view should have won several.Despite its lack of commercial success, this is a fantastic film, which tells of terrific story through excellent performances from its lead actors, who work in a visual environment that beautifully complements their performances, for which Michael Mann deserves huge credit.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very interesting.,"This is a true story that took place in the mid-90s (you can tell bythe oversized glasses and cell phones, lol) about an executive inthe tobacco company that was laid off and told a story about hiswork in the tobacco industry and how the customers who becameaddicted to nicotine were lied to. He went on 60 Minutes. Of coursehe is also threatened, his life is put in jeapordy, and he is stalked.Other complications come up along the way as well. Some of thedetails of the true story are altered, such as the ages of hischildren, but these details are very minor. If you liked  ErinBrockovich, you will like this!",,Anonymous,Biography
Slow paced but gets engaging and even a bit heart-wrenching as it progresses,"I am not a big fan of Micheal Mann as a director but he made few great movies and this is one of them. Micheal Mann has a style of directing that influenced other directors and it really works in this movie. It's a shame that this movie faltered when it came to the box office earning when the movie itself beats most movies that are Hollywood. But when it comes to box office earnings it's like that for most of his movies. But in this case it's understandable because this isn't a movie of the mass audience although it's a good movie. Especially since you have to focus a lot to the dialogue in order to understand what is going on. Al Pacino is good in this but Russell Crowe is excellent for this role. This has a ambitious journalist/producer for CBS news Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) going after Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe) who is a man of integrity but works for major tobacco company as general manager but gets fired for big information that can be breaking news. And these vital information can help others in a positive manner. But he is under a confidential agreement which he tries to keep but is being pushed around to the point of breaking. In another words he is the insider of one of one of the biggest company. The execution of this movie is very well done although it takes patience to get use to and it's not a big shock that this movie was nominated for 7 Academy Award Nominations. However if your looking for a action thriller this movie will not be for you. But what this is, is a realistic and intelligent approach to a journalist and a insider with some excellent dialogue. This is what movies that deserve award nominations is about.7.9/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Deep ""Insider""","Where would the filmakking without Michael Mann? The notoriously detail-oriented director has crafted such masterpieces as ""Heat"" and ""Collateral"", which transcend mere bullet operas and turn instead into wrenchingly violent character studies. However, in ""The Insider"", to quote Peter Travers, ""the characters shed no blood, only principles."" A young Russell Crowe beefs up and grays down to play Jeffrey Wigand, and ex-Big Tobacco exec who wants to go on national TV and blow the whistle on some of his company's darker practices. 60 Minutes supervisor Lowell Bergman (a fiery Pacino, who gives an excellent performance, although bearing no resemblance to the real Bergman)fights to get Wigand on the air, while the CBS Brass, along with veteran reporter Mike Wallace (Chritopher Plummer)do their best to kill the story, fearing a lawsuit. Mann turns a real-life newsroom battle into a pulse-pounding thriller, complete with a tense score by Lisa Gerrard and Pieter Bourke, and superb cimenatography by the great Dante Spinotti. If you want a single scene that showcases all of this, I'll give you one; Wigand golfs at night, and is threatened by a Big Tobacco worker. By blurring the world around him and shooting the driving range in ominous greens and blacks, Mann gives us a look inside Wigand's indecision, anger, and isolation. Wow. This is one of the best films of the 90's.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A big fan of these movies, not this one","I normally like these long developing deep movies.  I am a huge Pacino fan as well, his acting is incredible.  But, after seeing this movie, I said ""that's it?""  I had seriously felt like I had waisted my time.  Great story line, but I felt like the movie just came and went without changing any part of my thinking at all.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
masterpiece of the movie world,"This movie is based on a true story and depicts the two men's fight against the tobacco industry in U.S. One day, Jeffrey Wigand (acted by Russell Crowe) gets fired by Brown & Williamson, a big tobacco company. He is familiar with science and health and deeply knows that tobaccos are harmful to their health. However, all tobacco companies in U.S. claim that tobaccos are NOT toxic in order to maintain commercial benefits. Furthermore Brown & Williamson threatens Wigand and his family not to tell the truth about tobaccos' harm. Wigand cooperates with a journalist, Lowell Bergman (acted by Al Pacino) and they try to disclose the secret. However, they encounter plenty of difficulties arranged by Brown & Williamson.Though you may think first 30 minutes is boring, as a whole, this is certainly interesting. In the middle of this movie, Wigand and Bergman hit so many obstacles that they seem to be up against the wall. But nevertheless, Wigand's willpower and Bergman's journalism overcome the awful situation in the end of the story. It leaves a quite agreeable aftertaste.In addition to the great plot, their acting, camera work and music are also excellent. They enable us to feel sympathetic to main character's anger, depression and bravery.I strongly recommend you to watch this great work at any rate. I'm sure this is a masterpiece of the movie world.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good for those, and only those, who have the taste.","Overall, it's a good movie, but only those people will enjoy it who will have interest in slow paced works bringing critical thinking with some sets of twists and dramas. However, many people will see 7 Oscar nominations and quickly grab the movie, and will feel disappointed in the end. This movie is not for those who only enjoy fast pace action movies.Al Pacino and Russel Crowe are as good as they are expected. In fact, the whole cast was good, and if you are acting lovers, watch it. You will enjoy the movie.There were some flaws in the movie too, mainly with the script. After all, it was a long movie and was slow paced. The climax seemed to start much early, but the real one was very short. When there are so many characters in a single movie, it is indeed difficult to manage them. But what does the director think? If you haven't introduced a character, and haven't even declared their names once or twice, would the viewer still get the true impression and their purpose in the storyline? Many characters were there, playing there roles in the story, who were helping the story to go forward, but their roles failed to create the instant reaction, and when they did, it seemed to be almost too late. After watching the movie, I feel like I will enjoy it more if I watch for the second time. But what about the first time? Many people will feel trouble to follow the storyline and dialogues, as they were intended to create. Many people will feel bored in the middle of the movie, trying to keep track of the twists, which are not that hard to understand, but very difficult to concentrate. No one likes to memorize every name in the movie by himself, and trying to figure out what that character is doing in the movie.I have given it 7/10, because it could be lot better than it was. Still, I will highly recommend it to everyone, mainly because of it's cast and the topic. Although I'm a smoker myself, I do feel the importance of 'Consent'. People have every right to learn the bad consequences of Tobacco products.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A Plodding, implausible mess","Crowe plays a fired Tobacco Company employee whose conscience is burdened by a truth about nicotine everybody already knows. The premise of the film makes zero sense but to its credit, the film is consistent in maintaining its level of stupidity all the way through. Crowe's appalling rendition of an emotionally unstable whistle blower is a hate crime of a casting flub. But it's not half as bad as Diane Venora who supplies the ham as the whiny, nonsupporting wife in one of the most grating, amateurish acting performances in a film of this intended caliber. Pacino is excellent with his loud portrayal of 60 minutes producer Lowell Bergman and somehow fits perfectly in this dragging Tinseltownian cliché factory. Michael Mann, after 20 years, is still trying to convince himself that wobbling camera work for every scene is not annoying and distracting but is something adding beneficially to the viewing experience. It most certainly does not.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent suspense drama.,"You wouldn't think a film about a corporate whistleblower could be as exciting as this one, but Michael Mann did a superb job of keeping this viewer on the edge of his seat for two and a half hours.  He doesn't make many films - this one came out four years after his previous one, ""Heat"" (also excellent) - but the director makes the most of his shots.First of all, the acting is superb.  Russell Crowe is as good in his portrayal of the scientist who blows the tobacco industry's dirty little secret as he was playing Maximus in ""Gladiator"" - he was nominated for an Oscar as best leading actor (Mann was nominated for director also).  Neither of them won, nor did anyone else associated with this film, so maybe the tobacco thugs were getting the final word after all.Crowe handles this difficult part extremely well.  Dr. Wigand is a man tortured with inner doubts.  Does he do what he knows is right, expose the tobacco industry for peddling an addictive drug under the guise of an innocent agricultural product, or does he knuckle under to corporate pressure to keep quiet?  Complicating his life is a wife who doesn't want to take risks, who resents their lowered economic status, and who eventually deserts him when he needs all the moral support he can get.  Cameron Crowe reveals all these inner conflicts in a most believable way and makes his character a hero without the usual props.Al Pacino plays the ""60 Minutes"" producer, Lowell Bergman, in his usual fine manner.  He's a bit of a crusader, and the film takes some liberties in the truth to build up his character, but he comes off well without being too overbearing.  Christopher Plummer is also excellent as Mike Wallace.  And the rest of the cast is very good too.  But it's a tribute to Crowe's acting skills that he was able to outshine Pacino in a movie that was made for him.And the best part of this film is that it is, except for some dramatic enhancements, true.  Dr. Wigand's testimony was the start of tearing apart the veneer of invulnerability the tobacco industry had managed to create for itself.  Since that ""60 Minutes"" piece, these huge corporations have been forced to pay out enormous sums to litigants harmed by their products, and that is really a sweet thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Corporate Drama!,"The Insider is one of the better if not the best corporate dramas I have ever seen. It's tense, taut, thrilling, and even has some chilling moments. I never thought a movie that deals with the issue of cigarettes would turn out to be such a fascinating film, but as usual I was wrong. Not only was this film wonderfully acted, it had a steady pace, a well-written script, and wonderful directing by Michael Mann.Michael Mann's film is about a tobacco industry whistleblower named Jeffrey Wigand who got fired from his job and he decides to testify against the company thanks to the efforts of Lowell Bergmann and his 60 Minutes crew and the American legal system. However the careers of Wigand and Bergmann might be on the line if this goes out to the public.Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are two very talented actors that have blessed us with their screen talent over the years. Pacino seems to have gotten better with age and he showcases great acting in the film. Russell Crowe has a memorable performance as Wigand. He does a good job playing the shy, not-wanting-to-talk type of people.Overall, they have found away to make corporate dramas interesting as proved here. This could have easily been a dry, boring movie but the subtle directing by Mann makes this a thriller that will keep your mind and heart racing. However, I want to mention that although this is based off a true story, there are some changes made for dramatical purposes. But still, I don't go to the movies for a history lesson, but for enjoyment. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A great Great Movie,"After watching all of Michael Mann's movies i can say that he has never made a bad film. Although i have to dissagree with the bulk of his fans and say that this film is his best NOT Heat (it was still an awesome movie).I think my opinion of this film is slightly bias as i am a Huge fan of Al Pacino but even if they got an equally great actor for the same roll, it wouldn't cause this masterpiece to falter in any way.On the outset this does not look like an amazingly gripping film. The true story of a tabaco executive turned whistle blower doesn't make it sound as if it'll be ripe with action or suspence (which the average popcorn junkie craves). That said it's not action you go to see in a Michael Mann film. Even with Heat he brilliantly put characterisation first before the relentlessly violent action set pieces and he keeps the theme going here.There is no action to speak of in this film, just the agonising tension that builds from the moment Wigand (Russel Crowe on top form) is fired from his job and it doesn't let up.Pacino is his usual shouty self but that is what makes him so great. His role as 60 minutes producer Lowel Burhman is brilliantly played out as a man who can't take no for an answer. Watch his noticable dispair as he realises that they will NOT broadcast the show.There is nothing bad about this movie. Mann's direction is his best since the brilliant and gripping Manhunter. His use of slow motion is enough to make the Wachowski brothers quiver in their boots. Many of my friends complained about the length (over 2 1/2 hours) but these are the pop corn junkies i spoke of before. I was fortunate enough to catch this film at the cinema where the full glory of the cinematography was amazingly apparent.All in all this is a true masterpiece. Interlectual (which is rare in a film today), gripping, and truely truely fantastic in every sense of the word. This is by far Mann's best work to date and if he churns more gems out like this i will be a fan for many years to come.5/5",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Is it true?,"Russell Crowe plays Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, an intelligent yet difficult and imperfect (i.e. normal!) man who decides to go public although he is extremely publicity shy. For this performance the movie can be highly recommended. It reminded me of some of Rod Steiger's best acting feats. Dr. Jeffrey Wigand is mad, and his anger is somehow related to moral issues. In venting his anger publicly Wigand thinks he can reduce his inner pressure and cherish hopes that he may have a future life in peace with himself and with the world. The presentation of this character was very credible. It enables you to take Dr. Jeffrey Wigand at face value.A possibility to get release materializes for Wigand like a miracle in the form of Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pacino. Bergman is the producer of a TV show - the very instance of truth and honesty. Bergman is zapping through the real world. Today Beyruth, tomorrow the backwoods of Montana (the UNA-bomber, you know!), and in between Kentucky, where Wigand lives. Why is Wigand interesting for Bergman? Well, the guy worked for the tobacco industry and has to tell something! Tobacco related stuff promises the station high ratings. So the moral issue gets married with commerce.Pacino's character is one of those media-man sterotypes that annoy me since The Killing Fields. The mixture of arrogance, moral suprematism, pretentiousness and sham soul baring is really sickening. This feeling is augmentated by the all too smug suburban patchwork breakfast-cereal-commercial-family life as depicted in this movie. What's more, Pacino at all time looks as if he is just dying for a fag.After watching this movie you will know that smoking cigarettes can endanger your health. That's not really news, is it? Moreover, you will gain the impression that the big business tobacco industry is no better than a criminal organisation. Purportedly, the story of The Insider is based on actual facts. And yet I wonder how much of it is true. Putting a ""gag"" into Wigand's mouth seems for the tobacco industry like shooting in one's own foot. And the media's getting at the tobacco industry looks like the shooting of an already badly wounded animal. I know, I could be totally wrong about those issues, but the movie is made in a way that in the end you feel almost sorry for the poor tobacco guys who just want to earn an honest buck.There is in this movie a consistent muddling up of motives, causes and effects for the sake of dramatization and a message which seems to be made for simpletons. In my opinion this is bad when real moral issues are at the core of the whole thing like here.",,Anonymous,Biography

Good/Not Great,"ok ok i am not a big fan of reality-based/news-worthy/current event type movies especially those inspired by or brought to you by headline news especially in my life time.  and i mean movies like ( and not to be compared with) larry flynt, and howard stern---i've grown up with these people/this news and have read and seen televised coverage of these people/this news over and over and over again.  why make a movie about it?  ok--in the case of ""the insider"" i can see getting the underlying message out ( and a powerful message made even more powerful), one that is advertised and discarded with the subtlest ease every time you open a pack of cigarettes. and i can see the exposing of the tobacco companies---this is strong stuff. but this movie was more about the relationship between the 2 main characters, pacino and crowe, and the psychology and ramifications of getting a news story in front of the public, of getting the RIGHT news story---the RIGHT context---the RIGHT message---as seen by the two leads. don't get me wrong---i liked this movie in that regard but i felt the underlying theme of the movie ( david vs goliath/hazards of smoking) was stronger and should have been more center-stage.  the acting was superb---crowe was magnificent, and it was so refreshing to see pacino in a strong, good-guy role instead of a stereo-typed pacino role, and the supporting cast was terrific, cudos to plummer as wallace.  would liked to have seen a stronger female presence from mazar, gershon, or crouse or someone but hey--i can't have everything.  and micheal mann's direction was outstanding---the camera work, choreography, technique was right on cue. the editing towards the end of the movie was a little shakey as far as time lapses go but again, hey .  i do have to mention i loved the soundtrack to this movie so much i actually felt a rush to more emotions than were displayed by the actors, i felt lead from scene to scene moreso than needed. but killer background tracks.  all in all i give this movie a 7/10. watch it if you haven't seen it on the nightly news.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

We'll see how he tackles a complex subject like Ali later this year, but fortunately for us, he has given what may be the best movie of the 90s.I do not know how R.Crowe does it, but somehow he captured the essence of an otherwise normal, scientific everyman put into a pressure cooker and forced to squirm out from underneath it. The scene in the hotel room, when he and Al Pacino first meet: this is such a wonderful scene. Full of subtle clues and clever and affecting writing/direction and acting. Watch how Lowell (Pacino) who knows nothing about Jeffrey (Crowe) and what he has to say measures him and equally impressive is Jeffrey's nervous assertion of Lowell.At one point later in the film, Jeffery remarks he cannot find the parameters to effectively make a decision. Spoken like a true man of science. His crumbling under the weight of his life is entirely palpable as is Lowell steadfast resolve to stick to his guns, despite being under his own legal and professional stress.I could go on and on but I won't except to say that I hope Michael Mann and his team continue to create excellent dramatic stories that require us, the viewer, to use our brains and watch the movie with patience and attention.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
A must-see for many reasons,"Before coming to ""The Insider,"" I had no idea of Michael Mann. After watching it, I have been literally hunting for his movies around and watching them one by one. This is by far one of the BEST movies Hollywood can or will ever produce. The subject is delicate and extremely well handled; movies on whistle blowers are not uncommon, but showing the corporate corruption and the cover-ups that upper echelons of the society engage in needs some mastery over detail and know-how. The real insider for me is Michael Mann. I would be belittling Al Pacio and Crowe if I attempt to say anything about their performances in the movie; words cannot describe it. I watched the movie eight times in a space of three months and bought the DVD to watch it couple more times. It gives me the feeling that this is what any movie should be about--reality, hard core reality exposing the corruption inherent in the systems we trust in. Be it CBS or Brown and Williamson, their corporate honchos must have squirmed in their seats while watching this movie (if they had the ticker to do so, that is). The courtroom scene needs special mention: ""Wipe that smirk off your face""--these six words actually set my heart pounding, making me feel as if he was shouting at me. It was so naturally done that I could almost feel I was there in the courtroom. Just watch it; no one will EVER regret to be an insider to the brilliance of THE INSIDER.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A quiet, horrible ride","As a video selector for a public library, I added this amazing film to the collection. I own it and have watched it at least eight times. I believe part of the reason the film succeeds so admirably is Crowe's portrayal of Wigand. The cast in general is excellent and there are so many small moments that resonate. The music is excellent and contributes to the emotional tone of the film. Plummer is good, Pacino is good, but Crowe is excellent as the quiet moral man who bucks a corporation. For anyone who is looking for a 'true' story and an excellent telling of that story. Hopefully, this film will continue to appear on movie channels so that audiences will have the chance to see it. It bears more than one viewing and it is an exceptional film.",,Anonymous,Biography
"An inside look at 2 moguls, 60 Minutes and the Tobacco Industry","When you put two people like Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, you know you have a good thing.This movie, although a bit on the lengthy side at 2 and a half hours, keeps you pretty much involved the entire way.  Al Pacino plays great journalist looking for the big story, but gets personal when Russell Crowe loses his job as a researcher for a big tobacco firm, and starts to come loose at the edges because of some damaging information he is aware of.The movie provides some very original plot twists, and kept it surprisingly real.  They probably could have cut about 30 mins of footage, but after seeing Mike Wallace freak out...I can understand the length.  I definately recommend, but get comfy.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Powerful Perfornances and a very Interesting Story,","The Insider is a great movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very thrilling film with inspired performances from the entire cast, particularly Russell Crowe and Al Pacino of course, packed with some very intense scenes and superb dialogue. I feel like it was certainly longer than it needed to be, though this is an interesting story, it didn't need to be almost three hours long, it had a complicated story but they easily could have taken stuff out and made it shorter and sweeter for an average moviegoer, instead it added more stuff that didn't really happen. Michael Mann was certainly the perfect choice to direct this, he is fantastic at capturing the darkness of real life events, there were moments were I felt like I was genuinely there with these characters, I felt the seriousness of this true story. Intense and very well acted, I would recommend the Insider to anyone looking for a good drama or thriller.After appearing on an episode of 60 Minutes, a man gets himself in to huge legal trouble as his involvement is revealed.Best Performance: Al Pacino",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Lengths People Will Go to Hide the Truth,"When two legends of the silver screen join forces to act against one another, it's typically something special. The Insider provided just that, a visceral and relentless intense take on the Tobacco industry whistleblower, Jeffrey Wigand. Both Russell Crowe (Wigand) and Al Pacino (Lowell Bergman) do a great job of playing off each others strengths as characters and as actors. And really this film is a brilliantly poignant take on the lengths at which both sides will go (during a whistleblowing incident) to keep the truth hidden or revealed. The only thing I could have used a little bit more of is Wigand's reasoning behind why he should reveal to the world the truth behind this particular Tobacco. I got all the reasons and examples as to why he should keep his family safe (among many other things), but I feel like I didn't get enough from the movie as to why he should risk his life and come clean. Besides of course, the obvious reason being that it's the right thing to do. Other than that, The Insider is an impressive watch, and one that still rings relevant to this day.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The toughest battles are always internal...,"It's interesting that, on several occasions, ""The Insider"" insists on the fact that it was a dramatization and at times fictionalization of real-life events as if the makers decided to adopt the characters' honesty and transparency. It's all to the credit of Eric Roth and Michael Mann who respectively wrote and directed a powerful drama about men caught in professional and ethical dilemmas, but ultimately, making the right choice. Still, this is a long road to these 'right choices', paved with seemingly insurmountable obstacles -the worst being internal- and depicted through a claustrophobic and moody thriller.For the thrills, ""The Insider"" relies on a heavy editing, an abundance of phone calls between angry protagonists, a succession of threats and volte-faces, of confused hesitations and divisive decisions, the overall effect is dizzying and upsetting, there are many reliefs where the characters can question their choices but it's only at the end that we can finally breath. And as inspirational as the message is, we're also glad that this exhaustive journey has finally ended. There's no cheers, no arms raised, no champagne popping, no exchange of smiles, there's a feeling of sheer loneliness that inhabit all the players of this influence-wrestling game between tobacco companies and the fourth estate as if one couldn't lead a collective crusade without condemning himself to an individual exile.It doesn't work for every movie but in the case of ""The Insider"", Michael Mann managed to inject a sense of existentialism in this quest for truth, that's not a matter of opinion that what the tobacco company did was wrong on every level, and even a smoker wouldn't deny it, but how about having the courage to denounce it? That's the whole point of whistle blowing, and the ungrateful burden rests on the shoulders on chemist Dr. Jeffrey Wygand (Russel Crowe), who meets CBS producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) after he's just lost his job. The meeting is purely coincidental but once Bergman understands that Wygand is under a contract of confidentiality, his instinct tells him that something doesn't smell good about the tobacco industry, and it's not just tobacco.Wygand is a man of probity, and never is this certitude shaken to pretend to mislead us, even when the adverse parties try to sabotage his image. What the film shows though is that he's a man of responsibility. If he speaks, he loses all his severance benefits and will be sued, not to mention the psychological effect of death threats and the growing discouragement of his wife (Renee Olstead). The marital element is crucial because there's no attempt of understanding what her husband is going through, all she sees is that they will lose the house, the ones where their daughters made their first steps, their privileges, their comfort, everything they built. From the moment, Wygand embarks in this battle, it's like an earthquake menacing the foundations of their marriage, and it's a matter of time before the inevitable. The tragedy is also on a private level.And Russell Crowe plays Wygand in such a way that we can relate to him, a man who's caught in a worse fight than one on the battlefield because it's permanent and affects his life on a daily basis. Take the trigger of his decision to accept the interview with CBS, only when he's threatened in a patronizing way by his former bosses, he accepts CBS' deal. His ego is tickled, he makes the right choice for the wrong reasons, but it's still right in the sense that it will then throw the 'hot potato' to the journalist and confront them to their own ethical hypocrisy, when CBS is confronted to the legal intricacies that would force them to pay one hell of a bill if they ever interfere between a company and a worker. There comes a point where everyone must make a choice and pay the price.Mike Wallace, one of the most enduring and respected correspondents of the CBS ""60 Minutes"" program, played by Christopher Plummer, uses all available means and his power to get the interview done, he's a man who interviewed tyrants and politicians, but he can taste the sour irony when the ""seven dwarfs"" of the third major tobacco company are preventing him from doing his job and forcing him to surrender to the cause of money. While he does play in the same team than Bergman, he's powerless when the real threat comes from ""inside"", quite fitting, given the film's title. Publishing the interview might ruin the channel's deal with Westinghouse, which represents a great opportunity of financial expansion. And now, the journalists are entrapped in the same dilemma. Bergman couldn't understand Wygand, until the end.The merit of ""The Insider"" is to highlight the truth that there's not one courageous step that doesn't have a price.And while the film is driven by the whole chronicles of fact and investigation procedures, it really gets into an unexpected level of poignancy when the main players are confronted to their failures, ignoring that they are temporary. When Wygand learns that the airing is canceled, his reaction is pleasantly surprising, by that time, he's divorced and he's alone, but what he deplores is that his daughters will never know why their lives had taken such a dramatic change, to realize that it was worth it. And Wallace has a powerful exchange with Bergman, aware that infamy lasts longer than glory, and that this failure might ruin his legacy, because what he did was betraying the legacy of Edward Murrow, and since I recently saw ""Good Night, and Good Luck"", I could appreciate the comparison.Truth ultimately triumphed and yes, it was all worth it, but it was an omelet that broke many eggs, and many spirits, but it's a triumph nonetheless and Wygand, Bergman and Wallaces' legacies wouldn't suffer from it otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie like ""The Insider"".",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Warning:  Movie May Cause Boredom,"Whether the defendant is a squealer or a whistle blower depends on which side of the social border the judge sits on. If the informant betrays secrets about an organization we support, then he's a squealer or a spy. If we hate the organization, then he's a civic-minded whistle blower. It's kind of like being a ""terrorist"" or a ""freedom fighter.""In this case, there's no doubt that Jeffrey Wigand was a flawed but full-blown whistler. He tattled on ""Big Tobacco,"" as it's consistently called, a conspiratorial corporate entity everyone hates. What did he have to gain? Not much. He admits to having a bad temper and feels he was fired ""for no good reason,"" but for most of us that would be a weak motive for risking your bountiful severance package and your family. (Of course, who knows what's in a man's heart?)There are death threats that show up on his PC and a bullet appears in his mailbox, or so we are told. People may be ""surveilling"" him at places like a golf driving range. If so, the surveillers are pretty obvious about it. Writers, and viewers as well, need to be careful with this kind of material. After he was sent to jail, G. Gordon Liddy, a paranoid if there ever was one, describes in his book, ""Will,"" how he made killer enemies in prison and concluded that on a given night they were going to make an attempt on his life. He chose bravely to sleep out in the open with a blunt object for defense nearby. Nobody showed up that night. He believes his audacity frightened the killers off, whereas most reasonable readers would suspect that his enemies, like Son of Sam's social life, were all in his head. At any rate, as it turns out, Wigand loses just about everything dear to him.Another brave whistle blower is Lowell Bergman the CBS producer who brings the whole tawdry story to light by blowing the whistle on CBS to the New York Times. He quits his job. (The movie makes it appear that he quits immediately after his victory, whereas in fact he didn't quit until two years later.) The movie is based on Bergman's version of events.The question is: aside from making us feel good because, by means of all this sacrifice Big Tobacco gets it in the chin, what other purpose is served? What startling exposition is there in Wigand's suppressed interview? Certainly not that cigarettes are bad for you. The Surgeon General's report demonstrated that in 1964. And even that report was a redundancy since just about everyone, from scientists to morons, knew that cigarettes make you ill. The first use of the term ""coffin nail"" or ""nail in your coffin"" used in reference to cigarettes appeared in 1888, when cigarettes were just beginning to be used in addition to cigars and pipes.Here's a headline from the Chicago Daily Tribune, 15 July 1897, ""Unconscious From Cigaret Smoke: George Decker of Jersey City Succumbs to an Excessive Use of 'Coffin Tacks.'"" (That's from Dictionary of American Regional English.) In Chinese, the character representing ""tobacco"" is the same as that for ""opium,"" a stylized picture of a man imprisoned by four walls.There is an interesting datum on how ammonia compounds are added to tobacco to facilitate the impact of nicotine -- but that's the whole point of smoking. No one ever claimed that cigarettes TASTED good. Enhancing the impact of nicotine is an example of good old American know-how.At least from what we can see, the two main contributions of the controversial interview are (1) that the CEOs lied when they testified that they did not believe tobacco was an addictive drug, and (2) sound bites -- ""Cigarettes are nothing more than a delivery system for a drug."" (We hear that last bite quoted 3 times.)Well, Big Tobacco (and little tobacco for that matter, if that term can be applied to users) had already been demonized. The whole affair, in all its complexity, seems to have cemented even more firmly in place those prejudices most viewers will already hold. The film was careful not to indict smokers because, after all, these addicts go to the movies. The film poses as an expose, when in fact it has about the same sensational value as the revelation that Benedict Arnold sold West Point to the British.And who wound up paying for all this? Big Tobacco came under a great deal of expensive litigation, and remains there today. Penalties were levied on the corporations. The corporations passed these additional costs on to the users by tripling and quadrupling the cost of cigarettes. Most of the people who are addicted to cigarettes (we're not talking about the conspicuous consumption of expensive cigars) are working and lower class. The result is a regressive tax, in which the chief burden falls on those least able to pay. Forty years ago, a carton of Camels could be had for 90 cents. Today, in New York, you pay between five and six dollars a pack. That's an increase of roughly 6,111 percent. (I think. If that figure's wrong, it's my calculator's fault.)One might think that, having finally brought the addictive properties of nicotine out into the open, the public and its representatives would feel some sympathy, or even pity, for its victims, but no such sentiment has surfaced. The hatred we feel towards smokers seems boundless and almost gleeful. Here's a poster on the door of a professor of social science in an Eastern university: ""Cancer Cures Smoking,"" in huge blood-red letters. The last time there was such widespread and righteous wrath must have been during the anti-communist fervor of the early 1950s.In return we have the warm self-satisfied glow that comes from knowing that we rooted for the right side in this really rather simple-minded and exploitative movie.",2.0,Anonymous,Biography
Michael Mann's Best,"I enjoy pretty much everything Michael Mann does, but this one tops them all. I've heard some people say there are a lot of slow spots in this movie, but I have to disagree on that one. This film will literally keep you on the edge of your seat. I love how Mann plays out the scenes to give you the feeling he's looking for. It's Pacino's best performance since Scent of a Woman, and Russell Crowe is terrific. Christopher Plummer (from 'A Beautiful Mind') was the perfect man to play Mike Wallace. This is a story about truth, integrity, and the politics of the business world. The ending almost makes you cry. It's a fight for truth. A masterfully told story, excellent camera work, one of the best scripts in a long time, and Lisa Gerrard's score is perfect (remember her from 'Gladiator'?). You can see Michael Mann pays attention to even the smallest details to set the right mood. I can't think of anything I would change in this film - it should have won best picture. This would easily make my top five, and is a must see.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

One of the few movies which makes it matter and makes it count.,"I finally saw the movie last night in one stretch. Have always missed the beginning or the end or the middle when it comes on TV. And I was engrossed and as drawn in this time round, even though I knew what was going to happen.Without giving too much about the plot, Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe), decides to blow the whistle on his employees, a big tobacco company. And he chooses to do so on America's premiere Television News show, 60 Minutes, which is produced by Lowell Bergmann.The script by Eli Roth and Michael Mann is tight and has some intelligent writing. This was possibly Mann's triumph in using hand held camera work, which has in the last few years adapted by people like Winterbottom, Greengrass and Liman.But the film's aces are the actors...and all of them. Led by the paranoid and even guilt ridden Russell Crow who must make the choice between family and his conscience. Crowe's body language, his nervous twitches steal the show the much seasoned Al Pacino, who delivers a usual strong performance. Christopher Plummer too has some great moments of acting.Overall a great film. A must watch for all, especially in today's climate, where news is not we are made to believe it is, and as Al Pacino says, 'Heros are scarce!'",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Rich Michael Mann film but not his best,"I consider Mann to be the second most important living director in the US. I became his fan after I watched Violent Streets (released in the US as ""Thief"") way back in the Eighties at the Indian International Film Festival in New Delhi. I had then written in the newspaper I was then working for that this director is somebody to watch out for. I am glad that some 20 years later I have been proven right. I consider him next in importance only to Terrence Mallick among living US directors.It is a shame that those associated with American Academy of Motion Pictures constantly bypass great talent on so many occasions. Overlooking the performances in the Insider and bestowing so many awards for 'American Beauty"" is crass injustice. ""The Insider"" is superior to ""American Beauty"" in several respects, acting, direction, music, photography At some stage in the Oscar history, this august body will realize that just as Orson Welles was ignored for his early work, great contributors to American cinema who are being ignored are Mann and Mallick. Both of them are consummate filmmakers: who take great care with story, screenplay, acting, editing, photography, sound and music. Mann, unlike Mallick, approaches less philosophical subjects and is therefore appreciated by a larger slice of the public.Why do I find Insider not to be his best work? The Insider's power is essentially in the content. That it is the work of Michael Mann and cinematographer Spinotti only adds flavor to the product. Mann is a director who could make James Caan, an average actor, appear impressive in 'Violent Streets'. If he could do that it is not surprising to find superb performances from Crowe and Pacino in 'The Insider'. Compare this with 'Heat', whose story needed the superb treatment of Mann and Spinotti to come alive. In 'The Insider,' the focus is understandably on the male duo and due to the documentary nature of the subject the women are pushed into the background. In 'Heat', while the male duo carry the film, the female characters are not wallflowers-all three wives/lovers grab your attention. Mann had a 'compleat' film in 'Heat'. That does not mean 'The Insider' was not a great work-it had limitations to develop due to the subject.Another great trademark of Mann is his opening sequences full of kinetic energy injected through sight and sound. However, the opening shots of 'The Insider' reminded you of a Costa Gavras/Gillo Pontecorvo type of Sixties cinema, much less impressive than the powerful opening sequences of 'Violent Streets' and 'The Last of the Mohicans.' Mann, Mallick, and Kubrick are directors who use sound and music with great felicity. In 'The Insider' the scene of Wygand refusing to be disturbed in the hotel room is an example of this talent in Mann, with beautiful music, camerawork and special effects.Has Mann matured over the years? Definitely. Mann directing 'The Insider' is more reflective and offers the viewer options to evaluate Wygand and other characters, which 'Heat' did not. You begin to like Wygand as he makes the big decision as he stares out at the waterscape. You begin to doubt, as he cannot defend aspect s of his past. You begin to wonder if Wygand is using circumstances to be hero or if he is a true hero as he hits the golf balls in apparent solitude. In 'Heat' there was no such ambiguity. His work is much better in 'The Insider' than in 'Violent Streets'. Yet 'Heat' is in my opinion a more demanding and creative work compared to 'The Insider'.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Another Mann classic,"Mark Kermode in his March 2000 Sight and Sound review said: The Insider ought to walk off with a basket of Oscars in March.' He goes on to say, of course, that it won't (and it didn't) and that Michael Mann and his movie should be proud to be outsiders.'The fact is that the reason The Insider did not gain a single Oscar was because it was too risky. It treated a subject (whether or not the tobacco industry was involved in chemically treating its cigarettes to enhance their addictive properties) which was in its way as political as the equally neglected, and equally brilliant, Bulworth last year. It used as its basis a current affairs article and named names. Result: few people in Ipswich, or elsewhere outside London, can have had a chance to see this film, which was rapidly eclipsed on its release by the admittedly arresting American Beauty and the trivial efficiency of The Talented Mr Ripley.A word about Michael Mann. Famous, some would prefer infamous, as the creator of Miami Vice, his feature film work has lent towards more challenging themes while retaining the surface sheen of that cops and robbers series. Manhunter (1988) anticipated The Silence of the Lambs in being a film about serial killers with Hannibal Lector as touchstone, but had a cop who was as screwed up as his quarry. The Last of the Mohicans (1992) brought visceral excitement to the costume adventure and Heat (1995, also with Pacino) returned to the hunter/hunted identification of Manhunter while returning the urban thriller to the chic of Bullitt after years of French Connection grittiness. All his films demonstrate Mann's qualities as a stickler for detail, a director ready to take a chance with a shot, holding it for longer than most would dare, and someone who likes to get inside the psyche of the macho male (pardon the tautology). The classic Mann shot has one of his characters silhouetted against a landscape, set below an evening sky in contemplation of his destiny, all with sensuous electronic music over the top. He is the thinking man's action movie director.The Insider is in a way a change of direction: this is not an action film but an investigation, in the manner of All the President's Men or JFK . The setting is TV and the programme Sixty Minutes. Bergman (Pacino), the show's producer, receives anonymous documents casting dubious light on the tobacco industry and approaches Wigand (Crowe), a recently fired research and development employee for Brown and Williamson. And so it goes, the familiar twists and turns followed with precision and without condescension to melodrama or hyperbole. B&W sweat and threaten, CBS loses its cool, individual integrity is on the line. We've been here before, as so often in the movies, but rarely with such conviction and professionalism.Pacino continues his recent spate of plum roles with a super performance as the man at the controls, a part he has made his own since The Godfather Part Two. Russell Crowe, in a part quite different to that in this Summer's Gladiator, is a stocky, greying, reluctant hero, and more than fulfills the promise of LA Confidential. The supporting cast, from Plummer's unctuous presenter to Gershon's acid corporate lawyer, all pull their weight, no doubt glad to be speaking a literate script for a director with a vision.",,Anonymous,Biography

Way too overrated,"American moviemaking is so deceptive these days.  Get A-list actors, directors, and some decent, serious plot for a film, and you'll get those academy award nominations rolling in.  But great actors don't make a great film.  Story is always, and has always been, number one.I thought this film gives us a slick pacing in its storyline, which is good. But it is emotionally flat throughout the picture.  The biggest problem is the theme itself.  I don't know about the others who thinks this film is a roller-coaster thriller, but almost everyone now knows that smoking is bad for the health.  I felt like I already knew half of the story before I actually walk in to the theatre.I am biased when I saw this movie, I admit.  My bias is that I kept thinking about we all already know of the movie's premise ... about the scumbucket tobacco industry.  We all know about the effect of tobacco on our lungs. Still, I was hoping that the film would provide some plot-twists out of an ordinary story.  But noooo .... it has to be about a depressed scientist who spends his time just trying to get away from the bad guys, just because he is going to tell the world that tobacco kills. That's all there is to it. True story?  Yawn.  Al Pacino also looks like he needs to drink some coffee and freshen up - he looked so tired and uninteresting here.  Heck, I never thought I would get tired of seeing Al Pacino, but for the first time I did.This movie, being a true story, showed a lot of promise, but unfortunately ended up being just too straight and simple for my tastes.  What is scary in real life doesn't mean that it's scary onscreen (and vice versa).  I blame it on the director.

"Great acting great story, great movie","The Insider is without a doubt a masterpiece.  Two of the absolute finest actors of our time, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, are both at the peak of their game in this incredible movie. I was especially impressed by Russell Crowe who I think is even better in this movie than he was in Gladiator. The acting really brings this movie to the even greater heights, but I think it really needed supreme acting since it's so important that the characters in the movie are well portrayed because the movie is very realistic, and the way the people respond to the things that happen to them in the story is very realistic.The story of the movie is also done very well and even though the movie surpasses 2 hrs and 30 minutes it never even gets close to get tiring or boring because of the extremely entertaining story which is consistently being delivered at a very constant high pace, so there is never a dull moment.  It's a movie that stirs up great anger towards the tobacco company, and it's the type of movie who leaves me as a non-smoker asking myself: Don't already people know it's no good for yourself to smoke, so then why is it so special when new information about the tobacco-companies is released? That's a question I don't know the answer for.I think the movie is entertaining because of the acting and because of the way Russell Crowe's character is being chased by tobacco companies and, the sad part is that those kind of things do actually happen, you sometimes hear about smoking documentaries not being able to air because of anonymous threats.  This movie is a great way of showing how criminal the tobacco companies actually are.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
big tobacco,"A long but good enough to keep one watching movie detailing a surprising true story about ""Big"" tobacco and their responsibility for the deaths of hundreds of thousands of smokers. Equally interesting is the CBS ""60 Minutes"" episode where they lost their nerve and pulled an interview they had taped rather than face a lawsuit. It's a classic battle between their legal office and the news people, reminding one of the later film ""Good Night and Good Luck"" about Edward R. Murrow, whose spirit and legacy aren't easy to live up to. Tying it together is the nice characterizations and sharp writing, making this movie, if not a thriller, than very close to it. Russel Crowe and Al Pacino are at the forefront, but Christopher Plummer is right up there, playing CBS' Mike Wallace. The movie ingeniously ties together the tobacco story, a very good drama about the power of corporate giants. You keep waiting for the violence to start, but it stays concealed under a tight, well coordinated effort to destroy the whistle-blower, the character assassination that's more effective and damaging than the use of physical violence. The deposition scene in a Mississippi office is one of the best dramatized legal showdowns in a long time. Mississippi, like so many other states, was faced with the costs of caring for all those sick smokers and was at the forefront of going after the big companies to seek reimbursement. How a movie can make a technical legal battle so interesting is a tribute to director Michael Mann and this, perhaps his best film so far. He balances the complexity of the movie, using the talent to create a forceful and constantly interesting film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Don't trust the news,"Aside from all the other previously mentioned great things about this movie, what I take from it is how corrupt our news media is. They do these bits on how awful corporatons like big tobacco are, which they are, don't get me wrong, but they do the same things themselves. They will sell out the public's safety to save their own asses. CBS would pull a story on health issues if it would hurt the companies that own them.

Excuse me while I put out my cigarette,"Interesting quasi docu-drama investigation, well played out by the principal actors; not without the usual doses of tremendism, this film narrates how a sacked cigarette-company worker and a CBS newsreporter manage to bring the big tobacco companies to justice. Lots of tense moments and the usual clashes among all those participating, as to be expected in any kind of US-type drama film. The Pacino/Crowe/Plummer trio is pretty fine, and the rest of the cast carry out their duties adequately.However, mostly due to the complex nature of the film's subject matter a lot of the would-be impact message gets lost on the way: tobacco kills; cigarettes can cause all kinds of cancer  but this is mostly due to all kinds of chemicals added to the nicotine by the cigarette manufacturers. The original cigarette, as found among South American Indians and brought back to Europe were as harmless as hashish, precisely because in both cases the product was purely natural.An interesting film quite intelligently put together. Unfortunately I began smoking when there were no warnings like `cigarettes are harmful to your health' nor any other kind of anti-tobacco social feeling. Excuse me while I put out my cigarette.Now, where was I? Oh, yes: I've just been a couple of months in the dear old U.K. for the first time in 22 years. What a surprise! I could not smoke almost anywhere without asking permission first! The same, even harder, was in Australia two years ago  even in cafés I had to ask permission to smoke. I muchly fear that over 40 years inhaling those death.. I mean delightful fumes, it is too much for me to give up this filthy habit.If only for this reason, `The Insider' is worth a viewing. The good news for shareholders is that US-brand cigarettes are on the increase in Africa, Asia, South America .. but we need not worry about all those people, do we?",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
Good Acting. Solid Film,"This is just a well acted film that has a solid, no bull-s--- way of storytelling to it.The only thing lacking in it is any explosive scenes. The most explosive scene to me was when Crowe is called into the office and they threaten and blackmail him, but besides that there are not many memorable, strong scenes.However, that's okay if that's the kind of story it is. Instead, it is driven more by dialogue, acting, and ""based on true events"" story, that had major ramifications.Crowe was outstanding, and really pulls off some incredibly good subtle acting- it's a quietly brilliant performance. Pacino was very good, as usual.There needs to be more movies made like this. It's just solid and ""GOOD"". From Michael Mann, what do you expect?",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great acting, great film","I was supposed to see ""The Insider"" at the cinema six months or so ago. Of course, the day before I was to see it they took it down in my town. Just my luck. Luckily, I got a second chance now when it is out on video. Michael Mann's  ""Heat"" is a great action film, this film is certainly nothing like it. Well, apart from the great' thing, because ""The Insider"" is a great film. Of course, like most films it should have been made shorter, 2.5 hours is just too long.

"Garbage, A True Waste Of Film","I am an avid movie watcher, and generally a movie lover.  But in this case I am going the other way.

Journalism drama has a universal reach in Mann's hands,"Not since 1976's ""All the President's Men"" has a film shown how vital, dangerous and deeply conflicted the field of journalism is, and ""The Insider"" goes there and beyond. It's not just about professional and legal conflicts, but also issues of trust and dignity that have deep personal repercussions. Michael Mann (""Heat"") delivers yet another film that goes beyond its subject (journalism), beyond merely a plot with intriguing conflict and into a realm with ethical considerations for everyone.""The Insider"" delves into issues of confidentiality and where journalism's first allegiance is by telling the story of how former ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman (Pacino) convinced a top researcher for a Big Tobacco company, Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), to come on camera with information implicating the industry for knowingly enhancing the addictiveness of the nicotine in its products.But Mann isn't as interested in the logistics of the legal processes and whatnot as he is the personal implications for Wigand, Bergman and CBS. Issues of trust and moral responsibility abound. Wigand and Bergman develop a relationship both with the most honorable intentions in our eyes -- Bergman wants the truth and Wigand wants to risk his financial well-being to enlighten the public, but Wigand's paranoia and the responses by Big Tobacco lawyers create a shaky dynamic between the two.The cast is loaded with incredible talent (Christopher Plummer, Philip Baker Hall, Rip Torn, etc.) but Pacino and Crowe are the most necessary to mention. Pacino brings his same machismo: he sounds as if he knows exactly what he's talking about -- his reactions when his character comes under fire are calculated and not overplayed, even when he does his signature shouting. As for Crowe, his character's emotional issues are apparent and his execution of this is vital at taking us beyond the issue at hand and having great sympathy for his conundrum: to tell the truth he risks his family and his livelihood. His performance, in addition with that in ""L.A. Confidential"" is all the proof necessary that this guy can act.Mann and ""Forrest Gump"" writer Eric Roth deliver a script that while certainly busy with many characters that are hard to discern at times, perfectly gets across exactly what needs to be said as succinctly as possible to both move plot and provoke thought. It's very easy to stay with this film despite needing to move quickly to fit everything into 155 minutes.Especially journalists, but everyone who has daily ethical concerns with their job, can also appreciate the fairness with which the film handles both sides of the debate. Basically, CBS makes a critical decision on whether to air the interview and both sides make convincing arguments. The best part is that what's unquestionably, morally right wins out in this film despite it's very psychologically damaging consequences on its main characters. As Mann points out, where the truth is concerned, it's not all about who wins, but it's the principle on which you got there.""The Insider"" is thought-provoking and insightful, a true example of how one specialized area like investigative journalism and confidentiality law suits can become universally understood through great dramatic writing and the write talent executing it.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
How poison is protected,"Nowadays nobody doubts that tobacco is harmful to health, but  still one finds plenty of brands of cigarettes available in the market, and many people smoking and not caring about the consequences of such a dangerous practice. The causes of such a behavior are many and this film touches one of them, proving how the companies manufacturing cigarettes try to protect their market of tobacco denying any scientific fact about the problems caused to human health. In addition, the film shows the common interests of some companies like Westinghouse, and the way CBS tried to hide a good evidence of the whole problem of tobacco market and consumption. One must acknowledge and appreciate the initiative and work of the director Michael Mann for conducting such an extraordinary film, and also good acting of Al Pacino, Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
entertainment and substance,"I think you can judge this film on different levels. As entertainment we get an involving story attractively visualized. The characters are interesting and well portrayed. The climactic stroy build-up makes it a satisfying viewing experience. Enhancing this entertainment value is the substance of the movie consisting of the fact that it's based on reality and the fact that it makes you think about the capitalistic society and your life in it. The enhancement is mutual because the involvement caused by the high entertainment value of the movie lets you be maximally immersed in the awareness of the power of money : choices in your life, neglect of public welfare, objectivity of journalists etc. Personally I suspect anyone disliking this movie through this medium of being connected with the tobacco industry. But then I just saw the movie :-)",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Al Pacino, Russell Crowe at their best","Another great movie by my favorite director Michael Mann.THE INSIDER was a superb film.  Even though it was 157 minutes, it still kept my interest throughout.  I just have to say that Al Pacino and Russell Crowe were excellent and it most certaintly deserved the seven Academy Award nominations it was given.Pacino stars as Lowell Bergman, producer of CBS's 60 minutes, who in order to finish a story on the use of tobacco and its effect on the public, must be provided information by an ""inside"" source.  That source is a former tobacco executive, Doctor Jeffrey Wigand(Crowe).  Wigand was fired by a large tobacco company and agrees to help Bergman in that the company is using unethical stimulants to make their cigarettes.  Dante Spinotti is Mann's director of photography in just about all his movies and he is great. The cinematography of this film was outstanding.  I especially liked how they zoomed in on the characters faces when something dramatic in the story occured.  You could really see the effect of what was happening on the characters' faces.  Once again, Michael Mann used colored lighting, just as he did in the film HEAT and some parts in MANHUNTER.  Its usually a dark blue.Pacino and Crowe were just simply magnificent in their roles and this is a movie that I would watch again and again.  Definetly an A for a grade. Highly recommended.",,Anonymous,Biography

A shoot out where the same number of bullets that halved the cast of Saving Private Ryan on reel one failed to take out de Cino (or was it Paniro).  Was there anything else?  Sorry.

A perfect movie. And I don't throw that term around lightly.,"There are some films that are so perfectly made in every way possible that I sit there thinking 'Every persons effort and every element of creative energy that went into making this movie has been implemented flawlessly, arriving here and now to give me the viewing experience I'm getting. A perfect movie'. Michael Mann's The Insider is such a movie. I held off on reviewing it for a couple days after seeing it, partly to let it sink in but mostly to see if I'd feel any different about it once my synapses had cooled down and the frames had dimmed from my consciousness. Perhaps the fiery reaction it drew from me in the moment was cheaply earned, or I was just in the right mood to love it at that time. Not a chance. If anything I've become more enraptured by it as time has passed, already aching for a second viewing. Every performance and aspect of is just so rich, deep and rewarding that for its two and a half hour runtime I found myself externally distracted not once. Occasionally Mann deviates from his comfort zone in the nocturnal crime zone. The occult themed period piece, the colonial adventure, the psychological horror, and this, the blistering drama based on a true story. One might not think the subject matter deserves a two and a half hour film, let alone would make a great one, but Mann has the cinematic Midas touch, and never half asses it. His work always contains traces of a true master at work, telling little details that engrave the film with a sense of immaculate skill and unwavering dedication to telling the story in its finest, and most honest form. The Insider tells the story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a chemist who turns whistleblower on the tobacco corporation he was once employed by, finding shelter under the wing of CBS News's 60 minutes, and particularly hard nosed reporter Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). The network wants his take, in order to do an exposé on Big Tobacco, a plan with predictably disastrous and dangerous results, for both Wigand and CBS. The film shakes off any impending sensationalism or deliberately emotional stylistic cheats, instead keeping a microscope focus on the three lead performances and letting all the hurt, determination and emotion come forth naturally through their work, as opposed to smothering their story with an overbearing score and cheap cinematic manipulation. I've never been that won over by Russell Crowe until now. He always seems 'halfway there' in his work, like he's missing something. This changed things for me. He's like a raw nerve here, a family man pushed to the precipice of an impossible decision. One can almost see him wrestling with his conscience behind those haunted eyes, a storm with a lid barely kept on and anchored by Crowe in his finest hour. Pacino holds us captive with his work until we realize we're not breathing. He's the moral compass of the piece, and to see him explode at the injustices served up to him will give you goosebumps. The third leg of the table is Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, the 60 minutes anchor who also struggles morally with the situation they are in. Plummer is so good you forget you're watching a film, giving Wallace buried gentleness and chiselled emotional intensity that you can scarce believe is even possible through acting. The supporting cast is peppered with bushels of talent. Colm Feore, Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Stephen Tobolowsky, Diane Venora, Nester Serrano, Rip Torn, Michael Gambon and an unusually sedated Debi Mazar are superb. It's Bruce McGill, however, who almost steals the film in one blistering scene, playing a lawyer with enough righteous anger to shatter your TV screen. A career best for him. No one puts you into a story by forcing you to feel alongside the characters quite like Mann. Here he guides through the trials that Crowe, Plummer and Pacino face with steady hand and heart until we are invested. Then he pulls the ripcord and let's the sparks fly, making monumentally intense work of events that could seem pedestrian in lesser hands. We really feel for Crowe and clutch the seat with the same desperate intensity that he clings to his family, and sanity. We feel the same jilted fury alongside Pacino as he wades through sickening bureaucracy for a shot at retribution. We take pause with Plummer as he ponders his legacy and are incredulous with all three at the snowball effect the entire proceeding has had on them, devastating us as an audience the same as them, in turn making us feel closer to them. This is all laced with the incredibly heartfelt music from Lisa Gerrard, who sang alongside Crowe in Gladiator and was a favourite of Tony Scott as well. Mann is a ceaseless monster of storytelling, tone and pacing. The story has flair simply because he doesn't wantonly throw it in the mix; the feeling and reaction come from story and character and not the razzle dazzle. Mann knows this, and let's the fireworks naturally spring from the absence of deliberation, like music in the vacuum of space. This one will live on to stand the test of time far longer than the decade and a half its help for already. It's a revelation.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Good subject, poor telling","The Insider has an excellent subject to work with, but somehow it all gets a bit lost as Michael Mann tries to impress with his command of the camera. Al Pacino's histrionics in certain scenes are just so, well, 'Al Pacino' that the character he is supposed to be playing gets submersed. The film feels flabby and would have benefited by losing at least half an hour. Russell Crowe however is outstanding as Dr. Wigand. Although playing a man about 20 years older than his real age you would never guess from his performance. Despite my disappointment with the film as a whole I would still advocate at least one viewing, if simply to be reminded of the lengths corporate business will go in the name of profit.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Nothing to lose,"The Insider is what I like to call a ""political thriller"". This is overall a great movie about the topic with perfect characters, good direction, and an entertaining screenplay.Jeff Wingand (Russell Crowe) plays a paranoid research scientist who has just lost his job at a major tobacco company. Jeff soon loses his wife's trust in him and is on the verge of losing his family if he can't pay the bills and give his family dental care and health care which they need. Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) is a news reporter from the show 60 Minutes who travels all around the world to get stories from some of the most dangerous people, he is willing to do absolutely anything to get the complete story. When Lowell calls Jeff up and asks him if he can go over a simple report on flame resistances that involve cigarette burns, Lowell gets more than he bargained for. Jeff secretly hints that he knows a lot about the tobacco companies, so much he could bring them down himself if he had a chance in court. Lowell wants Jeff's full story at any costs because it would be the story of the year. Jeff has signed a waver though with his former company that he can not release any research information to the public or else they can financially hurt him or physically hurt him by any means nesscarry.The Insider starts out with a sample of Lowell's work as he travels to an Arabic country to get a report from an alleged terrorist leader, this is obviously very interesting to today's crowd. Russell Crowe plays his part perfectly as the paranoid scientist in that the way he talks, acts, and moves. Russell's character is always worried that his former tobacco company is going to hurt him and his family, and every instance he gets a hint of it he acts immediately in strange ways which are very interesting to watch. Al Pacino masters his role, just as he does for all his roles, there are no flaws in the acting in this movie. However the movie does exceed the three hour mark and tends to run a little slow near the end, but you'll be dying to see the conclusion because of all the hype about the release of the story during the movie.Michael Mann's movies are always fun to watch and this is no exception, this is his best work since Heat with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino.

This film could easily have been told in one and a half hours rather than the two and a half it clocked in at.  There were so many unnecessary, pointless and unresolved sub-plots, mostly involving other stories at '60 Minutes', that the film sometimes seemed unbearably confusing.  I know they were thrown in to prove to the audience just how hard working and busy a '60 Minutes' producer is, but the end result was that it slowed the pace of the movie interminably and ended up really annoying me.

"A good film, but not a great film","The Insider is certainly worth seeing.  It tells a fascinating story, boasts an impressive cast and is competently directed.  But that is all.Those people who have posted reviews on this site paying tribute to Michael Mann's genius' and claiming to have burst into tears' during the film, are obviously easily impressed (and/or emotionally unstable).  Don't get me wrong.  This is a good film, it's just not a great one.The film's main asset is, obviously, the true story upon which it is based. The lengths to which tobacco companies are prepared to go to suppress information and distort the truth was always going to make captivating viewing.  The question is, did the director capitalise on this and create an exceptional film?   I don't thing he did.Michael Mann's directorial style reminds me of a kid who just got a new tool box for Christmas, but doesn't know how to use any of them.  The film is DRENCHED with dramatic pauses', meaningful slo mo's' and moving classical scores.'  Although such devices are often PRESENT in great films, they don't MAKE a film great.  It just depends on how they're used.  In this case, Michael Mann simply threw them in everywhere in the hope that people would walk out saying `I mean, like, wow!  How good was that bit where the guy took 15 minutes to peel off his coat?  It was just so DEEP!'If anything, the overuse of these devices gave the film a slightly clinical, colourless feel, which detracted from its emotional impact.  I kept sitting there thinking I really SHOULD feel sorry for Jeffrey Wigand, but I just can't seem to empathise with him.'As for individual performances, I thought the stand out was Christopher Plummer.  His portrayal of veteran 60 minutes anchorman, Mike Wallace, was superb.Russell Crowe was solid as Jeffrey Wigand, but didn't live up to the hype. Although the make-up team deserves full credit for ageing him twenty years (and Russell himself did well to stack on 10 or so kilos for the part), the acting itself was only fair.  Those of you who saw his brilliant performance in LA Confidential are bound to be disappointed.Al Pacino did well playing 60 minutes producer Lowell Bergman', but it was a fairly two-dimensional role  tenacious, old school newsman, who plays it by the book and never breaks his word.'  All you really needed for the part was a good voice and a haggard face.  Al Pacino has these qualities in spades.The only other performance worth mentioning was Diane Venora's portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand's wife.  I thought she was dreadful.  I have no idea what type of accent she was trying to pull off, but whatever it was, she failed.In summary, The Insider is a very solid film.

I do have to say one thing though, I have read other comments about this movie, and Pacino barely receives recognition for his performance. The focus is mostly on Russel Crowe. Now don't get me wrong, Crowe did do a fine job portraying Dr. Jeffery Wigand, but Pacino was amazing as Lowell Bergman, the producer of CBS's 60 minuets.

If you want to make a movie with a political point, people are gonna have to want to watch it. If they stop it half way through then you've failed. I've never walked out of a movie and i rarely turn one off before its done, but this was so BORING and without any form of emotion other than anger. All we really see is Al Pacino (in a role he's played a million times before) and Russel Crowe, who looks like a small water animal who cant fight for himself, banter at each other for some kind of betrayl.

One of the most overrated movies of 1999,"Am I the only one seeing that this movie is totally overrated? The beginning of the (already too long) movie, meaning the first hour is just utterly boring and uninteresting. The movies starts somewhere in Northern Israel of the South of Lebanon (I am not quite sure) and when I went seeing it I had no idea what it was about. So I thought it was about the PLO or the Palestinian-Israeli issue but the first part of the movie was completely unnecessary. Okay one might state that it was meant to show what the profession of Bergmann is about and like but that could have been accomplished in other ways than sending an expensive crew to such a country.And the first hour there's nothing happening. The meant-to-be-artistic slow motion shots are annoying and not functional at all. Main character Wigand is played by a good actor, but the story is a complete flunk. It can by summarized as 'guy shouldn't talk, guy does, guy is sadly left by wife and children'. I can hardly keep my eyes dry.. what drama!And I was even more surprised to see that Pacino is the center of the second part of the movie. The screenplay doesn't divide its attention evenly at all. All of a sudden the movie changes color by putting all attention to Pacino and his problems to get the bloody interview aired.Christopher Plummer is good though.. but there are to many gaps in the screenplay to let him save the movie...And it could have been such a good movie... too bad...Mann was trying to combine personal drama (Wigand), professional drama (Bergmann) and a cheap John Grisham court-drama.It's too long to keep the viewer's attention... hello people? where is the so-called haunting suspence?6 out of 10 points.",,Anonymous,Biography
"""Russell Crowe's best performance""","What does an actor need to do to impress an audience, an actor needs to make you cry, make you angry, and especially scared. Russell Crowe(Gladiator) has done all of those things in ""The Insider."" In ""A Beautiful Mind"", he shows the obvious sadness, he cries, weeps, and screams, but in ""The Insider"" he tries to stay strong while showing his sadness threw the not so obvious ways. Like sitting down in a chair, but good old Michael Mann will show you that he's going mad in some way. Mann shows a scene where he's looking at his children, but his children are not there, he's really looking at a wall.Crowe's Oscar winning performance(Gladiator) is not nearly as good his performance in this film, or even ""A Beautiful Mind"", but he brought back the sandle movie saga, and redefined what a Gladiator really is.  He is one of the greatest actors of our time, he deserves to be compared to the all time greats, like Marlon Brando, and Richard Burton, and he needs to be compared to the elites, Mel Gibson, Tom Cruise, Robert De niro, Al Pacino, and Tom Hanks.This film is incredible, and I give it ****(out of 4 stars).",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Worth watching - hard to fault,"Hey this movie is 5 years old already?? How did I pass it by so many times at the video store until now? Both DeNiro & Crowe do an outstanding job in their portrayal of real-life characters involved in bringing to air one of the most damning-to-the-tobacco-industry press interviews ever.At times a little drawn-out, but even so the long-ish running time (2 1/2hrs) was not uncomfortable. We are kept interested the entire way - this is a story about the ultimate human sacrifice - do you fight for what you believe in even if it means you could lose your job, your house, your family, and possibly even your life? And at what point do you say ""enough is enough, I give up, it's NOT worth it""?While you have to remember that this is a dramatization, you simply can't shake the fact that the majority of events that you see likely *actually happened* more or less as portrayed. A good movie, a great story. 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pacino's character,"Well, I thought Al Pacino did some of his best work here. Noting that Russell Crowe got a nomination (Oscar), I felt that even stronger was the role played by Al. Russell did his best work here and later they thinly veiled an Oscar as a, so to speak, ""make up call""...I mean come on! Oscar for gladiator and not Insider! Reminds me of Rod Steiger missing Oscar for the Pawnbroker (Lee Marvin's Cat Ballou"")and getting the make up for ""In the Heat of the Night"". The comment concerning Al's control within the character is so accurate...noting that he contained his energy until it was important. When he gets the Hotel employee to knock on Crowe's door and tell him to pick up his phone and then Al says to tell him to ""just pick up the f...king phone"", Russell crosses the room and picks up the phone and the two have at it....so visceral! Oscars for the two...and outstanding roles for everybody else from the Wallace character to the plaintiff attorney in the courtroom in Miss. One of my all time ten best!!!

Crowe and Pacino are magnificent!,"Whenever someone hears about the big tobacco industries, they think big money and not to be meddled with. But in 1994, one man changed all that. One man stood up to this giants of industry and told them off. In 1999, director Michael Mann retold this story in grade A fashion.The Insider deals with the CBS 60 Minutes special involving the tobacco company Brown & Williams and their former researcher Dr. Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe). 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) will go to great lengths to get this man to talk about his work with the company. What he has to get around is the confidentiality agreement that Wigand signed. Now that he has been fired for a bogus reason, he wants to get back at the company that now threatens his family. Bergman tries to bend the rules and go around every corner to get this man to testify in a court of law so that his testament will not be liable with the confidentiality agreement.With B&W watching every move that Wigand makes and checking everything that has happened to him from birth up to this point in time, Wigand is ready to do anything. Before he even appearers in court, he records an interview with 60 Minutes host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer). This interview may not go on the air at all if certain things aren't made right. What Bergman must do now is protect Wigand and still air this special without causing any trouble because he knows that this will be the biggest case in US history.Crowe and Pacino both give breathtaking performances. Crowe was nominated for his portrayal of Wigand and was well deserved. Wigand is an interesting character. He has to make the right choices without hurting his reputation, his family, and without breaking the deal with his former company. The decisions he makes are both life changing and have an impact on those around him. Pacino as Bergman is the perfect fit. He is an explosive actor and very passionate with his work. His work in this movie is incredible. He combines a soft heart with a hard-nose attitude that gives him a very powerful presence. These two men are great and even Plummer as Wallace gives a great performance. His character is both working for the people so they are informed, and working for CBS, making sure they don't go under with this story. All together, there is a great cast with smaller parts even shinning, especially Bruce McGill as Ron Motley, one of the lawyers working with Wigand.The Insider is a must see. This political thriller is a great watch and showcases two of today's top actors doing what they do best. Director Michael Mann is no stranger when it comes to good movies. His hits like The Last of the Mohicans(1992), Heat (1995), Ali(2001), and most recently Collateral(2004). The Insider is one of his best films to date. The Insider is a great film...and that's the truth.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An overly long ""information"" movie","I kept wanting this movie to end.  It seemed to go on forever.  We saw the movie on Sunday afternoon and when we came home it was time for 60 Minutes. Then I realized how well Christopher Plumber did in imitating Mike Wallace--but it was Russell Crowe that made the movie good.  The theme is better suited for a TV documentary.  The entire time I was watching the movie I was wondering if and how many law suits will be filed over it. Certainly Mike Wallace was not presented in the best of lights.  And the blankety-blanks at Brown & Williamson must be awfully upset over their portrayal!  Even CBS was ""defamed.""  The message is great, the nobility of man is presented well, but the movie is an overload of non-essential events which detract from the message.  There were places where I actually felt bored.  And yet others where I wanted to cry.  However it's just not the kind of movie I generally like to see -- I want to be entertained, not informed. And this was a information movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Nutshell Review: (DVD) The Insider (1999),"Directed by Michael Mann, The Insider belonged to the category of movies with a number of nominations for an Academy Award, but won none. Based on a true story (of course with some dramatic license taken) involving the CBS hit television documentary series 60 Minutes, this is a rare insight into the time when the acclaimed series faltered in its editorial stand.WIth whistle-blowing having the local spotlight in recent months, no thanks to the NKF fiasco, this movie tells the tale of integrity in investigative journalism, and how two men rose to overcome personal challenges, to put out a story with damning evidence against the tobacco industry.Russell Crowe plays Dr Jeffrey Wigand, an R&D vice president at Brown & WIlliamson, recently fired for reasons unknown. As he holds an important role in the company, his severance package requires him, and I suppose like all leadership positions in Fortune 500 companies do, to sign a confidentiality agreement. However, he's holding onto something big that could damage the industry, and with these companies, having their reputations and industry survival put on the line, is never cowering to non-conformists.Herein lies the dilemma about moral obligation - if you're privy to industry information that is sensitive to the company, yet in the public's eye can help save lives, and put things into perspective, would you go public with the information? Wigand was undecided, but hearsay of horror stories, and being compelled to believe that he and his family were being watched, and threatened, he made up his mind that enough was enough, and did what a man would have done, even though it was against his wife's wishes, and didn't the guarantee safety of his family.Besides Wigand, the other protagonist is Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), who is a producer at the famed 60 Minutes. Fighting to get Wigand's story told, he too runs into opposition from all angles, including internal ones at CBS News. To survive, he had to rely on personal wit and contact to establish and swing things around in his favour, even resorting to giving unauthorized scoops into the inside happenings at 60 Minutes when they decided to air an abridged version of the story.The movie raises a number of interesting questions about the wheelings and dealings of the supposedly free press in the USA, and how when you're under media scrutiny, every little dirty detail you have hidden about your past, will be brought up and blown out of proportion. Grim reminder, but true.The acting by the two leads will keep you riveted as you watch the entire proceedings unfold, until Massive Attack's Safe From Harm (just the remixed instrumental) closes the curtain.Code 1 DVD contains the theatrical trailer, a 7min production making-of featurette where you'll see the real Lowell Bergman and Dr Jeffrey Wigand, and a relatively useless Inside A Scene segment where you'll see a partial notes to the actors, script, and the actual scene again, how it played out according to paper.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Unfortunate,"This could have been a really terrific movie.  The acting was amazing and the story was well written.  Unfortunately Michael Mann's direction was awful.  I'm not quite sure what happened, since he did such a good job with ""Heat.""  In ""The Insider"" he constantly uses awkward focusing techniques and hand-held cameras- it's like watching ""The Blair Witch Project"" but worse because you're trying to follow a complex plot, but people's heads keep shifting in and out of focus, and the camera keeps zooming around in blurry close-ups, that I got dizzy every scene.  The movie was too long at almost 3 hours, it could have easily had 30 minutes or so cut. The problem is I really liked this movie.  I was looking forward to it, Mann's awkward direction and often out-of-place music cues detracted a lot from this film- I can only honestly give it ** out of **** stars.  Its a real shame, this could have been an incredible movie.  Pacino, Crowe, and especially Christopher Plummer were fantastic.  Really unfortunate.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A masterpiece of craftsmanship, acting, and storytelling of a true story!","I saw Michael Mann's ""Heat"" some time ago, and loved it.  I was also excited about his next film ""The Insider"".  However, the trailers advertised what looked like an action film, so I passed on it and forgot about it.  However, the Academy Award nominations recently came up, and ""The Insider"" was nominated for Best Picture.  I don't think it or any other film will win against ""American Beauty""(which I have not yet seen, but will), but nonetheless, you can't resist seeing a good quality film.  To my luck, it was re-released and now seems to be making more money than it did when it first premiered.  I saw it, and was absolutely amazed at what a good film it was.First of all, ""The Insider"" is based on a true story, and it stays very true to the actual accounts, with the exceptions of some dramatic additions which were stated at the end of the film.  It was very realistic and the actors didn't look like they were acting, even though they do an excellent job of doing so.  They looked like real people, who talk to each other in a normal manner, unlike the cliched Hollywood dramas with the characters overacting and giving lines that only work in movies.  I also liked how the characters were handled.  Al Pacino as the journalist is laid back, yet determined and true to his word and never intends harm to anyone.  He cares about his subjects, and he wants to help them.  Russell Crowe as the doctor is great, because he's not some gung-ho hero who has a wife that looks like a centerfold on Playboy magazine and sarcastic one-liners.  He is a real, living, breathing family man whose wife cares for him, yet is unable to deal with the problems his ""inside"" knowledge of the drug industry causes.  The movie dances beautifully back and forth from these characters.  Both are equal in importance, and both are given a great amount of care by the director.  Michael Mann makes absolute sure that you know who these people are, and what they are feeling.I also loved the camerawork, because it was never overdone.  People complain that it got out of focus at times, but that only added to the realism and artistic qualities of the film.  As a matter of fact, what makes this film so great is how everything, even the music, was underplayed.  Overdoing something for dramatic effect is silly, but is often done to ""please"" the audience and wake them up.  Here, you can't help but be riveted because it's just so damn real!""The Insider"" tells the story of a man, or an ""insider""(Russell Crowe) who knows secrets about the cigarette and drug industry, but is afraid to talk. He is approached by the journalist(Al Pacino) and is offered to do an interview regarding the subject.  He agrees.  Threats are made to him by the drug industry, and death threats are made to his home.  He blames the journalist, but the journalist says he only wants to help and has nothing to do with the events and threats that are happening.  The ""insider"" goes for broke and does the interview, and then testifies before a court, after he is warned that if all does not go well, he could go to prison.Then the film goes from being a riveting case of what it took to get the truth out of the ""insider"", and turns into a poignant study of how the power and manipulation of the media can take a normal family man, and destroy his life.  The ""insider's"" wife files for divorce and takes the kids away.  CBS is afraid to air the story on 60 minutes because they might be sued and lose money, and their ownership of CBS.  The ""insider"" moves out and lives in an apartment, in seclusion.  There is a brief moment when Michael Mann uses a digital effect to morph his room into the backyard of his home and he sees his two daughters digging in the garden.  The result is one of the most saddening images of the film, in which we see this man, this family man, lose everything he worked so hard for and loved, merely because he told the truth to the media and the court.""The Insider"" is definitely one of the year's very best films, and it's a shame that it didn't receive as much attention as it did when it first premiered.  Like I said, I doubt it will win Best Picture, but that doesn't detract from the overall quality and art of this film.  If you want to see a great film that turns it's back on Hollywood dramas and a fascinating true story, then look no further.  ""The Insider"" is it!",,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies of the past decade.,"""The Insider"" is a prime example of how when talent is mixed the results are memorable, excellent.The Director picked the best choices for the main characters. Russell Crowe delivers an extraordinary performance and starts really strong but then demonstrates his desperation when ""things"" get out of control. Al Pacino is a master and delivers a great performance as always.But the best thing about this movie is the intriguing and solid plot. When you think about the tobacco industry many adjectives come to your mind, but after watching this movie you won't help but associate it with corruption, financial interests by the powerful people who also dominate government, and worst of all, when such powerful people tend to take things to a personal level.""The Insider"" is one of the most clever, intriguing, and written movies of the past 20 years.

The cinematography inn this film is absolutely exceptional with the camera most of the time being hand held right up there in the actors faces. Crowe earned his first Oscar nomination for his role in this film along side Oscar veteran Al Pacino. The key ingredient though in all of this talent being shown is the man behind it all. I am speaking of course about one the best and brightest filmmakers working today, Michael Mann.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Michael Mann makes this slow moving film even worse,"Oliver Stone's film ""U-turn"" was a pretty good film, when it was just that, a film.  When it became director heavy it really lacked.  What I mean by that is the technique of film became more important that than the integrity of the story.  Stone used so many silly and pretenscious shots that it took away from the experience of the movie.  That is the same with Michael Mann's The Insider.The Insider is an interesting film about an interesting topic. I'm not sure if I would invest more than 70 million dollars into it, but it is an interesting topic.  The story and the two great lead actors are the strength of the film.  But what is almost an abomination is the work done by Michael Mann.  Sometimes a film has such strength in it's script that it can survive on that alone.  Think of work by Tarantino or Kevin Smith.  They usually have material that is strong enough that you don't need a lot of camera work or an infinite number of camera movements to capture the essence of a scene. The Insider is directed like a it is made by a guy that is fresh out of film school and wants to use every technique he ever learned and that means using 25 different angles for one scene in a room.  The Insider has more close-ups and over the shoulder two shots that I can recall any movie having in quite some time.  And that became boring and cumbersome after about 15 minutes.  Whatever point was trying to be made had been done in overdrive. Close up of Crowe and his kids= he loves his kids and their life and safefy is at stake.  Close up of Crowe= he is in imminent danger.  Close up of Crowe and his wife= they are in danger and they are on shaky ground.  Close up of Pacino=  I don't know what, it could mean anything, maybe Mann is obsessed with close ups of actors.  But they were not needed in this film. I got tired of them, I didn't need to see every pore on Pacino's face, every wrinkle on Crowes forehead, every hurt expression on Crowe's wifes face magnified twenty times.  Movies have directors so that they have direction but that does not mean that I need or want to know that they are there behind the screen and off to the right of what is happening on screen.  I've always thought that a film works better when the presence of a director is not felt.  When you can look at a screen and feel like you are peering into someone else's conversation, then that is the best kind of film making. Spielberg is a master of it, Tarantino and Smith are as well and even a guy like Robert Zemekis is wonderful at doing that.  But Michael Mann seems as though he is unsure of himself as a director of films that are laden with dialogue so he compensates his ineptitude by using every shot he possibly can.  This is the biggest problem with the film, but it is not the only problem.As interesting as the film is, in subject matter that is, it is really quite boring and slow.  There were many times that I groaned silently and wanted the film to end.  But it just kept going.  And I also felt that as good as Pacino was, he wasn't allowed to act, he was always just waiting in the background to do or say something.  The times when he was allowed to show emotion were the best parts of the film.  There is a scene in the office of 60 Minutes when Pacino is allowed to explode after his character has been told that his story is not going to air.  Here he blows and tells them how foolish they are and how much of a corporate puppet they have become and I will bet good money that when Pacino is nominated for an Oscar, when they show the clip that showcases his talents for the Oscar at the ceremony, it will be this piece that they show.  He really excells for about five minutes in this one scene.  But that's all there is, really.  The rest of the film he just sort of waits in the shadows to do anything memorable.  I don't know how you make a film like this better, with the subject matter and all, but I know one way to do it is to let Pacino loose and another way would be to get a better director.  I mean let's face it, no matter how good your subject matter is, if it is something that you can make into an A&E Special, perhaps it shouldn't be on the big screen for 150 mintues.Overall this is an unsatisfying movie and one that I don't really think redeems itself.  I had seen Dogma the day before this, and as I stood in line, freezing on a blistery Saturday afternoon in Toronto, waiting for the Pokemon kids to get their tickets in front of me for their beloved film, I commented to the cashier that I was probably the only one seeing something else besides Pokemon.  He told me that I was probably right, except Dogma was selling out as well.  I wish I had gone to see that again.  It too was quite long ( about 2 hours in length ) but it was funny and enjoyable along with being interesting.  The Insider and Michael Mann should take lessons from Dogma and Kevin Smith.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
a thinking man's thriller.,"I've recently became a big Michael Mann fan and started watching his filmography. I saw the fantastic 'Manhunter' last week and this week I picked out 'The Insider'.Even though Mann puts a lot of variety in his work, this was still an a-typical film for him. No trademark Michael Mann shootings or chase-scenes but great acting, great dialog, a great script and great music. Based on true events but slightly altered for dramatic reasons, The Insider is a top notch thinking man's thriller. Pacino in one of his best roles of the '90s, Russell Crowe in his best role ever and a supporting cast to match. Christopher Plummer (!),Philip Baker, HallBruce McGill,...the list of fine actors goes on and on.A must see if you like intelligent political thrillers with fine acting.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies on corporate corruption('s) I've seen.,"Yes, the message is very clear. Nicotine IS addicting. But it is the way that the tobacco corporation handles such issues that I also take note of. Russell Crowe was excellent, even in his mannerism's of acting like the Sr. Corp. VP, a powerful position. Al Pacino was excellent as the guiding force behind trying to help Jeffry Wygand get his message to the masses. Even the wife's character was played to a tee. I took it as ""They used to love each other, in some other life"", but the prestige and power involved corrupted them both to a point where they grew apart. The father truly loved his little girls, the mother was more worried about ""what the neighbors will think"" of their sudden misfortune of losing a job, and having to move to a lesser neighborhood. (family values? What family values! It's about how we look, not the love). hehe. Anyway, I really enjoyed the movie. As a compliment to this one ... the BOOK ""Runaway Jury"" would be an excellent look into Big Tobacco's theme. And way of doing business.Michael Mann is a genius. This movie has a way of drawing the viewer right into the minds of each and every main character. In particular, the scene of Jeff in the hotel room, and it panning off to the walls giving way to the picture of his 2 daughters playing, looking at him from a great distance. Despair. Anguish. Anger. And even Defeat. Coupled with the music Michael Mann used, ... I was on the edge of my seat. I was right there, feeling the exact same emotions as Jeff W. was. WOW! Excellent directing, producing. Nothing short of a Michael Mann movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A little boring here and there, but overall, not that bad of a film and pretty interesting","I rented The Insider almost a week ago and now seeing it this morning. I love Michael Mann and most of his films. Heat, to be my favorite of his films, opened up in 1995. Four years later Mann opens up with a new film called The Insider. The top cast is Al Pacino who starred in Heat, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, and Phillip Baker Hall. The movie was beyond interesting and had such good dialogue, it wasn't even funny. Al Pacino and Russell Crowe had ground breaking performances and brought a lot of intensity to the movie, which I praise highly. The movie is very interesting but for a 2 hour and 38 minute film, a lot of people could lose their interest into it and be in boredom which I unlikely entered. I liked the movie and it wasn't t bad at all but the film needed more energy if it wants to please everyone.

It's a bit too long, running about 2 hours and 35 minutes, but the material is intriguing nonetheless.  Writer-producer-director Michael Mann keeps the suspense up throughout, even though you know what is going to happen in the end.

Watching this film brings a new appreciation for reports and documentaries that challenge the status quo. I was particularly reminded of the little-known but powerful documentary ""Taken for a Ride"" (1996), not only because of the similarities in broad plotlines (corporations doing whatever it takes to maintain or enhance their ""market""), but also because of the recognition given to the complex relationships between stakeholders at the corporate AND (more importantly, as the film emphasises) the individual level.

A quality production that rarely comes to life,"Journalism films are a small genre but one of my favourites. ""The Insider"" is only an average entry in the canon.It is very much a film of two halves. The first half is the story of TV news producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) trying to convince tobacco company whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) to go on the record with what he knows about their research into addiction. The second half then focuses on Bergman trying to get his story on air after the network gets nervous.The first half plays like a thriller complete with mysterious figures in the shadows and fearful young families. Unfortunately it doesn't really work. The industry secrets are already known so the audience isn't discovering anything and it is hard to engage.The second half is much better. You find yourself rooting for the journalists in the face of the TV network management and malignant power of the tobacco companies.The supporting cast is excellent (albeit extensive), with a stand-out performance from Christopher Plummer as veteran TV host Mike Wallace. Russell Crowe may have received an Oscar nomination, but his performance is only OK - it doesn't help that he is playing someone about 20 years his senior. The weak link is Al Pacino. When tension ratchets up, his default mode is neighbourhood wise-guy. He's not a convincing journalist.If Michael Mann had got rid of the tough guys in the leading roles, and focused on the battle to get the story on air, this could have been a taut newsroom drama. Instead, its broad ambition results in an average outcome.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography

Crap!,"At the beginning of this year something was seriously wrong with the majority of reviewers in the world. For some strange and obscure reason they all gave top marks to junk like this, American Beauty and Being John Malkovich. Although I understand why they did this for the latter there is no excuse and no denying that The Insider is quite possibly the most over-rated and over-hyped film ever that was unfortunate enough to be seen only by totally biased audience. Except me of course.The story is about Jeff Wigand, who is fired from his job at a tobacco company and wants to do an interview with 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman. At first he does not want to do it but thanks to pressure increasingly mounted on him he decides to do it out of spite and retaliation it seems. You see the tobacco companies do not want Wigand to let the whole world know that cigarettes are addictive. But everyone knows that anyway so what's the big deal? It's hardly big screen material. It may make an 85-minute long TV movie but it certainly cannot stretch over 2 and a half hours even with the talents of Al Pacino and Russell Crowe to support it.Let me just say that Heat was cool. Long, but still a very good film. I do admit that Michael Mann is a good director, but every director coughs up a severe dud once in a while. For Steven Spielberg there was Amistad and for Kubrick there was Eyes Wide Shut. Both of these films received excellent reviews for one reason only: the reputation of the director. This is why so many people lied to themselves that The Insider is a good film (snigger). No way!Out of sheer respect to Michael Mann the whole world has given false review of this film but I'm about to give you the truth. The rest of mankind has been so brainwashed that The Insider is Oscar-worthy so they might try to hurt me for telling you this, but because I'm such a humanitarian I'm willing to risk it. THE INSIDER IS GARBAGE! There I said it.A Shocking amount of characters appear for a few seconds or maybe even longer and then disappear for the whole movie without them even being introduced to us or at least telling us their purpose to the story. This makes a series of confusing and drama-free events even more blurred and low in any kind of narrative. Mann also goes as far to not even give us reasons for events taking place. Like those men in black suits who just enter Jeff Wigand's (Russell Crowe) home and take his hard drive. Who were they? Who sent them? Why didn't Wigand do anything about it? Like call the police or even tell Bergman (Pacino). This scene is embarrassing to watch because Wigand is such a wimp. He does nothing! If someone came into my home I wouldn't just let them take my computer without doing anything.The only thing that is decent in this travesty is Dante Spinoti's widescreen photography, which is stunning. The scene with Bergman knee-deep in the ocean is a great example of wonderful cinematography. But that isn't enough. Sadly The Insider is as bloated as it is self-important and boring as it is confusing. A huge big mess. At the end you feel so bum-numbed and exhilarated that you just want to lie down. Maybe some people confused this sensation as the result of seeing a good movie. Which it certainly is NOT! Beware! 1/10.Shawn Watson",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
"An intriguing, though somewhat slow drama.","A man, who used to be a leader in the health care industry, takes a job at a cigarette company as a researcher.  You can tell he doesn't like what he is doing, but the money is good, so he stays.  Then he's fired.  What's the first thing he does?  Goes off and tells everybody that there are bad things in the chemicals.  At first he is reluctant (the first 45 minutes of the film, which should have been shaved off), but then comes around.  The storyline, I thought, was fascinating, and the acting was almost Oscar-worthy.  I would have given this movie a 9/10 instead of an 8/10 if it had only been about a half hour shorter.  There was just too much repetition in the beginning.  Towards the end it was very intense and compelling, but the beginning was so slow that the people I went to see the movie with decided they would rather play a video game and get popcorn.  But they have horrible taste in film, so what does that matter?",,Anonymous,Biography

The insider,"this has got to be one my very favourite movies: superbly written a and screen played, cleverly directed, brilliantly acted... it proves that a story focused on a normal bloke u can meet in your everyday's life can be just as interesting as the most surreal and extravagant Hollywood plot. Acting plays a big part in this movie obviously as both Pacino and Crowe give a lesson of drama school and literally carry the story forward almost on their own. Cinematography is key, every little detail taken care of, we all know Michael Mann's style from Heat but he really nails it with this picture. Master in adding drama and taking you to the edge of your seat when you don't actually see a single weapon (or not in use anyway), or explosions or deaths or anything like that in the entire reel, this is all accomplished throughout vision and prevision in all aspects of film directing. An excellent score adds the cherry to an already perfect cake.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Perfect pacing makes this a great film,"There are very few films that last over two and a half hours that can keep my attention from waning even just a bit.  Sometimes it will just be a two second `what time is it?' check, sometimes a more involved interruption depending on the quality and pacing of the film.  `The Insider' is so well done that had I not been interrupted a couple of times, I would not have strayed from the film for even a moment.  Its perfect pacing takes it from `really good' status to `great' status.Russell Crowe is unrecognizable as Jeffrey Wigand, a middle aged, pudgy and graying former tobacco industry scientist who, after being fired for expressing an unpopular opinion of their procedures, is harassed to the point of near insanity by said company when he threatens to tell all on `60 Minutes'.  Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman, a senior producer on the show who fights to get the story, then finds himself in the position of having to deal with the fact that CBS won't air the show for fear of retribution.If this film were not a true story, it would be incredible, but the fact that it is based on true events is both mind-boggling and compelling at the same time.  Wigand is an almost Shakespearean character in that he has to make some unbelievably difficult decisions, where the results aren't going to necessarily be good for anyone, and Crowe is masterful in this role. Pacino is always good, but he is all energy and fire in this film as we see him struggle with this incredible string of events.  Michael Mann can't make a film under two and a half hours, but that isn't even a factor in this film because the pacing is perfect and without any dry moments or gaps.  The cinematography is interesting in that the lighting almost has a blue haze to it, yet it maintains its sharpness.  Unfortunately, the film has a cheesy soundtrack since Mann can't get out of the 80's, but it is a minute criticism because no film can be perfect.Watch this film when you have a couple of hours where you are not going to be interrupted, because this is one movie that is going to hold your attention for its entirety.  With tour de force performances, a compelling plot and excellent film making, `The Insider' is a film that deserves all of the accolades it received when it was released and since.--Shelly",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Biased?,"The lead review complains ""The only negative was the obvious Liberal bias"".What an odd thing to say.

"Very good drama, fine performances","I thought the movie made very good drama out of a story that might of otherwise been rather dull (I am not a follower of the smoking industry scandal). Fine performances all around, but particularly by Russell Crowe. I would only dispute some of the directional choices with respect to what I would say was dramatic effect over charaterization.For example, the extreme closeups and the soundtrack (much as I enjoy that kind of music) often made me wonder when someone was about to get shot; impending danger, yes, impending extreme violence, a slight overstatement, no? Additionally, I think a few corners had been cut in the characterizations of some of the important supporting roles such as Liane Wigand, and Mike Wallace. I felt the former's exit from the marriage seemed premature relative to immediate context of the narrative; similarly, Wallace's decision to side with CBS Corporate seemed to come out of left field. I believe in both cases the story could have foreshadowed a little better the capacity for the characters to eventually make the decisions that they did (the restaurant meeting scene wasn't enough to me). Instead, we saw extensive footage given to the opening Iranian sequences, the Unibomber sequences, though plotwise their relation to rest of the story was rather inconsequential.Moreover, I felt that the film towards the end dropped the development of who I thought was the protagonist, Wigand, to concentrate solely on Lowell Bergman's heroism. I think I would have like to see more of Wigand as 'survivor'.These points downgraded the film's quality for me, though on the whole, very good!",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

A mature film and telling of a tale..for everyone,"It is very hard these days to go in a pitch a film to a major studio or distributor that doesn't have loads of special effects, sex, young people having sex, the car chases, profanity. I am sure the first words out of the mouth of an executive is, ""Well, what makes this film sexy?"" That means, what puts butts in the seats and sells popcorn.Here you have a film that tells the story of a Corporate whistle blower. Not just any whistle blower, but one for big tobacco and he tells his tale on the one place Corporations don't want to have their tales exposed: The TV Newsmagazine ""60 Minutes"". Does this sound like a fun film? A film that will get the teens going in droves or adults to shell out $8.00? No. But it did.The strengths of this film is based on the performances of the characters. as well as in the pacing and telling of the tale. Being that I am not a Russell Crowe fan, he made me a fan of his work with this film. He plays the lead character, the whistle blower Dr. Wygand and makes you really feel for him, his family, his decisions. matched well is the performance of Al Pacino who plays the Journalist/Producer for 60 minutes, Lowell. Al Pacino is as equally wonderful showing how stories are developed, produced and killed..in the corporate TV world of ""60 Minutes"".""The Insider"" does one thing extremely well and it makes you an insider as you watch. You become involved in the Wygand story for sure, but you also get really involved with the workings of getting a story together for 60 Minutes and the bigger corporation, CBS. You realize getting a story together for ""60 Minutes"" isn't all that easy and even if you have a story -- the surrounding elements of competitive Journalism with Magazines and Newspapers as well as the Network you work can be a battle ground within itself.This is a look into real Journalism to tell the people of the Nation, of the World when something is endangering your life and how hard it is to get it on air, to face so much including lawsuits and jail just to tell a story -- make the public aware. This is before the ""spin"", before the ""politics"", before the looking for sexy entertainment value that has overtaken Journalism and TV today. Director Michael Mann knows how to build suspense without drawing conclusions -- allowing you to use your brain and do it yourself.An Excellent film -- excellent acting, excellent story.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Two stools.,"A magnificent, sublimely restrained performance from Russell Crowe as the unfortunate but heroic insider of the title and excellent, moody atmosphere à la 'All the President's Men' do not quite dispel a sense of a big chance lost here: the chance to have a modern classic on our hands. So what is missing? Well, we should rather ask what is there too much of? And the answer, in my opinion, is perspectives. The writer and director have taken a true story (the cover up by powerful tobacco interests of health risk from smoking) and looked at it from the p.o.v. of both the snitch (Crowe) and the investigative journalist (Pacino) who fights editorial corruption to follow up the story, and more or less equal weight is given to each. I would suggest that by far the more interesting of the two stories is that of the snitch, the common man whose conscience is so heavy (and bitterness so strong) that he even sacrifices his beloved family to get the truth out. As it is, the stories of the two men kind of trip each other up; perhaps there was even material here for two films. Whatever, it's certainly an immensely absorbing and at times very moving account of common (and not so common) people caught up in a shameful moment in American corporate history.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Drawn-out and unsatisfying like a bad cigarette,"Considering the huge dramatic potential of this story, one wonders how the director could have made it any more boring. Instead of plot or character development we are subjected to endless meandering sequences, often accompanied by soporific 'wailing woman' music. Much of it looks like a pop video and not a very good one. Then blam, a sudden melodramatic scene with Pacino and Crowe shouting at each other. The film is about 3 hours but seems MUCH longer. Anyone making such a film about a similar subject in 1950 would have made it in 90 minutes tops and the film would have been tighter and better for it.As it is, the film vacillates between this ambling (and very undramatic) style with scenes of manufactured conflict. There is nothing in between. Clearly the director was keen to make a 'great' and 'important' film, but Michael Mann is no Kubrik and cannot sustain his rambling camera-work. The final scene with Pacino walking out the door of CBS, summed up the pretentious ambitions of the film. Pointlessly subjected to slowing down and speeding up it was the final piece of self indulgence in a highly indulgent film.The inherently interesting subject matter attracted a large cast of fine actors. Pacino is always watchable and Plummer puts in a good turn. Crowe is competent if uninspiring in his role. The script, like everything could have done with a good deal of editing. There is also a lazy reference to @all the presidents' men' near the end, a much tauter and better film.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Probably the Best Expose of Comporate Greed Backed by Hollywood,"Corporate greed is one facet of American life that is hidden often from public scrutiny. Unfortunately, many multi-billion dollar corporations are only interested in profits at the expense of Americans' health and welfare. In short, we the public pay for corporate executives' multi-million-dollar mansions, their planes, and their vacations, and we often do it without realizing what we are compromising in terms of our life. ""The Insider"", based on the real-life incidents of corporate informer Jeffrey Wigand, is one of the few American films to date that deals truthfully with the lies and corruption of American corporations.Jeffrey Wigand (played with exceptional emotionalism by Russell Crowe) was fired from the tobacco company Brown and Williamson when he could not condone the company's use of ingredients in their products to perpetuate addiction to nicotine. To add insult to injury, the corporation began threatening Wigand and his family to scare them into honoring a confidentiality agreement that basically compelled him from revealing corporate wrong-doing to the public. The film starts with the day Wigand leaves the offices of Brown and Williamson. He is then approached by Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), then one of the top journalist-producers for 60 Minutes, to analyze some documents from Philip-Morris.Bergman then discovers that Wigand has a story to tell. Wigand at first declines, using the confidentiality agreement as his reason. The film becomes how and why Wigand eventually agrees to be interviewed on camera, and the many twists and turns that occur in the process. Simultaneously, a class action lawsuit in Mississippi is brewing concerning the seven major tobacco companies, and they compel Wigand to testify there as well. Then in an interesting and unexpected twist, CBS corporate begins to pressure CBS News about withholding the Wigand story. Its reasoning: the CBS corporation was in the midst of a buy-out that would earn millions for top corporate executives that might be compromised if the there was a threat of a lawsuit from Brown and Williamson.The film is a tour-de-force triumph not only about corporate greed, but also how network corporate executives, and not journalists, are having more and more of a say on what stories are aired and what stories never leave the editing room if the corporation fears that the story is not in their best interests. The film becomes as much about an issue that is now plaguing our entire American democracy as it is about corporate consumer products: the freedom of the press to expose stories that are in the public interest as oppose to corporate interests. As a side note, the late Ed Bradly produced a story for 60 Minutes exposing President Bush's misleading the public about the War in Iraq that has not, at this writing, ever been aired.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pacino & Crowe Are Superb,"The Insider (1999)Plot In A Paragraph: Based on a true story about a CBS 60 Minutes-episode in 1994 on malpractices in the tobacco industry, that was not aired because CBS parent company Westinghouse objected.This is a much better movie than I Remembered, but it's still long and slow at times, and I do still think it could use a bit of trimming here and there. But Mann does a good job of building suspense and frustration.Al Pacino and Russell Crowe are both superb. (I personally think Pacino should have been nominated alongside Crowe.) They are ably backed up by great supporting actors Christopher Plumber, Phillip Baker Hall and Bruce McGill.As always in a Mann movie we get strong female characters.

The corporate law,"In general, I'm not a huge fan of the films of Michael Mann, finding them unsubtle; and I delayed watching 'The Insider' for precisely that reason. A film about a heroic whistle-blower fighting against the evils of big tobacco: it sounds like a black and white story. And there are certain clichés in this movie: the selfish wife, for example, who doesn't stand by her husband when he can no longer provide for her in the style to which she was accustomed (although I fear that in one scene, where she contemplates the awful possibility that she might have to go out to work, that the audience is actually being encouraged to sympathise with her). And yet the first two thirds of this movie is really strong. Mann gets his A-list cast to justify their salaries, none more so than Russel Crowe as the whistle-blower Jeffrey Wigland, who displays a character he doesn't often show: nerdy, insecure, un-self confident, torn between conscience and self-interest. Precisely because Wigland is not obviously a wonderful (or indeed a terrible) human being, but an ordinary man, the story is more interesting; and black-and-white or not, the story of such an individual fighting the huge power of corporate America is terrifying and brilliantly told. I was gripped; but the last third of the movie doesn't quite have the same power. Partly it's because we see the same story again, now within a news organisation thinking about broadcasting an interview with Wigland. But however passionately the journalists care about the story, it's hard to believe that this is their fight in quite the same way it's Wiglands, some themes are repetitive, and the idea that a news organisation should make its decisions without commercial considerations is frankly nonsense; every journalist gets their salary only because someone is prepared to pay for the product, and I find it hard to believe that this is the only time that C.B.S. news has fallen beneath a standard of 100% purity. In this final part, Mann orchestrates more scenes with big music, perhaps because there a less powerful drama beneath it. Moreover, it's never completely clear what exactly is unique about Wigland's information. Yet for three hours, Mann made me share in his characters' well justified fear of persecution. That's an achievement; and this (in my opinion) is his best film.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"A ""10""","From seeing the trailer and hearing that the movie was a true story about a corporate whistleblower in the tobacco industry, I didn't think that this movie would be terribly exciting.  I did know, however, that this was Michael Mann's next project after ""Heat""(1995), a movie near and dear to my heart, and that was what brought me to the theater.It turns out that I was thoroughly captivated by this story from minute 1 to minute 157. Told by any other director this may have been a real bore but the combination of Michael Mann, Al Pacino, Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, Dante Spinotti (camera), and the musicians make this movie incredible. Usually when I watch a movie that uses extensive cutting between two protagonists, one is more boring than the other and I can't wait to get back to the good one.  In this movie, the scenes with Russell Crowe are just as good as the ones with Pacino.I couldn't find a hole in the acting amongst anyone including Gina Gershon who I thought might screw it up.  Russell Crowe plays a perfect defensive, upper forties(he's really only 35), corporate and family man.  Al Pacino plays a perfect upper forties man (he's really 59) at the top of his profession.  I can imagine that it would've been pretty easy and tempting to vilify Mike Wallace but you won't find that here. Christopher Plummer portrays an intelligent Wallace who made me feel as if each of his decisions were rightly motivated by what he says is his main concern, getting old.""The Insider"" is shot very similarly to ""Heat"" in that there are many, many, telephoto and macro shots.  Michael Mann must have the fastest lens available to be able to shoot telephoto in the dark with decent depth of field.  This closeness has a way of making a city look like a place made up of just a few people, who you get to know very, very well.I think Michael Mann has outdone ""Heat"" here and even though it probably won't get any Oscars, it should.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Visually, like all Mann films, it was experimental and breathtaking and the mood music perfectly complemented the colors and compositions of all the scenes. This film is also historically important for obvious reasons, and I felt that a biographical film like this is not usually given the thriller-drama that this film was given to such a quality degree, but Michael Mann never disappoints.

A row of cars drive almost solemnly as in a cortege toward a courthouse where a deposition will be given. Another vehicle twists through the streets of a Middle Eastern city with a destination rife with danger. These are just three of the images Michael Mann presents us with in his latest film, `The Insiders'. It's this constant parade of resonant scenes  that transform what could have been a run-of-the-mill TV movie of the week into one of most incisive and burning dramas to come from a major studio since `All the President's Men'.The actors portray a cast of real-life  people, never imitating, but subtly communicating their innermost feelings and conflicts. Al Pacino is Lowell Berman, segment producer of 60 Minutes, preparing an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, recently fired executive of the Brown & Williamson Tobacco Co. Pacino has his best role in years. Here there is none of the scenery chewing he has been somewhat guilty of in `Devil's Advocate' and `Scarface'. This stunning expose of the tobacco industry will rock the lives of Wigand and his family, and change the public's view of Big Tobacco forever. Russell Crowe (as Wigand) delivers another award worthy performance as he tortures himself as to whether or not he should reveal the stunning facts he has been privy to as part of his job. Crowe actually gained weight to realistically resemble Wigand.  Christopher Plummer is perfect as Mike Wallace in a not altogether pleasant portrayal of this TV icon. Plummer is sure to garner  supporting actor nominations for this role.Description of the plot cannot do justice to Mann's passionate rendering of this story.

"The Bill of Rights and ""Prior Restraint:""  The Tobacco Companies as Censors","Back when good old James Madison was thinking and ciphering and scribbling up the Bill of Rights, the phrase `freedom of the press' had a specific meaning:  freedom from `prior restraint,' which meant that publishers no longer had to submit their articles to a board of censors for approval before going to press.  To the censors, just because something was true didn't mean it would be approved;  on the contrary, the truer something was, the more dangerous it could have been as an instrument of sedition and insurrection.What an irony, then, that 200 years after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the tobacco companies have the power, and authority, to exercise `prior restraint' censorship on matters of fundamental and vital interest to the public welfare.  It's as if the tobacco industry has become the pre-Revolutionary equivalent of an oppressive board of censors.  I suspicion that it would have made Madison's blood boil.  Ain't that a corker?Not since All the President's Men has such a significant, insightful, beautifully presented and dramatically poignant documentary film  an embellished but basically true tragedy of epic Greek proportions  been released.  On the one side, you have Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for CBS's `60 Minutes,' whose mission is to communicate vital information to an informed, voting populace.  On the other, there is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former tobacco executive, who faces a monumental moral dilemma:  on the one hand, he knows the dirty secrets of the tobacco industry, and deeply feels his duty to expose them;  on the other hand, he is bound by his confidentiality agreement with Brown and Williamson, which he also feels duty bound to honor.  Worse yet, Wigand faces an array of profoundly negative personal consequences if he decides to go public. Needless to say, no one would blame him if he decided to protect himself and keep quiet.  But to talk, well, that's as valorous a deed as ever accomplished on a field of battle.This is a true `must see' video.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Well acted and directed, but poorly paced down the stretch.","Michael Mann's 'The Insider' is directed with technical precision and skillfully acted by numerous veterans in this well-made drama about the exposure of the tobacco industry.The film follows Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) & Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino). Wigand is a scientist who is fired after he finds out that the tobacco company he works for, chemically alters nicotine. Bergman is a producer for the CBS show '60 Minutes' who entices Wigand to speak out against the tobacco industry. Based on the Larie Brenner article 'The Man Who Knew Too Much', Eric Roth & Michael Mann write a thorough and enticing screenplay.Russell Crowe gives his best performance to date. His subtle and heartfelt performance anchors the film. Gaining ? pounds and greying his hair, Crowe transforms himself into this sympathetic character. We feel his anguish and pain. Al Pacino gives an underrated performance as Lowell Bergman. He is efficient & gets the job done, but he truly cares about the stories he works on and Pacino shows this perfectly. Crowe and Pacino play their parts perfectly and their character chemistry is great. Christopher Plummer gives a good, albeit overrated performance as Mike Wallace. Diane Venora gives a natural, underrated performance. Her chemistry with Russell Crowe and emotional depth give the film a heart. Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, and Colm Feore add veteran backup. This is an efficient cast, but the film loses steam when Crowe, Pacino, or Venore aren't on screen together.The cinematography, sound mixing, and editing gives the film a documentary feel to it. Michael Mann's rapid, fast-paced editing succeeds in making the film seem shorter than it actually is. Mann uses very small things to develop tension in between characters. The films only fault is the pacing down the line. It feels like it has several endings. But just as soon as it starts dragging, a key encounter occurs that grips you back into the film.

"10 lines about ""The Insider""","Like it, love it or hate it, this is what Michael Mann does best.Yes, there is mostly talking and not much action, but somehow the director can even make a gag order suspenseful.The performances are rock solid, and even Gina Gershon isn't completely terrible.Russell Crowe successfully created a believable character that made the suspense work.Al Pacino, (who I sometime find to be a parody of himself), gives his most dynamic performance in years.Mann created a film where every relationship and character has ample room to breathe, providing a complex and ultimately engrossing piece of work.It doesn't get 10 stars because the score was so awful.Spinotti's cinematography and lighting design shows why he is one of the best in his field.As with other Mann films, the moods are set with lighting and set design to perfectly enhance the scene.There was so much detail and care in the craftsmanship of this film that makes it stand out amongst the standard Hollywood fodder.

An Honest Review,"I was drooling when I saw the first preview. the talent involved in this...aaaaahhhhhhh.You just know it's going to be good.And Crowe, who thinks he's the best actor who ever lived actually acted in this. Seeing him actually act is worth it. Many of us believed it was only a legend, but here it is, proof he does have talent somewhere beneath the brass.Pacino, Mann, Plummer, Gabon and you turn around and low and behold Gershon is doing a good job too.It's like a dream cast with a B-Team that rises up to the challenge.I'd give it a 10 if...wait, I can 10 of 10 just because it is a privilege to watch everyone in this film...who cares about the plot even? It could have been the worst story ever written and the cast and director would have saved it. It was like they were doing Richard III. that quality of awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Performance driven flick,"The Insider is a film that relies quite heavily on its inspired performances by Al Pacino and Russell Crowe, playing a frustrated journalist and a paranoid whistleblower, respectfully. Pacino brings a sense of urgency and dedication to breaking the story that leads to constant butting heads with his interviewee and the network. Crowe brings a sense of deep fear and mixed emotions as he tries to weave his way through exposing his company's wrongdoings without the retaliation against his children. This tug of war makes up most of the film and fuels its dramatic trajectory, but it doesn't offer much else, as the plot is rather thin and repetitive. Every scene is the same - Crowe's character wants to go public with some documents, something scary happens that makes him change his mind, Pacino pushes for an interview, and back over again.",6.0,Anonymous,Biography
Pacino being Pacino... AGAIN??!!,"It's a good film. But isn't anyone annoyed by Pacino that his acting is always the same since ""Heat"" ???! Different role, same guy. Too bad. Great acting, don't get me wrong. But in a strange way with a Steven Seagal frequency. Seagal plays different characters, but he plays em like Steven, and not like the role requires. See where I'm getting at? Pacino since '95 is always acting like "" Watch out, I'm Al Pacino; I'll show you how it's supposed to be done!"".

Pacino and Crowe shine,"I find it amazing that such a good film as this did not get a larger billing, or a longer release window, certainly in the UK anyway.  To have had to catch it on video as I couldn't get to the cinema at the time is insane.Al Pacino is the 60 minutes producer battling with the story that he can't put on air, due to legal machinations and pressure from a tobacco company, after getting the story from insider [hence the name of the film] and whistleblower Russell Crowe, who is again showing that he is an all round actor of some repute - not in the same league as Pacino obviously, but impressing more from film to film.Pacino is wonderful, as he seemingly always is, and is incredibly convincing as the TV producer who'll fight as much as it takes to get his story across.A top cast, a well scripted and directed film, and an amazingly candid tale given the subject matter; and that it's based on a true story.I'm sure that the soundtrack had some classical music tunes that also appeared in Gladiator, perhaps Russell gets a bulk film discount from the record company!",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Surprised by how much I enjoyed it!,The first time I saw this movie I just thought it would be a very boring and slow movie. However I actually thought this was a very compelling movie even though it goes by very slowly. Unlike Mann's other movies like Heat and Collateral I really loved this one the first time I saw it. In my opinion this is one of Pacino's best movies and Crowe gives his best performance which is even better and the complete opposite of his character in LA Confidential. This is Mann's best movie and my third all time favorite behind Zodiac and Pulp Fiction. Despite Pacino struggling to get the interview aired he makes being a producer for 60 minutes seem like it would be a very fun job to have. I really think Crowe should have won best actor and the movie should have won best picture because like a lot of other great movies you'll never get tired of watching it.,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Disappointing and Satisfying,"If you think it's a crime/ action/ thriller, you'll be disappointed. It's more like a documentary. Yes DOCUMENTARY. In fact if you look at the top of the title page of The Insider in IMDb, you'll notice that it says Biography|Drama|Thriller. So don't nag about how boring the movie is!The main plot is very interesting. The Insider tells the story of a former top researcher of a big tobacco company Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe), who is approached by Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino), producer of CBS News' TV show ""60 Minutes"", when Bergman learned that Wigand wanted to blow the whistle on his former employers. The dramatization of the original story fits nicely. But the screenplay holds back the story. Probably only average thing about the movie.Director Michael Mann was between good and very good. Same goes for Al Pacino. But Russell Crowe was very good. The film editing could have been better. Score and sound editing were amazing.So The Insider managed to win 7 Oscar nominations. But lost all of them. Now why is that? Was it a conspiracy against the movie by the tobacco companies? Or there were better movies? I myself believe that the film lacked the final touch. Something to push it past the finish line. May be a remake of the film can fix all the flaws and claim it's rightful place.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie is excellent.,"Eric Roth (The Horse Whisperer, Suspect) has written great scripts. The Insider kept me watching, and grabbed my attention. Very well written and with a great cast ""Lowell Bergman"" Al Pacino (The Godfather, Looking for Richard) is a great character. I remember something about the incident. Russell Crowe (Gladiator, Proof of Life) is a very good actor. The man he plays  ""Jeffrey Wigand "" is very smart, has a lot of knowledge about the cigarette industry, and who was willing to come forward to tell that the cigarette industry was in privy that cigarettes are addicting. Well, not to put the character down, but I believe that everybody knows that.  The entire world knows that... Why don't they do something about it, you've guessed it money!  Why they decide to destroy the life of  Wigand is beyond me because the whole world knows to be true what he was going to say anyway. But they destroyed him, and the movie is about how he was followed, stalked, terrorized. and so on. When I was young I also believed in changing the status quo, but after having gone through severe trials because I am outspoken I have learned to keep my mouth shut. Is it good, that I have learned that? Not sure! But for some reason sometimes even describing the obvious in the world is an  impossible thing to do. Why? I don't know. This is an excellent movie which I recommend. My favorite scene: Is a conversation where Lowell Bergman states: ""You'd better look into it, because I'm getting two things: pissed off and curious."" Favorite Quotes: Jeffrey Wigand: ""I'm just a commodity to you, aren't I? I could be anything. Right? Anything worth putting on between commercials."" Lowell Bergman: ""To a network, probably, we're all  commodities. To me? You are not a commodity. What you are  is important."" I recommend this movie. It is excellent.",7.0,Anonymous,Biography

Too long,"The problem with The Insider is that this movie is too long : 2h30. Michael Mann clearly could have, and should have, shorten the duration of a good thirty minutes because the action is completely diluted and the plot drags and drags on especially in the last half hour where everything seems to be stuck. Moreover, the big revelation supposed to be exposed is that tobacco is bad for your health, something so evident these days that this story seems completely absurd. Apart from the solid performances of Russell Crowe and Al Pacino — who for once isn't overacting —, there is not much to draw from this movie which sorely lacking density and where everything is a bit too over-dramatized.",3.0,Anonymous,Biography
All The Kings Horses and All The Kings Men Can't put the Watergate Era Back Together Again!,"In 1976, Alan Pakula's All The President's Men was released.  Those were heady days for journalism.  In the period since , the enthusiasm over the Watergate investigation has waned considerably.  Then Woodard & Bernstein became stars and millionaires.  Today many newsmen are millionaires. People wonder if these guys still share their values. Walter Cronkite is no longer in the anchor chair. Viewers have fled the big Three for Cable.  The cable news networks define news coverage for all other national news outlets.  Cable News and syndicated tabloid magazine shows give fits to the news divisions at CBS, NBC and ABC, which produce newscasts that are less serious than ever in order to remain competitive.  And Americans are about to flee television itself, for the Internet.Against this backdrop director Michael Mann gives us The Insider, a film every bit the equal in seriousness to All the President's Men.  Russell Crowe plays Tobacco Executive Jeffrey Wigand.  Al Pacino is Sixty Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman. Wigand has just been fired from his $300,000 a year job.  Bergman wants help deciphering a tobacco industry document. The two of them start an uneasy relationship.  The film suggests Wigand's employer began spooking his family BEFORE the executive agreed to become a whistleblower for Sixty Minutes. I doubt that is true.Soon the two men are developing the story.  The Mississippi Attorney General's office wants Wigand to testify.  Reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) is brought in to interview Wigand.  Executive Producer Don Hewit (Anthony Michael Hall) is brought on board.  Brown & Williamson gets wind of Wigand's betrayal. Bergman says it wasn't him who tipped B&W. Wigand begins a new job as a high school science teacher. Brown and Williamson assigns detectives to follow him and make trouble for Wigand's family.  The Tobacco giant plants anti-Wigand stories in other Press outlets in anticipation of the Sixty Minutes bombshell.  Wigand's wife and daughter leave him.  He loses his home and the wife divorces him.The story keeps developing and the pressure builds.  But the biggest problem is inside CBS itself.  CBS Legal learns that Wigand has a contract with Brown & Williamson that provides for serious financial penalties if Wigand reveals ANY of its secrets, and CBS is liable too.  All of a sudden the story is threatening the financial interests of the Network itself.  Wallace and Hewitt agree to back off. Bergman is livid. He says CBS owner-CEO Laurence Tisch is betraying the news division because he is afraid a major liability suit will queer plans he has to sell the network to Westinghouse.  Left out of the script is the news that the Tisch family owned Loews controls Lorillard, another of the seven giant tobacco companies in America.  Even director Michael Mann had to make some concessions.  He must have bargained away this embarassing little detail when making his own deal with CBS over what would appear in the script.Bergman has to tell Wigand the story has been squelched. After all he has had to put up with, Wigand is more than disappointed. Bergman begins leaking CBS' betrayal of the news division to other press outlets.  Wallace is now angry that his own part in the coverup has been revealed.  He and Bergman quarrel. The Producer is furloughed for a week by Hewitt.  But CBS News has a black eye that would make Edward R. Murrow roll over in his grave.  Wallace has a brilliant public relations ploy. Lets go over to Black Rock (CBS Corporate) and sell them a package that will save all  our reputations.  I won't tell you what the deal is though you can probably make a good guess.The film is two hours and 37 minutes long.  It doesn't drag but its a very long sit for a film audience that is mostly under 30 and more interested in special effects than public affairs.  In 1976 the film would have been hailed as something like the Second Coming.  Today, a film like this is released with almost no fanfare. Its only hope is to capture enough awards to alert the mostly 35 and older audience that has abandoned filmgoing, at least in theatres.  Two years ago, Crowe made a boffo debut in a wonderful film called LA Confidential that was soundly trounced at the Awards by the Carnivorous, youth-oriented Titanic.  And Crowe, whose performance is tempered in this role, is one of the greatest screen actors to hit these shores since Marlon Brando, James Dean, George C. Scott and Tony Hopkins.  Because he still insists on acting at a time when appearing in monster special effects packages is the key to success.., because of this, Crowe's success as a film actor is still not a cinch.There are other actors in this film that are wasted.  Any film that would use Rip Torn as little as this one does, deserves a slap.  Torn plays PR man John Scanlon, but he barely speaks a sentence.  British actor Michael Gambon plays a high executive at B&W.  His screentime is minimal.  And Mann repeats a video clip of Gambon repeatedly.  The guy who lit a welding torch to reshape the Otter's Uncle's Lincoln in Animal House 21 years ago is wonderful as one of the courtroom lawyers from Mississippi.  Wings Hauser, the aptly named and wonderfully over -the-top B-movie actor who usually is larger than Richard Simmons onscreen, is subdued here as a B&W lawyer at a Mississippi court hearing.  Speaking of subdued, the most interesting performance is Christopher Plummer's subtle underplaying of Mike Wallace.  Plummer's Wallace almost seems to be subordinate to producer Bergman.  I wonder if Wallace is really this quiet around his colleagues at the network. The Plummer portrayal is in savage contrast to the Mike Wallace we are used to on-air.  Plummer makes no attempt to imitate the on-air Wallace.  His delivery is sufficiently newsman-like, but it is not the hard-hitting TV character we are used to. Gina Gershon is sharp and sharklike playing the CBS Lawyer who deflates the team's hopes of putting the story on the air. And former New York Post Editor and columnist Pete Hamil plays a reporter-editor at the New York Times, one of the few Gotham publications he has not worked for.I wasn't crazy about this film, but in a debased American Cinema, the Insider stands out just because it is directed to an adult sensibility.  There are many adults who will not enjoy this film. Its been a long time since Watergate. Not everyone is interested anymore.",,Anonymous,Biography

I absolutely loved this movie,"This movie is fantastic. When I saw this movie, I figured it was just going to be a boring and long movie. I couldn't have been more wrong. Sure it was long, but The Insider kept your attention for every second of the film. Russell Crowe, once again, is magnificent. I just can't get over what a great actor he is. Every character Russell plays he makes seem so real and I couldn't help to think that Russell was robbed out of the award for Best Actor at the Academy Awards. His Oscar win for the role of Maximus in Gladiator (for which he deserved all the way) makes up for it though. He absolutely amazes me. Not only is he SO CUTE (well, not in The Insider because he played a 53-year-old, but he looks cute in most of his other performances) but he is also an amazing actor. Al Pacino also gave an excellent performance. He too makes his characters seem real in every movie he is in. The cast for this movie was phenomenal. This movie kept you on the edge of your seat.

Best Picture of 1999,"Let me  start off by saying that i don't like Michael Mann.  I thought ""Heat"" was a long, boring waste of my time and I never liked ""Miami Vice"". That is why it is with great surprise that I announce that ""The Insider"" is the best film of 1999.  I won't get too much into it, but this film tells a riveting story with great acting.  It is well written and beautifully filmed.  The cinematography by Dante Spinotti is outstanding.  he worked on ""L.A. Confidential"" which had a great look as well.  If we think of cinematography as the use of light in film (which is what it is), then this film gets it just right.  The scene that really stuck with me was when Pacino is sitting in the hotel lobby waiting for Russell Crowe.  The shadows in that lobby just lend a whole mysterious tone to their meeting and the way Pacino's whole face is in the dark except for his searching eyes is wonderful. This film is what a best picture should be: great story, great acting, great technical work.  Like ""Titanic"" except that didn't have a great story or great acting.  It also has a great group of smaller role actors which lend it a richness so many other films lose because they focus too much on the stars.  Phillip Baker Hall, Christopher Plummer and Bruce McGill (forever D-Day in ""Animal House"") are just a few of the names that add to the greatness of this film. Whod've thought Michael Mann could pull this off?  Not me.  Thanks to the Academy for forcing me to see this film.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Intriguing and Clever. Worth a Look.,"After getting nominated for 7 Academy Awards, I was dying to see The Insider. Well, I must say, I was basically blown away by how much effort went into this film, and it is very recommendable.Based on a magazine article, The Insider follows the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), head of a tobacco company's Research And Development department, who discovers that the fag companies have for years not only known that nicotine was addictive, but worse, they've been messing around with the formula to make it even more so. After being persuaded to give a TV interview by producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino Pacino), Wigand discovers that smoking is deeply bad for your health, even if you've never lit a gasper in your life. Harassment, death-threats, a possible prison sentence and a collapsed marriage are a few of the ordeals that Wigand is put through -all, it would appear, to no avail when squabbling at CBS' 60 Minutes news programme leads them to ditch the programme, much to Bergman's horror.Some powerhouse performances here, Al Pacino is corker as Bergman, but New Zealander Russell Crowe pulls off the most impressive act in the film, therefore earning himself an Oscar nomination. Michael Mann, director of Heat, has assured direction here, he knows what he's doing, and he does it well, his script for The Insider is also well thought-out and amazingly clever. The only faults there may be here is the fact that The Insider could be a big bore for some audiences, but for me, it was an enthralling experience.A well done film, definitely worth your time.I rate The Insider 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Boring, cheesy, and this inexpressive Australian actor","I'm surprised everyone seems so highly captivated by this slowish and rather pointless movie.As usual since he's played Shakespeare, Al Pacino doesn't play his character - he just plays Pacino, ie he has his shakespearian tirade, like in Any Given Sunday, The Devil's Advocate, etc.And there's Russel Crowe - the man with one expression (or no expression at all ?). Is it boredom, fatigue or disgust ? Anyway, it's the same mask as in Gladiator !Then there's the pace of the film - or rather it's lack. I must say I've had to watch this movie (on DVD) on several moments, pausing after each 30 mn not to fall asleep.If you want to see what kind of masterpiece action-packed movie with DEPTH Michael Mann can realize, then (re)watch Heat !I rate this film 2/5.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
In a perfect world. . .,". . . this would be just another movie. The uniformly strong acting, the tautly-scripted storyline, the assured but (for the most part) largely unobtrusive direction - this stuff should just be par for the course. Back in the mid-70s these kind of smart, densely plotted, clearly focused movies were done all the time. Sadly, in today's Hollywood of Michael Bay, Lucas/Spielberg clones and Tarantino wanna-bes - where shock and spectacle, pop culture hipsterism, and visual overkill predominate - an intelligent, sensitively wrought movie like The Insider comes across like some kind of revelation. Rather than what it is: a good, competent film - not a transcendent one, nothing that will stay with you for a long time after you've seen it: in short, not a Best Picture nominee. And yet, of all the films up for the Oscar this year, I'd say this one is the best; what does THAT tell you about the movie cycle we're currently going through?I don't mean any of this to take away from the movie itself. There's much to like here, particularly the lead performances from Al Pacino and Russel Crowe. Crowe brings a crimped, repressed intensity to his role as Jeffrey Wigand, who blew the whistle on big tobacco and then had to live with the consequences. His stillness and meek stolidity simultaneously pull you in and yet keep you distanced at the same time. He internalizes the role to such an extent that we can sense the springs and whirrings going on underneath without him having to show any of it to us. As a matter of fact, it's very much the type of controlled intensity which Al Pacino brought to his work in such 70s films as Serpico, Dog Day Afternoon and (especially) the two Godfathers. Alas, it's a skill that has long deserted him (or been deserted by him) and he has become one of the most ""showy"" of actors. No Pacino performance can properly be called subtle anymore - it's merely a question of the degree his over-acting takes: either full-steam-ahead scenery chewing (Scent of a Woman, Dick Tracy, Devil's Advocate, Heat) or a more relaxed hamminess which at least keeps him on the same earthly plane as his co-stars (Carlito's Way, Glengary Glen Ross, Donnie Brasco). Happily, The Insider falls into the latter category, and his portrayal of ""60 Minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman, while certainly heroic and larger than life, is also imbued with a real sense of friendliness and compassion. In dealing with Wigand, he is forced to adopt several different roles - friend, confessor, sounding-board, even big brother - in order to nudge the man into telling his story. Pacino goes through the changes with ease, but he also suggests a real concern and protectiveness for Wigand which go beyond his need to get a good story. As such, the film becomes primarily about the relationship forged between these two men. This is a good way to focus the story, since it puts a human face on the larger issues raised instead of just being a simple-minded polemic, whose characters exist only to move the plot along.What else. Um, let's see - the direction is solid, for the most part; it lets the story tell itself rather than trying to inject much bogus ""style"" onto it (there are some lapses here and there - some overly dramatic soundtrack choices and a misplaced ""hallucination"" scene in a hotel room - but nothing too major). The supporting cast is all good - though certainly no more than that. This is particularly true of Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace, who's drawing all sorts of accolade for what is basically an impersonation. An enjoyable one, to be sure, but it never really goes beyond the surface. Of course, the film doesn't help matters by writing Wallace as a shallow dupe and corporate lackey - it really does a hatchet job on him and I'm not sure how justified it is. The final third of the film, in fact, is a little hard to take - the part which deals with ""60 Minutes"" refusal to air the tobacco story. It just doesn't seem as compelling as the earlier part of the film - partly because Wigand, the most interesting character, gets pushed to the background and it becomes a one-man show for Al Pacino. And when I say one man, I really mean it: the Bergman character is portrayed as the only one with any integrity whatsoever, as he single-handedly (and single-mindedly) pushes to get the story out through other media, while his colleagues (including Wallace) are content to tow the corporate line. The filmmakers exaggerate the facts here, and the film suffers as a result: it puffs itself up too self-consciously as an ""issues"" movie, rather than letting those issues emerge organically through the kind of character study the first part did so well. And any time a film makes one character the sole repository of goodness and integrity, as it does with Pacino here, it tends to become strained and unbelievable. So, too, does The Insider in the final half hour.Up until then, however, it's good - though certainly not the second coming of All the President's Men (the film it's most often been compared to). There's no reason, though, why every film shouldn't be this good; there's nothing amazing going on here, just an interesting story, well told. If that's the kind of virtue which gets lauded in Hollywood these days as a masterpiece, then I think we're all in a lot of trouble.",,Anonymous,Biography
"A very slick, smart, and absolutely shocking film.","""The Insider"" is like the ""All The President's Men"", ""The Hurriance"", and any other true story that involves dirty tactics.  The true story revolves around Lowell Bergmann (Al Pacino), a segment producer for the CBS news show, ""60 Minutes"" and Jeffery Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former sciencetist who used to work for Brown & Williamson.  Bergmann wants Wigand to go on ""60 Minutes"" and tell Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) the little secrets that the seven C.E.O.s, a.k.a ""The Seven Dwarfs"" didn't tell Congress.  Wallace and Don Hewitt (Philip Baker Hall) oppose Bergmann's idea to air the segment because Big Tobacco might sue CBS. Russell Crowe is simply superb here as he was in ""L.A. Confidential"" and earned an Oscar nomination for it.  Al Pacino, too, is fantastic and he deserved the Best Supporting Oscar hands down.

Compelling story of 60 Minutes & Big Tobacco,"Faults; The film starts covering the life of the Insider - Dr. Wigand, played by R. Crowe. But the film ends focused upon Al Pacino's character - the 60 Minutes producer - Lowell Bergman.                       In the end, it would have been stronger to wrap up the Insider's human story more fully.What works; Pacino gives a strong performance, as well a Crowe. The story of intrigue keeps one on the edge of their seat wondering how the Insider will manage to testify under the pressures mounted by his old employer. The added twist of CBS caving to money interests and pressure, thickens and intensifies the plot.Powerful consequences: Reviewers mention how well the film depicts big tobacco. Perhaps true, but what is most impactful, is how the film portrays the behind-the-scenes of 60 minutes. This film was only lightly marketed because of complaints from CBS and Mike Wallace. In June of 2000 - years after the film was made - Don Hewitt of CBS gave a speech to 1000 journalists filled with angry rhetoric for Lowell Bergman. Mr. Bergman - a former 60 Minutes producer - is the person Al Pacino plays in the film, and who consulted on the film when made.

Mann's follow-up to Heat is the better film?,"This is the thing. The Insider got rave reviews, people who saw it liked it, the studio thought, indeed everyone thought it was an important film, a very valuable piece of work, and it didn't sell. It basically flopped.These things happen, or happened sometimes in the '90s. Think of Soderbergh's crime comedy, Out of Sight (Georger Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, et al). That movie was a rave, it was way better than the overrated Tarantino venture, Jackie Brown (with which it shared the characer of Ray Nicolette), but audiences didn't go see it. What are you gonna do?The answer is rent both of them, Out of Sight AND The Insider, although Mann's film is better paired with his previous, much celebrated cops and robbers yarn, Heat. Heat was famous for putting De Niro and Pacino together, on camera, two masters. Here, instead, we have the old master (Pacino) and the new flavour (Russell Crowe), as well as excellent support from various actors, Christopher Plummer being the most famous.Well, it's (potentially) a better story, and a true story, and played with real commitment and intensity by the cast, especially Pacino, who is increasingly magnetic as the investigative journalist courting a whistleblower from Big Tobacco. Crowe also does well as the insider, and maybe it's a more difficult role, the man wrestling with the biggest ethical conundrum of his life, facing mounting pressure; a role that requires more interiority. The scenes in the offices of 60 Minutes, and the court scenes, the legal chess moves, the callous acts of intimidation, attempts to discredit the witness, are all enthralling and disquieting, and it's a comfort to see Pacino's Lowell Bergman making his counter-moves without getting disenchanted.I guess the story is just a bit too dry, not as juicy or as sexy as Heat, and that's why it's harder to enjoy The Insider than it is the previous Mann epic. It suffers from that dangerous virtue of being a worthy subject, rather ore than an entertaining one. Maybe the film could move a little, just a little faster to, the music be a little less overwrought.But really, for the main, it's a great film, powerfully acted and stylishly directed.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Engrossing plot, dialogue and characters make it zip by","I was kind of wary about watching this movie because I have seen a few of Michael Mann's other films and found them nonsensical (Mohicans) or just plain boring (Heat, except for the robbery scene).  But this one really caught me up in the story and character development.  Pacino gives yet another charismatic performance as Lowell Bergman as he fights to get his story aired on 60 Minutes.  And what can possibly be said about Russell Crowe?  The man defies being pigeonholed as an actor and his Jeffrey Wigand was a superb characterization, going from persecuted employee to defiant rebel who wonders if it was all worth it after he loses everything.  He played a middle-aged man so well that he makes a paunch and white hair exceedingly attractive! :P  The almost 3 hour running time just flies by and you see some of the best performances on film along the way!",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent cinematography and music elevate a tedious story,"In order to do justice to an actual event either in a book or in a film, it usually helps to allow adequate time to pass between the event itself and the retelling of the event.  This allows authors, filmmakers, etc. time to assess the social, political, and/or historical significance of the incident and tell the story with this in mind.  Unfortunately, the controversy in Mann's -The Insider- occurred only four years ago and the true, perhaps indelible impact Wigand's story had on the tobacco industry, on investigative journalism, and on America as a whole has yet to be felt.Mann's movie certainly details a provocative--sometimes infuriating--incident, however the film entertains without providing much analysis or insight about WHY Wigand's saga is important.  At over two hours, the story failed to keep my attention.  The film's saving graces are solid performances by Russell Crowe, Christopher Plummer, and Al Pacino; beautiful, moody cinematography; and an excellent score which includes classical pieces, opera, and fluid, ambient synthesized music.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

It is really amazing that this film even got made.  Russell Crow surely deserved the nod over Kevin Spacey for best actor.  It was one of the greatest performances I've ever seen.  My only gripe at all was Michael Mann's style of photography in the film.

Probably the best of 1999,"I dallied for so long before seeing THE INSIDER, and, especially after seeing it, I have no real idea why.  Was I afraid of a socio-screed against cigarette companies?  Al Pacino acting up several storms?My advice -- having now seen it twice -- is to view this one while it's still in the theater.  This is the sort of intelligent, gripping movie Hollywood produces when it's at its best.  Like QUIZ SHOW, DONNIE BRASCO, CITY HALL, and SEARCHING FOR BOBBY FISCHER, THE INSIDER has a tight, tight script, moves at a great pace, offers an insightful story about humans, and has terrific performances and cinematography.  Michael Mann pushes the quasi-documentary camerawork perhaps just a bit too much for some tastes; I thought it was terrific.A very deep nod of approval to Russell Crowe.  This is the sort of subtle acting that I don't think most folks realize is so special.  He details his performance so beautifully, even pushing up his glasses perfectly in character.  I could see both the reserved southern gent in him as well as the man who has a problem managing his anger.  The only time it doesn't completely work -- and I would suggest it was a writing and directing problem -- is in a scene in which he is badgered to get on the telephone. His sudden explosion is more a movie mannerism than a glimpse of reality; little matter, though, as he quickly makes the scene work.  A terrific performance from Christopher Plummer, too.  (And Al does fine, keeping the ham largely off the plate.)The only movie that touches this one in 1999 is THE TALENTED MR. RIPLEY (or, much more arguably, TOY STORY 2 and THE STRAIGHT STORY).  THE INSIDER is more than worth checking out; it's something of a treasure.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Very powerful,"Lest one thinks that a movie made about a tobacco whistleblower who loses the chance to tell his story to the world would be dull, think again. This film is hard core drama. A gripping story ripped right off the evening news. Al Pacino plays Lowel Bergman, a producer for ""60 minutes"" who accidentally finds a recently fired VP of a big tobacco company holding valuable information that could cost the cigarette companies billions in law suits. But just as he tries desparately to get Jeffrey Wigand's story told (excellently played by Russell Crowe), CBS backs out of the story leaving Bergman holding the bag and angry at the CBS brass for making him the fool and a liar. This film has some of the best acting I've seen in years, especially in Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace. Plummer doesn't imitate Wallace as much as portray the intensity and drive that he is well known for. The Insider pulls no punches in attacking the cigarette industry (an easy target), but also attacks the hypocrisy of the news media wanting to be free to tell ""their"" side of the story at the same time wanting protection against any ramifications that come of it. This should have done better than it did in the theaters but comes across well on DVD. Don't miss it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A Riveting and Unforgettable Experience,"The Insider is one of the most gripping and thought-provoking films I have ever seen. Directed by Michael Mann, this film tells the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, a whistleblower from the tobacco industry, and his courageous decision to expose the truth about the harmful effects of cigarettes.As I watched the film, I was captivated by the intense performances and the powerful narrative. Russell Crowe, portraying Jeffrey Wigand, delivers an outstanding performance that truly brings out the inner turmoil and moral struggle of his character. Al Pacino, as journalist Lowell Bergman, perfectly complements Crowe with his relentless pursuit of the truth. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable and adds depth to the story.However, watching ""The Insider"" is not without its challenges. The film delves into the complexities of corporate power and the lengths to which companies will go to protect their interests. The tension and pressure faced by Wigand and Bergman are portrayed so realistically that it leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. The ethical dilemmas and the immense personal cost of standing up for the truth are depicted with such raw honesty that it is both heart-wrenching and inspiring.""The Insider"" is not just a film about the tobacco industry; it is a powerful commentary on integrity, courage, and the importance of investigative journalism. It underscores the crucial role that the media plays in uncovering the truth and holding powerful entities accountable. The meticulous direction, compelling screenplay, and exceptional performances make this film an unforgettable experience.If you're looking for a film that is both intellectually stimulating and emotionally engaging, ""The Insider"" is a must-watch. It is a testament to the power of truth and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity. Though it is a tough and intense watch, it is an incredibly rewarding experience.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The movie was neither too long nor too short. I never felt something like ""We get it, now another scene please!"".

Fine job of acting, too, by Russell Crowe as Dr. Wigand.[The only potential disaster was one of Dr. Wigand's daughters was that obnoxious little twirp from the Pepsi commercials.

Music is added when necessary (as is dialogue, of course) but Mann lets the gaps do much of the work, to great effect.Pacino, brilliant as always, using a bit of his Ricky Roma salesman character, tempered with the heart of an idealist.

True, the performances are first rate - as one would expect from people like Pacino, Crowe en Plummer (though Crowe deserved special mention.)True, the movie is longish (but feels fast paced nevertheless.)What has not come out in many reviews is that Mann really succeeds in submerging the audience in the sinister force field that is out to destroy the Wigand character. Mann really pulls it off to make the spectator feel part of the drama - as a spectator, but one residing within the movie as it were. The brilliantly creative camera work and editing are reinforced by a restrained but effective soundtrack. As in Heat, Mann shows once again that he is close to being a cinematographic Mozart.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"The most engrossing, clever film of 1999","The Insider is based on the true story of two men who fight to get public information out to the public. Lowell Bergman (Pacino) is a producer of 60 Minutes. Jeff Wigand (Crowe) is an ex-executive at Brown and Williamson (America's 3rd largest tobacco company). When Bergman approaches Wigand to be a consultant on a fire safety study on cigarrettes Brown and Williamson blackmail him into furthering his confidentiality agreement. Bergman can tell that Wigand has something to say but can't. So he sets up Wigand to testify in a court of public opinion on behalf of the state of Mississipi. He does, and he also does a CBS interview on 60 Minutes with Mike Wallace (Plummer). The information is simple. That the tobacco industry has been lying to the people about nicotine. That it is not only addictive but they also manipulate it to increase its addictiveness. But big tobacco are trying to do all they can to shut Wigand up. They use restraining orders, they treating CBS with a lawsuit and they start a smear campaign against Wigand. All these things separate Wigand from his family and Bergman from the rest of CBS. This was a fantastic movie. It deserved all 7 of the Oscars it was nominated for. Michael Mann's direction is impeccable as he shows what the people are thinking and the emotions they are feeling. The film is long but very engrossing. The film switches half-way through from Wigand giving the information to Bergman fighting to air the information. Al Pacino shows that he is one of the best actors in Hollywood with an Oscar worthy performance. But the star of the show was Russell Crowe as Jeff Wigand. His performance is perfect as a man torn between what is right and what is best for his family and he stops short of showing Wigand to be a persecuted hero, but as a man whose whole life is threatened by what he knows.

Jeffrey Wigand called it ""rat poison."" Warfarin is a rat poison in huge quantities and can be made from green leaf volatiles, it is also a life-saving drug that prevents strokes and heart-attacks. So the ""whistle-blower"" lied to make himself appear to be a hero.

This film is a riveting tale of corruption in corporate America, of valuing money and personal advantage above traditional, basic fundamental human values such as respecting human life and telling the truth. Two courageous but imperfect men, and their allies, prevail in the face of an army of greedy, dishonest, egoistic, cynical people surrounding them. As such, this film does a masterful job in telling this story, in a powerful fashion that no documentary (well, perhaps if Ken Burns produced it, and Stephen Ambrose was still around to be interviewed, not having succumbed to smoking induced lung cancer) could have conveyed. It's a heroic, well-crafted morality tale, and well deserves its comparison to ""All the President's Men."" In fact, I think cinematically it is much better.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The real drug pushers.,"After his last masterpiece, HEAT, Michael Mann had enough integrity and credibility to attack the powers that be. So with this film he crosses the hot coals - lit by the drug pushing tobacco companies, multi-billion dollar corporations and the TV media - to tell the true story of Jeffrey Wigand who blows the whistle on his ex-employees about the drug induced nicotine they mass produce. 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman gets a whiff of the story and is quick on the trail. He is a man of his word that gets straight to the point and doesn't like to mess about. He may seem to be too patriotic, waving the sleazy media flag but he is not. You can label him as the last of the true media reporting heroes, a rare thing in this day and age. The other bonus Bergman has is that Pacino does a wonderful job in portraying him. You almost wonder why all the accolades are going to Crowe as the poor stressed-out Wigand. Not taking anything away from Crowe, the man is absolutely astonishing. As a viewer you do get swept into his deep ocean of paranoia and frustration. With these two performances up front there is no letting you down. What really picks up the film is the second half when all guns are out to do battle with the revelations of what goes on behind closed doors in the Corporate sector. The great thing is that there are no shoot-outs or dead bodies for dramatic effect. Reality can sometimes be fascinating! Mann's previous films were stylised, but with The Insider he knew that the script was good enough to stand on its own. So he went for the realist look where the photography of Dante Spinotti is just there to tell the story without any fancy lighting. Another technic Mann uses is the sense of paranoia. We get into Wigand's fear as the image lingers on at the end of a scene with the extras in the background becoming the focus of attention. Is one of them the tobacco thugs, spy or whatever? Or is it just me that's paranoid? This build up works perfectly for Pacino's character later in the piece when he realises what Wigand is going through. Nice to see a film not afraid to tell who the real criminals are, because these days we all just tend to shut up, bend over and take that Corporate $ firmly between the cheeks!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

A template for others to follow,"The Insider is an absolutely wonderful movie.  What made it especially great is that it didn't rely solely on action and explosions to boost its interest level, as most movies out there do, but instead it chose to lean on tension to keep the audience riveted.  Not only did I find the movie extremely interesting, I found myself learning a thing or two about television production and tobacco companies.  I felt extreme sympathy for Jeffrey Wigand as he struggled to reveal the truth about tobacco to the American public.  Russell Crowe may have misstepped in Mystery, Alaska, but he is back to the height of his acting in The Insider, a powerful performance rivaling the one he gave in L.A. Confidential.  Al Pacino was fabulous as well.  I know that this film was early in release, but I hope that when Oscar nominations come out that this film is not forgotten.

Inside a true story,"WHAT CAN WE SAY ABOUT A MOVIE BASED ON A TRUE STORY?Well, if the movie is any good, even if loosely based on that true story, not much can we say. Michael Mann has done a fantastic work. He throws the viewer into a voyage filled with constant tension, the hallmark of every good thriller. Ok, being based on a true story makes somewhat easier the job of the director - we can easily identify with the characters, because (that´s my case) we imagine ourselves in their shoes and think, ""Wow, what would I do if I were him/her?""The plot, full of twists, is frighteningly familiar to all of us with some sense of reality. That´s the real world, folks. Powerful men and institutions don´t give a dime about any of us, simple mortals. We are merely the tools they use to get richer and more powerful and that´s it.Once in a decade or so, and out of millions, comes someone who goes about his/her business with a tremendous sense of justice and righteousness. The Insider is about two of such persons, two men - whether or not the real story is exactly like that, it does not matter. But I have a feeling that whatever happenned in real life may very well be close to this movie.Al Pacino, as usual (I have no words to characterize his acting - superb, out of this world, to be remembered, the master of masters, someone who breathes acting like others breathe air), fantastic. He is older, one can see that, he looks a little bit tired, but what a tremendous performance this man has achieved.Mr. Russel Crowe...his performance is worth a nomination for an oscar. He is strong, fragile, cold, emotionally unstable, a loving father, a knight who fights for justice, knowledgeable, a good friend...what a character, and what a performance. He is the main emotional engine of this movie, and has made it big. He is a nominee for this year´s oscar, together with one of the greatest actors alive - Denzel Washington. He has a definite chance of winning this one, but it will be tough.The rest of the cast...Plummer, the great actor, is his usual self-centered man who goes nuts when someone ""screws"" with him...pardon my english.Good soundtrack, also.I thank Michael Mann, the actors and the studio behind them, for bringing us (the public) their vision of the events surrounding the discovery that tobacco companies are playing with every smoker´s life...and everyone´s life, by the way. I haven´t yet seen the other movies nominated for Best Motion Picture Award, but The Insider seems like a good choice.Good movie. Good directing. Go see it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Movie Making at its Best,"First of all, this movie is not for people that enjoy shallow, flat, or poorly written scripts. The Insider is an informative true story that shows us how Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) chose to fight and reveal the lies of the tobacco company Brown & Williamson.

Al Pacino does an amazing job of portraying the 60 minutes producer Lowell Bergman who helped Wigand along his journey of emptiness, heartache, and frustration in order to show the American people the truth. Russell Crow gives the performance of his career, and Al Pacino again shows America what real acting is all about.

"Jon Monsarrat review:  disappointing, low-key","I'm an action movie guy and I like thrillers. Plus, in tune with the culture in Massachusetts, USA, where smoking was banned in workplaces earlier than most regions, I was looking forward to enjoying ""The Insider"", which sticks it to the evil cigarette industry.However, ""The Insider"" is based on a true story, which means that the script writers are not at liberty to spice up the plot. They can't, for example, throw in an extra car chase whenever they like.So the film sort-of bored me. The acting by can't-fail actors Al Pacino and Russell Crowe was great, but this wasn't ""The Firm"", and lives weren't really at stake here. Without giving away the plot, mostly it's a legal battle where Al Pacino (the journalist) has to convince Russell Crowe (the Insider) to endanger his career.OK, he might endanger his career. So what? That's worth a movie? That's bravery? I know, I know, the film is really about Pacino's character as the protagonist, not Crowe's, but it still didn't work for me and I found it a little boring.Who should see this film:-- Arty film types, you'll probably appreciate more than I did-- Anti-smoking types who can't help themselves-- Action / thriller movie buffs, but only on a rainy daywhen you've got nothing better to do, and only if you don'tneed stuff to blow up constantly to enjoy a filmI give ""The Insider"" a disappointing 5 out of 10.

The fact, that of all current ""based on a true story""- Hollywood films ""The Insider"" is the one which stirred upcontroversy the least, also shows that Mann was very precise in the treatment of the facts (note: there is no criticism of ""The Hurricane"" and ""Boys Don't Cry"" intended, simply because I haven't seen them yet and I don't forget that in adapting a true story for cinema it's simply necessary to compromise). ""The Insider"" convinces in nearly every detail: Manns direction is straight to the point and always finds the appropriate tone. There's always a feeling of danger and threat in his film, keeping the tension on a high level. Also worth to mention is how the film deals with questions on integrity and responsibility. Its depiction of the working procedures of the american corporation system is accurate and as Russell Crowe has put it in the Sunday Times interview, it is miles away from the paranoid conspiracy theories of the likes of Oliver Stone. That brings me to the actors: the supporting actors -among them Christopher Plummer and Philip Baker Hall (also to be seen in ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" and ""Magnolia"") - are all very good and Al Pacino does a good job as Lowell Bergman, but the one who beats them all is Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wigand. Crowe (who was already great in L.A.Confidential) is simply outstanding! I honestly think that Russell Crowe should get the oscar and not Kevin Spacey (well, Spacey is great in American Beauty, but he already got an academy award for The Usual Suspects). To me ""The Insider"" is just a perfect film and I already consider it as one of my alltime favourites. It is a real gem, flawless, essential. The very best film of the year. A well deserved 10! Can't wait to get on it DVD.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Winner - Most Overated film of the year,"I was really disappointed by this film.  It features lots of one dimensional characters, another tired variation on the standard hollywood corporate/government paranoid conspiracy plot, and a highly over rated performance from Russell Crowe as ""The Insider"".  What really bothered me the most though was the performance of Al Pacino. This is a guy who gave what I consider to be the two of the best performances of any actor in my lifetime. I am talking about the Godfather I&2.  His other early performances in Serpico,  Scarface, etc.. though not up to the Godfather standard, rank right up there.  Several times during the Insider I kept thinking to myself, is this the same guy??? I had the same thoughts while viewing his other recent film in which he played a football coach.  That film was so bad, I can't even remember the title. One part I will remember most about this film is the portrayal of Mike Wallace.  It was a hoot! If you have not seen the film, Christopher Plummer acts as if he is playing Mike Wallace on Saturday Night Live.  It is a totallytongue in cheek funny send up (I really don't think Mike could be that much of a buffoon in real life).  I could see why Mike was so mad about the characterization.  Hats off to Christopher Plummer for providing some comic relief to an otherwise boring film.",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
A high level drama,"I didn't know what to expect of ""The Insider"". The first time I heard about it I didn't care much. Then, I saw one scene at a TV programme and I thought it was a conventional film as ""A Civil Action"". But, in December, it received some nominations to the Golden Globe, including best picture and, even not winning anyone, I started to show some interest about it. About fifteen days ago, the nominees for the Oscar were announced and I knew that ""The Insider"" could be a strong rival for ""American Beauty"" -my new favorite film-, so it had to be almost as good as the other one. Well... I watched it this afternoon, and... if it's not better than ""American Beauty"", or as good as that, it is a high level film which has its importance.Everything in ""The Insider"" has a high level, from the acting to the screenplay. Director Michael Mann, whose previous works were ""The Last of the Mohicans"" and ""Heat"", does a wonderful job with the camera and is helped by a very well written screenplay, based on a true story, which makes suspense about ordinary things and keeps the attention of the audience. If Kevin Spacey weren't on the list for best actor nominees, my favorite one would be Russell Crowe. He was great in ""LA Confidential"" and here he perfectly plays a man in contradiction, who has to make an important decision and has to deal with the consequences. Al Pacino delivers a stellar performance once more, and Christopher Plummer should have been remembered by the Academy. The film has its flaws (the fact that it is slow, for instance), but this defects are covered by its great qualities.""The Insider"" is a very important movie for some reasons. It is about the power of the media in the '90s and how it can manipulate people. But, more than anything, it is a film about ethics, and how ordinary people deal with it. Russell Crowe's character, Jeffrey Wigand, is on a very difficult situation, and the film shows very well how he faces it. That's one of the greatest points of this picture.I gave ""The Insider"" a 9 out of 10 for all its qualities and great points, showing a sad true story very, very well. But if you want PERFECTION, pure perfection, go watch ""American Beauty"", which is for sure my favorite for best picture.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
wish I could give it a 20,"This easily one of the top 3 movies I've ever seen.  GREAT acting from top to bottom, a great story line, editing, directing, everything.  Russell Crowe deserves all the success he gets after this film - he was BRILLIANT. I saw it toward the end of its run, and boy am I glad I caught it while it was still in theaters.Also the movie poster is really cool, I'd highly recommend checking ebay or online stores if you're into that sort of thing.Off to see Traffic...",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Fit  for  Academy Award,"Michael Mann does always great film each 4/5 years,so I 'll have only to see again(if all'll doing well) 7 or 8 and I'm very very disappointed! After HEAT I was thinking that the next MANN's work could be very different,because I think that movie was unrepeatable and an end of a restart. In fact,THE INSIDER is very different than Heat and go beyond,the tobacco story in only a pretext,this is a film over the courage about responsibility of our actions.A great screenplay a great story! Russel Crowe show us how is hard do be coherent and honest in life.Al Pacino makes again a great work,and I'm thinking why have no Nomination?Maybe bacause he have no more space on shelves at home? About Mann styles,the music is used in a perfect way.Almost obsessive is SACRIFICE.Like HEAT's score there were using 2 tracks ARMENIA and IN NOVEMBER both too great for be forget. On Remind's Children scene a music is mixed with MELTDOWN and give a great emotion and that is what I call Mann's Movie! The SPINOTTI's cinematograpy is amazing,but very different then HEAT,very particular the Mountain scene. But I give me a reserve to the Italian Copy of that movie,I'll have to see on ntsc DVD or LD for make a right idea. Last is the strange way to shooting this movie,I saw often anything like a weak quivering,like a real Documentary. Why I love that movie?Simply because is a Mann's film and I have not used 20 years for understand that guy is a genius.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
What price truth?,"At what point can knowledge be deemed ""too expensive"" to reveal, even when it would eventually save thousands of lives? How thin can one's integrity be stretched before you can no longer live with yourself? These are just a sample of the themes explored in Michael Mann's engrossing ""The Insider"", a parallel examination of former tobacco executive Jeffrey Wigand's whistleblowing 1996 testimony against corporate giant Brown & Williamson, and ""60 Minutes"" segment producer Lowell Bergman's struggle to expose Wigand's sobering evidence to the public. The screenplay's structure is intriguing: as we follow Wigand's back-against-the-wall attempt to reclaim a modicum of self-respect after years of looking the other way, he concurrently loses all of the treasures, both meaningful and materialistic, he has accumulated in his career. Comparatively, as Bergman struggles to bring to light Wigand's shocking revelations, his once-united front of journalistic truth crumbles as his ""60 Minutes"" colleagues cave in to the potentially devastating legal ramifications of revealing to the public information that Wigand is forbidden to share. All of the Mann touches are here: the good (muted wide-screen compositions, unusual soundtrack selections) and not-so-good (too-frequent hand-held shots, overlength, underwritten female roles). In any event, this trenchant true story (despite some dramatic license and composite characters) is well-served, particularly by Crowe (nearly unrecognizable as Wigand) and Pacino (convincing as the relentless Bergman). So focused are these two, whether together on-screen or apart, they are never less than riveting.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best films Ever.,"Not many films get as much right as this one does. The writing is excellent, intelligent; the performances absolutely brilliant and effective all around, particularly from Crowe and Pacino. The filming and editing are works of art. The music fits marvelously. I am totally absorbed and engaged every time I watch this, to the point of tears at times. Crowe should have gotten the Oscar for this rather than for ""Gladiator,"" but alas, ""Insider"" came up against the devastating ""American Beauty"" and no one knew what to do...The film as a whole is a work of art, a true dramatic beauty, a tribute to the struggle of an ordinary, flawed man to do the right thing despite personal cost. Or of two ordinary, flawed men. A standing ovation to Michael Mann and everyone who brought this movie into being.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
ATTENTION: This film is not propaganda,"This film is the tale of the whistle blower, who came out and said that the tobacco heads were lying when they said that they knew nothing of cigarettes being addictive.I am not a smoker, but I was still reluctant to go to this film. My fear was that the whole movie would be propaganda about how bad smoking is for you... It wasn't, it was just about the tobacco heads.Everything about this movie was tip top, especially the writing, the only thing that got me down on it was the set direction. Here is some movie about the media, and lawsuits, and family, except everyone is walking around on the set from ""The Matrix"".The media aspect of this film was wonderful too, and Pacino's performance was very strong. It almost felt a bit like ""All the President's Men"", just not quite as good.Check this one out if you've already seen ""American Beauty"", and ""Fight Club"" so far this year.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Too slow, too long, too unimportant.","There are definitely parallels between this movie and 'All the Presidents Men' and it looked to me like the director was trying to produce an ATPM for the new Millenium. Well he failed. The difference is that ATPM was about the Constitution and this movie is about smoking. So it was hard to get excited about it. Michael Mann tried to use some of the tricks he used in 'Heat' - but it just didn't work since the subject was a bespecaled scientist with a PHd. This is another movie (The Green Mile is another) that is *way* too long. On the positive side, the acting is good - even Al Pacino tried to constrain his over-acting tendencies. But overall - pretty boring, too long - and another reason why American Beauty should sweep the Oscars. One other comment - the film was based on a program made in 1994 yet (small) mobile phones, the Internet and e-mail were seen. Sloppy directing.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
The movie that became itself,"In writing this review, I'm tempted to address it to Don Hewitt and Mike Wallace. The Insider is a devastating film, but I think they are mistaken, if they see it as a blanket indictment of 60 Minutes. It's a blanket indictment of the tobacco industry. I don't think we will ever get to the bottom of what went on at 60 Minutes, with respect to the treatment of the Jeffrey Wigand interview. This movie is a dramatic piece that takes a stab at it, and I think that heaping criticism on Director/Writer Michael Mann is a huge mistake. This film shouldn't be picked at, it should be applauded. The spirit of this film is exactly the same as that of 60 Minutes. I doubt that most people watch 60 Minutes with a notepad in their hands. I think 60 Minutes gets people to think, and hopefully look into issues that are important. I believe that was Michael Mann's goal.The first issue to tackle is the presentation of Lowell Bergman, former producer at 60 Minutes, as the white knight of the story. There were complaints that Bergman got credit for things he didn't do, and that he didn't quit when they said he did, etc. I'm reminded of the avalanche of criticism that Oliver Stone received when he chose Jim Garrison as his vehicle to probe the JFK assassination. As Michael Kinsley noted at the time, critics assailed Stone for making a hero of Garrison, whom many considered a shameless self-promoter and a man of shaky morals, at best. While this attack was taking place, across the multiplex you could go see Warren Beatty and Writer James Toback's near deification of Benjamin Siegel in Bugsy. I'm tempted to say that it's Michael Mann's dime, so he can pick whatever hero he likes. However, I think the truth is that there was a wealth of information he needed to convey, and selecting Bergman as his vehicle was the best way to go.The second issue which had supposedly ""independent"" viewers up in arms was the aura of suspicion, manufactured or otherwise, that surrounded Jeffrey Wigand. This man will probably remain an eternal enigma. Was he exaggerating his claim of being harassed for some hidden agenda? Did he lie about finding a bullet in his mailbox? Did he try to cover up that he stole an electric can-opener?This second issue is at the core of my argument in defense of this film. Question: Isn't it more important that Wigand, a scientist who worked for Brown & Williamson, provided undisputed testimony that nicotine was being manipulated to bolster it's addictive qualities, than whether or not he stole an appliance at Walmart? Shouldn't people be more disgusted by the laughable testimony to congress by the seven heads of big tobacco (The Seven Dwarves, as he refers to them)?This movie became itself. It's a story of how many forces there are out in the world that seek to silence agitators. The simple truth is that Wigand, Wallace and Bergman had a story to tell and were crushed by some of these forces. Mann and Co-Writer Eric Roth wanted to tell this story on as big a screen as possible, and they got crushed, too. I'm surprised we didn't hear about how Michael Mann stole some lawn darts when he was in high school, or that Roth missed a Alfa-Romeo payment when he was in college. I hope this irony is not lost on Mike Wallace and Don Hewitt.It's no surprise that this film (vastly superior to the diverting, but hardly earthshaking American Beauty) was shut out at the Oscars. Kevin Spacey is one of our finest actors, but his character is not in the league of Russell Crowe's work here. Crowe's Wigand, with his birdlike and occasionally irritating behavior, with his egotism, with his intelligence, whoa! This is a performance. Reporters once again had a little fun when it was reported that Crowe didn't invite the real Wigand to the premiere. I guess this Crowe guy must be a schnook. Don't give him the Oscar.Truth be told, acting kudos go to all involved. Pacino, as Bergman, creates a stubborn character, who's not ashamed of his liberal nature, even when he's in a sea of conservatives. Christopher Plummer's controversial characterization is a delight as well. He gets Wallace's legendary tempestuousness, his egotism and his smarts down to perfection. The small characters are drawn with a sharp eye, as well. Alert to reporters: Mann's wife Diane Venora plays Wigand's wife. Bad news, though, she's a wonderful actress, and she's great here. Sorry.As the settlements from big tobacco come down, Mann's working on a film about about Ali, Bergman's back working in Berkeley where he belongs, Wigand is up to God knows what, and 60 Minutes chugs on, popular as ever.

A missed academy award for actor Crowe !,"Although the movie's subject was the corruption of a cigarette-manufactory and the way a honest man and a journalist work together to bring it out, the mainstream was the courage of a man nearly paralyzed by fear yet determined to do what has to be done. Never before I saw an actor ""breathing"" fear and determination so intensely during the whole length of a movie as Crowe did here. He should have won his OSCAR-nomination that year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gripping reality based drama,"This is a dramatic triumph; a gripping story of the battle between truth and corruption in the sacred halls of mass media news.  Based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand, the research scientist from Brown and Williamson Tobacco who blows the whistle on the industry's attempts to chemically enhance the addictive effects of nicotine, this story grabs you like an anaconda and slowly squeezes you until you are out of breath.The plot follows Lowell Bergman, a producer for 60 Minutes, as he first stumbles across Wigand (Russell Crowe), convinces him to do an interview and then battles to get the interview aired after Brown and Williamson threatens CBS with a lawsuit.  This is reality based drama at its finest.  For once, we have a real story that is not rendered dubious by over-dramatization.Michael Mann directs his third consecutive triumph.  He only does one project every three or four years, but what he lacks in frequency he more than delivers in quality.  I liked all aspects of his direction, but I was particularly impressed with his use of the camera.  Mann has all the various camera techniques honed to perfection, but what is most impressive is his appropriateness in using technique in a scene to maximize effect.  If he gives us an extreme close-up or a foreground blur, it is exactly what is needed for maximum impact in the scene.  He uses technique to enhance the scene rather than using the scene as an excuse to show off technique, a disease that seems to have become epidemic, especially among hip young directors.Mann brings us taut drama with a relevant message.  He provides well defined characters that hook the audience emotionally.   His pace is always appropriate with moments of frenetic action augmented by dramatic buildup and suspense.The acting in this film was uniformly excellent.  Pacino is at his finest in this role.  It is clear that he had a real passion for the part unlike his stilted and phony performance in `The Devil's Advocate'.  As in `Heat', I believe that Mann has again brought forth Pacino's maximum dynamism and squeezed out of him every bit of his brilliance.Russell Crowe elevated his game to a new level with this film.  Though I found his performance a bit uneven, he brought great power to the role (perhaps a bit too much), and transcended his previous best performance in `LA Confidential' by a wide margin.   This was a complex and difficult character,  reserved and intellectual yet highly emotional and explosive. This is a combination that doesn't usually come in the same package.  Crowe nailed the reserved intellectual part, but was overwrought in the angry scenes, coming across more like an action hero than the incensed nerd he was supposed to be playing.  However, this is a picayune criticism of what was on the whole a fabulous performance.This is one of the better dramas I have seen in a while.  I rated it a 9/10. It is well written, well acted and well directed.  What more can you ask?",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An exciting look at a disturbing story,"The Insider succeeds as a thriller while tackling the difficult job of a controversial news story.  It is about Jeffrey Wigand, the Brown & Williamson executive who wanted to tell of Big Tobacco's lies to CBS' 60 Minutes, and that network's refusal to air the story.  Russell Crowe gives a fantastic performance that not only should be remembered at Oscar time, but should guarantee that he will become one of the top actors in the future. Al Pacino is very good (as usual) as Lowell Bergman, the renegade producer who fights with CBS and Wigand in order to save Wigand's story.  Christopher Plummer mimics Mike Wallace perfectly, and the rest of the cast are all good.  But most of all, it is Michael Mann's direction that makes this film work.  It moves at a frenetic pace, and pushes the audience to feel the tension and frustration of the story.  This film has not performed well financially, and that's sad; audiences may feel that they already know this story.  That's too bad - The Insider is a terrific film which will be remembered for years to come.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
It was better when it first aired on 60 Minutes,"If you followed the massive media coverage about Jeffery Wigand a couple of years ago you have a much clearer and more informative image of the goings on with the Wigands and 60 mins moaning about being possibly sued (wah wah wah).  But luckily because 60 mins (and don't forget CBS) were such pussies it gave the other networks free reign on the the tobacco Tyrants.  But if you happened to be in a coma, have long term memory problems or you are informationally challenged (he was on Rosie for god's sake) check this movie out.",1.0,Anonymous,Biography
Epic Drama,"The Insider is a fascinating look at the story of Jeffrey Wigand and how he revealed to the world that tobacco companies were lying about cigarettes. Russell Crowe gives a very good performance as Wigand, and you feel sorry for Wigand because he has sacrificed his career, family, and good name for a cause he believed in.What keeps this two and a half hour epic from becoming boring is the quality of the acting throughout the picture.  Even the least important characters are played well, except for that annoying Pepsi girl who plays one of Wigand's daughters.  I couldn't watch her on screen without wanting to punch her in the face for those stupid commercials.  But I digress.Al Pacino gives an amazingly understated performance as the producer of 60 Minutes who gets Wigand's story on the air.  After Mann's last collaboration with the actor on Heat, I expected a little more over-acting, but was pleasantly surprised.The only fault of the movie is that it does run a bit long.  Unnecessary scenes could have been cut to bring the run-time down, but it's obvious that Michael Mann believes in this material.  In the end, The Insider is an involving movie that patient viewers will not be disappointed with.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Yes, Michael Mann likes long.But what does that matter, for a film that can put one in touch in the most basic levels with a character that you don't really know much about for those 2 and some odd hours?Coupled with an unusually  good performance (for production company movies) put forth by Russell Crowe as Jeffrey Wygand, this film, with its dramatization, worts and all, brings forth more truth about America than any film on the block in the past few years.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

He wasn't quite convincing about having a southern accent, a glitch that was slightly distracting to the otherwise intense scenes he appeared in.Otherwise every part in this movie was played to perfection, especially by Crowe and Pacino.  A very believable effort by Christopher Plummer as the venerable Mike Wallace, and all the other supporting roles tell a story of truth, morality, and justice in a way that surpasses the run-of-the-mill Hollywood flick.A great movie, one of the best, that would be great even if there were no truth to it.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Brilliant film.... stunning,"If you liked The Sixth Sense and Fight Club, watch this and find out what a great film is supposed to be like.  If you liked American Beauty, come see its strongest Oscar challenger so far this year.  Personally, I find The Insider to be hands down the best film I've seen so far this year.People will say (have said, actually) that it's boring or too long.  If you see this movie, be prepared.  It is long.  But I never once looked at my watch (notwishstanding the fact that I don't have one), and I was never bored for a moment.  I was completely engrossed from start to finish.  At movie's end, I would have happily sat down again (after a brief stretch) and watched it again, despite the lateness of the hour.The performances are magical.  Pacino, Crowe, and Plummer all must be seen. Let's hope this pushes Crowe up a notch in the realm of professional respectability.But it's the direction that makes this film.  When it's praised, it's the director being praised.  The long pauses, which irritate some (when it's criticizes, it's the director being criticized), provide the viewer with a peaceful moment which is needed to process and come to terms with the material.  The story is not thriller material, but the direction provides all the tension and excitement of a thriller.  But most thrillers are mindless, and a savage, relentless pace doesn't hurt the narrative.  In this film, however, the tension and excitement must never be allowed to obscure the story.  The pauses allow for the audience to stay with the story.  They are gently pulled along with the events, rather than having images and ideas simply thrown up at them.Lastly, I would just like to point out that Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand, as they are portrayed in this film, are probably the two most heroic, admirable characters I've ever seen on film.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Compelling Drama From Michael Mann,"Many times, the resolution to a problematic situation is seemingly as easy as simply knowing right from wrong, and acting upon it.  The sub-text of the problem, however, is often more complex; especially when the onerous decision of personal sacrifice is involved.  Such is the situation explored in `The Insider,' a powerful drama directed by Michael Mann and starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe.  Based on the true story of Dr. Jeffrey Wigand (Crowe), a former Corporate Vice President of one of the major tobacco companies, it examines his struggle to act in accordance with his own conscience after circumstances put him together with Lowell Bergman (Pacino), a producer for Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) and the highly respected television news program, `60 Minutes.'  On the surface, Wigand's conundrum seems easily dispelled; as a research scientist involved with matters of health, he has vital information concerning the addictive nature of nicotine and, moreover, the attempt by the company for which he worked to enhance the consumers propensity for it by manipulating the ingredients of their product.  Under oath (and televised on C-SPAN), the CEO's of the seven major tobacco corporations testified, to a man, that to their knowledge nicotine was not addictive; but Wigand knows otherwise.  And by claiming ignorance of the properties of nicotine, they subverted the truth even more by refuting what Wigand knew to be what they considered their real business: The delivery of nicotine to the consumer.  You put a cigarette in your mouth, you light it up, you get your fix.  Bottom line, not only do they know exactly what they're doing, they perjured themselves on national television when questioned about it.  Wigand's problem, however, is the confidentiality agreement he signed upon termination of his employment; if he talks, he loses the lucrative severance package that includes health benefits for his family.  And he has a young daughter with acute asthma.  So from his perspective, in knowing the truth about `Big Tobacco,' the question becomes one of morality:  How much does he owe, and to whom, considering the personal sacrifices he will make if he does the right thing. 	Beginning with an intelligent and well developed screenplay (by Mann and Eric Roth, adapted from the magazine article `The Man Who Knew Too Much,' by Marie Brenner), Mann meticulously presents this story of ordinary people under the stress of extraordinary circumstances in a manner that is creatively imaginative and totally engrossing; in short, a flawless delivery of a terrific script and story.  The tension begins from the moment we are introduced to Wigand and continues to build throughout the film.  There is inspired camera work (at times almost invasive, in a way that puts the viewer `in' the scene), impeccable transitions and pacing, and Mann exacts a number of brilliant performances from his actors, especially Crowe and Pacino. 	Crowe gives a detailed, Oscar worthy performance (he was nominated) as Wigand, deftly capturing the traits and attitude of this intelligent, complex individual; his volatile temperament and demanding attempt at self restraint, his forthright manner and love for his family, and the toll that coping with the demons that plague his conscience takes upon him.  Crowe has a compelling screen presence that commands the viewers attention; his expressive reactions alone convey intelligence, a sense that the `wheels are always turning,' that demands regard.  It is quite simply a remarkable character study delivered by an amazingly gifted actor whose approach to characterization is, in many ways, reminiscent of the style of Alec Guinness. 	Pacino gives a commanding performance as well; the kind of work we've come to expect from one of our greatest actors, who time and again never ceases to amaze with what he can do.  As with Crowe, his turn here is firmly planted in reality, and it's that ability to make it so real that gives such emotional impact to the drama.  And it should have garnered him a Best Actor nod as well. 	Other notable performances include Christopher Plummer, who absolutely `becomes' Mike Wallace, affecting a manner of speech and physical traits that are entirely convincing, and Diane Venora, as Wigand's wife, Liane. Also, in smaller-- but highly effective-- roles, are Michael Gambon (Thomas Sandefur) and especially Bruce McGill (Ron Motley), whose work here should have brought him a Best Supporting Actor nomination.  In the final analysis, `The Insider' is a film that will keep you enthralled from beginning to end; one that rings of truth beyond reproach and which aptly demonstrates how important it is to have men of principle and integrity among us.  This film is an example of cinema at it's best, and one that demands viewing by one and all.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent,"In a year that has boasted great commercial success but little artistic achievement, Michael Mann has directed a solid, well-crafted gem.  A wonderful cast, that includes Al Pacino in a more subtle character than his recent movies, Russel Crowe delivering big-time in a complex character, and Christopher Plummer who is nearly flawless as Mike Wallace, is what drives this movie.  Unfortunately Mann's direction is a tad too stylized.  Mann favors the ""behind the ear"" camera angle too much, and the overuse of jump-cuts becomes tiresome toward the middle of the movie.  Toward the end of the movie, Mann relaxes his narcissistic techniques that supposedly ""define a director"" and simply tells the story, thus redeeming his past mistakes.  The story is well worth telling.  Lost in the wake of the OJ Simpson verdict, this true and riveting tale of morals, big business, red-tape, and perseverance is now being told with incredible dramatic force by this talented crew of artists to those that will listen.  The script, the movie, Plummer, the cinematography, and perhaps Mann will be nominated for an academy award.  In a weak year such as this, both Pacino and Crowe could receive nominations for Best Actor though the bronze statuette is sole possession of Kevin Spacey for American Beauty.  This is an excellent movie, it may end up being one of the top 5 of the year, but only Plummer might end up taking home an Oscar.  Definitely worth the cost of admission, but be prepared, it's reeeeeeeally long.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A realistic portrait of a whistle blower,"Michael Mann is a director with an appetite for crime and detectives. This applies to TV (""Starsky & Hutch"", ""Miami Vice"") bit also for the cinema (""Heat"", 1995).It is therefore a little bit of a surprise that with ""The insider"" Mann makes a docudrama about the cigarette industry. This docudrama is however not about smoking being bad for your health (everybody knows that) but about the industry adding purposefully ingredients reinforcing the addicting effect of nicotine to their cigarettes. A scandal causing a huge dollar amount of claims.Main characters of the film are an investigative journalist (Lowell Bergman played by Al Pacino) and a whistle blower from the cigarette industry (Jeffrey Wigand played by Russell Crowe). Both are portrayed in a very realistic, not romanticized way.By investigative journalists we almost automatically think of Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) in ""All the president's men"" (1976, Alan J. Pakula). However Lowell Bergman is not working in an idealistic environment like the Washington Post but in a media company with the emphasis on company that is afraid of diminishing advertisment revenues (from the cigarette industry).Also whistle blower Jeffrey Wigand is not only an idealist but also a man made of flesh and blood, doubting if the cause is worth offering a promising career. In ""All the president's men"" the whistle blower (deep throat) literally remained in the dark and never became an interesting person.In the end Jeffrey Wigand not only offered his career but also his marriage. There was some criticism that the movie was women unfriendly portraying Mrs Wigand in such a disloyal way. In my opinion films are women unfriendly when they portray a woman as a sexual object only but not as they portray a woman as less then perfect.More interesting in my opinion is the role the American way of health care insurancy is playing. Losing your job can also mean losing your insurance. When you, or one of your loved ones, has health issues, this can be a big problem. It is a big problem in ""The insider"", but also in films as Glengarry Glen Ross (1992, James Foley) and ""Take shelter"" (2011, Jeff Nichols).",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent acting by main charaters,"The Insider is a powerful movie about the corporate strong-arming of big tobacco and CBS News to prevent a sixty minutes journalist, played by Al Pacino, and a tobacco whistle-blower from taking their story to press.  The three lead actors, Al Pacino as Lowell Bergman, Russel Crow as Jeffrey Wigand, and Christopher Plummer as Mike Wallace all gave splendid performances which were astoundingly moving.  Although the acting of Diane Venore and some of the other smaller role actors left something to be desired, the movie itself was a splendid piece of work which was certainly one of the year's best.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Powerful and Under-rated Story,"I can understand why the validity of the truth behind this film might be questioned.  However, you have to realize that you have to see this movie for what it is:  A powerful story about strength, hope and how an individual can overcome REALISTIC, overwhelming odds.  Ironically enough, another film like this one was also overlooked by the academy, whose characters used hope and strength to survive more life-threatening situations: ""The Shawshank Redemption"".From the movie's excellent direction (a superior ability to make a thriller without action and still maintain the quick pace), wonderful screenplay,haunting musical score and especially the fantastic acting) will be a film to be remembered for a long time.The acting is incredible.  Plummer's performance as Mike Wallace is frightenly real.  Pacino finally gave up his screaming method-acting he picked up in ""Scent of a Woman"" and gave a subtle, energetic portrayal that is his best in years.But the actor who gives the movie its heart is Crowe's Wigand.  His is a performance that shows realistic struggles of what this man is going through and what he loses.  And when he does get his emotional battle scars, he maintains his silent composure, but reveals his pain through his eyes. His is the best portrayal of ""an ordinary man facing an overwhelming circumstance"" and should be an example of how to face our problems like a fighter, not a victim.I was extremely disappointed that he did not win for best actor.  Although I am a Kevin Spacey fan,  Crowe's was the most multi-layered, and the transformation was more thorough.  Unfortunately,  for the last 3 years, the academy has been blatantly showing that it's not the best performance that wins, but who is the most popular.  3 years ago, it was Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt who won for ""As Good As it Gets"", instead of Judi Dench for ""Mrs. Brown"" and Peter Fonda for ""Ulee's Gold"" (or Robert Duvall for ""Apostle"").  Then, 2 years ago: Gwyneth Paltrow for ""Shakespeare in Love"" and Roberto Benigni for ""Life is Beautiful"" instead of Cate Blanchette for ""Elizabeth"" and Nick Nolte for ""Affliction"" or Ian McKellan for ""Gods and Monsters"".  Now, Kevin Spacey came out of the blue for ""American Beauty"", based on this popularity.  The only redeeming factor was Swank winning for ""Boys Don't Cry"".Again, I'm a fan of Spacey's, but Crowe, as well as many others in this film, were robbed of the recognition they deserved. Perhaps the inspiration that is generated from the film to the viewer is good enough.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Truth Has Many Masters,"Sometimes I wonder how this movie got made at all.  ""The Insider"" is easily the best movie about journalism since ""All the President's Men."" And many of the forces at play here: big tobacco, network conglomerates, corporate lawyers, are still very much in evidence in the media/political landscape of today. One has to wonder how many other Jeffrey Wiegands are at this moment, slipping through those cracks. It's a  gripping, compelling story.Russell Crowe is amazing as Wiegand (write down Best Actor nominee right now). Not only does he look like him, but all traces of his heavy Australian accent are gone. Al Pacino shows us yet another shade in his multi-faceted repertoire, and is fascinating to watch. Director Michael Mann gives us his usual interesting tableau: visually arresting shots, quick cuts. Some may complain of its length, but I was riveted to the end.Another Best Picture nominee, for sure.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Michael Mann's magnum opus (Let's see if Ferrari would make me delete this),"Mann's touch for crafting imperfect men obsessed with their profession shines here. From the blue-collar professional thief who wanted a family, to a criminal who would abandon his love for the heat around the corner. This film he tackled with an ordinary man whose family and fame is on the line, and a producer who lives in the craft.The brilliant performances are only magnified by the brilliant cinematography. As if dancing with Crowe and Pacino with the camera, Mann and Spinotti often shoot them with a flair of interest, we follow their paperwork, their faxes, sometimes we could even share their visions. (Hint: meltdown)In here, the art of broadcasting somewhat echos that of filmmaking, and the film shows that.When Pacino is in the editing room, we hear his comments to the editors, we see his work on the computer screen, we also linger on his look of confidence, his craft. A lot of people say Mann is obsessed with the crime genre, but I think Mann is obsessed with obsession itself.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best movies ever made.,"I'd say by the time this movie finished, my eyes were wet.  Whatever the facts are, this movie does a good job in pointing out the fact that when businesses own a news media, the news becomes biased.  This is where free press is blurred.  I had heard of the 60 minutes screw up in the Tv Guide years ago, but I didn't know the facts.  This movie makes you want to know more.  When this movie first came out I bi**hed only because Disney didn't let sixty minutes review it.  That's the only reason and I never let on to the fact that just because I bi**hed it didn't mean I wouldn't like the movie.  Anyone who wants to see a good movie like this should see it.  My favourite part of the movie though is the contrast at the beginning where it would seem it's easier to protect a terrorist than it is of big tobacco.  10 out of 10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent Conspiracy Thriller,"An excellent treatment of a subject that's difficult to make dramatic.Both Pacino and Russell Crowe are excellent, and Michael Mann manages to keep the tension up and still show us his distinctive style.

Jim Schembri is wrong again.,"We settled for The Insider because American Beauty was all full up.

Mind you, I was going to spare IMDB one of my mediocre ""reviews"" until I saw what Jim Schembri had to say in The Age.

The movie that should have won the best picture Oscar among the movies nominated,"While Fight Club was the best movie from 1999, The Insider should have won the Oscar among the films nominated. Instead, they passed the award to the completely undeserving American Beauty.Russell Crowe shined as the tortured Wigand, even though the man in real life was actually kind of light hearted. I listened to him speak when he made a rare appearance in Tucson, displaying a persona that seemed far from the one portrayed in the movie. Al Pacino was probably the hippest news producer ever, and the film was most certainly a classic.Hopefully, people will give this film the respect it most certainly deserves.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the most disappointing films of 1999,"To put it simply & succinctly this film is a mess. The screenplay is disjointed & unless you are familiar with the original story on 60 minutes, you will have a hard time undertstanding what is going on. both Al Pacino & Russell Crowe act there hearts out & I for one found them not believable. Now my main gripe & my very low rating is for the music.One of the most aggravatingly bad scores,There are some supposed songs (you cant make out any lyrics at all), That is so annoying you wonder what is happening to  film music now a days.Also it is overly long & quite boring. The 158 minute length is way too long, An hour could have been easily cut.Respectivly submittedJay  Harris",4.0,Anonymous,Biography
Great Epic true drama,"Consistently fascinating detail of a true life Big Tobacco informant (Russell Crowe) and his relationship with a producer at 60 Minutes (Al Pacino) that becomes tempestuous when CBS will not air the segment because of the lawsuit threat from Brown and Williamson.Great casting.  Russell Crow gives a very textured performance, Pacino is his usual dependable self.  Like many of Mann's film...it is sprawling and runs 2 and a half hours plus...does not drag however and anyone with an active mind will be fascinated by this well told tale.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Gotta love Russell,"Just a few short notes:There was an actor playing Mike Wallace?There was someone _acting_ as Wigand?How did Al Pacino figure into this in real life?Can Russell Crowe do intensity subtly or what? (at least he won't be going up against any of his LA Confidential castmates except Spacey come Oscartime)Creates a wonderful feel with everything technical, then adds a wallop with the acting, scripting, and directing.The partially repetitive style makes it feel in some aspects like a 60 Minutes show, itself.The Insider and Fight Club both show you that you're watching a movie, Fight Club more directly, Insider much more subtly as the presentation mimics the theme of media manipulating the facts of the case.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Harrowing story of tobacco scientist, turned whistleblower","""The Insider"" was a story about having it all, then taking a risk and losing it all.  Jeffrey Wigand was a tobacco scientist, but quit because of his guilty conscious in his questionable line of work.  He comes into contact with the producer of ""60 Minutes"", Lowell Bergman, who asks him to bring his story into the public eye.  Wigand has information about big tobacco companies knowing about the addictive chemicals of tobacco, and other dangerous details, but not telling the public, and even lying about it to Congress.  Big Tobacco fights back by trying to dig up as much dirt as possible about Wigand and even threatening him and his family.  The movie is tense, scary, and the worst part is, it's true.  It's hard to look at a cigarette ad without thinking about scumbags after you see this movie.  An excellent movie with a fantastic plot and incredible cinematography.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Interesting story,"The Insider is filled with terrific acting, a good storyline and suspense. However, my friend and I both felt it was very drawn out and could have been condensed to make it more enjoyable. I certainly don't want to take anything away from Crowe and Pacino as they were both excellent.  At times I did think the movie dragged but overall it works well and I would recommend it to almost anyone.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Infamy lasts a little longer,"One of the phrases uttered by one of Michael Manns characters in this fine depiction of a whistleblower within the tobacco industry, Jeffrey Wigand played by ""kiwi-born, aussie-raised"" actor Russell Crowe. In the beginning its not a difficult story to grasp. The good and bad guys are pretty much defined early on. The tobacco conglomerates are the bad guys of course. Even the smokers would agree with that. One day Wigand decides to divulge some of his former employers more questionable production practises to the media. Here the media is represented in the form of hard driving '60 minutes' producer Lowell Bergman, played by Al Pacino. Everything goes well until one day journalistic ethics clash with corporate priorities, then its all on. Enough said.What to me could have been a boring 165-minute docudrama turns into a gripping story as it delves into ethics in the press and the angst and moral dilemmas which sometimes occupies our top news staff. Some would say not enough angst. The performances are exceptional and the principals, Pacino and Crowe have received worthy mention but some of the supporting cast also give of fine studied portrayals of their characters who are people still living. Gina Gershon deserves credit as an icy corporate lawyer, and Christopher Plummer as 'Mike Wallace' gets it down pat. The arrogance, the humbleness is all there.  Mike Wallace also gets all the best lines. But although his character comes out flawed in places to me that showed him as more human, not the brusque interviewer we see on TV, and consequently more likeable.  Not my pick for Best Picture this year but a worthy candidate to stand beside the top five. Bravo.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Love / Hate,"By giving this film a 5 rating, I'm ensuring my comment will (probably) never get seen!!! After reading several comments here on the ""loved it"" end and several on the ""hated it"" end, I find myself agreeing with both. I liked the story (even though as one ""hated it"" fan says, it's old news.) I liked much of the acting -- with particular praise to Michael Gambon for his near perfect accent and slimy affect, and to Russell Crowe for his understated but dead on portrayal of Wigand. Some of Pacino's work did seem stacatto, blustery. Two aspects of this movie, as a film, were quite disappointing to me. It needed an editor. There were several segments that were pointlessly drawn out, the director's ""little darlings"" I think, that were not quite sleep-inducing to me, but just irritating. The movie could have been far better at 2 hours. The other problem was the music. It was, for the most part, either pointless and irrelevant, or just awful and overpoweringly distracting. The awful part consisted of a rather abstract vocal composition that should never have been 6 miles from a microphone, ever! While it was intruding on the shoot, I have no idea what the characters were doing / saying / thinking, and I'm unwilling to watch this (unedited) piece of work again to find out.",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Exceptionally well made movie.,"I thought this was an extremely well made movie.  Michael Mann is at the top of his form.  Russell Crowe has turned in an excellent portrayl of Jeffrey Wigand.  Christopher Plummer was so believable as Mike Wallace there were times I forgot it wasn't really him.  Al Pacino is always a joy to watch. He makes acting seem so simple and flawless.  The pace was slow but my interest was held throughout, and this type of story benefits from the slower pace.  The only discordant part for me was the music, but after a while I really didn't notice.  I recommend this movie highly for inteligent adult fare.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Wonderful acting,"This extremely tense drama shines an unflattering light on the tobacco industry. Because we're no longer living in the 1940s, it's no longer considered ""cool"" to smoke. Non-smoking ads run rampant, and rather than politely light a stranger's cigarette, it's much more socially acceptable to smack the offensive stick out of someone's hand and lecture them about their cancer risk. So, it's no wonder The Insider was very well received and nominated for seven Academy Awards. In fact, many believe Russell Crowe won his Oscar for Gladiator the following year as a ""make-up award"" for The Insider.Russell plays a former executive of a tobacco company, someone with inside knowledge about how terrible cigarettes are for their consumers. He's approached by tv producer Al Pacino to talk about an unrelated topic 60 Minutes (hosted by Mike Wallace, via Christopher Plummer), but when he figures out how spooked Russell is about saying the wrong thing, he knows there are secrets he's keeping. The acting is incredible from start to finish, so even though it's really dramatic and frightening at times, there's so much to appreciate from the actors and filmmakers. If 1999 passed you by and all you watched was Toy Story 2, it's time you grew up and saw The Insider.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
We Can Be Heroes,"By far and away Michael Mann's best film, with outstanding performances by Crowe, Pacino and Plummer.

Better than American Beauty!!!,"Over the past wekend, I decided to indulge myself in a movie marathon. IThe two movies which I had been eager to see were American Beauty and The Insider. After sitting through the unmerciful mess that was American Beauty, I wandered half dazed into the theatre across the ahll, thinking ""this movie cannot be any better"". How wrong I was. I was jolted from my seat for the whole 3 hours, mesmerised and dazzled by the best picture of the year. The dialogue crackled, the scenes wrenched my heart to the core and chemistry between Pacino, Plummer and Crowe delighted me to the very end. What could have been a very simple and mundane tale about a ""whistle-blower"", turned out to be the best 3 hours I have ever spent in a theatre.

"Game, Set, Match-Best movie of the year","Michael Mann has enamored me how one can go from the ultra cheesy Miami Vice to the big screen with movies like the very underated Manhunter, The Last of the Mohicans, The heart stopping Heat, and now the gutwrenching Insider.So accurate in portraying an even that can be considered a black eye for the Black Eye and corporate America.  I didn't want this movie to end, I wanted it to keep on going deeper and deeper into the lies that Corporate America has bestowed upon us in an effort to line their pockets and influence the youth of the future.  I'm not ready for a revolution yet, but I will say that if someone passes on this movie because they don't want to see Al Pacino just walk through another role is very wrong.  To me, he was Lowell Bergmann and not some Mafia kingpin, miscast football coach or even worse yet, the Devil.Would someone please tell me where Rip Torn was in this movie?  It's either I was so completely enamored wit the rest of the performances and I missed some clever make-up, but I didn't see him!Russell Crowe, has acheived a success now that will catpult him to the top of his profession.

Phenomenal,"A phenomenal movie which recounts the story of a whistleblower who worked for the tobacco industry. The tragedy of being a whistleblower is beautifully portrayed by the movie as it unfolds. It is hard to do the right thing in the world for the sake of others when big corporation interests get in the way. Anyone with a interest in seeing how two men stood up for justice in a world where your life and livelihood can be snuffed out in the blink of an eye, should watch this profoundly affecting movie. Needless to say, Al Pacino and Russel Crowe shine stellar, as do all the movie's supporting cast. The direction is brilliant, taking us gently into the private world of a family whose affluent and happy life is about to implode.. The pace of the movie is gentle enough to allow us to settle into the life of Russel Crowe and his family, and to share in the dread of anticipation as events begin to spiral out of control. A phenomenal and beautifully portrayed movie. One of the best and most worthwhile seeing. By the way, was Christopher Plummer ever anything other than Brilliant! What a huge loss he is to his industry.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
I was surprised - this is a really good movie,"Frankly, I would have never seen this movie if not for it receiving a Best Picture Oscar nomination.  Generally, I hate ""issue"" movies, even when I agree with the issue being presented; usually, such movies allow character motivation to take a back seat to social commentary and end up preaching at viewers.  Not true with The Insider.  Whereas screenwriters Eric Roth and Michael Mann could have spent all kinds of time complaining about the evils of Big Tobacco, they're much more interested in telling the stories of Lowell Bergman and Jeffrey Wigand.Well written, well directed, and well acted, The Insider has quality leads in Pacino and Crowe.  Also, as a person living in the South, I admire the film for not portraying Southerners as idiots, as many Hollywood films do. And I loved the unconventional soundtrack.If I had to find something to complain about in this film, it would be that I think Jeffrey Wigand fades a little too much into the background towards the end of the film; his reactions to events could have been detailed a little further.  And I don't think Mike Wallace would realistically be dumb enough to yell at one of Shiekh Fadlallah's bodyguards.  Still, The Insider is quality entertainment and worthy of its Academy Award nominations. 9/10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Paranoia beyond compare,"Russel Crowe plays Jeffrey Wiegand, a scientist working for a tobacco company.  Al Pacino plays Lowell Bergman producer of 60minutes (obviously a VERY YOUNG Lowell Bergman).  After Weigand is fired from his high position in the company he later meets up with Lowell to blow the roof off of Big Tobacco.Russel Crowe plays Weigand to PARANOID Perfection.  You get a real sense of how far outreaching the tobacco companies have by watching this film, as Weigand who's atempts to tell the truth, has people following him, threatning his family, and eventualy even threatned to be sent to jail.

"A Good, Intelligent Movie","This was an interesting movie.  It is enjoyable to watch a movie that respects the audience.  The characters are complex and flawed as you would expect in a portrayal of real people.  This movie is well-written and well-acted.There are a couple of things that detracted from the overall quality of the movie.  First, I thought the direction was annoying in a few scenes.  There were some handheld shots that were course and jittery.  This did not convey any emotional element of the movie to me, but was a mere distraction.  I also read in Brill's Content magazine about the factual errors in the movie. I understand the need for ""dramatic license"", but when portraying real events using real names of people who are still alive and still in the line of work portrayed in the movie, I would like to see the content held to a higher standard of accuracy.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Film that only Oscar forgot,"How this movie, the best film of 1999, got a grand total of 0 oscars will remain a mystery for a long time.First, the movie takes a story about an overweight whistle blower with family issues and melds it with tobacco & the world of deception, cancer, medical hu-do, and lawyers.  It does this and is watchable and interesting.Second, the acting is superb.  Crowe went all out preparing and doing the role and Pacino portrays his aspect very well.Three, Mann is the Jack of all trades.  He makes a short story/article into a nicely flowing and very long movie.  The tough subject matter (above) is intriging full of suspense (despite the fact that we know the general ending from the true history).  He then produces a good ad campaign (the poster is a classic pun of a cigarrete package. Finally, as director the entire package comes together.Despite the nominations and despite the performances, the film did not find a huge audience and it was the only one of the 1999 best-picture nominees not to gain massive revenue from its nomination.Possible reasons for this are that the film is really long (155 minutes) and the subject matter is complex.  Given this, long attention spans and an interested audience are needed.  Also, Mann may still have the TV type stigma from his Miami Vice Days (although he has since been connected to many other quality movies).  Maybe it was the writing, as it  was on a true event stigma (and therefore less work because an outline is theoretically established).  Perhaps, Crowe (being a relatively unknown) hurt awards. Another possibility is maybe people thought Mann hollywoodized history (like Hurricane and U-571); although I cannot see it.In the end, it did not separate itself from American Beauty as Best picture. While the two had differing audiences and vastly different material, both films were great stories with nice writing and good acting.Either way, The Insider is a great movie that should not be missed.  It is long, but every minute is important to the story.  It did not win a single oscar, but it was good enough to win all that it was nominated for.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
BEST ACTOR,"Although I enjoyed 'Heat', I've always felt it to be an overrated film. However, 'The Insider' is a great film, that I'm sure will stand the test of time.

I wanted Spacey to take the BEST ACTOR, but Crowe deserves it a lot more. A film with no sex, violence, action that will leave you gripped and hooked for every minute.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A dramatic illustration of the Manufacturing of Consent,"This is one of the finest films I've ever seen, and one of the most important of the year. It illustrates the cold bloodedly greedy ruthlessness of the tobacco industry and the dire implications of big media taking money as a priority over the truth.It's almost surreal, but all too creditble, to see a big corporation act like a thug, openly threatening people, using their own families as de facto hostages to get their silence.  However, that didn't surprise me considering I have read about these hoodlums' antics in at least one book called ""Merchants of Death"" which also illustrated the underhanded tactics of these jokers.   Also see them threatening to sue CBS for broadcasting the truth and the truth itself only makes the case worse is a bizarre echo of the famous Peter Zenger case. In the 17th century American colonies in which truth for a supposed libel printed by a newspaper publisher was not considered a defense back then and it took a brilliant lawyer representing Zenger to change that.  There are many things we have to deal with in our times, but refighting the Zenger case in the civil law sphere should not be one of them.However, what was even more ominous was the waffling of CBS News as they buckle to corporate pressure.  What you see in this film illustrate the very same tactics that major media critics like Noam Chomsky have noted that big media is prone to do.  For instance, the censoring of Mike Wallace's interview about being censored was excused on the basis on time constraints. This is what Chomsky has noted as the tactic of ""concision"" where time constraints are use to limit debate and discussion to make you have to speak only pat & bland statements because to say something really unexpected and new would simply too much time to explain between commercials.  In short, this film is an excellent companion to the film Manufacturing Consent: Noam Chomsky and the Media (1992).This film is a real eye opener and an absolute must to anyone who wants to know was both big business and big media are capable of doing.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Needs editing--A LOT!!!,"Yeah, it's well acted, yeah it's got an intelligent script but those two elements do NOT make a great movie.  This movie is a (needless) 2 hours and 35 minutes.

How this is getting good reviews is beyond me.  I saw it in a packed movie house.  When the film was over a lot of people came out complaining about the length and pointing out how half an hour could have been cut with NO loss to the story!

Michael Mann is responsible for my favorite movie of all time, ""Heat"", and there are some similarities in the ""poetic visual language"" that he has mastered fully.The performances are amazing, both Crowe and Pacino are immersed in their characters and make them so real and alive that one hardly thinks of them as actors in a movie.But what really makes this film excellent is the filming. It is beautiful, alive and vibrant. The images convey the sadness, fear, frustration and anger that the leads are experiencing. Fantastic. I can't wait for Mann's next masterpiece.By the way, the music one hears when Wigand discovers the agents in and around the house (that later reveals themselves as his bodyguards), and rushes towards his house is music from ""Heat"". In that movie, it is played when Shiherlis (Kilmer) drives away from his wife, presumably forever.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the year's best.,"The Insider is a terrific movie. The story is absolutely gripping and interesting. It runs a long 170 minutes, but stick through it and you'll be happy. It starts out slow and very vague, but it sets up for an explosive one hour climax that will have you on the edge of your seat.The performances really were this movie's strong side. Al Pacino gives his best performance since Glengarry Glen Ross. And Russell Crowe plays his part very well, giving a powerful performance, his character develops and unfolds very slowly in the story and he couldn't have done a better job on it.The first hour or so would give you the impression of a story with a simple, easy plot. But as you think the plot is about to take a rest and the movie will simmer down, it explodes in your face, you will be surprised at the way it turns into a movie more about the corruption of our justice system and the major flaw impossible to break. Rather than JUST a conspiracy on the verge of being exposed. Al Pacino's character changes dramatically as does Russell Crowe's. And both actors do an excellent job.Although it is loosely based on the truth, it runs unlike other true stories. Some movies try to grab the audience and to become surprised that this could actually be true, and only that. The Insider does that, as well as producing a fine piece of dramatic cinema. Go see it while you can, you won't be disappointed.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Wrong Message, Right Movie","The acting, directing, and writing in this film are superb. Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer especially do noteworthy jobs. The story is also told very well, and it avoids getting too preachy, which many of today's PC anti-whatever movies do. One thing which proves this movie's quality is the fact that I totally disagree with its underlying message and still found it very good. Anyone who smokes does it at their own risk and shouldn't whine when their lungs turn black and they have to breathe through a hole in their throat.

I just want to add my 1 Star review to the rest of them,"I just want to add my 1 Star review to the rest of them.I started this movie three different times on three different free sites because I couldn't believe whatever was going on in the beginning had anything to do with the movie, ""The Insider"" which was supposed to be about some kind of smoking problem.Instead, it was a boring ride through something to do with Hezbollah? That looked like a terrorist movie with credits listing a bunch of people I never heard of except for Rip Torn. It looked like a torture type situation in the Middle East, which was irritating and so stupid.Then I get the DVD and it turns out that was the start of the movie, which had no dialogue for eternity, and then it showed up in English with Russell Crowe walking and driving forever with no dialogue till he gets home where is daughter has some kind of an allergy attack or something.Seriously I just couldn't get past this garbage. When this happens, I go to IMDb and see if there's a lot of one star reviews saying basically ""don't watch it, boring, as could be, etc. And indeed there are.So I'm just here to say that I agree 100%.

Mann is a Master of the Character Film,"Upon seeing Russel Crowe's great performance in ""Gladiator,"" I decided to check out his Oscar-nominated role in ""Insider.""  While his performance was subtle and convincing and definitely worthy of a nomination, I was more taken aback by Mann's directorial style and his fine attention to characters.""The Insider"" is definitely not your standard thriller.  Events do not move the story along here as much as characters do.  Characters'internal conflicts, doubts, fears, and uncertainties are what drives and raises this film above the usual fare.It's Mann's novelisitc approach to the story that makes it such a refreshing change of pace.  He avoids almost all thriller cliches: there is no excessive profanity, no shootouts, no fistfights, no murders.  The result is a mesmerizing, totally involving, refreshing, and frighteningly realistic film.Russel Crowe's subtle, brooding, and humanistic portrayal of Dr. Wigand and the loss and forced change of his life and family bring a deep emotion to the film.  Wigand falling down a hill in his yard is one of the film's most unsettling scenes.  The rest of the ensemble cast also does well, but Crowe's haunting performance overshadows even veteran Al Pacino.Definitely not a conventional, over-the-top thriller, Mann's character tour-de-force is a welcome change to a genre that usually makes the viewer suspend belief.  ""Insider"" does not ask the viewer to believe the incredible; instead it makes the viewer understand the truth.9 out of 10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
An absolute magnificent movie - best I've seen in years,"This is an absolute magnificent movie, in fact probably the best I've seen in years. Pacino and the actor who plays Wegand are superb.

A superior thinking-person's drama,"A previous review on this site made a succinct, apt comment about this film: ""This movie is for people who like to think...."" I cannot sum up my impressions of this film better than that. ""The Insider"" treats the audience as if it is intelligent, never force-feeding us data. Those of you who prefer to turn off your brain when watching movies, do yourself a favor - rent this movie and realize what you have been missing all this time.Russell Crowe (excellent as Bud White in ""L.A. Confidential"") plays Jeffrey Wigand, a tobacco executive ousted from his job because he won't play ball. Without saying too much, he has an insider's story to tell - about how the tobacco companies manipulate nicotine to make it more addictive and how he knows the ""Seven Dwarves"" (Wigand's term for the executives of the main seven tobacco companies) lied in their testimony to Congress.Al Pacino's character, Lowell Bergman, is a producer for 60 Minutes who wants his show to be the public conduit for Wigand's information. The film chronicles how difficult it is to publicize this damaging information not just because of retaliation by the the tobacco companies but by CBS's unwillingness to stick it's neck out on a vital public health issue.Crowe is marvelous - he effectively conveys the emotions of a tormented man, yet he never becomes a characture. Wigand is intelligent and wants to protect his family, and that never changes despite the odds. Al Pacino is excellent as usual - he convincingly portrays Bergman's dogmatic pursuit of truth and his high standard of never leaving a source hanging out to dry. The suspension of disbelief took over quickly for me. Early on, I stopped looking at Pacino and Crowe as Pacino and Crowe - they were Bergman and Wigand to me.This film affected me much in the same way ""Quiz Show"" did. Both films are in ways about ""the end of innocence"" by selling out principles to the almighty dollar. One convicting scene involves Bergman battling CBS legal department over the story. The gist of the lawyer's position is simply this: the more truth you tell, the more liable CBS is. If that's not twisted, I don't know what is.This movie should get you thinking about a variety of issues: what is a corporation's responsibility to the public well-being? Does corporate ownership of the media compromise what is reported? Is it worth all the personal sacrifices to make certain information public? If you're not thinking about larger issues after watching this film, you simply weren't paying attention.My rating: 9 out of a possible 10",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A very interesting and well paced drama,"I was looking forward to this latest release by the man Michael Mann, as his past efforts include ""Heat"" & ""Last of the Mohicans"", both of which I own on DVD.The Insider just shows how a movie can be made to grip you without the need for action sequences. All actors in the film excel themselves as portraying the characters essential to the story in particular the mighty Pacino as the investigative journalist and Crowe as the insider, looking to uplift the guilt of working in America's tobacco industry.If you are looking for a movie in which you have to think with the movie as it progresses through its twists and turns, then this is one hell of a show. If however you are expecting action sequences then forget it, as the only bit of action is Crowe rolling down the lawn in front of his house!!!Essential viewing if you are a Pacino fan, and not to be missed as a film on the whole.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

Here you see real people struggling for what they believe is right,"I've just  seen this movie and I found it absolutely great. Basically what I like about the movie is that you see several people who are all trying to live according to their own basic values, and those values tend to clash every now and then.It starts with the character Wigand who, having worked in the health-care industry now accepts a job with a tobacco company because of the high salary they pay. He then finds out that no matter the salary, he can not live with the consequences of his work. Upon protesting to the nature of his work, he is fired.At one point, his wife leaves him, with the motivation: ""I really want to support you, but I can not take this kind of life"" In other words, she wants to support her husband, but finds that she is not able to muster the strength needed to full fill her wish.When Al Pacino hears that his interview is not to be broadcasted because of the risk to CBS, one of his colleagues who has a financial stake in CBS says ""Are you accusing me of being influenced by the money"". Where upon Pacino answers with sarcasm ""No I'm not accusing you, you are a volunteer, you work for free just like me. Of course you are influenced by the money!""Time and time again you see these scenes where you can understand the motivation of all the characters involved and you can also understand that every one of them is trying to do the good thing, even though they vehemently disagree about what ""the good thing"" would be.Whereas I can understand that this movie leaves you in a depressed state of mind because it shows you how very far the power of large cooperations actually goes, it can also give you a boost.

Mann at his most potent,"I've been long overdue for a rewatch of The Insider, given Michael Mann's recent postings about it on his socials, they couldn't have been a better excuse. A sobering examination of corruption, courage, cowardice, and the sometimes catastrophic costs of telling the truth it's Mann's least physically violent film yet feels no less ferocious. Revelling in Mann's unparalleled ability to fashion taut suspense from unpromising material with its issues of corporate ownership interfering with respected news media resonating almost identically today as they did when it was first released. It's Heat, hushed. Turning a moral issue into riveting suspense and infusing wit into a film that easily could have been unbearably pretentious, Mann makes the mundane exciting, with his trademark blue/dark backlighting, hyper-kinetic editing and a haunting techno score, skillfully making every shot and every note of the soundtrack help shape the story. Not only is Mann's directing inventive yet down to earth, but the performances by the cast are truly excellent, ones that command attention, primarily the emotional relationship between Russell Crowe, as the conflicted Wigand, and Al Pacino, as the tenacious Bergman. With its masterful acting, strafing wit and dramatic provocation, The Insider offers Mann at his best... blood up, unsanitized, and unbowed, one with the power to absorb, entertain and anger.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A Very Good Ensemble Of Pacino And Crow,"The Insider is a very serious film; it has none of typical Hollywood sweet sentiments. Instead, it offers us a very deep insight into the modern-day problem  a struggle between an individual and a multi-national tobacco corporation. All the means is good here  bribery, libel, lies and blackmail. But the main hero, here played by Russell Crow, is undaunted, and despite the threats and loss of a family, he goes on. Another main character, here performed by always impeccable Al Pacino, is a hot-tempered CBS journalist, who is not afraid either of some mighty Lebanese Mullah or not less mighty tobacco moguls. He also goes on and he wins. The happy end here is not a false, sugary sweet melodrama type of end. Nay, since the whole plot is based on a real story, the director Mike Mann made it as it was. Yes, the happy ending, but after so much sufferings and losses. What is good, the movie does not thrive on blood or violence. What is a bit rude and even shocking, all the heroes use too much of the F-word. The cameo appearances of Gina Gershon and Stephen Tobolowsky are also a nice surprise and they add some certain spice to the plot. In general, if you like deep, mature, serious dramas about every day life and such like, watch that! Mind some foul language, though.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Al Pacino gave a commanding performance,"I remember barking at the tv when all those CEO's of the tobacco companies lied. I remember watching tv and seeing Dr. Wigand on Sixty Minutes and I thought to myself ""What a courageous man!"". When I heard about""The Insider"" I said to myself you have got to see that film. I did just that today. This is not your typical movie showing the latest in computer graphics so it will not appeal to everyone. For those who enjoy a behind the scenes look at events that have occurred in real life then check it out.I really feel that things are far more evil than even this film intimates. I do hope that lawyers can be tried for war crimes against humanity. Gina Gershon played one superbly and she was supposed to be one of the good guys. Dr. Wigand put everything on the line to do the right thing. What gets me in this insane world is that the whistle blowers are given no protection at all. They are expected to do the right thing and then take it in the ear. And guys like Sammy ""The Bull"" Gravano who has admitted to killing 30 plus people in cold blood gets witness protection, plastic surgery and the right to keep his ill gotten gains. Where the hell is protection for the whistle blowers that are trying to protect us from greedy, amoral and thorughly ruthless b****rds that run corporate America and multi-national corporations. Logic would dictate that we help out the whistle blowers. Luckily for Dr. Wigand things worked out sort of. Unhappily for us the tobacco industry seems to be stronger than ever. This film is really important for the outstanding commanding powerful performance of Al Pacino. If for no other reason Al Pacino's character in this movie stands for a person who is as good as his word. He in short has integrity in a world that has lost even the knowledge of what that word ever meant. If you are discouraged by the state of things then go see this movie because there are still a few good people out there.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

This film is a masterpiece,"I have only seen Michael Mann's three most recent films:  ""The Last of the Mohicans,"" ""Heat,"" and this one.  He has improved with each.  ""Heat"" was also an excellent film, but Mann improves on the grade A quality of even ""Heat.""  I was blown away by ""The Insider.""  I decided I had to see it when I realized it was another Michael Mann epic, and especially at the presence of Al Pacino.  Now, while Pacino gives yet another chill-worthy performance, Russel Crowe is the real gem in this film.  I am not sure that I have seen such a layered portrayal of a human's absolute despair since Robert DeNiro's Travis Bickle in ""Taxi Driver.""  The acting alone makes this film worthwhile as does the pathos of Crowe's character.  Now add the brilliant rapid-fire dialogue and you already have a masterpiece.  This does not even include the cinematography:  which ranks right up there ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""2001..."" for some of the best of all-time.  I have read statements that the film takes itself too seriously and borders on self-righteousness.  Not so. This is a crucial morality tale that explores the importance of not selling-out and doing ""the right thing.""  These characters are far from self-righteous.  They are not even sure they believe in their cause. Please see this film.  This is an example of why movies are made.  By the way, don't avoid the film simply because you smoke; the scope is much larger than just tobacco.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great Film, would have been a classic if half an hour shorter","The film is very good. It's been said before but its closest rival is all the president's men. The reason that president's is a classic is that it is more tightly edited. Half an hour of screen time isn't needed.

a bit of a disappointment,"Because the subject of ""The Insider"" appealed to me, and because I like Michael Mann's work (Heat, Last of the Mohicans, Manhunter), I decided to go and see it, even though I felt slightly tired and I knew the running time was 2½ hours. Well, the start of the movie (let's say, the first half an hour)was quite good. And of course, Russell Crowe (who I loved in the Australian film 'Proof') and Al Pacino are good actors. But the film went on forever, everything was so elaborate it just became tedious and overdone; it just didn't manage to reach the point that the viewer became really 'captured' and involved in what was happening on-screen. The occasional witty remarks of good old Al Capone (as I like to call him as an hommage for all his gangsta' rolls) were a relief, but after some time even this became a bit of a bore. He tried too hard to be a clown, it seemed, and it didn't really fit in the basically serious story. It wasn't just as tedious as another Capone film, 'City Hall', which also dealt with corruption on high political levels, but it came quite close. 5 out of 10, I'm sorry, Mr. Mann. Incredible that the IMDB users voted an average of 8.4...But: ""de gustibus non est disputandum"".",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Crowe and Mann were robbed....,"This compared to American Beauty-this is to my thinking a better film, a decent portrayal of a real-life drama that we saw unfold on TV, in the press and on radio. What Mann, Pacino and Crowe have done is give us some of the more kinetic scenes and performances in the past 20 years or so. Terrific stuff at times.I had a few problems with the Insider, mostly in that they try to cram in too much without enough time devoted to them.Gina Gershon and Debi Mazar resemble each other enough so that I hadda really pay attention to tell who was who, and what it was Debi's character did. She has hardly any lines despite being in many scenes. Diane Verona as the long suffering Wife of Wigand isn't really developed into a three dimensional character, and I agree-when she leaves Crowe, we don't feel it as much as we ought.Hall and Plummer also resemble one another enough so that I found myself thinking-THAT is Hewitt, THIS is Wallace, more than once.And there were a few scenes that did not fit-notably the 'FBI/Geologists in the restaurant' scene. I had no idea what 'arrest' they were talking about, or where this was in relation to the whole tobacco case until they wedged in the Unibomber stuff at the end. Maybe they coulda done without that entirely? I think so.But overall-the acting, the pacing, the feel for what these people went through, I found to be genuine, true, heartfelt, very well done. Crowe at times kept on looking like a guy who was my age(more or less) with white hair, but I still think he deserved an Oscar.Overall, a really goof film, and to my thinking, BETTER than American Beauty.***1/2 outta ****.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure.,"Sitting in a lush New York restaurant, Liane Wigand (Diane Venora) gets up and leaves the table in a reserved fit of anger after learning that her husband, Jeffrey (Russell Crowe) is going to record a taping the next day for 60 Minutes where he plans to expose the tobacco industry and their web of lies the next day. After she storms off, Jeffrey whom admittedly has a bit of a drinking problem, quietly stands up and marches over to the bar. Remaining at the table, the show's host Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) gleefully stares across at his producer, Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and asks with a grin on his face ""Who are these people?"" Lowell's answer perfectly describes what Michael Mann's visceral, subtle thriller is all about. In one sentence, he summarizes the entire plot and in that shows the genius of how Michael Mann could take something so minimal and make it so extraordinary. Lowell quickly answers ""Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure, Mike.""The Insider focuses primarily on Jeffrey and Lowell, two characters who start in very different places and collide to eventually make drastic changes in each other's lives and the fate of our nation as a whole and it's stand on the tobacco industry. The film opens with Lowell in Israel, blindfolded being taken to a meeting with a reported terrorist whom he convinces to conduct an interview with Mike Wallace for the show. Across the globe in Louisville, Kentucky we are introduced to Jeffrey Wigand as he's walking away from his office for the last time after being fired for what his employer called ""communication problems"" but he knows that it was because he was no longer comfortable with what they were doing; lying to the public in order to get them to continue to buy their products while being completely unaware of the consequences. He watched the Seven Dwarfs (the seven CEOs of Big Tobacco) lie under oath, saying that nicotine wasn't addictive, and he was no longer comfortable with it so they let him go and made him sign a confidentiality agreement not to disclose any knowledge he gained while working for Brown & Williamson. Jeffrey had every intention to go home, find a new job and honor this agreement with no exception.As is generally the case with Mann, he quickly (but thoroughly) introduces us to the main characters without wasting half of the running time just to give us the basic background of the characters like the majority of films inevitably do. Mann has a gift for showing us one scene for each main character (in this case, the two leading men) that allows us to understand their entire personality and leaves the vast majority of screen time for the actual story to present itself instead of spending so much time on introducing the characters that the story is left to be bunched together in a flimsy package in the last half hour. After the strong introductions to the characters, we see a typical morning for Lowell Bergman. On the phone every second with his wife answering the other calls, he barely says goodbye to his two children as the eldest informs him that there's a package on the porch for him. When he finally gets around to opening this anonymous delivery and realizes that he's going to need a consultant in order to translate the documents into words he can understand. Through a network of communications, he's connected with Jeffrey Wigand who agrees to help him but refuses to do anything that would breach his confidentiality agreement.That is, until Brown & Williamson make a grave mistake. After hearing that Jeffrey has spoken with Lowell, they bring him back in and ask him to sign another agreement that ""more thoroughly defines what confidential is"". After some poorly chosen words by the company's CEO Thomas Sandefur (Michael Gambon), Wigand becomes infuriated and gets the impression that the company is threatening not only his life but also the life of his family. He doesn't sign the paper, storms out of the office and immediately calls Lowell, thus embarking them on the journey that will vastly change both of their lives. Wigand goes through an emotional roller-coaster in order to do what he knows is the right thing by exposing Big Tobacco for the frauds that they are. His family is threatened and eventually leaves him, his paranoia reaches several breaking points and his life is ultimately destroyed by his decision to come forward; through all of this, he still firmly believes that it's worth it. He becomes a martyr in order to expose the lies of Big Tobacco, and Lowell guides him through this crusade. Through Lowell we are given an inside look into the new industry and we see very raised emotions that explode, Network-esquire, including one particularly stunning scene where Mike Wallace scolds ""corporate lackey"" Helen Caperelli (Gina Gershon) for cutting the guts out of a controversial statement he made.Just like Network, The Insider's sensational story of corruption and the web of the media is hinged on numerous brilliant performances. Russell Crowe gives possibly the finest performance of the entire decade. His subtle portrayal of Wigand's paranoia and indecisiveness is stunning, but what's even more brilliant is the actor's ability to display all of the bottled up rage and fear that Wigand had bound up inside of him. The few scenes where these emotions explode are some of the most emotionally draining experiences I've ever witnessed on film. Though Crowe is definitely the shining point of the acting ensemble, the rest of the cast also excels (primarily Al Pacino, Christopher Plummer and Diane Venora). Mann's direction is truly ingenious, as it always is. His style is beautifully unique and smooth and he manages to create a visceral, highly engaging film unlike any I've ever seen. In the end, The Insider is an impeccable character study of ""ordinary people under extraordinary pressure"".",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Respect this man,"I saw this film on television on April 11, 2003. Right after the US-invasion in Bagdad. Right after the US-ambassador in Brussels told the press that he didn't like how Belgian media commented on the US-operation in Iraq. The Insider is about pressure on the press by big international concerns (in this case the tobacco industry). Since the Bush-administration in the USA took over, the interests of industry and government overlap. How free can the press be when this happens? Not all journalists are as brave as Lowell Bergman. Some Americans should read about the evil propaganda methods of Goebels (remember?). And Michael Mann has still a lot of shooting to do to make clear that the freedom of the press is essential in democracy, as important as opposition in Congress, as important as the voice and the clearvoyance of Mr Michael Mann himself.

"Power corrupts, Absolute power corrupts absolutely","If there ever was a blueprint for social corruption, the practices and belief systems of the tobacco industry are the quintessential finished product.  If there ever was an argument against large corporations owning the media, this is one of the best.  If anyone doesn't believe that the boardroom's of corporate America don't operate like this, they more than likely bet on professional wrestling matches too. Cigarettes are a delivery device for nicotine.  Does it have to be said any clearer?  And yet, we spend millions of public dollars to subsidize this industry, even after the industry admits it lied for years about its knowledge of the effects of smoking. In the future will the producer stand by his principles and be lucky enough to get the truth told or will we continue to live in ignorance of potential danger from products, people and organizations, because of the threat of lawsuits? This film should be mandatory viewing in every junior high school.  It should stimulate debate with our young people regarding lessons in health practices, economics, politics and ethics.  They will watch with interest because this is pretty well made movie.  Russel Crowe performance is outstanding in a group of excellent actors. The script is fairly solid. Although, I think I got a little bit confused toward the end of the film on where Bergman was and what it had to do with the plot.  However, this flaw didn't dull the impact of this highly tense and horrific slice of Jeffrey Wegand's life. It will not however show our junior high school audience good film technique.

Fascinating and Frustrating 9/10,"A really great movie. This is a true story!You really see how messed up the law-system is. If you have the money you can do everything. It's not so shocking that ""nicotin is addictive"". That's something I knew for a long time, but it's shocking what the tobacco companies go thru to protect that knowledge from being made official. It's frustrating to see that the truth (at first) doesn't seem to be valuable enough.Here in Austria we also had a big dispute a few years back. Every cigarette pack contained the wording ""cigaretttes MAY cause health problems"". It took a long time and a lot of litigation to get that ""may"" out of the sentence, because cigarettes are dangerous. After this movie, reconsider smoking or even investing in cigarette-related companies.Go see this movie, for not only is the story good, but also the acting is truly phenomenal.

Based on the true story about secrets of the tobacco industry,"""The Insider"" is based on the true story of Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former tobacco industry executive turned whistleblower, and Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a producer for the news program ""60 Minutes."" When Wigand decides to reveal the harmful secrets of the tobacco industry, Bergman sees an opportunity to expose the truth.However, the journey is fraught with challenges, as both men face threats, legal battles, and personal sacrifices that test their convictions and their loyalty to their principles.Pacino captures Bergman's determination, intelligence, and unwavering commitment to the truth. His performance is marked by subtle nuances and a quiet intensity that adds depth to the.Crowe's transformation into the complex and tormented whistleblower is nothing short of remarkable. He captures Wigand's internal conflict, vulnerability, and the immense pressure he faces as he becomes a key player in exposing the truth.""The Insider"" addresses issues that remain relevant in contemporary society, such as the influence of corporations on public health and the media's role in disseminating information. The film's themes continue to resonate, making it a timely exploration of power, truth, and accountability.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

Fine actors in a drawn out film .....,"Questionable would not be a strong enough word for the editing of this. The compelling story of ""big tobacco"" intimidating a ""whistle blower"" is drawn out to monumental proportions. I definitely felt like the film was going round and round with little forward motion. At least 30 minutes on the cutting room floor would have been most welcome. I am suggesting that the ""big name cast"" was simply being put on display for as long as possible and let the chips fall where they may. Christopher Plummer comes out the best as Mike Wallace, because his screen time is limited. On the other hand Al Pacino and Russell Crowe seem over exposed to the point of weariness, and I definitely felt that less would have been best. - MERK",5.0,Anonymous,Biography
Revealing the Truth....Nazis of the New Millennium....,"A distinguished professional film reviewer from Chicago says this movie was more impressive than ""All the Presidents Men"" as Watergate did not kill his parents but cigarettes did. This picture is a damning indictment of corporate crime perpetrated on us all... revealing how vested business interests control, determine and decide our lives. A company cigarette executive for whatever motive knows that the ""seven dwarfs""(CEO'S) of the cigarette industry lied about knowing the true effects of smoking and that chemicals are purposely added to cigarettes to cause addiction. The human cost of revealing ""the truth"" is graphically illustrated in this brilliant movie, which is superb in every way. The main tenets in this film are true and begs the question how on earth can these drug traffickers(disquised as executives)not only get away with but prosper in their deliberate deceit and intent to harm and kill us all?? The film also importantly shows how these criminals attempt to censure the media from telling the truth. I am one of the millions of victims of cigarette addiction and this film makes it obvious to me that the scale of legalised drug trafficking in this film makes the perpetrators far worse than the Nazi's ever were.That begs the question however why do Governments allow the sale of cigarettes?? My own research knowledge reveals that from now to the year 2025 the equivalent of a shipload of Titanic passengers will die every 7 minutes from the effects of cigarette smoking. This is a ""must see"" film ..... for cigarette addicts and everyone......it is 2 hours plus of intense and compelling drama....horrifyingly based on the truth.....10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

More than a modern All the President's Men,"The sense of scandal and coverup is in the air of this film, just like the political thrillers of the 1970s. I was truly impressed at the amount of drama and suspense that was packed into this story, even though some of it is fictional. The performances are outstanding, too. Everyone is singing praises for Russell Crowe, and with good reason. The ones that really blew me away, though, were Al Pacino and Christopher Plummer. Director Michael Mann also snuck some clever camera work and beautiful photography in. The only problem I had with the film was that some of the camera work was unprofessionally shaky.

One Legend and one up and coming actor come together.,"Russell Crowe is fast gaining a great reputation as one of the top hollywood actors and his performance in THE INSIDER does nothing to dispell this. Al Pacino stars as a producer on CBS's 60 Minutes who tries to get a top executive who has just been fired from a tobbaco company to come clean on their dirty tricks which get the public hooked on the nicotene in tobbaco. Pacino , for the first time, comes up against his own bosses who are frightened about losing billions through litigation from the tobbaco company. This film is 2 and a half hours long and not for one minute did i get bored , it is totaly inthralling and more than anything it is an insight into what can and has gone on in the news reporting business.On the cover of the DVD it says""The Insider will thrill you with its unbelivable twists and turns"". i'm not sure what they are talking about there because this is hardly the sixth sense but The Insider is still a great movie. 8 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

In fact, it is probably the best film about the news industry I have seen, but it is unfortunately very slow going at parts, especially towards the beginning.  Several scenes at the beginning of the film are completely unnecessary, and the film could have been a 10 if about 20 minutes of unneeded footage was deleted.

"Gripping, Disturbing","Not that it's any big surprise that corporate interests supercede reporting/news on the boob tube, The Insider still chillingly portrays the plight of Jeffrey Wigand, ex tobacco company scientist, on his whistleblowers journey with the 60 Minutes TV Newsmagazine.  This movie had me on edge the whole way.  Outstanding performances, especially from Christopher Plummer.  His turn on Mike Wallace is unforgettable. This Actor is IN THE ZONE!  Al Pacino makes it look eeeeaaasy, and Russell Crowe transcends his dialect struggles (he goes with a mishmash of ""American"" dialect, and at times I found it a little distracting), but he scores with his understated Pressure Cooker character development. The screenplay and writing is wonderful, as are many supporting roles.  If you haven't seen this one, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The real tragedy...,"The real tragedy is that this movie changes nothing.  This is a monumental film about a subject that affects our daily life...but is it really going to make a difference?  Not a chance.  The tobacco companies sit back and laugh. The much-delayed revelation that cigarettes are bad for you has turned into a huge boon for manufacturers.  They have built whole advertising campaigns, aimed solely at the teenage market, built around the fact that cigarettes are 'bad', and therefore teenagers want it.  Then they simply reinforce the fact that cigarettes are addictive, and virtually impossible to quit.  With that message in your head, the impression that you are going to fail before you even start, it is small wonder that only a small percentage of those who 'quit' can stay away from these things.The government, of course, plays along, even taking handouts in the form of 'lawsuits' which they make token efforts to dispute, then settle out of court for assurances of protection from further lawsuits..a.k.a. bribe money.  The only truly responsible thing to do is ban cigarettes altogether, but you and I both know that will not happen.  Why?  Because cigarette sales contribute millions to our economy, and, more importantly, billions to all of the major political parties.  So the government makes sure everyone knows cigarettes are 'bad', and noone does anything about it.And THAT is the real tragedy.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Simply Wonderful,"Just been to see The Insider and Words do indeed Fail.I think the plot isn't as good as Heat, but the direction is probably better. And the soundtrack is even more amazing! It may not feature the line ""risk versus reward, baby"", but it still rocks majorly.Pacino is actually quite brilliant, Russell Crowe is good, the other people are cool, and Diane 'oh look she's in Heat too' Venora is ok. There's a great cameo by Gina Gershon looking horny as ever, and lots of fab southern accents.But the whole thing is classic 'the same guy who did Miami Vice'.  It's like he's conscious of it being a bit of a dull story, so he decides to just make it really watchable and an incredible audio-visual experience. There's a bit near the start where they are having a conversation by sending each other faxes that is soooooo M Mann! And the scene where Crowe arrives at the court to give his testimony (which is your bog standard Lot's Of Journalists Standing Outside and People Saying 'No Comment') is simply magical.At 157mins, it's a bit short though (seriously!); it's even a bit rushed at the start, although he manages to dwell wonderfully on the stuff near the end.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
How to make an action film with no action,"This was undoubtedly the movie that Russell Crowe won the Academy Award for, since the Academy invariably hands the little oscar out for the wrong movie in the wrong part of someone's career.  (Not that Crowe's performance in ""Gladiator"" wasn't life changing for many - ahem - but ""The Insider"" was where he truly ACTED his socks off and then some.  And all power to the Academy for being only ONE year late; most actors wait till their twilight years to get their hands on the deserved statuette).It's a sublime piece of work from Mann, as his fans have come to expect - thoughtful, driven by well-written characters, intelligent scripting and wonderful direction.  But of course much of this story comes from the real-life inspiration of Mr Wigand and the 60 Minutes coverage of his whistle-blowing activities on the tobacco industry.  It is also a fantastic demonstration of how to make an action movie with NO action.  Well, not in the Jerry Bruckheimer sense of the word.  For man the action is all in the characters and the beautiful way that Pacino, Crowe and Plummer especially draw you in to their inner worlds.  For some, latter-day Pacino is just too much like prime ham - but here just give the movie a couple of viewings and you'll realise how well he acts.  It's a wonderful turn and utterly appropriate for a TV producer.If you want to see a gripping movie this might not be where you would instinctively turn, but trust me - just for the scenes on the golf course, and when Wigand is on the stand about to give his deposition (I climbed the sofa the tension was so immense!) - this film can provide excellent and stimulating 'action'.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography

The man is great in absolutely anything he does; I don't give a rotten rat's butt what anyone says about him being tired or frequently overacting, that's all a load of hooey. Anyway, I was pleasantly surprised to see Crowe take the brunt of the acting and really run with it. He was superb in this film and deserved the ocsar for best actor this year (sorry Spacey...you were good, but not that good). Pacino and Christopher Plummer both added to the mix as volatile elements in a taut and well-directed film by a truly great filmmaker who has lots more chances to shine - Michael Mann (Heat and Last Of The Mohicans are two of the best films of the decade).

Great surprise,"After Heat, I was a little worried that Mann wouldn't be able to present the same level of character, intensity and drama on what would seem to be a ""boring"" subject matter. How wrong was I.Russell Crowe and Al Pacino both give outstanding performances. Crowe is one of the most talented ""new"" actors around. See L.A. Confidential for proof.Mann's use of intense lighting, close-ups and wide landscape shots to establish atmosphere are more refined than in Heat. While most directors either ignore the environment and how it relates to the story or characters, or use it as eye candy, Mann understands the importance of atmosphere. Music, photography, lighting, all can say more in a single scene than most directors can get across in a whole movie.I have to respectfully disagree with Gooch-4 about the lack of focus of the film. The story is about ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances. Wigand is the ordinary person thrust into the center of the maelstrom. We need to see Bergman's fight and the corporate happenings to understand the full extent of Wigand's struggle. As to the ""why,"" it seems fairly obvious that Wigand simply set out to do the right thing.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Gritty, intense and full of nervous tension and suspense.","""The Insider"" is an intense, almost painful, movie to watch, due to the angst, fear and personal turmoil imparted by actor Russell Crowe.  Crowe is a master of his craft, and succeeds in making us feel at least a little of the agony Jeffrey Wigand must have felt during his whistleblower ordeal, although I am sure there are few who could truly understand what he went through. If you can stand movies that are thought-provoking, tension-building, and mysterious rather than action oriented, this movie is worth watching. Al Pacino is better in this film than he has been in a long time.  This is the true Pacino, for admirers of his work.  He does not overplay this role, yet succeeds in letting us see passion and loyalty. Even though this movie is not billed as a thriller, it has the same intensity and nervous tension, and keeps you on the edge, as if you are constantly waiting for the bogeyman to jump out of the screen and grab you.

The best film of 1999!!!,"Leave it to Michael Mann to direct a epic story about a modern tale of David versus Goliath.  Except this story has two David's and two Goliath's.  Yet, the center of the story is the risks and trouble it takes for one to expose the truth. The first David is Jeffrey Wigand (Rusell Crowe), a former tobacco scientist who was fired for ""poor communication skills."" But Jeffrey was really fired for questioning his bosses at the tobacco company about putting a addictive chemical into cigarettes to increase sales.  It isn't until Jeffrey's and his family's life are threaten that he wants to go to the press and expose the truth. Enter the second David, ""60 MINUTES"" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino).  Lowell thinks that this could be the biggest story of the decade.  And Lowell and his friend/reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) to run a cover story on what Jeffrey has to say.  But airing a story this big, won't be easy. Now comes the first Goliath, the CBS executives and attorney's.  They feel that airing this story will cause a major lawsuit on CBS, and destroy the business deal of Westinghouse's purchase of the network.  And if Westinghouse doesn't buy CBS, the executives will lose a lot of money. The other Goliath is the big tobacco company.  If Jeffrey testify against his former employer's his health benefits will be taken away, and Jeffrey needs it since one of his daughters suffers from asthma. This is quite a story, and Michael Mann does a brilliant job of bringing it to the screen.  Mann has done a excellent job in the past of showing true to life crime stories: THIEF& MANHUNTER.  A violent, yet historical adaptation of THE LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  And his biggest and best work yet about a Los Angeles epic crime story, HEAT.  THE INSIDER isn't as good as HEAT, but it does come pretty darn close.  It's the kind of film that goes by quicker and it's more enjoyable every time you watch it.     The acting is top notch as well.  There's a strong supporting cast including: Christopher Plummer, Phillip Baker Hall, Michael Gambon, Diane Verona, Lindsay Crouse, Debbi Mazar, and Bruce McGill.  But the two leads, Pacino and Crowe, definitly stand out for their acting.  Pacino does a excellent job as the network producer who is suffering from trying to get the truth exposed, but is being pushed back from doing that. And Crowe is also excellent as the informer who is looking over his shoulder as he's fearing for his life. What's also great about this film is the excellent cinematography by Dante Spinotti.  Spinotti has done a great job in the past with HEAT and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, but in THE INSIDER, he displays his best work yet!  Some of the scenes just need to be seen to see how great of a job Spinotti does. And the music score is also wonderful.  It really adds to the suspense and tension that this story brings. That is why I LOVED, THE INSIDER so much.  There is so much to love about it.  Like many other films that try to make a point with it's story, THE INSIDER does it so well.  And Michael Mann not only does it well, but with style.  I will be very disappointed if this film, the actors, and cinematographer don't get recognized in Febuary for the Oscars.  This film well deserves it!  A outstanding, not to be missed classic! ***** (out of five)",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

The Best Film of the Year,"""The Insider"" is the best film of 1999. (""Fight Club ""comes close, though) Michael Mann's direction is in your face, and he develops the story perfectly. He succeds in making both of the two main leads very real and complete characters, which can be very difficult, especially since he also brought out strong performances with the supporting cast (Especially Christopher Plummer). The cinematography is excellent, and Pacino and Crowe should be nominated for their performances. (Which I assure you, they will be) Even though the film is basically all talk, it never loses your attention. (The cinematography has alot to do with that) The film runs close to three hours long and you feel it, but I think it was entirely necessary in order for you to get the feel for what the characters were going through. Mann and Pacino maintain the same great chemistry that they had in 1995's ""Heat.""

A small role, but well done.  Was she really like that? So why did he stay with her?I wonder how factual the scenes about Mike Wallace (6o minutes host) were We see him give in to the cover up, but when one of his TV editorials is edited down he loses it and again supports the struggle to get the truth out.Similarly, the TV station looks bad trying to cover up in the cause of money.It's a shame that we, as the human race, have such little integrity.",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
Al Pacino is the real John Wayne...,"Or the Ronnie Reagan of the left. I mean this in both the positive sense that he is a cultural hero, and in the negative sense that he is a celluloid hero. I have seen so many Al Pacino movies that I feel not only that I know him, but that he is actually a character from my own life. I like him here as Lowell Bergman, a radical ex-Ramparts Magazine editor grown into middle age but still fighting the good fight from within the establishment of CBS and 60 Minutes. His hair still flies about, showing that he is a free soul who cares more about substance than appearance. (We realize that the dye job is a necessary concession to the media world in which he lives.) And the passion still burns bright in his dark eyes, and he's still as wiry as a teenager.But is this history? Is this the truth about what happened with Jeffrey Wigand, big tobacco and CBS? Or this 'revisionist history' dressed up dramatically to make the good guys look good and the bad guys look bad? I wish I could say this is how big time journalism really works, and that we have been afforded a true view inside the system. But it's hard to tell where the truth leaves off and dramatic license takes over. We learned in journalism long ago that there is no real objectivity; that all is to some extent interpretive. In fact I recall a college text we used in the sixties with the (then) arresting title, 'Interpretive Journalism.' Today's text might be called 'Subjective Journalism' and tomorrow's 'The Age of Tabloid Journalism.'Nonetheless, this is a very good movie. The script by Michael Mann and Eric Roth sparkles with the immediacy of today's headlines, and Mann's direction is clean, crisp and dramatically very sharp. Russell Crowe as Wigand, the biochemist who blew the whistle on big tobacco and lost his wife and children to divorce in the process, is excellent. His subtle and restrained interpretation of Wigand reminds me so much of those guys from my generation who opted for the security of the corporate structure, only in his case the misgivings got to him. Diane Venova is chilling in a small role as his wife, a house and home centered woman who leaves him because she doesn't think it's fair to subject her and the children to the dangers and financial uncertainties of his whistle-blowing activities. Wigand is the reluctant hero and she is the woman who did not stand by her man.Christopher Plummer does a good job of playing 60 Minutes's Mike Wallace, who gets plenty of egg on his face here. He looks pathetic in the scene where he talks about what he will be remembered for. I'm sure Wallace is mad as hell about the portrayal, but I don't think anybody is going to sue the producers of this movie, since it is so popular and so much in tune with what most of us believe to be true. Gina Gershon appears briefly as a greedy bottom line lawyer who cares nothing about journalism or the ethics of journalism.John Wayne fought the enemies of our culture on celluloid with true grit and an unwavering, if sometimes moronic, sense of what's right. Al Pacino does the same here, except our enemies have changed and what's right isn't so clear anymore and the war room has become the board room. The really melancholy thing is I guess I wanted to believe in John Wayne when I was a kid, and now as a middle aged man, I want to believe in Al Pacino and 60 Minutes. This movie helps.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Skills that Fine Actors Have,"I watched the original 60-Minutes airing of Wigand's interview. The astonishing thing about the movie is that Russell Crowe is more believable as Wigand than Wigand. He is more believable as someone who could be a biochemist, more believable as someone who could win a teacher-of-the-year award, and more believable as a whistleblower!Why did Michael Mann allow Michael Moore to play himself in 'The Insider'? Even though he is playing himself, he is not believable as the character in the movie. The part is quite small, but this ""casting"" certainly reveals, by contrast, the skills that fine actors have.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Master Force... The Insider!!,"I usually don't write reviews, very rarely do. But whenever i do, its for a pretty good reason, i'll be really impressed by the movie. The Insider definitely falls into this category. There is not a single point in this movie where you feel that you have been let down. Especially after brilliant performances by two of the best actors Hollywood has ever produced, Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Even the support actors have done a brilliant job. Russell Crowe & Al Pacino both deserved Oscars for their role. Denying them the Oscars can be considered nothing short of a sin. Exceptionally well written by Eric Roth & Marie Brenner, the dialogues in this movie take your breath away. Some scenes in this movie just blow your mind out, especially the ones where you see Ron Motley portrayed by Bruce McGill, puts down the opposing lawyer with his outburst. And also one scene where Al Pacino goes out all wild for the network not letting him run his cut. And the most brilliant part of it is, its based on a real story with some drama thrown in, which is rightly acknowledged by the director during the end credits. A fast paced movie, that doesn't let you down, I would proudly recommend this to anyone. Though this movie failed to win a single Oscar, i feel that it deserved all the 7 categories in which it was nominated, along with an Oscar thrown in for Al Pacino.10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"What ""All The President's Men"" was to newspaper journalism, this movie is to TV journalism.","This film is unavoidably being compared to director Alan J. Pakula's ""All The President's Men"" and for good reason, because Michael Mann's new film is every bit as good. (Anybody is the TV news biz -like me- knows that newspaper and TV news are very different animals.) ""The Insider"" is a very mature film. It takes its sweet time letting the events unfold. However Mann and his team use very cinematic trick in the book to hold our attention and the editing is impeccable. But first and foremost the film features 2 virtuoso performances: one by a master we've grown accustomed to and one by a guy who may have joined his league. Of course I'm talking about Al Pacino and Russell Crowe. Pacino adds another mammoth blast in his Hall of Fame collection of home run performances. His portrayal of 60 Minutes producer gives him a lot of room to use all his skills as an actor and he never ever looks like an actor acting. He vents anger and frustration better than any actor I've ever seen and he is given the chance to do so here. Now on to the ""new"" guy. Anybody who has seen Russell Crowe before (especially in his Oscar-worthy effort in ""L.A. Confidential"") is not surprised that he can more than hold his own against Pacino, but then again acting is not a sporting event and there is room for a lot of winners in a movie like this. Crowe's role as ""the guy"" who blows the whistle on the tobacco industry is a fascinating study of a man imploding. Not since Pacino's work in ""The Godfather II"" have I've seen it done so well. Like every other thing Mann has done the supporting actors are great too, but the standout here is Christopher Plummer's Mike Wallace who has to reluctantly sell out to the corporate bottom line. The story about a guy who wants to go public about a major public health crime but is abandoned by a major network is complex and difficult stuff, but Mann and co-scripter Eric Roth do a magnificent job at keeping it clear and interesting. It is riveting and important entertainment. Like the phrase ""TV journalism"", ""important entertainment"" may seem like a contradiction of terms, but not with this movie which is one the best films of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Excellent legal drama,"In The Insider, Russell Crowe once again proves his versatility as an actor. It's amazing how different he looks in this film from his other roles, particularly Mystery, Alaska and Gladiator. Here, he plays the part of Jeffrey Wigand, a man who is torn between his responsibility to uphold his agreement to keep his mouth shut about happenings with a gigantic tobacco company and his duty to inform the public of potentially harmful products. He was fired from his position as the head of research and development, and as he gingerly begins to speak to Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino), a spokesman from 60 Minutes, he begins receiving death threats aimed at himself and his family.Crowe delivers yet another outstanding performance, as does Al Pacino, who flawlessly creates the type of character that his role calls for. Not only is this a very interesting story, but it also gives a very good look at how big business corporations work, with both the massive cigarette companies as well as the respected television show, 60 Minutes, being presented in a new light. The casting was perfect for this film, everyone delivered excellent performances. The legal thriller is an almost endlessly interesting genre, but The Insider puts a new twist on the almost overdone subject, resulting in an excellent film that should not be missed.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
The Best Film of 1999,The fact that The Insider did not win the Best Picture Oscar just proves how CONSISTENTLY wrong the Academy is. This is a film about TRUTH!!! It's just incredibly disappointing to me how films that explore the depth or REAL LIFE struggles...and how the drama of REAL LIFE can make the absolute most compelling films out there. THIS is the best picture of 1999. And III don't want to hear another word about it!!!,10.0,Anonymous,Biography
"Great movie, superb acting","The fight of a David against Goliath is principally not new but with regard to this movie, director Michael Mann could keep you close to the very topical subject of the illegal and destructive practice of the tobacco industry for almost 3 hours without having a minute of being tired. Russell Crowe is amazing concerning his acting and he will hopefully surprise us with some more of this great performances in future films. Al Pacino as well is convincing in his role. The movie is credible and gives it's viewers an as deep as possible view into the real circumstances the movie is based on. Everybody - smoking or not - should watch this. Highly recommended!",9.0,Anonymous,Biography
A vivid and compelling film,"""The Insider"" could have been a troublesome film, since most people know how it turns out and the controversy captured in the film is often material taken on my TV movies.  However, Michael Mann directs a film that captured me from beginning to end and never once did I feel restless throughout the entire three hours.We all know the story and probably most know how it ends.  This film is about standing up in the midst of strong opposition and doing what one feels is the right thing to do.  This theme is often portrayed in cheesy sitcoms and dopey films, but this film shows how much of a struggle it was for Wigand and how he almost gave up doing anything at all, making him all the more human and inspiring.  Michael Mann's film shows Wigand as a human being, rather than an idealized hero.Russell Crowe gives the performance of his career, which is saying a lot since he has continually impressed me with outstanding performances.  His work, along with the rest of the actors besides Basinger, on ""L.A. Confidential was ridiculously shut out of most award nominations.  Although Basinger did a great job, Crowe was just as deserving of recognition.  I believe he will give Kevin Spacey a huge run for his money when Oscar night comes around.  Spacey, Crowe, and Carrey will all battle it out for what may be one of the most intense Best Actor competitions in recent memory.Al Pacino gives his usual powerful performance and, since this is expected, his fabulous work will probably gain little fanfare in terms of nominations.One complaint about the film: it the last 20 or so minutes of the movie, Wigand is completely forgotten and Pacino's character becomes the central focus.  This seemed to shift the movie in an entirely different direction and it seemed to run of course.Overall, an excellent film that will compete heavily with ""American Beauty"" as the best movie of the year.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
One of the best films of 1999,"Michael Mann has done it again. This movie has it all. A great story about the truth. Exceptional moving performances from Crowe and Pacino. a Great haunting sound track. And above all it is the best directing of the year. A cross between (All the president's men) and (network), The Insider is one of the best films of 1999.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
More than an interesting take on interesting events.,"The Insider is a film in which people talk. A lot. They talk over dinner, they talk in cars and more often than not they talk on the phone. And yet it never bored me for a second. The main reasons: an intelligent, grown-up screenplay that never gives in to cheap entertainment, Michael Mann's spectacularly sweeping yet semi-documentarylike direction and, of course, the great performances.Michael Mann and Eric Roth based this tale of the modern day David-versus-Goliath battle between whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and faceless sigarette juggernaut Brown & Williamson (and journalistic integrity) on a Vanity fair article. It has led to a powerful script, not only succeeding in showing the issues it deals with, both also (or perhaps most of all) succeeding in telling the emotionally captivating story of Wigand himself. The film's certainly aided by Russell Crowes masterful performance, but the writing itself deserves attention for being emotionally gripping without ever being sentimental and for keeping the drama real (although it's basic story is fictionalised, of course). However, the only problem I have with this film also lies within the script. About 100 minutes into the film shifts its perspective from Wigand to Lowell Bergman, the producer on 60 Minutes, who's trying to get Wigand's testimony to the screens. A lot of people have already pointed this out as The Insider's main flaw, and I'd have to agree. Wigand is the tragic figure of the story, not Bergman, Wigand is making all the sacrifices, he's having his life ruined for telling the truth, not Bergman. Wigand's ordeal is far more captivating than Bergman's and therefore I would have preferred it if the film had continued focussing on Wigand. The fact that Crowe is absolutely brilliant and Pacino merely very good, doesn't help either.As for directing, I think Mann is becoming better and better. I never really liked his older films. I remember seeing The Keep and being...well, baffled. I remember seeing Manhunter and although I enjoyed it, something didn't work for me. It always felt like style over content. With Heat however, Mann won me over. And with the Insider he proves he is still evolving as a director. The Insider looks great like any other of his films, but much like in Heat, style never overshadows content. It's always there to enhance the mood of a scene. The same goes for his genius use of a genius soundtrack (by Pieter Bourke and Lisa Gerrard). Still, the most amazing thing is the Mann's masking of the fact that this film is all talk.Finally, there's the acting. I said it twice, and will say it again. Crowe is perfect as Wigand. He brings across every emotion not so much through words, but through facial expressions and body language. And he never does it in a way that is noticable as being 'acted'. Also, Crowe looks the role, having put on more than a few extra pounds. Watch this in conjunction with, say, L.A. Confidential, or Gladiator and you'll see Crowe is a total actor, a chameleon almost. And although he got a deserved Oscar for Gladiator, his performance here is more finely tuned. Pacino, on the other hand, is very good, but he's not exactly doing anything new. He's convincing but in certain scenes comes close to the overacting more suitable for The Devil's Advocate. The supporting actors are all good or better.In short: Until the perspective shifts an emotionally powerful, highly intelligent, brilliantly acted and directed film, after the shift the 'emotionally powerful' is confined to the few scenes Crowe has left and the 'brilliantly acted' makes way for simply 'very well acted'. Still, I love the first part so much (and like the second part enough) that I can't rate this any lower than 9/10.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Enthralling from beginning to end,"It is amazing when a film close to three hours long can keep the viewer glued to the seat the entire time.

Very realistic and credible since I have worked for a large Corporation and the power and money issues are amazing.

Christpher Plummer and Lynsay Crouse,"Christopher Plummer was the star of The Sound of Music and Lyndsay Crouse's father wrote the screenplay with his collaborator Lyndsay, both a famous team. Here Plummer is majestic as Mike Wallace the CBS investigative reporter. Crouse plays Al Pacino's wife.Pacino is the lead as a CBS producer of news, 60 Minutes. Jeffrey Wigand is played superbly by Russell Crowe. These are top performances all around.Michael Mann's script captures the story from the article Man Who knew Too Much in Vanity Fair. The main thing is Brown and Williamson in Louisville, Kentucky were adding amonia to the tobacco to make it more addictive. Wigand worked for B&W in research and knew this. He told Bergman, Pacino, and how Bergman got the story told is the film. Mann writes with a multi layered approach. I enjoy that in his films and liken it to a symphony. He gets results from everyone. Russell Crowe delivers such a tour de force as Wigand. I think working with top people raises everyone's game.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography
Much more than you think!,"I walked into an advanced screening of this film thinking it should be okay at best.  Mann's last film ""Heat"" had all of this hype surrounding the casting of Deniro and Pacino.  And a lot of people were left feeling let down by ""Heat"" (including myself),  but this film the ""Insider"" draws you in like some type of cinematic whirlpool.  I will not spoil the movie but merely state how this film affected me.Russell Crowe gives a great layered performance as the main character.  In the way he conveys the pressure he is being put through by the tobacco company, 60 minutes, his family and all sorts of other influences is almost painful but stunning to watch.  At times I wanted to yell at the screen and say ""will you just leave the guy alone"". Truly a man against the world feeling.  Pacino is very understated but powerful when the script calls for it.  I thought he was very well cast as the producer for 60 minutes.Another great aspect of this film is the way it lays bear the inside workings of the television and print media.  I thought stock brokers werebrutal.  Truly interesting to watch and to witness how a news story comes together.Well all in all a great story with well acted characters through out this film.  If you feel like being interested and educated by a film.  Well the ""Insider"" is most definitely for you.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography
Mesmerising adaptation of a true story with outstanding performances.,"`The Insider' has been compared in many ways to `All The President's men', released in 1976. While I found both movies to be brilliant, I don't find them to be similar in any way. While `All the President's Men' was a factual, claustrophobic look at the uncovering of the Watergate scandal, `The Insider' is much more subjective and at times, a bit more compelling. Anyway, `The Insider' is an outstanding and continually fascinating look at this story that occurred not so many years ago. It's not very often that I can say this and mean it, but this is one of the few movies that is engaging for it's entirety, and at 158 minutes, that's quite an achievement. It's just a shame that the movie didn't receive international success it deserved.I wasn't very impressed with `Heat' (Michael Mann's last outing) so wasn't sure if this would be any good. Where I found `Heat' to be boring, `The Insider' was simply mesmerising. The flashy, shady directory techniques are magnificent and though this is a lot less murky and subtle than `All the President's Men' was, it still creates the desired effect. Backing up the excellent direction is outstanding acting from the lead actors.The best performance comes from Russell Crowe in the first of his three nominations (Gladiator and A Beautiful Mind soon followed). His portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand is first rate and he proves he can lose the machismo for these quieter but very powerful roles. He definitely should have won the Oscar that year. Al Pacino does his familiar `grumpy determined' part but he's never done it with as much substance and pure gusto as he does it here. `Mr. Von Trapp'- Christopher Plummer, does his part quite well as the head of the network. Diane Venora plays her `good wife' part adequately but there isn't much material she has to work with. There's a big (if not un-necessary) supporting cast with average performances from the likes of Philip Baker Hall, Gina Gershon, Lindsay Crouse, Michael Gambon and Debi Mazar.What most surprises me is the fact that the movie was nominated for 8 Oscars and didn't win a single one. It definitely deserved to win Best Picture ahead of the pretentious, contrived and manipulative `American Beauty', let alone Best Actor and Best Director.`The Insider' is a brilliant and muchly under-rated account of the uncovering of the truth about the addictions of nicotine. It's just a shame that it didn't receive the huge audience it deserved. Definitely a film that deserves a reserved spot in the IMDb Top 100. My IMDb rating: 8.5/10.",10.0,Anonymous,Biography

"Water, Water Everywhere -- Close Cover Before Striking","Michael Mann loves water. In two of his previous films, ""Thief"" and ""Heat"", Mann took great care to place his [male] characters in front of deeply calm, deeply blue-green watery horizons at moments of inner turmoil. As the seas calmed them, thus they were renewed for the rest of the picture. James (Thief) Caan goes to the waterfront with his bag of breakfast, breathes deeply. Robert (Heat) DeNiro lives in an architect's dream house of steel and glass with a perpetual thin line of blue sea/sky bisecting the view from his living room.In ""The Insider"", which I must admit is a brave, well-made picture, Mann once again places and lights his actors against an aquatic mise-en-scene so precise as to be painterly.Russell Crowe, in the film's biggest will-he-or-won't-he dramatic moment, faces out onto Pascagoula's Gulf of Mexico. Crowe's body is arranged just so in the frame, the waterline there, the trunk of the palm tree there, a distant sailboat there, none of this an accident. The photographic work is, again, simply stunning. Later, Pacino stomps about in an eerie green foaming Caribbean inlet, the color, and the waves, a sign as to his inner struggles with his own moral weight and the pressures of modern telejournalism.The supporting cast -- especially Bruce McGill -- and the ambient score are both a strong plus.""10"" from me.

The movie is constrained from having flashing action scenes, because real life is not that way and this story is suppose to be remotely close to life of a real insider.  The most troubling part of the film is its length.  It needs to be cut by at lease 45 minutes to be more bearable.",8.0,Anonymous,Biography

Overall though, a bit shorter and quicker would have been better, and I don't think that is just my short attention span.",,Anonymous,Biography
long...but it is still great,"I own the DVD of the film and I actually watch the trailor for it more than I watch the film. To me a trailor has to be so amazing, like the one this film has.

He really knows how to bring a scene to there full potential. Observe the ""faxing"" scene. This could have just been a regular scene, but with his use of the camera, fast editing, and good music, it makes a simple scene suspensful.The acting in the film is top rate. I couldn't find one bad actor in the film. I think Russell Crowe deserved an Oscar more for this performance than his ""Gladiator"" performance (He was good in it though) . I think it is a crime not to have given an Oscar to Al Pacino. This is some of his best acting in the past decade. I can't believe he wasn't even nominated for Best Supporting Actor, nothing.This is a very long film, though. It goes into a great amount of detail with many of the issues the film addresses.

Everybody needs to stop smoking right now.,"I have 3 favorite actors of all time. Al Pacino is one of the three. To watch him act is pure genius. With all due respect to Mr. Pacino, who is a wonderful actor and person, this movie belongs to Russell Crowe. This was a difficult part and character, and he played it beautifully. The whole time, he looked like he was going to have a nervous breakdown. The tremendous pressure that he was put under. ""Do I tell?"" ""Do I keep my mouth shut?"". It is a double edged sword. He deserves an Oscar nomination. Al & Michael Mann always pull off a great production when they work together (just watch Heat, you'll agree with me). And to everyone who did not like this: do yourself a favor and don't see movies with involved character stories, because it is impossible to not think of this movie as one of the best of the year (next to American Beauty). If you dont like movies with controversy and character studies, this is not for you. My mother and I loved it and we are recommending it to all our friends.

"Overblown,overdone pretentiousness","Here's what we learn in about two and a half hours:Big Tobacco companies are bad, Lowell Bergman is good.Mike Wallace is a bumbling, eccentric fool, who finally sees the light after having it flashed in front of his face about a dozen times.A tobacco company whistle blower, Jeffrey Wigand got royally screwed for breaking his confidentiality agreement and speaking out on the negative health impacts of smoking.Predictably, his wife will abandon him when times get tough. ...and, we're all at the mercy of big corporations, which are all in bed with each other anyway.If you're thinking that this story could have been compressed into about half the time (or less!), it was, when it originally aired in the form of a sixty minutes episode.  Of course, that episode didn't have the stylish directing talents of Michael Mann, a suave Al Pacino strolling on a dimly lit beach screaching ""I fought for you and I STILL fight for you..."", and other tantalizing little moments which Mann attempts to inject at every twist and turn in order to keep things moving.  Indeed, Mann is a director who knows how to stretch a film out for 2+ hours and not make the viewer look at his watch.I guess I could have just done with less cloak and dagger stuff and more documentary style details, like one might find on a PBS Frontline episode. As a matter of fact, that's precisely where Lowell Bergman ended up after leaving CBS over this fiasco.For all Mann's stylish directing talents (who doesn't like those city skyline shots that Mann seems to use so much) and Pacino's shouting and posturing, this film just ends up being an slickly produced, over dramatized hollywood version of events that by now are well known to most.",,Anonymous,Biography
An Outstanding Achievement for Michael Mann,"I've seen the film twice now, and, thanks to the Official Site, I've read the full Vanity Fair article.There's also a film programme in Toronto which spent half an hour on ""The Insider"" this afternoon, featuring interviews with Michael Mann and Al Pachino.I don't think I can say enough good things about this film. It works so well on a number of levels: social conscience, acting, direction, script, music- all are in place to deliver one of the best films of the year.The programme I cited above had a four-shot of Pachino and Russel Crowe with the real Lowell Bergman and Jeff Wygand. Wow! Crowe reportedly put on 50 pounds for the role. The resemblance to the real Wygand is incredible. Crowe's performance, in fact, is the best thing about the film. He allows the viewer to feel all the emotions the character feels as his life unravels. He is conflicted, motivated by both a desire for revenge and for an idealism which he thought he had lost. He is seeking to redeem himself in his own eyes, and the eyes of others.Pachino is the idealist, working within an organization which is making increasingly too many compromises to its journalistic integrity. As Bergman, relating to Wygand, both men seem to derive moral sustantence from the other.And.....the viewer forgets he is wathcing actors playing parts. The actors become those parts as whole cloth.The film contains a disclaimer that ""certain facts have been altered for dramatic effect"", or words to that extent. Major reshaping of history would have been the norm with a Hollywood film. Not this one: the Vanity Fair article demontrates that only minor changes have been made to sequence. The spirit of the truth is in place.I think it is fitting that a film about integrity, about two men of integrity, is in turn directed by a Mann (a bad pun, I know) of integrity.A must see. Crowe for Best Actor.",,Anonymous,Biography
Flawed but memorable,"Despite way too much so-called ""fictionalizing for dramatic effect"" in the third act, Mann's riveting whistle-blower epic is high drama of the finest pedigree. It's a soft subject matter for the creator of Miami Vice and Heat (minimal violence, no one dies, no one really gets hurt), and Mann has been roundly accused of self-importance because of his overblown styling. The movie is indeed too long and too tumultuous--but if this is a product of a filmmaker's self-importance, then I wish more directors would wake up and start thinking more of themselves.",,Anonymous,Biography
Gladiator takes on the tobacco barons,"This is not an obvious, or an easy, subject for cinematic treatment  high-level whistle-blowing in the US tobacco industry  but, in the hands of accomplished director Michael Mann, the outcome is a compelling analysis of the nature of big business and media values in corporate America. Al Pacino gives another fine performance as CBS `60 Minutes' television producer Lowell Bergman, trying to maintain his old-fashioned radicalism while surviving the tyranny of the suits and protecting his source.It is Russell Crowe, however, who sustains the two and a half hour movie as he portrays the former Brown & Williamson scientist, turned informant and science teacher, Jeffrey Wigand. I actually viewed `The Insider' after I saw `Gladiator' and it is astonishing that the same actor could have so ably taken on both eponymous roles. For the former, 34 year old Crowe takes on the persona of a man 18 years his senior by putting on 80 lb, while grey hair, glasses and sheer talent do the rest.This true story has an uncompromising message: cigarettes are delivery devices for nicotine and the companies that manufacture them are deliberately trying to make users addicted to them. Sad, then, that Crowe himself is a smoker.",,Anonymous,Biography
film and Crowe's performance overrated,"Russell Crowe doesn't deserve the hype surrounding his performance, - he didn't convince me as a middle-aged family man. I can't believe he is nominated for an Academy Award, especially when he is blown away in this movie by Al Pacino. This movie is given a great review almost everywhere, but I found it long, boring and slow. And very overrated.",,Anonymous,Biography
simply superb,"The Insider is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over again without becoming bored.  Every time I watch it, I notice something new--I come away from it with more of an understanding of the brilliance of this film.  Make no mistake, this is drama at its very best, with three outstanding actors--Al Pacino as 60 Minutes producer Lowell Bergman, Russell Crowe as ex-tobacco scientist Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, and Christopher Plummer as 60 Minutes' very own Mike Wallace--surrounded by an effective supporting cast.I won't bore you with a synopsis of the plot.  Too many reviewers get bogged down on plot and focus too little on what does or does not make a film work.In the case of The Insider, everything works, with the possible exception of a bad southern accent from Diane Venora, who has some great performances under her belt (The Jackal).  Let's start with the music.  A lot of people said it was bizarre but worked.  This couldn't be more true.  One of the scores used sounds much like a chant, but it works bacause it accentuates the conflict that is Dr. Wigand's life.  Among this film's most effective scenes is the one when Dr. Wigand is about to deliver a deposition and he standing before a body fo water trying to decide whether to go ahead and do it or pull out for fear of being arrested when he returns to Kentucky. You have to see it to truly comprehend the brilliance of the music of The Insider.Not enough could be said about the performances by Russell Crowe, Al Pacino, and Christopher Plummer.  These three actors are as fine as it gets. Pacino had fallen into a slump where he was over-acting a bit, as evidenced by his mediocre performance in Scent of a Woman, but he came back stronger than ever in The Insider, which was his strongest performance since The Godfather Part II.  Lowell Bergman is a rebel among conformists in The Insider and Pacino captures the conflict Bergman endured during the Wigand debacle--when 60 Minutes really dropped the ball.Plummer was brilliant as Mike Wallace.  In addition to actually looking like Wallace, Plummer acted like him too.  It was almost as if Wallace was playing himself in The Insider.Russell Crowe made a statement in The Insider.  Coming off an incredible performance in LA Confidential, Crowe, with his remarkable ability to play any role, proved to the world that The Insider was just the begining of a remarkable career.  Crowe is now in the same category as Sean Connery, Harrison Ford, Gene Hackman, Tom Hanks, etc.  He is here to stay and he is a giant.The Insider is simply one of the top 5 best movies of the '90s, maybe of all-time.  It's a classic and I recommend to anyone to see it because they won't regret it.",,Anonymous,Biography
To Inhale or no.That is the question!,"In this very absorbing true life story about whistle blower from big tobacco company who causes quite a stir with his technical analysis of how that industry has manipulated and kept users in a habit that should have been obvious to any and all influenced.But it was the biggest hoodwink scandal of recent history,having adulterated and hooked many with chemical enhanced tobacco additives that create even more desire and fix than regular tobacco laden cigarettes. With an outstanding cast including Al Pacino,Christopher Plummer and most notably Russell Crowe,the story is driven and enhanced by the acting talents and storyline that reeks of big business,corruption and white collar crime that is effectively portrayed and brought to life by credible performances and moving drama that appear to take place as if for the first time for camera and viewer as if scripted per chance.This is first rate filmmaking that appears at once and yet altogether as if the action is forthcoming but nonetheless held back,as if by happenstance.With this technique,the audience is held in suspended animation,awaiting with bated breath each upcoming scene,that will either come clean or dismiss the previous telltall sign of doom or gloom.A great conspiracy film that is neither fake or contrived,being too real and straightforward and also documented to dispell any myth about its authenticity. The movie has a nice flow and rhythm and Crowe and Pacino play well off each other,building their characters from scene to scene and adding nicely to the drama that is unravelling with an almost surreal texture of undercover madness that is lurking to strike and knock down at any moment.But with its subtle nature of impending doom that coulda,shoulda,woulda but never quite does,the viewer is held in obligatory observance of results that seem too easily pending the fate and control of others that can't be seen or heard from.That is the true nature of grand mal conscienceness and conspiracies gone foul.Only in this film the conspiracy is all too real and perpetrated on an unsuspecting victim {The american public} for the good of big business who robber baron the health and pocketbooks of those who need its product.A better example of the fleecing of a generation or 2 of people and its filthy desire to profiteer from its insidious marketing of a product who's  only true use is to futher its insatiable lust for more and deeper want,has not been put to screen with this degree of seriousness and savoir faire.Christopher Plummer is quite effective as Mike Wallace and the 60 minutes anchor who stands head over heels tall when it comes to integrity and life experience as a new journalist who knows the ropes and how to dance around power plays.But even he has a hard time with this agenda,being a historic ballbreaker of monumental status that defies even his grandeur.This uncover story is world shaking and touches many if not all of mankind. And this film will also touch many,as it is dramatic,very well acted and has all the ingredients of suspence and unravelling that make for great cinema.It also happens to be based on fact which heightens its impact. 4 out of 5 star or 8 out of 10 for a smoking display of drama and its aftermath.

Loved The Film,"I really enjoyed this film.  I thought that Russell Crowe was absolutely entertaining,brilliant and great at this movie.  He should have won the Academy Award however he did win the Golden Globe.  The story was uplifting and interesting.  The cast and crew knew what they were doing when they decided to make this film.  I loved it because the acting was very good. The only thing negative that I can say about The Insider is the length. Otherwise it was great.  Russell  Crowe was extremely believable and understandable.  Thanks,Suzanne",,Anonymous,Biography
Deep-going account of people under extreme pressure,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I was going to see the Insider. I thought it was going to be a good entertaining action-thriller like Heat or Absolute Power, but wrong I was. The Insider proved me wrong about one thing, Michael Mann. Having made so many movies about bad guys getting shot, and sweaty cops screaming at each other, he underlines the facts that made his other movies so good, in the Insider. It's much more difficult than you'd think, and it presents Mann as a professional and experienced movie director, who finally gets a shot at what he really wants to do.The Insider was entirely about people. There weren't any high-budget action sequences to boost the entertainment value. To make it even less commercial, it was filmed with handheld camera, and it didn't even try to look good, but to describe in detail the lives of the people involved. First I was uncomfortable with the filming style, but I soon realised why it was necessary. There was a certain realistic flair to it that made it even more touching, and it made the viewer either focus on the characters and the plot, or get bored.The plot was very complex and it would have been very hard to follow if Mann wasn't such a good director. He has a firm grip of the cast, and doesn't let anyone overdo their performances. The dialogue isn't the hip, smart-ass kind you find in a lot of movies, but realistic and free of well thought out one-liners. They actually talk like real people do, and the humour is very low-key. The actors are in on it too, and no-one does more than his own part. The overall style is semi-documentary, touching th viewer on a deeper level, because these are real people.The special thing about this movie is the way it depicts people. Usually in this kind of genre, the people are just tools used to get the plot moving, and machine guns and cars are the real protagonists. Michael Mann always portrays the people in bigger detail, and shows how the events affect them. In the Insider he throws away all the commercial gloss that remained in Heat (not much, though), and makes the ultimate Michael Mann-film, a humanistic thriller-drama at it's purest.Besides the stuff above, Mann also delivers some intelligent media criticism, showing how capitalist executives can smother the truth and deceive the public in the name of the dollar. Great movie, but don't leave your brain in the coathanger when you see this one.",,Anonymous,Biography
It's 2nd on my list of 1999 movies,"This movie really moved me, it's message is universal.
A very well made movie in any aspect; Mann's direction is perfect, Crowe & Pacino & Plummer are perfect, screenplay is well researched and very well written, cinematography is unique and well matched to kind of story they made.
Although I have a little problem with the beginning of the third act which seemed a little bit out of pace and I think they could have edited this part better.
Overall this movie deserved every one of the 7 oscar nominations it got, It is a movie worth your time.",,Anonymous,Biography

Yes, AMERICAN BEAUTY was damn good but this film is wonderfully intense.  And, Al is always up for some yelling.  I love his confrontations with Mike Wallce.  (FYI: Mike Wallace comes off like a complete jack-face). Micheal Mann is truly gifted.  I love his style.  I love the music he picks. I hope he keeps moving and grooving.",,Anonymous,Biography
Take you time and enjoy this complex story.,"This is fine movie with good acting and directing. Clearly it deserves some of the notoriety it has gotten. There are couple of times where you'd like the story to move more quickly and a couple of dispensable scenes. In addition, there is a myriad of quick-in, quick-out characters which is a little confusing. (What was Rip Torn doing in the movie? Great actor, weak part.) But overall, this is a captivating story about two men. One is an activist, always looking do to the ""right thing"" and willing to take risks. The other is more opportunistic, but facing a crisis. He might seek revenge or forgiveness more than he would be a crusader. I'd recommend this with a very large bowl of popcorn and a long evening. BTW, the video I rented was picturebox format: bravo!",,Anonymous,Biography
Wow,"That's it, in a word. This from the guy who gave us Miami Vice. But can he paint a picture... This movie is just quality cinematic engineering from the word ""go"".

Whether you find the subject matter fascinating or not (and you should), witness a piece of cinematic mastery.",,Anonymous,Biography
A Masterpiece in Narrative Story-Telling.,"Michael Mann's `The Insider' is not a great film.  It is a masterpiece.  It is simply one of the great films made in the past decade.  The criticism in which `The Insider' received was that it was not an original film.  It also been unfairly scrutinized by the media for it's `inaccurate' portrayal of the facts.  People often forget that the `The Insider' is not a recreation of a factual documentation of a story, but it is simply a film, it is the highest art of it's kind.What makes `The Insider' a masterpiece?  To answer this question, film lovers who would disagree with me, should watch the films of Howard Hawks. In both of the directors' films, they share an uncanny common parallel. They are masters of the physical aspect of the film making process.  Both directors believe that films must tell a story through the structural narrative drive, transitions of the images, cinematography, fluctuations in filmic rhythm, and especially the subtle execution of the realization of the film's thematic concerns.  All of these qualities are masterfully demonstrated in `The Insider.'In `The Insider' the film's ability to drive it's narrative, which it immeasurably serves to examine the character's psychological insight, makes it one of the great cinematic accomplishments in recent times.  This is the aspect of the film that causes people to denounce the film as `unoriginal.' Yet, `The Insider' serves it purpose by presenting it's narrative with a force that can't be produced in a thousand of these so-called `original' films made today.  `The Insider' is presented with candor and doesn't use any gimmicks to tell its story.`The Insider' is also one of the few films, in the tradition of Howard Hawks, as a film, which uses the aesthetic of oversight, of creating the mise en scene of implication rather than overly stating the film's thematic concerns.  Underneath the surfaces lie complex tensions between the character's pretense and their conscious feelings.  `The Insider' could have gone to great lengths of how smoking kills millions of people each year by showing an autopsy of a diseased lung or a demonstration of injecting nicotine on laboratory rats, but ""The Insdier"" is not a Spielberg film, it is a Michael Mann film.The photography of the film can also be described as momentous.  Dante Spinotti, arguably the best cinematographer today, executed the photography where it serves the film's purpose by fusing the image with tension and apprehension.  The most effective shot in `The Insider' is probably the close-up with the telephoto lens.  This shot effectively distorts the background, which gives the image an unclear tension, which infuses the moment.  The dull blue-green hues of the film also serve it purpose of creating an insomniac effect where the two characters are stuck in a nightmare in which they can't wake up from.With this film, along with `Heat,' proclaims Director Michael Mann as the best storyteller today.  Finally, the successor to Howard Hawks has been found.",,Anonymous,Biography
Positively riveting: ***1/2 (out of ****),"I've been waiting to see this film for some time now, and while one could easily accuse me of sccumbing to Academy Award hype, the truth is that planned on seeing THE INSIDER all along, but never got around to it. Now I have seen 4 out of 5 of the Best Picture Nominees (all except THE CIDER HOUSE RULES).When I first heard about this movie and it's story, I thought, ""hmmmmm.... sounds like something I'd walk out on."" Well, I didn't, and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly as well. However, also I'm aware of the fact that THE INSIDER is in fact based on real life events and altered for dramatic effect, I don't remember the time when those events actually took place, or what happened (News like that never interested me that much). My opinion can be called, at its core, limited.Now about THE INSIDER'S strength as a movie-- it has truckloads of it. The cinematography is quite edgy, and establishes a dark, uncertain tone with lots of bleak, muted colors. Mann generates tension without resorting to the standard chase scenes and shoot-outs. The actors play their characters as if there really is something tangible on the line, which helps highten the intensity. The film tackles some big issues and morals, including how a top-drawer news corporation like CBS was pressured by financial and legal issues to cut a major story. It's also about Jeffery Wigand's struggle with his conscience, his struggle against his former employers, and the hardship of him and his wife trying to accept the sacrifices they had to make.In some ways, THE INSIDER is like a two-act play. The first half, like I said before, concentrates mostly on Wigand and his circumstances, and he is in nearly every scene. Later on, the focus shifts to Lowell Bergman and the 60 Minutes crew as a battle ensues over journalistic integrity and the consequences of airing such a revealing story on the air. Actually, I found THE INSIDER'S first half to be unquestionably stronger than its first; the emotional core becomes slightly murky later on. Minor problems aside however, THE INSIDER is a very worthy film, and possesses a kinetic flow that never stops moving. There are very few slow scenes, and if there are, I can't remember them completely.Nothing ranks higher in THE INSIDER than the acting factor. Al Pacino is at his intense best here, even though this isn't a particularly ""new"" kind of role for him. He screams his head off in a lot of his movies :). Russell Crowe certainly deserved an Oscar nomination for his excellent work here. He finds every nook-and-cranny in Wigand's character. Like many memorable heroes, this guy is certainly flawed, and Crowe depicts him forcefully. Also memorable is Christopher Plummer in his version of 60 Minutes' Mike Wallace. He also suplies a great deal of intensity, and his single standout is during a scene when some of his on-air comments have been censored on a broadcast. Everyone else is solid, but I have to stop the commentary somewhere.This is one of those films where the energy level is always high, and keeps the viewer in until the very end. The concepts will certainly confuse some people who didn't pay much attention to the real-life events based on THE INSIDER (like me), but most of the focus is on the characters here. The end result is an endlessly compelling and engaging movie that combines the intensity of a thriller and a drama into a unique hybrid.",,Anonymous,Biography

Holy Smoke!,"Holy Smoke!  What the hell is up with Russel Crowe?  For God's sake, the guy COMPLETELY disappears into the role of Wigand (aging make-up aside).  Very impressive, what a performance!Mann, as usual, leaves the possible ""flaws"" in his films as they are, he obviously and admirably believes in the sensitivities of his own eyes and ears.  I'm glad he does, and his trademark ""flaws"" of overlength, sprawling subplots, and radically different musical overlays are actually becoming strengths.  I hate the idea I will have to wait three or four years for his next effort!",,Anonymous,Biography
I think I missed the boat on this one.,"I honestly couldn't get into this movie. It was long, slow, and boring, and the two and a half hours it lasted felt like about four and a half. The story was an interesting one, though probably not as well known in the rest of the world (other than in the U.S.), but for me the interest in the story started to dissolve after about the first hour. The jumping camera I'm guessing was designed to give a documentary feel (??) to the story, but it just made the film irritating to watch. I went to see the film on the basis of all the good reviews it had received, and also the buzz surrounding Russell Crowe's performance, but I was left disappointed. I realise it was a stretch for him to play a middle-age family man, but he didn't convince me, so for me that's where the movie fell down. I kept thinking there's Crowe wandering about with talc powder in his hair, and this is supposed to be a great performance. I couldn't believe he was Wigand, and that was essential for me to get into the movie. I hope he doesn't win the Academy Award because his performance didn't impress me in the slightest. Kevin Spacey in American Beauty convinced me immediately that he was Lester, and although I didn't enjoy the movie as much as I would have hoped (something to do with it being so hyped up before I saw it), the performance was far superior to Crowe's effort. The Insider tells an important story, but the film's own sense of importance is what made it hard viewing for me. I felt no sympathy for Wigand's wife even though she understandably (in terms of her wanting to protect her family) didn't want Wigand to continue with his testimony because he was putting her family at risk, even though it was the right thing to do. Instead I found her an irritating character, and a bit one-dimensional. In my book, the films high points were the actor who played Wigand's lawyer in the scene where he is trying to get Wigand's testimony despite objections from the opposing lawyer, and Al Pacino's various one-liners scattered throughout the movie. The psychedelic scene in the hotel room when then wall begins to change and visions of his daughters appear was a bit out of place with the rest of the film. I know this was an attempt to give the viewer a sense of how far down Wigand had sunk mentally, but it just seemed so out of place and bizarre .Of the two main characters, I thought Pacino was much better, but he hasn't attracted as much praise. Unlike Crowe, Pacino immediately made me believe he was Lowell Bergman. All in all I felt the film was too long, and lacked the pace to maintain my interest.",,Anonymous,Biography
"Well directed, great acting","I saw this movie at a special presentation at the London Film Festival where we were honoured by a personal appearance from Michael Mann.  This was a great experience after watching an excellent movie.  Throughout 2.5 hours, the tension never lets up due to fantastic performances from all of the cast (I especially liked Bruce McGill as a hard nosed Mississippi lawyer), plus spot on direction and cinematography.  That they cast and crew achieve this atmosphere is all the more remarkable for the fact that the story itself is one that could be very boring if handled the wrong way.Great film - 82/100.",,Anonymous,Biography
Powerfully engrossing,"A film that is very gripping, ""The Insider"" is very deserving of it's seven oscar nominations. Russell Crowe and Al Pacino are excellent as Jeffrey Wigand and Lowell Bergman respectively. Film follows Wigand, a tobacco exec who's been given the boot by his CEO boss on the basis of ""poor communicative skills"" which in other words stands for ""c**p"". Bergman is a TV producer for 60 Minutes who convinces Wigand to go on the air with his story of why he may have been fired and releases some pertinent info about the tobacco company. A particularly brilliant opener follows the two main characters in their lives with Pacino's Bergman trying to prevent an already heated argument between a well known terrorist and Mike Wallace (a well done Christopher Plummer) and Wigand leaving his job. Another powerful scene takes place in a Mississippi courtroom where a lawyer truthfully tears into another lawyer and lets him have it. Christopher Plummer does an excellent job as the gruff Wallace who in one particularly scenery chewer, rightfully crushes the spirit of two CBS lawyers with some seriously hurtful insults. Michael Mann uses his visual flair to bring story to the controversial subject of tobacco, the media, and the destruction of man.",,Anonymous,Biography
Ordinary People under Extraordinary Pressure,"A film with not one but two martyrs.  Tack on a storyline that most people have some knowledge of - the whistleblower Jeffrey Wigand and CBS 60 Minutes' bungled effort to withhold his interview.  What you get is Michael Mann's ""The Insider"", a powerful film that, in spite of its foibles, is a masterful indictment of corporate America and those people who would compromise their integrity in order to maintain the status quo. The intelligent use of close-ups and focus in/focus out scenes creates a dynamic sense of the nature of the three main characters, Mike Wallace (as played by Christopher Plummer as so sure of his persona and yet so insecure of how others judge him ), Jeffrey Wigand (played by Russell Crowe as the corporate Judas who is tormented by choices he made), and Lowell Bergman (played by Al Pacino as the Type A in-your-face personality who cared enough not to compromise his sources).

"Wow! A great, thoughtful film, intense drama","This is a remarkably brave film considering the times we live in, where justice can be bought and companies put out of business just by filing law suits, and where concepts like morality and ethics are words which don't matter at all in the face of the almighty dollar.This film is a gripping drama that has the added value of being true in its essential nature. Wigand's testimony was critical for the exposure of ""Big Tobacco"" as a set of companies that knowingly lied to the American public about the effects of their products on public health.The characters are very well handled, everyone was convincing and did a terrific job of ""being"" these people. I thought Pacino was terrific and was surprised that he did not get a nomination for best actor.For me the best scene was where Wigand is about to be deposed by the Attorney for the State of Louisiana (or was it Mississippi?). It made me cheer for the system of states that we have now, where corrupt judges from one state are not able to shut down justice in another state (i.e. just because big tobacco has several judges in Kentucky in their pocket, other states are able to carry out their own investigations, thanks to state's rights).Bottom line: I would urge all citizens of the United States to see this film. It is an accurate depiction of the system we live in today. Its not a pretty picture, but it is riveting, and maybe, things can change.",,Anonymous,Biography
Brilliant Insider a Major Oscar Contender,"Critics at large have their work cut out for them when it comes time to compile their top ten film list of 1999.  This year has been extraordinary as far as high quality films go.  One thing is for certain; ""The Insider"" will grace many a list.  ""The Insider"" is not only one of the best films of the year, but of the past decade.  There is no doubt that this superior film will rank in many Oscar nomination categories. ""The Insider"" is based on the 1996 Marie Brenner's Vanity Fair article ""The Man Who knew Too Much"" about Dr. Jeffrey Wigand, a cigarette research & development executive who was fired by the tobacco company he worked for.  The film is a behind the scenes look at the events that took place that caused CBS's ""60 Minutes"" to blow one of the biggest stories of the decade concerning the negligence of the tobacco industry.After Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe) is fired from his job, he is pressured by ""60 Minutes"" maverick producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) and his own conscience to blow the whistle on the tobacco industry for misleading the public on the dangers of cigarettes.  But at the last minute executives at ""60 Minutes"" decide to pull the plug on the interview segment between Wigand and TV news journalist Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer).  In the process Wigand, who went out on a major limb, has his life destroyed as he gets caught in the crossfire between the tobacco company and ""60 Minutes"".  The tobacco company attempts to discredit him by exposing everything about his life and ""60 Minutes"" practically abandons him after deciding to cancel the segment, which might have a negative effect on the sale of CBS to Westinghouse.  Producer Lowell Bergman was the only one from ""60 Minutes"" that managed to stick to his guns and a good portion of the film focuses on the relationship between Bergman and Wigand.The true story in itself is a remarkable piece of drama with the high power villainous tobacco company, heroes Wigand and Bergman, the responsibility of journalism, etc.  Director Michael Mann turns what is already a compelling story into a superb and brilliant piece of filmmaking. Although known for his stylish action sequences (""Heat"", ""Manhunter"", ""The Last of the Mohicans""), Mann does a masterful job with this intricate and complicated media event.  The terrific script and cast make his job even smoother.  Al Pacino heads an amazing cast of actors.  Pacino, who I have always admired, sometimes lets his histrionics get in the way of his performances, but here in the character of Bergman, he give a understated and very focused performance, one of his best in some time.  Mann seems able to rein Pacino in as he did with ""Heat"" and the result is obvious.  But the true stars of this film are Russell Crowe and Christopher Plummer, both names, which should be mentioned during academy nominations.  Crowe, who was so powerful and amazing in ""LA Confidential"", is just pure brilliant here as Wigand. Crowe plays this emotional problematic and complex character the complete opposite of his LA role by showing a man imploding from the outside in.  He is just mesmerizing to watch as he deteriorates from the pressures that surround him, including his domestic life.  A magnificent performance. Christopher Plummer, an excellent actor that we do not see enough of, is totally compelling as Mike Wallace.  His monologue of ""how he will be remembered"" is truly moving.  Playing a live personality is not an easy task for an actor and Plummer pulls it off flawlessly without even looking remotely or sounding like Mike Wallace. He captures Wallace perfectly and is so believable in the role.  Others here do good work including Debi Mazar, who finally lets go of her tough New York gal that she is known for, unfortunately the talented Lindsay Crouse is wasted as Bergman's wife and Diane Verona does not fare very well in the unsympathetic role as Wigand's wife.  Her performance seems out of place with the rest of the cast.""The Insider"" reminiscent of another great film, 1976's ""All the President's Men"" shows Hollywood at it's best.  ""The Insider"" should be on every film buffs list. Highly Recommended. × × × × 1/2",,Anonymous,Biography

A very mature piece of work,"'Ordinary people under extraordinary pressure' is how veteran ""60 minutes"" producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino) describes tobacco industry whistle-blower Jeff Wigand (Russell Crowe) and his wife (Diane Venora).

Pacino's loyal news-man is the perfect foil, establishing himself as Wigand's equivalent in the world of mass media: the film is, in fact, about two insiders, struggling to maintain justice in the face of corporate power.

Dual Portraits: The Solitary Crusader Against the Corporate Juggernaut,"""The Insider"" is a docudrama that exposes the ruthless selfishness writ large of the corporations.  It consists of two personal portraits of high-ranking insiders, presented in series.

Wigand knows that the tobacco companies are promoting fatal addiction for profit and Bergman seeks to give him a mainstream forum for his confession.  The first man gets personal and professional devastation as payment for his honesty and accountability; the second man gets insuperable disaffection as payment for his courage and integrity.""The Insider's"" assessment of the American (military/industrial complex) dream consists of equals parts of bleakness and bitterness.

Powerful,"We all know the tobacco companies are made up of a bunch of scumbags who care about nothing but money, but this movie just blows your mind.  Crowe is a former scientist, Jeffrey Wigand, who worked with a top tobacco company to increase the potency of nicotine in cigarettes.  He quit the job, feeling somewhat guilty for his work, and this sets off a chain of events. He goes semi- public  with his story to CBS News' 60 Minutes.  Al Pacino plays a hard edged producer who does all he can to get the story aired...but due to fear of a lawsuit CBS cuts the story.   This is a fabulous story about the corruption and evil of corporate America, and the triumph of good over evil.  Pacino is brilliant as usual, and Crowe is great too.  The look of the film sets the mood for the film perfectly.  Music and periods of silent add to the drama that the story itself brings to the film.  It's a great film with some great characters, and some even greater acting.  Tho the story is true, it clearly says in the credits that some parts were fictionalized to add dramatic effect...and drama there is.  It's brilliantly shot and put together, and I'd definitely give it a 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Biography
Exposing the truth can be riveting. . .,"I just saw this film two weeks ago as it finished up it's theatrical release at the second-run theatres, then purchased the DVD three days ago. This is simply the best film I've seen in at least the last two years. I feel it was unfairly ignored at the box-office because the subject matter wasn't appealing enough, and it has no sex or violence to speak of. I dragged a friend with me who had no knowledge whatsoever of the film, and when it was over, he seemed to really have enjoyed it. Pacino and Crowe are excellent (as I'm sure you've heard), and even at 2hrs 40mns, the film moves along at a crisp pace. I usually am pretty suspicious of any film over two hours in length, but this one holds your interest the entire time. One point of criticism, though: There is an undeveloped (and unnecessary, in my humble opinion) subplot involving the Unabomber(!) case. I'm assuming this is because, in reality, ""60 Minutes"" was probably involved in this case during the story's time-period, but ultimately, this doesn't really serve any purpose in the movie. This doesn't really detract from the film, though, so it's a minor point. Hopefully, this wonderful film will get it's ""second wind"" (smoking pun intended!) on home video, pay-per-view, and cable. It's definitely worth 2 1/2 hours of your time, maybe on a weekend.",,Anonymous,Biography
The truth is out there,"The title alone promised an exciting espionage thriller. When Marie Brenner wrote her Vanity Fair - article on a Kentuckan teacher whose brave court testimony forced the tobacco industry into an expensive law suit settlement the true story was already old news. ""The Man who knew too much"" neither had the resemblance of James Stewart, nor was ever rescued by Doris Day singing ""C'e serra, serra"". Still, writer/director Michael Mann found the incidents described so intriguing that he decided to make an epic tale out of it. To adapt the real life to the big screen he followed his ""heat""-formula and created thereby the most powerful movie on modern-day journalism since ""All the President"" s Men"". Unlike Costa-Gavras questionable approach to the world of television news with the 1997 thriller ""Mad City"" Mann focuses much more on the behind-the-scenes settings than the obvious thriller elements. As with ""Heat"" he centers the whole story around two men who - this time - fight for the same good cause, but still are confronted with completely different living situations. While Dr. Jeffrey Wigand is fired from his job as a head researcher of the third biggest U.S. tobacco company TV-news producer Lowell Bergman negotiates an exclusive interview with one of the sheiks who possibly initiated the U.N.-bombings. Bergman is a small, energetic king of his little Reich which is the famous CBS news show ""60 minutes"". His goal in life is to provide the U.S. public with the whole truth behind the headline news stories. Wigand, however, just wants to continue making his living. He has two little daughters - one has really bad asthma - and a wife who is really not very supportive. In an ingenious opening montage we see these premises to the real drama intermingle. While Bergman and his interviewer Mike Wallace sit in an anonymous room in Teheran and talk to a fundamentalist terrorist, Wigand comes home and very quietly tells his wife about his sudden unemployment. Russell Crowe impresses down playing the humiliation and anger of Dr. Wigand who stands only at the threshold of a family life which is slowly about to break in pieces. The contact between these different characters is made almost in secrecy, by exchanging faxes. This initiates an awkward communication between Bergman and Wigand. It takes them nearly the whole movie to finally establish something like relationship, although they will never have the chance to become real friends. Bergman acknowledges Wigands struggle and he secretly admires him for his stoic sense of justice. Whereas media icon Mike Wallace has never better to say as: ""Where are these people?"" the second the Wigands may decide not to go public. In the meantime, Wigand loses his house, his medical insurance, his dignity, his trust, his wife and almost his two kids he cares the most for. He is willing to put all that at stake to help justice succeed, and it is the frantically realistic helpless way he fights his lonely fight against his former employers for which the viewer respects him the most. Of course, this is just a movie with a lot of alterations to the true facts, but still it is the most intimate depiction of an almost Don Quixotian  media war we' ve ever seen on the big screen. The camera stays very close to the actors, almost always observing their faces and painfully revealing the well hidden frustration behind their faces when they are confronted with the fact that CBS won' t broadcast the explosive interview. As the corporate lawyers tell Bergman: ""The bigger the truth, the bigger the damage."" Meaning the TV network does not want to risk a law suit by the tobacco company Wigand worked for. Memorable dialogue lines like these are not presented with larger-than-life gestures as in Costa-Gavras ""Mad City"", but evolve almost naturally from the ever changing situations and problems the TV producer and his dependent news source are confronted with. Bergman does not hesitate to stay true to his promise and by playing out his connections he finally get their interview on the small screen. Again, Mann does it the new way in presenting the audience the fact that the written journalistic word is still more powerful than any TV picture, because it is the ""New York Post""-Editorial which decides over Wigands future and leads to his rehabilitation after weeks and weeks of dirty campaigning against him. Still, at the time his face is shown on TV another story already catched the headlines - the arresting of the devilish Utah bomber. In that way, Mann concludes drawing his news cycle and points out that Wigands personal story - as life changing as it was for him - is only one small part of a media world which is stuck between journalistic truth and corporate decisions. That' s why the ""real"" Bergman resigned his job and went on making ""Frontline"" for PBS and teaching at UC Berkeley. Still, in the very last scene with Wigand we see him and his two daughters eating spaghetti in his own new apartment. ""The Kentuckan teacher of the year"" and his story finally resigns with a happy ending. It is Mann' s ability to build up suspense without any unnecessary violence which keeps this drama going and is best symbolized in one scene when Wigand glimpses at a burned down car wreck on the side of the road. Small, almost unrecognizable moments like this make this movie a treasure chest of great performances and powerful pictures. There are only few scenes where we really don' t trust the authenticy of what we see. Underlined with a hauntingly quiet soundtrack, composed by ""Dead Can Dance""-performer Lisa Gerrard and an uncredited Graeme Revell this is the best drama of the year so far, and a sure candidate for the upcoming Oscar-nominations.",,Anonymous,Biography
Loved It!,"I loved this film, and am surprised that it didn't do too well! It's so much better than a number of recent thrillers, and because it is a true story done well, it feels very real.I'd compare it in some aspects to All the President's Men, which is one of my favorite films. It's about journalists trying to uncover the truth about something very big, it's based on a true story, the acting and directing are very good, and it's real and indepth.It's a bit like a John Grisham novel - long and deep, yet you are gripped until the end. In fact, John Grisham covered this very same topic in The Runaway Jury.If you don't like to think when you're watching a movie, don't rent this. But if you enjoy using your mind and spending a whole lot of time thinking about a film afterwards, this is definitely for you. As a thinker, I'd give this one 10 out of 10.",,Anonymous,Biography
