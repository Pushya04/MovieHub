"Honestly, better than I expected","My expectations were low, I love Will Ferrel but his movies are often shallow and stupid and rarely touches you. This one is not deep and smart, that is not what I'm saying! But it is well made and has a lot of heart in it that balances the shallow and stupid quite good. Add on top of that the end performance by Rachel McAdams, the sweetest actress in all of Hollywood, and you suddenly find yourself cheering for a fictional Icelandic band in a fictional Eurovision contest in this feel good movie of crazy corona summer of 2020. Well done! Well done indeed!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I found myself tearing up over a film that (on the surface) seemed rather average...,"I think when people see Will Ferrell on the casting list, they immediately think that it's going to be a laugh out loud movie, which I myself fell victim for. The film wasnt as funny as I had thought it would be, but instead found myself in tears at the end of the film. This is because this movie PERFECTLY represents what Eurovison is about, a proud cultural phenomenon that strives in diversity and community. This is a MUST SEE movie. The final song is beautiful, and the characters that are developed on screen become more lovable by the end of the film. There were also a few cameos too, of course there were going to be cameos! If you love Eurovision, you will fall in love with this!",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Jaja Ding Dong!,"I would have never guessed that one of my favorite songs of the summer would be Jaja Ding Dong by none other than Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams vocal stand-in but hey, here we are. Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, much in the same vein as Ferrell's other film, Blades of Glory, tells a heartwarming story with tremendous comedic effect while also entertaining an audience with its musical thrills and surprising them with its heart. There's plenty to love about Eurovision, including an endearing turn from McAdams, who seems to be truly finding her home in Comedy, a production and costume design that is among the year's best, and Ferrell back at the top of his game. Safe to say, with many movies not releasing this year, Eurovision is near the top for me.7.8/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Can't believe I had tears in my eyes!,"This is way way better than I expected. It's fun and entertaining. It even brings tears to my eyes at the end, which is very unexpected! I really enjoyed it.",,Anonymous,Music
Extraordinary!,"I will disclose this. I am not a Eurovision fan. I think it is a pretty lame exhibition of crummy pop music masquerading as something legitimate. Now of course, I am a moody nihilist from the US and find this kind of music benign and boring, but how does this thing exist? With that in mind, I kinda liked this movie.It's stupid, it's over the top and it's like a hyper realized world like Blades of Glory or Zoolander. What makes this funny is how blurred is the reality versus the parody? I'm gonna go on a limb and say not a whole lot.The story begins with the haphazard group Fire Saga, a neo-techno disco group desperately trying to make the Eurovision contest. Well at least one of them is, for it's quite obvious that Lars Ericksson is hung up on the contest while Sigrit is hung up on Lars (which is a huge reach...who would not desire Rachel McAdams!!). Lars is something of a loser, and the way he dresses and carries himself absolutely clashes with the small fishing village he lives in. But by a weird series of events, Fire Saga actually makes the Eurovision finals!!The story pretty much follows any rom com ever made once they make it to Scotland. Lars makes bad arbitrary decisions, Sigrit is being chased by another man (or is she?), Lars makes a huge mistake, comes back, proves his love for Sigrit and after all is said and done, is content with his life.There is nothing really special in the second half of the film, but the Fire Saga songs are pretty darn awesome (even if they are parodic). I mean, they trot out all these other past real life Eurovision competitors and you realize their music is equally ridiculous and benign...so is this a true representation?I will say this, the song at the end is a real banger. I would venture to say if pop music had that kind of heart, I might listen more often. But of course, real pop music is far too easily digestible to be that moving.Yea, I have taken a lot of pot shots at the movie, but I gave it a seven because of the college students. I hate Arizona State, and the portrayal of ASU male students was pretty darn spot on. And of course, they had to have a self hating Arizona student with them. All of the insults Will Ferrell hurled at them had me rolling in the aisles. Anyway, bravo film, bravo.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Doesn't take itself too seriously,"I expected to HATE this movie and almost turned it off after 10 minutes, but so glad I didn't! This movie is filled with stereotypes, which was a little distracting in the beginning. Isn't this offensive to the people of Iceland?? Then I did my research and found out that it's actually mostly foreigners who think it's offensive to Iceland, while Iceland gets the joke and is having a laugh. Stereotypes and over the top performances ARE Eurovision, so I ended up being glad they ran with it. They had some good Eurovision classic references in there and it was just an overall feel-good movie. I don't remember the last time I actually laughed out loud at a movie from the sheer sillyness of it. It wasn't a so bad it's good type of situation, but just genuinely an enjoyable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Beautiful...,"So silly and exaggerated that it was fun ... A very delicate musical, with a ""handsome father"" ... Some shots so silly that they are fun, with inside jokes, between Europeans and Americans, ""Are you gay? - No, me I am russian."" (?!?!?!)

A joyful and feel good watch once in a while,"I think what a true movie passionate as I consider myself is the ability to adjust expectations according to the type pf movie you watch and still find enjoyment in it. This means to be able to enjoy also a funny and easy feel good movie like this that, btw, has a lot of really funny moments and had me in stitches a couple of time.
So yeah, suspend your disbelief and let yourself enjoy a funny trip from Iceland to Edimburgh and back!
Finally a film to watch with family too.
I cannot help to underline the great job that Rachel McAdams makes with her role. I felt that her expressivity really holds large part of the movie. Kudos to her.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A Will Ferrell film that didn't suck...,"...for which I give Rachel McAdams and the supporting cast all the credit. By now we recognize the buffoonish character that Ferrell plays in every movie. What really carries this flick is the charm that McAdams exudes in every scene. IMHO, McAdams is a seriously underrated actress and her ability to make you forget Ferrell's potty humor showcases it beautifully. Now not every joke lands but there are some good bits that buoy you beyond the cringe-inducing moments. There is a good deal of fun throughout and some songs contestants sing in the contest are actually quite catchy. If you're looking for something to put on in the background while doing other things, you could find far worse than this fluffy Netflix original.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Lighthearted Fun That Goes On and On...,"This movie i feel is two separate movies. It is one part a Romanic Comedy/love story and then the other is a Bizarre Eurovision parody/satire. And I feel like this movie gets in the way of it's self.The most successful part for me was the Eurovision side. It just works better. It captures the silly, fun, cheesy aspects of the Eurovision Song Contest. People have been saying that this movie is ""weird and bizarre"" and I agree somewhat but I think it can take it self serious at times. It has flashes of bizarreness but then gets weighed down by other things. I think the best scene is at the big party where it is a huge ""flash mod/singing medley"". It is so strange but so fantastical.The jokes...they are not that great. Some are like fine but others just don't land at all and to make it even worse you are forced to listen to them twice a lot of the time. Characters will constantly repeat a joke that has just left another characters lips seconds ago. I don't know if they thought it was so funny that we needed to hear it twice or if they just didn't want us to not hear it and miss out.The songs are really good. They really capture that cheesy, over the top, fun energy of Eurovision. They could all pass as Eurovision songs but they are also tinged with humour so I really think they did a good job on them and someone really took the time to get that right.The start of the movie is also very pretty with the shots of Iceland, it really makes you want to go and visit it.Unfortunately this movie is also too long. 2 hours for a story that could have been told in 1 hour 20. I think they needed to trim it down and tighten it up. It also seems paced strange as there seems to be a few like climaxes where you think ""oh it must be ending soon...oh no wait there is still 30 minutes left"".So you could watch it especially if you love Eurovision. You will find something you like about this movie.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Euro-fun! A feel-good and funny movie.,"If you are a fan of song contests and emotional success stories which might evoke your inner feelings, then you will be well entertained with this film. If you are a fan of Eurovision you will like this even more! And if you are a fan of Will Ferrell, then don't miss this! He depicts a funny Icelandic musician who is willing to give anything to win the Eurovision Song Contest, He has some great scenes together with the female lead Rachel McAdams, (also an Icelandic musician in the film), who is giving an amazingly heartfelt and sweet performance. The music in the film is great and the performances of various artists are rather notable and give that special Eurovision vibe. Also the production of this film is supported officially by EBU (European broadcast union) so the realism in the competition rules, style and overall look in the film is great. Not to mention the beautiful Icelandic scenery and some funny stereotypical comments from Europeans about other Europeans, and mentions to countries such as Greece, Russia, Sweden etc. All together, creates a kind-of magical sweet success story about true love, about following your passion and about being proud of what you do.

GREAT!!!,"As a European living in America I don't understand why people are surprised that the US made a movie about Eurovision. The US makes movies primarily for an american audience. Of course they'll make this. They have the money, the skills, and the experience to pull this off and THEY SURE DID!! This movie had it all. The songs were actually SO GOOD! The singing was amazing. The story was obviously nothing original. But it's like eating your favorite ice cream. You've had it a million times and it still tastes great!And to all the 1 star reviewers - you must seek help immediately because you clearly need a reality check.

Much better than I expected.,"First thing to say is that I'm a big Will Ferrell, and Eurovision, fan, and so I was a little dubious as to what to expect of this film.
I was very pleased to see that my fears were totally unfounded.
In a year when there was no Eurovision to watch, this made for an acceptable substitute.
Whilst a viewer would not need to be totally au fait with Eurovision to enjoy this movie, I do feel that a liking for the subject helps increase the pleasure.
There were several laugh out loud moments for me.
The storyline was a little predictable, but this did not matter at all for me.

"Great music, just not Will","The singer that sings for Rachel McAdams character is so unbelievably talented, and the final song honestly deserves to win the Oscar for best original song (move over Shallow) however I feel like Will Ferrells singing and part almost ruined the songs. I've never been a huge Will fan, and from the previews I thought he may surprise me, but it's just Will being Will. And the singer that does duets with him just blows me away every time she sings, and then he sings and it just really dampers it.
With that being said, besides the weird romance between the ""maybe siblings"" it was a great plot and very entertaining.I also really really loved Olafur Darri Olafsson in this. I watch him as Bing on the show NOS4A2U and I'm very impressed with his range of acting.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

But that's not the point.What it does offer to the audience is a bit of fun and escapism, and a bunch of good laughs and cringe-worthy moments. It also left me a little lighter in spirit, and It reminded me to take the world less seriously. This was just what I needed during a pandemic, rampant racism, a horrible government and climate change out of control. There's so much that is wrong, that a little right is helpful.

A movie that pays tribute to Iceland and Eurovision,"Iceland is a small and isolated country in the middle of the Atlantic and we the Icelandic people have many traditions that may seem strange to other people.For this reason I find that we Icelanders are many times made fun of in pop culture. We eat shark that is nasty höhö. So tired of this guys seriously.This movie does not make fun of Iceland it pays tribute to Iceland. It uses many famous Icelandic actors and there are loads of small references to Icelandic things that only people how have been to Iceland would pick up on.A part from all that the movie is great.

"Surprisingly Good, Absolutely Funny Movie with Great Singing and Catchy Tunes","As many stated before me, this movie surpasses your expectations. Hilarious at times, but also thrilling and captivating. I disagree that everything is predictable in it, there are some great twists and even shocking scenes. The casting is almost perfect although I'd given the main role (Lars') to someone else. Pierce Brosnan and Dan Stevens are fantastic, in fact, I liked the Russian character the most. "" A pet tiger? It can be arranged."" I laughed so hard at that line. The music was Eurovision Song Contest level great, the performances well-thought and designed, the actors very good and if nothing else, this movie definitely promoted Iceland rather than ridiculed. The 9 is simply because I so wanted the main character to go and have that exciting life with that hot and super-talented singer instead of choosing a mediocre life.

I have to say as a UK native we haven't won in a long long time so the only implausible part of the film is that it is in the UK and the hosts are not British but apart from that I will be watching this film anytime I feel sad as it has made my evening and made up the fact that eurovison was cancelled this year!Enjoy the film and don't take it seriously because Eurovision is just fun and meant to be enjoyed!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

"Silly, but Still Lots of Fun","Will Ferrell tends to overplay his roles and sometimes it works (Anchorman and Step Brothers), but IMO, a lot of times it does not. Here, his oblivious character works somewhat and the movie has a heart that will draw you in.Ferrell and Rachel McAdams play Icelandic singers, Lars and Sigrit, a duo who live to perform in a European music competition known as Eurovision. When a disaster strikes the other Icelandic contestants, they get selected to represent Iceland, even though they are...well not great. Pierce Brosnan plays Lars' dad who tries to dissuade him from seeking his dream. Dan Stevens plays a Russian singer in the competition who tries to seduce Sigrit. He could have been a one-dimensional villain, but he comes off as a decent guy who is just a bit full of himself. Several former performers from the actual Eurovision competition appear as other contestants.The movie is kind of dumb, but it has a really big heart. You can't help but be drawn in to the competition. McAdams' Sigrit, especially, is so sweet and charming, you start to root for the two. There is a fantastic scene of all the competitors at a party where they break into a group rendition of ABBA's Waterloo. Its so well done, I felt my feet tapping unconsciously.I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. There is definitely a lot of silliness and Ferrell's hamming did affect my rating downward, but the overall film deserves to be viewed. Enjoy it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

A Nordic Triumph,"I'm an American who's been living in Europe for 15 years and had never heard of Eurovision before moving here. I now watch it each year and think it's hilariously kitschy, spectacular, and, every now and then, there's even a great song. This film brilliantly captures all of those elements of Eurovision in a film that's both extremely funny and moving. The song ""Husavik"" is genuinely great and there are some other fabulous musical moments as well, such as the ""songalong"". I suspect that most of the bad ratings come from Americans who've never seen Eurovision before and probably haven't ever been to the Nordic countries, so don't have a sense of what's funny about the characterizations of both. I don't say that with arrogance - I also didn't know before I moved here! In any case, I hope Americans will give this gem of a film a chance. It was clearly made with love and Will Ferrell took a risk making a film about a country he must have known most Americans have no interest in. Probably the most fun I've had watching a film this year, and I watch a lot. . .",10.0,Anonymous,Music

Will Ferrells love letter to the Eurovision,"I was very positively surprised by the movie. I thought, knowing Ferrell it would have been more of a parody of the eurovision contest, than what it really was. It felt so warm, and with so many positive emotions towards the contest. It was funny, but without mocking either the islandic community, or as said the eurovision. I'm European, not super-fan of eurovision, but very much aware of the contest. And it felt so accurate. Very good fun flick, pacing is good, entertainment value is great, comedy is good as well, never really a dull moment. It did what it set out to - entertain the people, without making a masterpiece of movie art, in any sense. You can of course criticize the movie for a lot of stuff, namely the dull plot, and the fact it isn't very original.

Fire Saga: The Story of European Idol,"Right up front I feel like I need to say that I normally don't love Will Ferrell movies. I can appreciate the man being brilliant at what he does but so many of his movies just annoy the bejesus out of me. Those lower expectations may have helped here though because I actually really enjoyed this movie. McAdams and Ferrell are both wonderful and hilarious here and the outrageous situations they find themselves in completely worked for me.The best part of this isn't the performances or the comedy though. Don't get me wrong, there were laughs and I think they're doing a good job here but what really sells this movie is the set work and the music. There are some gorgeous sets and locales here and it's just a wonderful movie to look at. Aside from that the music was actually really good too. I could totally see myself listening to this soundtrack later on and I do feel like those two factors bump up the enjoyment from decent to actually pretty fun.EuroVision is a weird movie but there is a lot of fun to be had here. It's a fun enough movie that I'd recommend it to most people as just a casual, good time flick without requiring a huge investment. To that end, this is perfect background material because you'll get those great songs and when you do glance over you'll probably see something pretty on screen. Definitely worth the time.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Will Ferrell Can Still be Funny,"I very nearly ignored this movie entirely because Will Ferrell's recent run of laugh-free pseudo-comedies, like 'The House,' 'Holmes and Watson,' and the sequel everyone asked for 15 years ago but stopped asking for five years ago, 'Zoolander 2.'Will Ferrell, one of the beloved comedy gods of my youth, had forgotten how to be funny.This reality devastated me. I had spent hours watching and re-watching his early movies, always laughing uproariously. These were movies Ferrell not only starred in, but movies he often wrote. The guy was a one-man comedy tornado. And then he wasn't.So, when I saw the promo for 'Eurovision' I was content to give it a hard pass. I was not about to let Will Ferrell hurt me again. But then one friend told me the movie was funny. Then another. I decided to give it a shot.Remarkably, within the first five minutes, I could already tell this movie was different than Ferrell's recent bombs. It was sweet, and it was endearing, and most importantly, it was funny.Granted, it is not masterpiece. Sure, Rachel McAdams' accent disappears and reappears, often in the middle of a sentence. It's okay. I accept the flaws, because Will Ferrell showed me he could still be funny.'Eurovision' tells everyone it's okay to believe in your dreams. I'm telling you it's okay to believe in your past-their-prime comedy heroes. They just might come through for you.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Well worth a watch for Eurovision fans.,"The Story of Fire Saga is very silly, there's no doubt about that, but it doesn't feel as if it makes the most of being set amongst the infamous singing contest that has provided copious moments of entertainment over the years. Will Ferrell is as you'd expect Will Ferrell to be in a film like this while Rachel McAdams proves yet again that she belongs in more comedies. The songs are absolute belters and there are some very funny moments along the way however, it suffers from being a tad too long, comedies running for two hours or more will always find it hard to sustain the laughs.

Also a tip for the people who are new to this: there are a lot of original former contestants in hit. Also the commentator for the contest Graham Norton is in it. Just enjoy it for what it is! It's not a mainstream production but in fact a quite original one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly enjoyable,"Anyone who knows me know that I'm not an ESC fan, very much because I'm not into the kind of music that appears there every year. I'm more into metal and alternative rock.Therefore I was highly sceptical from the outset about this movie when my friends insisted we would watch it. It felt like it would be 2 hours of cheesy fan fiction that would be hard to stomach. However, I'm surprised how enjoyable it was.Funny of course, but most of all that it was produced with an unexpected depth and it gives you a warm feeling. But sure, at times the tempo of the film gets quite uneven and some scenes can be a drag to watch. But the positive sides outweigh the bad ones. The ""Husavik"" song gives the film a beautiful climax and every time I listen to it, it gives me goosebumps. To be fair, Will Ferrell is not the one who carries the movie. It's mostly thanks to Rachel McAdams and Dan Stevens that it gets as good as it gets. Pierce Brosnan didn't leave a deep impression on me, quite flat performance. Graham Norton's participation gave the movie some extra spice.So, all in all I feel generous enough to give this flick 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Messy start with incredible ending.,"I am not a huge fan of blockbuster comedies. Half the time the script is sloppy and the final edit ruins the delivery of the best jokes- two things that are painfully present for the first half of this film. However, none of it is glaring and can be overlooked. But if you are a stickler for effortless and seamless storytelling then I have a suspicion you'll turn this off in the first thirty minutes. No matter what, you'll laugh. The humor is clever and the two leads, Ferrell and McAdams, are incredible together, with the latter delivering a nuanced, believable, over-the-top character that Ferrell struggles to land every now and then on his end. The ending satisfyingly ties together the loose ends from the first half with surprising emotional weight- I won't lie I teared up but that's to be expected. Ideal for families with mature kids, middle school and up, and for any fan of comedies.
Lastly, it was refreshing to see a foreign-set comedy that equally laid into the United States, especially when the leads are Americans playing Icelanders in a tongue-in-cheek caricature.",,Anonymous,Music

Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Rachel McAdams who played as Sigrit Ericksdottir, Dan Stevens who played as Alexander Lemtov and Pierce Brosnan who played as Erick Erickssong, and they were all simply amazing.

He simply looked too old for the role in my and my gf's opinion, and we are only about a decade younger than mr Ferrell. The same difference he has with the character that played his dad. It looked a little silly. We both liked almost everything else about it. It was a comedy musical, well done, with likable characters. A feelgood movie mostly.The only thing we were expecting but didn't get, was raunchy homosexual jokes. We are talking about Will Ferrell in Eurovision after all.

Even if the movie itself is somewhat too long for the format (some 20 minutes less would work much better) it doesn't feel stretched overall. Meanwhile musical parts are not overdone and even if you are not a fan of musicals they are OK.

In the end, of course, they overcome all the obstacles that really matter, and it's an enjoyable ride along the way

We all desperately needed this distraction,"Will Ferrell's recent filmography has been hit or miss, to say the least. In fact, when is the last time we've been treated with an actual ""good"" Will Ferrell movie? Well, it may not be a masterpiece, but the 2020 Netflix original 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' is an over-the-top take on the annual campy competition that engulfs Europe over bragging rights for the best performer in all of the land.In 'Eurovision,' we witness the unconventional partnership between Ferrell's wannabe ABBA-like global star Lars Erickssong and his partner Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Rachel McAdams in an uncharacteristically comedic role) - also known as Iceland's dynamic singing duo Fire Saga. Of course, anything can (and will) happen on the road to the big show, as we find out. Yes, there's a lot of manufactured drama here, and general silliness, but 'Eurovision' somehow manages to show it has a heart.Perhaps the most surprising aspect of 'Eurovision' is its soundtrack. Given low expectations, it's a refreshing surprise to hear tracks like the future Icelandic anthem 'Husavik' and of course the earworm that is 'Double Trouble' (we'll ignore 'Lion of Love'...yikes). The omnipresent beats and synths of Eurodance string the cliched plot along in a way that makes it feel less offensive.Again, it's definitely not perfect, but for what it is, 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga' is a welcome escape in a year that has been in dire need of saccharin distractions.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

A beautiful mess of a movie that most ESC-fans will enjoy,"I'll try and keep this short.
I liked this movie very much. It's very noticeable how much fun the cast had while doing this movie, and it's super contagious.Overall, the movie is not the most faithful adaptation of the ESC, and you should know that going in to it.
But most of the songs sound like they could appear in the ESC and their staging is very faithful to how Eurovision usually looks, and I'll admit that the last time Fire Saga sung (you know which song) it actually hooked me. I'd love to buy the soundtrack of this movie.Yet, it is not without its faults. The movie is riddled with weird cuts, deus ex machinas and plot holes, and the third act is utterly insane.
But then again, so is the ESC, and that is what we all love about this show. The cringeworthy hosts and numbers, the ridiculous middle acts etc. - and it is kind of poetic how the movie portrays that in a way, intended or not.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

2hrs3m of confusing Americans,"Firstly, before I have even watched the film, I absolutely love the audacity of its existence. Literally no one asked for Eurovision 'The Movie', and yet what a strangely great premise for a story. I liked this even more upon learning that Will Ferrell himself is a big fan of the contest, and was a major hand in getting this film from paper to living room TV.I feel that I should pre-empt this review by stating that I watch Eurovision religiously every year, and that the date is CLEARED from my diary as soon as I learn it. The film itself does a pretty good job at explaining why Eurovision is so popular - the whole thing is a caricature of itself, and I love that Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga continues this tradition. From the get-go, it knows exactly what it is and should be - cheesy, campy and over-the-top. Eurovision was wise in seeing its own indulgence and being able to self-deprecate for a large portion of the movie, which I fully commend. Being directed by David Dobkin, who appears to have directed mainly music videos, was probably a good choice for these reasons. Also, the fact that the film has a subtitle makes me think...is this the start of a saga?! Forget the MCU, from now on I'm attending midnight screenings of the ECU...After Holmes & Watson (2018), things could really only go up for Will Ferrell, and this film has its fair share of welcome Ferrell-esque slapstick and humour. As with his other films, some of the quips fall flat and some tickle you for hours after the credits have rolled - it's always a mixed bag. Unfortunately, Eurovision had a few more duff notes than you would usually find, but thankfully the film moves on quickly enough to forget about it, unlike films by a certain Sandler that often crack a joke and leaves silence after it as if it's a comedy set, but even the tumbleweed doesn't feel like interrupting.I digress.If you're a fan of the annual contest, the inclusion of a few familiar faces is a nice touch. The effort gone into the production is truly commendable - I'm told that a full song was written and performed for every country that would usually compete in Eurovision. The ironic thing is that pretty much every song heard could quite easily pass as a winner of the contest. The 'song-along' (essentially glorified music video/karaoke) about halfway into the runtime was a fun little showcase, however did feel a little shoehorned in for the sake of a single to release with the film. Upon checking Spotify after, my hypothesis was confirmed. This could have been done better and be less incongruous with the pacing.The, for lack of a better word, 'villain' was a little bit of a concerning choice for me. Of all of the European countries to choose from for a 'bad guy', they decided to go for... yep, you guessed it! Russia. It really is a lazy film trope in 2020, made even more of a bizarre choice when the 'booing' incidents of Eurovision 2014 and 2015 are still fresh in the minds of many. Casting a person from the UK as the villain might have been a funnier choice and a little more tongue-in-cheek as, and I quote the film itself, ""everyone hates the UK"".I was told by a friend before watching this film that if I like Blades of Glory (2007), I'll enjoy Eurovision 'The Movie'. Perhaps this kept the memory of Chazz Michael Michaels fresh in my mind, but I couldn't help noticing the almost uncanny similarities between the two films throughout my viewing. For starters, both films feature Will Ferrell with long hair and a big personality, and not to mention explore the subject of underdogs in a big competition. However, even the smaller plot beats match scene by scene - one conversation that includes characters that may or may not have had sex with each other for the sake of sabotaging a rival duo could have been stripped word-for-word from Jimmy MacElroy for all I know. Yes, if it ain't broke then don't fix it - but also try not to create a carbon copy that ends up being inferior to the original!Wow. I've really written all this on a movie in which Graham Norton stars as himself. Regardless, everyone needs a feelgood movie from time to time, and truth be told, this movie made me smile a lot in a time when doing so is quite a rarity - and there's nothing wrong with that, right?Very much enjoyable Ferrell-style-flick. 7 stars.EDIT: It's the day after I've watched the film and I have listened to nothing but the soundtrack, so they must have done something right in that department.

A tonal mess but wins you over with heart and music,"Not sure what to say about this movie. It's kind of satire at times, but not exactly when it should be. The music and production is quite good. Will Ferrell (who I love) is terribly miscast and I almost think his comedic voice weighed the movie down. He should have played a villain or an eccentric rather than the romantic lead. His awkwardness in the role just doesn't help when the movie is trying to be sincere. It didn't spend enough time establishing the characters and relationship which is kind of forgivable in comedy, but it's kind of not a comedy at times.

Drawn out and contrived,"Honestly I watched the whole film to see them flesh out the Volcano Man production, which never materialized. Even after seeing the film, that little clip is the part of it with the most production value.The best part of it was the dumbed down introduction to the Eurovision world.

Instantly a Eurovision classic - is it too soon to watch again?,"As a huge Eurovision fan, this movie was everything I hoped it would be and more! The songs are so Eurovision and would be believable as genuine entries to the real contest. The song Husavik gives me goosebumps every time I listen.The humour was funny and silly but the film has so much heart as well which really surprised me. I'm not sure if you have to be a true Eurovision fan to really feel that this film does go deeper than what's on the surface. We didn't get a contest this year, this more than makes up for it, but we did get a special on the BBC (and across the world!) where the hosts were virtually speaking to this years entries and past contestants. This programmme really moved me and it was really heartwarming to see Europe come together through this crisis, and this film gave me the same feeling knowing Eurovision fans all around the world would most likely be checking this movie out as a replacement for a show this year. If there was a perfect time for this film, it's now!The only thing missing in the film was the postcards!! They could have done something so cool with these so I wish they'd been included but either way it's still a 10/10 from me!The low scores really baffle me, you have to take this film for what it is. You're not sitting down to Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, this is some lighthearted, heartwarming fun.

Absolutely Horrid- Will Ferrells worst film by a large margin,"I am not European and not familiar with the Eurovision so maybe I don't ""get it"".. but I feel like even if I did I would not like this movie. Some scenes are just gut wrenchingly bad and I cringed several times while watching. There were a couple parts toward the end that made me chuckle but not laugh out loud funny.. I was hoping for more of a ""Blades of Glory"" type film that you know going into it is going to be stupid but still has it's funny moments. This was just atrociously bad and lacked all of the funny moments you'd expect from a Will Ferrell film.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enjoyable, predictable","Some trimming and more satire would help, but this still raises a few grins, particularly the Russian baritone with his tiger fetish. The predictability of the targets is no problem, but the film is perhaps too respectful of the event, it's participants and audience, and only lovingly mocks them. It would be interesting to watch a documentary on this strange manifestation of human culture, and all its behind the scenes politics.",,Anonymous,Music
Wonderfully Weird,"Went in with fairly low expectations for this film...Ferrell has his typical over the top emotional outbursts (just like almost every film he's ever made) and once again, Rachel McAdams plays the Icelandic version of her usual angsts character choices. And yet, for whatever reason, that combination of actors and the weirdness of the storyline made for a fairly entertaining movie. My Marianne provides the vocals for McAdams which really shine on their Eurovision performance. It's probably not going to win any Oscars, but, it's surprisingly enjoyable if you give it a chance.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprisingly good,"Man, when I wrnt into this movie the only thought I had was ""Another Will Ferrell comedy. A few laughs but stupid overall.""

The movie sacrifices some laughs for a genuine story and I loved it. It still has those dumb humor moments, but they are rarer than before. Hooefully there will be more like this.

However, it does slightly redeem itself towards the end, Rachel McAdams gives a great performance & the film is bookended by 'Ja Ja Ding Dong'... so gets a 3/5 for that.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The best Eurovision event this year.,"..and probably would have been even if they had had a real show this year.
For me that has watched the eurovision since I was small this was an emotional roller coaster ride. The movie is not a comedy as such, even if there are more than a handful of laughs and giggles. It is more of a feelgood drama with comedic and goofy undertones. In fact I think a lot of the movie manages to hit the goofy tone of much of the Eurovision. It parodies a lot pf Eurovision song contest, which is probably lost on a casual or someone who never watched the ESC show. Payback to the americans when we had to watch otherwise good movies against backdrops of hard to enjoy or understand stuff like american football, basketball or (snore) baseball. But as well as goofiness, there are also deeply romantic and sad parts. The music, for the most part, is excellent, better than the average ESC fare.
Good efforts from Will, Rachel and Pierce Brosnan who is great as the stern and sane father.
Bad is a stretch in the middle of the movie and any mention of p----. Why is that even there?
Ohh, and this movie makes me want to go to Iceland right now. Was there for 4 days last year and it was great, beautiful country despite having few trees and friendly people.
Ps2. There was a phone voting in my country for the ESC contestants despite there not being a big contest, and Iceland won. Iceland for the win!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

A big dosage of dumb fun,"Much like the contest of its title, Netflix's latest high-profile comedy, that re-teams Wedding Crashers director David Dobkin with that films participants Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is all over the top color and joy with little substance to substantiate it but delivers exactly what it promises to do, lots of silly and fun entertainment.Sharing a great chemistry together, heightened by the fact McAdams continues to prove her powers in the comedy game after a stand out turn a few years back in Game Night, Eurovision may outstay its welcome slightly at a generous two hour runtime but there's enough winning moments here to make the oddball trip we take worth it.Filled with a killer soundtrack and some original ditties with titles such as scene stealer Ja Ja Ding Dong, Volcano Man and Lion of Love, Eurovision wears its heart on its sleeve as its game cast commit to every aspect of Dobkin and Ferrell's wild ride (with Ferrell helping pen the script after being inspired by his own love for the famed singing contest), making this one of those infectiously enjoyable offerings, that despite your better judgement, you can't help but enjoy.Following the journey of Ferrell and McAdams long-time Icelandic based friends and music lovers Lars Erickssong and Sigrit Ericksdottir, as they find themselves unexpectedly representing their home country in the worlds biggest song contest, Eurovision introduces us to a wide range of colorful characters and side players from Dan Steven's flamboyant Russian singer Alexander Lemtov, Pierce Brosnan's grumpy music hater and father to Lars Erick and Demi Lovato's unfortunate Katiana but the film really shines when its simply Ferrell and McAdams alone doing their best work.Seeming a little too old for this kind of thing now, Ferrell is his usual overplaying it self as the obsessive Lars but when his playing alongside the elves-believing McAdams as Sigrit, the film finds a genuinely nice groove that it can bounce along from, especially with McAdams embedding so much charm and heart into her role, elevating Eurovision from acceptable comedy to the perfect dumb antidote to the world in which we find ourselves in now.Final Say -A big dumb overblown comedy that never attempts to become anything more than a silly and brash comedic exercise, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga successfully reunites Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as it delivers solid laughs and toe-tapping tunes.3 portaloo's out of 5",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Not that funny,"Will Ferrell movies are normally love or hate. I found this one lacking, but not terrible. The acting is okay and the jokes are very cliched, which is the point, but the problem is Will Ferrell is just being him, and without a great comedy partner, he's like Garfunkel without Simon, or Sonny without Cher..

"""Give up your dreams now while you're still young.""","This is pretty funny.Even for someone who does not have a clue about Eurovision or what it is (that's me). Even for someone who does not watch any reality shows like the voice, etc. (that's me, too). It's really quite fun.I'm sure someone who is well-versed in the Eurovision universe will probably enjoy it more... get all the insider jokes and such. But it was a great way to spend a few hours during a lonely holiday weekend (July 4) .I actually laughed out loud a few times - once when Lars yells out the line I use for the subject of this review, and again (and several times) when he makes fun of the americans (what he says is really quite pointedly accurate).This movie reminds me a bit of Momma Mia, a bit of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert. Both are movies I enjoy and which make me happy.I am an ABBA fan. And the very beginning makes my heart skip a few beats Silly me, being a dull american I didn't realize ABBA has some sort of history with Eurovision.Anyway, if you are looking for something fun to watch, here you go. Don't worry if you are clueless (like me) about Eurovision. You'll still like this. It's funny, emotional, romantic, cynical, and lyrical. A little something for everyone.I guess I don't give it a perfect score because something really needs to blow me away to get a 10 and this does not do that. It also is a little long... not a problem on the (sic) lonely holiday weekend during the pandemic, but (and again) there you have it.PS it was nice to see Mikael Persbrandt.

This shouldn't be good...but it is,"As a Dutchman I really wondered why. Why would you make a movie based on the Eurovision Songfestival? After all it is a weird thing 'we' do every year that 'nobody' really likes but we all take way too seriously. So when a bunch of Americans take on this event to make a movie it can only turn out to be as bad as many of the Dutch (or British) entries to the festival over the years. Right?The answer is no. Because for some reason the director and actors actually understood what Eurovision is about better than they should. Maybe better than we Europeans do. Its in all the details. Like sending acts hoping they won't win so you don't have to host. People saying they hate the show but still demanding to watch it in a bar. The outright weird songs with their bizarre lyrics (even if songs have become far better over the past 2-3 years or so). The way the American tourists are treated in this movie is almost a meta thing for this movie.The movie itself is simple but charming. A bit predictable but with great humor. There's sort of lightness to all of it that just makes it a joy to watch. Even if it drags a bit from time to time.
Ferrell and McAdams are cast perfectly even with their fake Icelandish accents that vary in thickness throughout the movie. This movie succeeds where a European production never could do. It captures the weirdness perfectly, turns everything up a notch and delivers some of the best songfestival hits ever. Its not a perfect movie but its actually better than the real deal!Go watch it!

"Musical but not only. Icelandic but International. Fun, but entertaining & also emotional ...","Such a 'feel good' movie !
Had a smile on my face (and a few tears at times) all along the movie ... I enjoyed this musical adventure from beginning to end.
For sure a comedy, but with a big heart.Will Ferrell is a genius, not just comedic but also creative. He also is a multifaceted talent who can infuse his ideas and concepts in all kinds of fields ! You clearly can feel his passion for music & soft spot for Eurovision (and everything it means ; a competition yes, but with this sense of community around the passion of music). Also, the will to show this sheer 'togetherness' through this international event that is Eurovision, is obvious and enjoyable to see, hear & feel all through the movie.Rachel McAdams' character (Sigrit) wonderfully balances Will Ferrell's character (Lars). While Lars' only focus is music & becoming famous worldwide, Sigrit brings her sweetness and large palette of deeper emotions. Two eternal dreamers that answer to one another in the most organic way. Because the chemistry between both actors is a gem that's really pleasant to witness in every scene they are together !The supporting cast (Dan Stevens, Pierce Brosnan & Melissanthi Mahut, for the most part) all nicely serve the evolution of the plot and highlight the two leads in the best possible way. And even if the movie is over-the-top at times, it also breathes multiple realistic emotions and situations that always work in this type of movie... Making you invested, cheering and feeling moved as much as you feel entertained. The movie isn't just gonna make you laugh or shed tears, because the whole soundtrack is very catchy ! The stage performances and production value pop with radiant lightings & colors !Certain scenes are really efficient and worth rewatching (the Semi-Finals' scene is exhilarating, the Song-Along one is a blast, the Final's song,...etc).Once again a Will Ferrell movie that might become a classic.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

IT HAS ITS MOMENTS - Technical Rating: 7.5/10 My Rating: 6.5/10,"YAYA DING DONG! If you know me, you know I am always the harshest critic when it comes to comedies.

And honestly, despite a few unnecessary cringe-worthy scenes, a few misfires of dry humour, and some eye-rolling dialogue, it really wasn't an awful movie watching experience ;). There are definitely some laughs to be had and a decent third act (music and performances are fine as well) - so, in conclusion I would say it's ??probably?? worth a watch!

He plays the ego-driven superstar who is alternately lovable and also despicable; really enjoyed watching him in this.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,"The Eurovision Song Contest. It gave Abba its big break and lots of other winners based on incomprehensible voting patterns. You can be sure Greece will give Cyprus high marks and vice-versa.It was always campy but fun. Nowadays it is campier than an episode of RuPaul's Drag Race with countries that are nowhere near the continent of Europe being eligible to enter.Will Ferrell who is a fan of Eurovision co-wrote this story and it has a lot of elements from other Ferrell filmsAfter watching Abba win the contest as a small boy. Icelandic Lars (Ferrell) has dreamt of representing his country in the Eurovision Song Contest. His dream comes true when a freak explosion kills off the other Icelandic competitors.Together with best friend Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) their group Fire Saga get the chance to represent Iceland. However the group are not that good and are accident prone with their complicated staging. Lar's grumpy father, Erick (Pierce Brosnan) is very vocal with how bad his son's singing is.Fire Saga go off to Scotland where the contest his held. Sigrit is being romantically pursued by a Russian competitor Alexander Lemtov (Dan Stevens.) Bad luck still follows them every time they perform their song on stage.Ferrell just about gets away with his same old schtick. It is McAdams with Sigrit's obsession with magical elves, her love for Lars that gives the movie and the songs heart.The film is sporadically funny, it is too long and inconsistent. Graham Norton pops up to do the commentary.Somewhere up there, Terry Wogan is laughing his socks off that they made a movie about Eurovision.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Very far better than I expected,"Will Ferrell is the only comedian capable of repeating the same character (a selfish middle age naive man with Peter Pan syndrome who grows up by the end ) and still able to get the public sympathy. His charisma is out of this world for sure.
His movies as cliche as they are always carry some surprise and this is not exception. You pretty much knows where it goes but still hook you up gladly.
This time Ferrell who is also a writer throw darts to politics, small town absurdities (and believe as funny as they seem are most of them real) and parents disdain about sons.
On the other hand, he increases Rachel McAdams performance who is lovable heere and with voice so angelic it will surprise you for good.

Funny enough for me.,"I remember the days when there were not many different tv channels to choose from, only about twelve, a couple from my country Belgium and the rest from neighboring countries. When it was Eurovision every freaking channel was broadcasting that show and I hated it. It's the lamest music possible, and the voting was quite ridiculous as neighboring countries would give eachother big scores no matter how bad it was. So yes i hated everything about that yearly show. Watching a movie about it would have never happened if Will Ferrell wasn't in it. I like everything with Will Ferrell, even though it's ridiculous humor, but he has one of those faces that makes me laugh so that's already enough for me to watch it. This one is probably not his best one but still I had some good giggles. The story is lame like the real Eurovision Song Contest is so it was funny enough quite realistic. I can see why people would hate it (those are the people that can't stand Will Ferrell) and I can see why people loved it (Eurosvision fanatics and Will Ferrell lovers), I'm between it so a six star rating seems fair to me.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Euro Trash (But in a Good Way),"GRADE: C+THIS FILM IS MILDLY RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Entertaining but light-weight comedy about dreaming your dream.JIM'S REVIEW: Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga is a very long title for a very long movie.

Call it a underdog story or an amusing Rocky rewrite with purposely bad music.Written by Andrew Steele and one of its stars, comedian Will Ferrell, the film tells its Icelandic tale of a middle age loser named Lars Erickssong whose dream it is to win the Eurovision contest, the musical equivalent of a vocal Olympics Game. His singing partner is Sigrit Ericksdóttir (a very winning Rachel McAdams), who, for some unknown reason, idolizes her bandmate. Their pairing is an imbalance, not only script-wise but as an acting team.The movie is silly fun, although, Mr. Ferrell is miscast in his own script. The actor does have some nice sight gags and pratfalls, but most of the time he belabors his character and lets his performance go off kilter. He plays Lars as if he is still performing on a SNL skit. There is no real chemistry or depth of character here and it's hard to believe his ""middle age status"". (He is a bit long in the walrus tusk for this role.) In all honesty, his performance simply lacks the light comedic charm needed to pull off this part and he weighs down all the joyous buffoonery from others in the cast. The miscasting is very obvious as he acts opposite the talented Ms. McAdams, who has a natural flair for comedy. She is a perfect fit, almost a 10. Also providing humorous moments are Pierce Brosnan as Lar's disapproving father and Dan Stevens as the narcissistic Russian crooner.Actually, the best parts of the movie are the snippets of the half-baked musical numbers. These fleeting moments are on-target spoofs with the typically over-produced staging and sexualized performances gyrating in full satirical view. Highlighting these scenes would have made a much funnier film. The filmmakers should have considered making this intriguing concept as a mockamentary instead of the formulaic rom/com that it is. If they had focused more on the outrageousness of the competition and shown the musical entries in their entirety, leaving out much of the predictable story, the movie would have been more laugh-out-loud funny than merely diverting fodder.Directed by tongue-in-cheek ill reverence by David Dobkin, Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga barely makes the semi-finals.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

difficult to merge into,"Second hour is good, but hard to figure out what's the core of the first hour, seems just like a big tourism ads for Iceland and Europe. in my opinion, no matter what background a movie has adopted, the key of storytelling should focus on the complexity between characters that connects with the backgroud, for example, Ferrary vs Ford, we barely know the sophistication of F1 racing but the movie really didn't talk about F1 racing much. It's really unnecessary to film so many content about the contest which is easily accessable on internet. and you can notice that some emotional scene was cut too short, maybe because too many useless view and Eurovision content.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The scenes that poke fun at the real life event are genuinely entertaining, and both Ferrell and McAdams put forth great comedic performances.

Eurovision is 30 minutes too long however, and one too many jokes fall flat. A less forgiving cut of this movie could be great.

The playful use of different pop music also really adds to the comedic elements of the film.All in all, this film isn't going to win any awards anytime soon.

All the songs in this movie are absolutely fantastic and by far the best part of the movie, they really nailed the eurovision vibe.
The main thing that brings this movie down is the story in between the songs. If this movie was 90 minutes I think it would be much better, but instead we get these drawn out conflicts that we all know the ending of and all we can do is just wait for them to resolve it and sing another fantastic song.
I would still recommend this movie if you want something stupid and fun, but not much else.

Eurovision works in spite of itself...,"This new offering from Netflix is a weird, wacky romcom starring Will Ferrell, Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan.While this movie never really treads new ground, it steadily reels you in largely because of the three leads. Ferrell and McAdams play two grown childhood friends who sing together as a duo/band with aspirations(mainly Ferrell's) to hit the big time and make it to a singing competition in Europe called Eurovision. McAdams happily does most of Lars' bidding because she's not so secretly in love with Lars. Truth be told, she's a far better singer than Lars by an Icelandic icy mile(I have no idea what that means). But, it's Lars' ambition that propels them to keep it through gigs.
They both decide to enter into an Icelandic singing contest that's sort of regional qualifier for Eurovision. Through some tragic, but funny plotting they both find themselves in the big show as it were.
Once in Eurovision they find they're just small minnows in a pool of big time sharks, hungry sharks at that. Enter the lusty, sexually disoriented Russian pop heartthrob Lemtov, lustily and tongue in cheekily played by Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey Fame. Now, we've all seen the plot mechanics where situations arise that place our heroes in romantic peril. This flick also mines that well trodden territory as well.
That said, this is where all of a sudden something strange takes place. The movie creeps up on the viewer and makes them start rooting for Sigrit and Lars. So much so, it's quite perplexing to figure out. That's why as someone who's seen countless RomComs, I whole heartedly must recommend this film because towards the last third of the film you actually care for the main characters and the entirety of their whole Icelandic crew. I think you'll find this weird kinship with how Icelanders must feel about their country and their little corner of the world. 7 stars...",7.0,Anonymous,Music

An entertaining tribute,"In order to fully appreciate the spirit of this tribute to European Song Contest, we need to put aside the generic plot elements that merely keep the story together, like unrequited love, daddy issues and childhood dreams and focus on the competition itself. It's a cultural phenomenon from Europe that somehow entirely escaped the American radar while reaching all the way to Australia. However things are starting to change, it's now broadcast in America as well. This spawned the American Song Contest which completely missed the point since the very concept doesn't really work outside a place like Europe. As a European myself, this movie is a great idea to answer basic questions about the competition because this place isn't merely a pile of different countries and political alliances but rich heritage and a cornucopia of identities that uses Eurovision as a platform that celebrates all that. An another thing that's crucial to the experience is the sheer variety of endless glam, kitsch, ballads, hilarious costumes and staging and the occasional cult classic that you see on stage.""The Story of Fire Saga"" is the fruit of Will Farrell's imagination fuelled by his Swedish in-laws that initiated him into what might be called the Eurovision cult because the average finale has more viewers than the Superbowl. A story about two friends from a small town in Iceland determined to take part in Eurovision, they put all their efforts into their band called Fire Saga which does, indeed, end up on the stage of the competition. Rachel McAdams is doing a fine job in the leading role, while they tick all the stereotype boxes (elves? Tick! Everyone is related? Tick! Lots of fish and ice? Double tick!). Their chemistry works but the romantic angle was probably a nod to the audiences that don't start hyperventilating as soon as they hear the sound of Alexander Rybak's violin. To please his target audience, there's music by Cher, Madonna and Black Eyed Peas. For the rest of us there's Celine Dion and ABBA, whose international careers took off after the competition. And to put the cherry on the cake for fans, a singalong with a group of Eurovision royalty like Loreen, Jamala, Salvador Sobral, Netta etc. Graham Norton pops in for a cameoas well, playing-naturally-himself, with the usual jokes at the expense of contestants.So, what's the final verdict on this? Ferrell tries to please everyone to an uneven success. Americans who can barely tell the difference between The Voice and Eurovision, and diehard fans who will be undoubtedly be pleased by Conchita's rendition of Ne Partez Pas Sans Moi or Sobral crooning on a piano. To my surprise, Will Ferrell can sing when he's not trapped inside a human-sized hamster wheel. True fans take their passion seriously so I wouldn't be surprised if the reaction get polarized either. But that's the hidden intention: to show you why so many people connect over music and that there are so many things that are still hidden in plain sight. As Ferrell brilliantly put it, Europe is more than a big party town. And Saga's karaoke-friendly soundtrack is destined for parties that take place everywhere from London to Tel Aviv before the main event. Before attempting to parody Eurovision, nobody does it better than they themselves. Grasping on this makes Ferrell's film a success.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Will Ferrell is no Borat and spoiled a good film,"My Review - Eurovision Song Contest - The Story of Fire Saga
Netflix
My Rating 6/10There are some good moments I this Comedy send up of the Eurovision Song Contest if it wasn't for its star ? Will Ferrell.I was tempted to watch this film when I saw the Academy Award Song from the film Husavik ""My Hometown "" performed by Molly Sandén .Set In the small town of Húsavík, Iceland, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit Ericksdóttir, ( Rachel McAdams) best friends since childhood, make music together as the band Fire Saga, much to the dismay of Lars' widowed father, Erick. ( Pierce Brosnan) Lars has one dream: to win the Eurovision Song Contest. Lars, in particular, is deeply into his ""art"", but at the local bar where they play, the only song the audience wants to hear is the suggestive nonsense song ""JaJa Ding Dong"". The pair apply and are randomly selected to take part in Söngvakeppnin, the Icelandic pre-selection for Eurovision. Sigrit, who believes in the old Icelandic tradition of elves, asks them to help them in the contest in the hope that, if they win, Lars will finally return her romantic feelings for him.Somewhere in this very expensive Production is good film in the style of the 1993 hit ""Cool Runnings"" but it's Star Will Ferrell ,who looks older than Pierce Brosnan who plays his father in the film ruined it for me . Even Rachel McAdams as Sigrid I thought too old for this role but she was cute in the film . Will Ferrell sang in his own voice. Rachel McAdams mimed to Molly Sandén who did sing in Eurovision.Will Ferrell's interest in the Eurovision Song Contest began when his Swedish wife Viveca Paulin took him to her cousins house in May 1999 and the family turned the competition on. Since then, he kept following it. In 2014, Ferrell traveled to Copenhagen, Denmark to watch the finale of The Eurovision Song Contest (2014), in which Conchita Wurst who appears in the film was crowned the winner.He wrote the screenplay to this film and was a Producer it's apparently his most popular movie in years but I wish he wasn't starring in it .However there is one star turn in this movie it's worth watching to see the ""Downton Abbey "" Dan Stevens star remember Matthew Crawley he's brilliant as the campy charismatic Russian entrant ( Gay dear not me dear we don't have Gays in Russia)
Alexander Lemtov . Dan has the best moments in the film and the best staged song
Dan Stevens wanted to perform in his own voice but due to COVID he couldn't get to the recording studio in time and his voice in the film is Swedish Baritone Erik Mjones.He does sing well Alexander (Dan Stevens) invites Lars and Sigrit to his party which is my favourite part of the film . Erik says says ""be my guests."" Dan Stevens played Beast in Beauty and the Beast (2017) which famously includes the song ""Be Our Guest"".The party scene at Alexander Lemtov's house was filmed at Knebworth House. Located in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, this stately home and its surrounding gardens are Grade II-listed and date back to the Tudor times.Obviously lot of people love this film I liked parts of it but Will Ferrell was definitely my stumbling block.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"It's official, Will Ferrell ain't funny any more","This movie is a spoof about a band from Iceland trying to win the Eurovision Song Contest. It's a kitschy and camp annual event that is roundly ridiculed by just about everyone in Europe and is never even heard of by the great unwashed in AmericaIt's such a fine line between a funny movie and a dud. ""Blades of Glory"" had me rolling in the aisles but this one had me hitting the fast forward button every couple of minutes , trying in vain to get a chuckle. None!Almost as bad as ""The House"" but really nothing could get as bad as that one, and the problem lands squarely in the lap of Ferrell.He co-wrote the script (with another ex SNL alumni) and it's heavily borrowed from The House.A very similar plot to ""Blades of Glory"" but it missed the mark by a wide margin.Ferrell's penchant for showing us severed limbs and hacked up faces just doesn't come across as funny any more and he seems to want to use these tricks when the plot dips into a deep valley.It's a pretty good premise to spoof the Eurovision Song contest but you've got to have some good satire and parody to pull it off and this just don't cut the mustard. The scriptwriters just ain't talented enough to draw the humour out.I've said it before about other movies and I'll say it again about this one.It's like watching a horse plowing a potato field, you know there's something happening but you're not interested enough to see what's going on.Some of the scenes are so embarrassingly ""unfunny"" that they must have given the colorists extra pay to take out the red faces... just cringingly bad.Netflix never listens to me ( or at least they haven't so far) but let me give the executive some advice.
Have someone check on the project during the process, someone to look at the rushes .. because it's obvious that nobody did .
If they had a quality control system then the plug would have been pulled on this bathtub of cold water, or somebody, somewhere would have said ""hit the reset button""I know comedy films are very very hard to get right , it involves a lot of luck , a funny cast and a spoofable subject. This one only has one out of the three and you can guess which one it is.Dan Stevens is pretty good , showing that he can shuffle off the typecasting from Downton Abbey, Rachel Mcadams is sometimes very difficult to look at.
As for Will Ferrell, well his SNL type humour is a thing of the past.This movie comes across as one of those lame sketches on SNL , sketches that have you wondering how they made it on the screen.(and there's lots of 'em)I just can't watch that show any more and I wouldn't be the first in line to re-watch this movie, that's for sure.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
A nice comedy with an important lesson to learn,"I enjoyed watching this comedy. The story is about a boy and girl who grow up with the dream of winning the Eurovision song contest. They grow up and get a chance to compete in this competition. The story is well-written. I saw nice acting from Will Ferell like always. Also, Rachel McAdams was great at acting. The movie shows a lot of nice locations in Iceland. However, almost half of the movie is on stage. The movie shows different plays and auditions for the contest. Those songs are exciting and fun to watch. In my opinion, comedy movies teach us important lessons most of the time. The lesson in this movie is to never give up and try hard for your dream. If you are a fan of comedy, you have to watch this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Pretty Good for a Netflix Movie :-D,"Usually i'm not very fond of most netflix movies. they make great tv shows but for some reason they rarely make a good movie. this time its finally something good.

Of course you pretty much know where the story is going so there are not too many surprises. Except maybe at the end. They found a pretty good ending for the movie. the female lead Rachel McAdams is also great. the have good chemistry together on the screen.

The best Eurovision that I have ever seen,"This movie was a complete surprise. Netflix does not make really good movies. For some reason they are always lack something extra (take all of Adam Sandler movies of late) or straight awful like""Coffee and Kareem"". This time it's different. It's actually surprisingly emotional and simply awesome movie, with an amazing cast. This is one of the best I've seen from Will Ferrell in a long time, probably since Anchorman 2.
This movie is a creation of Ferrell, as he's the one who co-wrote, produced and starred in it, so the credit goes to him. The funny part is, that it felt that he was a bit of mismatch looks-wise, for simply amazing Rachel McAdams.
The music is perfect reflection of Eurovision. It lifts the spirit and makes you smile.

A watchable movie but...,"Rachel McAdams for me, in terms of acting, was the high point in the film, but I don't detract from the work of other actors like Brosnan or Dan Stevens. The soundtrack is super catchy and has songs that get stuck in your head and you might listen them again later. And Demi Lovato's cameo is something I'm going to have a hard time to forget.
For me the worst of the movie was the screenplay and Will Farrell's performance. I thought the screenplay (written by Farrell) was completely based on stereotypes and lazy comedy. Farrell's performance, on the other hand, sometimes costs a lot to look at the screen and see him perform. In my opinion, he should stick to sketching on SNL and leave films for anyone who knows how to act.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Return to form for Ferrell,"This was a bit of a return to form for Ferrell. He's a very funny man but some of his last few outings, like Holmes and Watson, just weren't funny films.

But this film is a lot of fun and one I could gladly watch again, and soon.

Not really a comedy...but well worth seeing.,"Although this IS a Will Ferrell film, do not watch ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" thinking it will be anything like ""Talladega Nights"" or ""Anchorman"". In fact, I would go so far as to say I wouldn't even consider it a comedy...though it has some comedic portions. Instead, it's a strange tribute to Eurovision from some folks who seem to understand and love it.Now this MIGHT mean that the best audience for this movie are Europeans and folks from a few other countries that also compete in the competition (such as Israel, Turkey and Australia). After all, few Americans (apart from me and a few other strange folks) watch Eurovision or even know what it is or how it's conducted! But, if you don't know about it, you might still enjoy it...who knows?As far as the movie goes, it is the fictional story about Lars and Sigrit (Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams)...a singing duo who, frankly, don't seem very good. But through an odd set of circumstances, they find themselves the Icelandic entry into Eurovision!! Do they stand a prayer? Probably not...but the film is about them and how they manage to salvage some dignity out of this!What really helps this story is that so many Eurovision winners and famous competitors appear in the film. Additionally, they must have gotten permission to use the name, bumper music and more...making the film look and sound exactly like Eurovision!Overall, a wonderful and enjoyable film for anyone who loves Eurovision...and a mildly enjoyable movie for anyone else.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Could've been much funnier,"As a gay European, Eurovision is a big part of our culture, and I'm aware it's so cheesy and over the top, but you can't look away, it's a lot of fun.

However it doesn't take long until it looses it's mojo, and the tone gets over the place, there are some melodramatic moments, cheesy moments which I didn't expect, as it does to make fun of cheesy at the same time. Also it felt like they were quickly left out of jokes to make , like Lars being late for the song, storming on the stage, it was ok the first time, but then that happens again in the final act.

aggressively mediocre,"Where do I start? The whole movie looks like it was shot on an iPhone, for example making the tavern scenes look startlingly fake.

And the female singer's voice changes dramatically throughout the movie, which is jarring and insulting to the audience.The Graham Norton scenes were obviously shot on a tiny soundstage in England, with one camera, which feels cheap. Netflix couldn't have flown him out and situated him within the action?To fix this film, production should've been handled by another studio, say, Paramount. And it should have 30 minutes of fluff edited out of it. Two hours for a movie like this is unnecessary and kills the pacing.It's quite low on comedy moments, but is quite sweet at times which makes up for this.Overall it's a missed opportunity that could've been a lot funnier.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Funny at times with an okay plot,"It's a fine enough comedy that does what it needs to do, but never more.First the acting, Rachel McAdams is usually bad. She seems to pick the same lazy roles where she doesn't need to do any acting and just plays the ""attractive cute love interest"" role. Never doing any more than looking hot and delivering her lines with overblown fake ""cuteness"". In this movie on the other hand she plays a role with an Icelandic accent! Finally doing some real acting. It took some time for me to get over her fake cuteness and mediocre comedy acting, but it's overall not bad. The Icelandic accent does make this new. I don't dislike her, she has just played some awful roles before this that I had to judge her by. Will Ferrell is way too unattractive compared to Rachel McAdams to play a believable love interest, but he is damn funny and carries all the comedy in the movie.Dan Stevens is as always amazing. One of the best current actors. He plays the bad guy with a heart which is a great role. Then there are many other good roles like Melissanthi Mahut, Pierce Brosnan and Mikael Persbrandt. All in all the scenes work and the movie is not a lazy product.There are also some funny scenes fairly regularly and even the non-funny scenes are plot relevant so we are always moving somewhere. The humor and plot is fairly strong for a small movie and the Iceland jokes are great. But it never really goes past this silliness of Iceland being a small country and Eurovision being crazy. It did try to tell a greater story with a boat scene and the reason behind it, but it's just a few scenes we rush through. This is actually the main plot as such and very interesting as there is a big mystery element here and it's something the protagonists could solve. Yet the focus is on a personal journey and a romance, which is fine, but nothing new or that fascinating especially because Will Ferrell is totally unbelievable in this role. They basically ignore the main plot to give us a bunch of emotional personal drama.It's not a bad comedy. But it just feels like something we have seen before many times over. It's not inventive or creative enough. There are a lot of Eurovision style songs and crazy gay men everywhere. But it's not really that interesting to listen to some B tier song with no humor in it. It's not boring, but why is this the focus instead of the huge mystery? Mediocre music and weird people is not what I want in a good movie and I'm not sure why this is the focus over the main elements of the story. There is no great plot to recall here and nothing much that changed how I view Iceland or song contests. It's a bunch of comedic scenes and they all work, but the story is just pretty plain overall. It's very much in this high mediocre range of movies. A very strong 6/10 and nearly a 7. But it's a movie I will forget in a week which is not good.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Bring back ABBA,"Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga (2020) -While it seemed very much how I view the whole Eurovision schtick, this film was still a bit exaggerated and sometimes very silly in that typical Will Ferrell slightly juvenile trope.There were times where it was quite obviously joyful though, especially when they did the Song-A-Long towards the middle of the film.I'm sure a real Eurovision fan would have noticed all of the various performers from previous years that had cameos, but I could only spot Conchita Wurst for their specific style.I assumed that the producers and directors deliberately chose English speaking actors to play their roles with accents in order to add to the farce of the comedy, because it seemed very much of that sort of humour. There certainly weren't any moments from any of the actors that weren't done for amusement. It just wasn't that serious.I did feel however, that the films representation of the Icelandic people was a tad disrespectful and possibly a bit racist.Most of the accents and behaviours were on the questionable side to be honest, although I couldn't help enjoying the dig at Russia by showing it to be represented by a suggested homosexual throughout. That countries attitudes toward the rest of the world and the rights of people as a whole seem very archaic and perhaps deserve a bit of ribbing in my opinion.Otherwise there isn't actually a lot that I can say about this one, because it was what you would expect it to be. I will say that it was very ""Will Ferrell"" and also not essentially a film that looked like it had a lot of money spent on it or too many worries about delivering an Oscar winner.I thought that it was just put out to entertain and for the most part it did.They could have easily gone really over the top with ridiculing the contest itself, but instead decided to focus on the backstage romances and politics between the singers that little bit more, which I thought was the right idea.There were of course a number of musical performances and it was easy to enjoy them, either for their humour or for the pleasure of the piece.So, in summary, don't expect too much, but be prepared to giggle and relax listening to the music. It was a simple film made to provide entertainment. If Will isn't your thing, then don't watch it, but otherwise enjoy it.641.23/1000.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Needed some script-cleanup, but still has some enjoyable elements","Add me to the list of Americans who were clueless and didn't know anything about Eurovision prior to the release of this movie. I certainly like the idea, and found it to be quite fun when we get a few glimpses at the competition. But this movie isn't really about the song contest, it's about the band, Fire Saga. I have a relatively high tolerance for Will Ferrel's silly humor, so I definitely had some fun with this ridiculous movie. I kind of wish it was a little more grounded and not quite so hammy because it feels like there is potential for a good inspirational story here. The dedication of these two characters to their goal of winning Eurovision has the opportunity to be inspiring and/or heartbreaking. But since Will Ferrell makes Lars such an untalented moron, it is hard to form any real emotional investment.I adore Rachel McAdams, and I loved what she did with the role of Sigrit. She is the heart of The Story of Fire Saga and is the one element that does ground the narrative to a minor degree. It's kind of a shame that she is dubbed on the songs, but it makes sense as they needed a truly astounding vocal talent to pull off that final number. The music in this film was a treat, and I thought that My Hometown was a beautiful way to bring the story of the movie full circle. Sadly, there's a lot of dumb time-wasting stuff that is inserted into the film just to pad the runtime, particularly when it came to the muddled romantic subplot. It feels like a half-baked script that needed some more refining before they actually started filming. The end result is that Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga feels underwhelming and predictable despite having some enjoyable elements.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

mildly amusing at times,"Since watching ABBA in 1974, Lars Erickssong (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit Ericksdóttir (Rachel McAdams) have been dreaming of competing in Eurovision for Iceland. They have a band called Fire Saga. His father (Pierce Brosnan) has always been dismissive and quite brutal in his criticism. In order to fill out the required number of competitors, the committee randomly selects Fire Saga as the last participant. It's a long murderous road to the top.This is Will Ferrell doing another goofball in another wacky competition. It's getting a little old by now. I would like for him to try something different. Unlike his character, McAdams is utterly endearing. It would work better if he could match her in personality. I almost yelled Oh No when they are sitting at the docks. I suddenly realized where the story is going. That would be an interesting path to go down but it needs to really lean into it. It has to turn into either a mass murder comedy or a murder mystery thriller. My other big issue is the length. Two hours is long for a comedy and the song singing turns it into Glee. I'm not that concerned about winning the contest. That part holds little interest. Still, there are some mildly amusing moments and that's fine.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Best Will Ferrell since Anchorman,"I started watching this movie and I admit that I expected I would zone out after about 10-20 minutes.
How wrong was I. This turned out to be a great feel good movie. This is not going to go home with many Oscar awards but that was never the purpose I assume. Spot on Netflix. Will, Rachel and co. Perhaps when Iceland wins Eurovision we will get a sequel.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Will FerrHell,"Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams perform well even though there's 20 years of an age difference between the pair.
I'm not a big fan of the real Eurovision song contest so this film tested me a bit. I went to walk away several times but I must admit the songs in the film are really good, catchy.
I wouldn't recommend it unless you're a die hard Will Ferrell fan.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Europe gives 12 points to Netflix!,Well done Netflix. We Europeans love our silly Songcontest and we are not ashamed to admit of it.Unfortunately it wasn't possible this year because an idiot with small hands wasn't able to take a global leadership role and shut down the world for a couple of weeks.Therefore this movie is a nice gesture from Netflix.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
Very simple but yet very quality movie,"If you want to watch something good but not complicated after the difficult day - that is the movie you are looking for.The scenario is simple where all the main moves could be easily predicted but the actors is playing very good and you just want to feel that simple story with them and share the happiness in the end. The operator work is also very good, through the whole movie there are marvellous scenes . And, the last but not least - the songs. They are really beautiful.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Not a single laugh...,"First off: Don't believe the fake 10/10 reviews... It's very easy to see that there's a tonne of fake 10/10 reviews on this title due to the multiple profiles who have ONLY ever reviewed this movie, and they all gave it 10/10... imdb won't allow me to link those profiles here, but there's over 100 fake 10/10 reviews.So yeah, don't belive the fake review score, this movie isn't a 6.7/10 movie like the IMDB score suggests, and it's CERTAINLY not a 10/10 movie like the fake reviews claim. The ACTUAL score of this movie is closer to 5/10 or 5.5/10.Anyways, I could tell from the trailer of this movie already that it was going to be bad, but just how bad, I wasn't even prepared for. With a cast like Rachel McAdams and Will Ferrell, I was expecting at least a few laughs but this movie is just so very not-funny. I'm a fan of both these actors, but this movie was just plain bad.The acting was OK, and I don't think that was the issue with the movie being un-funny, since we know that both actors can play funny roles... it just really comes down to the plot/story/writing being bad, and it's not the actor's fault.I honestly can't recommend that you watch this movie, under any circumstances... Normally most movies would at least maybe be worth watching if you have nothing else to watch or if you just want to pass some time, but this movie isn't even worth watching if you've got nothing to do for 2hours... I'd recommend rather going outside and looking at the birds flying, or organizing your garage... This is honestly the least funny comedy movie I've watched in a long time.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun Loud and Silly just like Eurovision,"I know the critics have been saying the latest Will Farrel offering was a tad lame but in this Covid environment a bit of off fun, silly song and dance is really what is needed!
Some of the jokes full flat and the accents are dodgy but it's just a fun story that you can sing a long to and forget any sense of age or logic to the relationships!
There is a sense of the magic of Iceland that shines through and it's just a nice story.

Another average movie from WIll Farrel,"His last one this year got Razzie awards, I guess this one is better than Sherlock or Vice.

The movie greatly works,"""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga"" is a fine blend of humor and heart, even with Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams being a very endearing Icelandic duo in the movie. Besides, it has infectious energy and resonant musicality; the feel of Eurovision makes for funny and catchy moments. For others, though, its over-the-top antics might be a little extreme and the plot predictable, sometimes tilting over into absurdity that works against the emotional core of the film. At its best, when it's simply charming or thunderous with song-and-dance production, the picture greatly works; at other times, the comic and heartfelt work against each other for a wildly uneven, but enjoyable, ride.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
So offensive to the Icelandic and European population,Typical that American Hollywood have this perception of Europe as dumb people with no intellect. So so offensive as a person from Iceland.

Gave it just 7 but rethinking...,"This is a comedy, but it actually doesnt have that many great jokes and in that part is average at best. But the humor built around the Eurovision and its style is great. Also interesting are the actual winners of last contests that cameo in the fim. The songs in the movie are actually pretty good, a combination of original songs made for this movie and past hits. If a soundteack came out, I would gladly listen to it while driving somewhere or having a sit down party at home with friends after watching the movie together. In that sence it is a unique movie that may develop a cult following.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
It garnered the craziness,"Will Farrell is a powerhouse of absurdity coupled with a wonderfully whistfully witty performance from Rachel McAdams, finally landing a comic performance after a failed forced performance in 'Game Night'
The fact Ireland did not get the slightest nod considering they have won it more times than any country with 7 wins, are the only country to win 3 in a row, won 4 out of 5 in a run, and the only country to have a contestant win it twice... is the only drawback",7.0,Anonymous,Music
decent flick,I am a big fan of ferrell who is a comic genius. This movie has its good parts and mostly bad parts. Storyline is nothing new. Most jokes are old and rescued by the excellent talent of Will Ferrell. Female lead is preety good looking and acted well. remaining characters are forgettable. The best part of the movie is the background music by Sigur Ros. That makes thus a decent movie watchable once.,6.0,Anonymous,Music
You would know if you know what Eurovision is all about! Brilliant!,"As someone who has been watching Eurovision every year, witnessing the enormous effort and money every country put to shine out as 'original', which is sooo unbelievable and can more often than not seem quite foolish, yet somehow charming and exciting, I would say this movie was spot on in terms of representing this exact spirit of the contest. I genuinely enjoyed every minute of it - laughed and cried. Also, having the opportunity to live in Iceland for a bit, I know most people there take this contest with quite an excitement, which makes the movie even better for choosing exactly Iceland as the main focus. Absolutely loved it!! And on top of that, since the actual Eurovision contest sadly got cancelled this year, this movie really made it up for that, at least to me.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not as bad as you might think,"Obviously a labour of love for Ferrell, he's not as teeth-grindingly irritating as he is in most films & turns in a decent performance.
Rachel McAdams provides a solid performance, helped by having quite a good singing voice.
Dan Stevens is unrecognisable, the Simon LeBon hair looks quite odd and his voice is, imho overzealously re-recorded...

How Eurovision 2020 Should've Played Out,"I simply can't understand all the poor reviews and scores of 5 or less that this film is getting. It's simply a fun, unpretentious & light hearted look at the Eurovision competition. I mean seriously people......Let me qualify my comments....my first ever review and it's for a Will Ferrell movie haha..I'm a movie buff who has enjoyed cinema for 40 odd years, and this was simply a great enjoyable easy ride, that was not meant to be taken as seriously as others have obviously done...I honestly had minimal expectations for what I was about to watch, but Ferrell and McAdams' 1st foray into the musical genre had me pleasantly surprised - in fact I absolutely loved it.
Although Eurovision Fire Saga doesn't take itself too seriously, it still delivers a very good solid storyline, a strong underlying message about life and love and topped off with a fantastic sound track that will have you blaring the speakers at all hours on repeat.....For those who enjoy Eurovision, for those who enjoy some great catchy music and for anyone that enjoys barracking for the underdogs then this is the film for you.

It made me feel the Icelanders. The bad ratings come for sure from people who doesn't follow the show, since they re missing a lot of details.

"Will Ferrell is himself, Rachel McAdams shines","Will Ferrell always plays a doof, no matter his characters background or nationality they will be a doof. Sometimes good, sometimes cringe inducing. Lars is one of his more mild ones so the movie was not as terrible as it could have been. Rachel McAdam's Sigrit is the star of this show for me. The humor from her isn't about playing a fool, more like playing an innocent who tries to see the best in people and her running gags are never overdone. I would have rated this much lower if not for her. The supporting cast, including former Eurovision participants is serviceable and is a benefit to the film as well. After living a good part of my adult life in Europe this brings on a bit of nostalgia. If you can stomach Will Ferrell you will enjoy this. If you don't like him this film won't change your mind.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

I'm a Willfan, so of course I loved watching the ever-goofy Will. Pierce Brosnan was solid, but my heart goes to Rachel, oh you cute lovely lady. Can you be any cuter? Why oh why?

Ferrell's career continues to slide,"Age has really caught up to Will Ferrell unfortunately - and I'm not in any way talking about his looks. I'm talking about his acting ability and his ability to be funny. The man was almost indisputably the funniest person working in Hollywood a decade ago. These days he can go an entire film without getting a single laugh out of me. It feels like he plays it incredibly safe these days, preferring to lean on PG-13 movies and safe scripts. I understand it's a very difficult time to be a comedian with the world being so easy to offend right now, but I really wish people like him would just ignore that noise and get back to making the fabulous movies that he was in the 2000s.Looking past the comedy, the movie didn't work for me as a narrative either. It was extremely clunky. There were many many scenes that could've (and should've) been left on the cutting room floor. Ferrell wrote this himself, and he's actually written some very fine scripts over the years, but this was not one of them. It felt like a kids movie, aimed at adults.Everything that was great about 'Pitch Perfect' in terms of combining heart, humour and fun was missing here. The music was actually okay and probably the strongest part of 'Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga'. There were some catchy singles along the way that were a pleasure to have replace the clunky dialogue. Rachel McAdams actually went a long way towards saving the film too. She gives her best in every scene, despite her clearly knowing some of the things she was being asked to do were ridiculous and not going to come across well onscreen. It isn't enough to save this mess though. I can't recommend this one.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A Good Strange Film,"This film hit Netflix on Friday and being British I know what The Eurovision Song Contest is so I decided to watch this film and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees two Icelandic Musicians given the opportunity to represent their country in The Eurovision Song Contest and attempt to achieve their dreams.Main Character
Rachel McAdams plays one of the main characters here and I thought she was really good here. She is the character that I cared about the most here and her journey is the most interesting part of the film. She is a great actress and even though this film doesn't take itself too seriously she tries too at times. Will Ferrell plays her partner and I thought he was fine here, this is nowhere near his strongest performance but he does have some funny moments and even though his story arc is cliche it does work for the film. The two's chemistry is good and they bounce off of each other well, which is good as it is the part of the film that you have to be invested in.Supporting Characters
Dan Stevens is one of the best actors going around today and for me he was the standout for this film. He is uber charismatic and really balances on the borderline of being super cool or super annoying but he nails it and oozes style in every scene he is in. Pierce Brosnan plays Ferrel's dad and he is good here, again he isn't the most interesting part of the film but for the role he has to do he does it effectivley. Everybody else also does good jobs and it is nice to see Graham Norton have his real life role here.Story
The story here is pretty basic, but the chemistry between the two leads is really good plus it is great seeing the song contest being played out in all of it's glory. But there is this side arc involving the Icelandic government that had potential but it feels really out of place. Plus as I have mentioned there are parts of the film that are very generic leading to it being a predictable film.Script
The script has some funny moments in it and some nice drama to it. But there just aren't enough of those funny moments, I am pretty sure this film is trying to be a comedy but it isn't funny enough to be a great comedy unfortunately.Style
The style of this film is absurd, you see just how crazy Eurovision is, and what is funny is that this film doesn't even make it much crazier then it is in real life. The song sequences are fantastic, they feel grand on scale and feel epic in nature. But the issue is that you can tell that every actor is lipsyncing and it does take you out of what is happening. Also I felt like the last act is rushed a little bit and it leads to a pretty abrupt ending.Overall
Overall, I feel like this is a very entertaining film, I think if you know little about Eurovision this might not be a film for you. But if you know about the show then this is a fun if not flawed experience that could be worth a watch.Rating - 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Play JaJa Ding Dong!,"The premise tells you all you need to know. What do you expect from a Will Ferrell film about the Eurovision Song Contest? Well, this is what you should expect.I'll say now, I'm not a Will Ferrell fan. I find the characters he portrays to be generally annoying. This film works with him in it though. Rachel McAdams especially puts in a stellar performance and with the rest of the cast makes for an entertaining experience.Neither am I a big fan of the Eurovision Song Contest itself. I grew out of watching it when Eurovision drinking games lost their appeal back in my University days.Like all good feel-good films though you don't need to be a fan of the event to appreciate the film. The film pays enough homage to what has come before it, including a smattering of political commentary to keep things interesting.

Yes. But was I expecting it, of course yes. But it wasn't trying not to be, and while watching it was more because of Rachael McAdams and wanting to see how silly she could be in such an outing, I was surprised to find some unexpected and genuine laugh out loud moments towards the end. Which is rare for me in such movies when the effort for laughs these days is so low brow and often forced into the story at expense of the story, the genuine laugh moment mome ts made me wish I had watched it with others to laugh along with. I think ratings for movies should be against what the movie is trying to be and the market it sits in. This is a story that is stupid, but funny, touching but still stupid, and for me, making you laugh is the goal for the movie, so when it succeeds at that, enjoy it for what it is.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

Having grew up with the competition and seen it grow it has a special place for many with its hammy songs and overdone everything, there's still a charm about it. Although not one of his best this is still captured in the movie and the cast surely seem to be enjoying themselves - McAdams is excellent as always - a goofy colourful movie just right for a bit of light entertainment in these times.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

An Absolute Hoot!,"This is one of those films where you can't help wear a smile while watching it (aside from the times when it tugs at the heartstrings and draws a tear or two). It's just one of those films that's so tongue in cheek, full of life and joy you can't help but love it.I was very sceptical of this film going in, not sure whether the satire would be too much, making the film ridiculous and cringey, but I could not be more wrong. It was absolutely spot on! Now that I think of it Eurovision is so ludicrous, outlandish and lavish anyway one would have to try quite hard to go over the top with it. There was a lot of care attention in this film to recreate the live Eurovision shows, as well as the songs. I'd be lying if I said I haven't had them on repeat since watching, its a genuinely great soundtrack with some amazing songs on it. Another huge surprise from this film.The characters felt so Eurovision, and its clear that all the writers, producers and directors did their homework on the bizarre behemoth that is the Eurovision Song Contest. I found myself really invested in their relationship and their story arc, yet again another surprise to come out of this!One thing that wasn't a surprise was the performances. Will Ferrell is a comedy goliath so its no surprise that he smashed this role. As a Eurovision fan himself I think he pitched his performance perfectly. I think he was actually eclipsed by Rachel McAdams though! She was amazing in this film, so funny, emotional and charming. Dan Stevens as well played a blinder as the Russian entry.This film is an absolute treat to watch. A tongue in cheek love letter to Eurovision which will leave you grinning ear to ear!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Musical!,"Even though I'm new to the whole Eurovision thing I can say with full certainty they tried their best to be respectful to the competition show.First the Pros: The songs are amazing to listen to each one has its own personality and flair, the acting for the most part is competent they actors know what they were doing and they did their roles fine, the set designs are amazing presenting what the movie was trying to go for a grand beautiful live show setting, and the cameos from the actual Eurovision contestants make the movie even better for people that watch the competition for a long time.Now for the Cons: The jokes are mostly misses when a joke doesn't land it really shows, Will Farrell's acting can be crazier then usual and for me it does not fit the movie, and the biggest crime of the movie though is the editing to me it feels clunky at times and it can be distracting from some scene that could have been amazing.All and all the movie was fine it was pretty much a middle of the road movie, but with what I've seen from Will it could've gone worst.

"Weird, fun, and a little too long for a comedy film.","Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga (3 out of 5 stars).Eurovision is a comedy film about two best friends since there childhood. Had a dream about going into a singing competition in Eurovision. Lars (Will Ferrell) and Sigrit (Rachel McAdams) are a duo that sing in local bars in Iceland. While they enter a competition presenting there country. They face against Alexander (Dan Stevens) a Russian singer who has a flamboyant style. And others. While Lars father Erick (Pierce Brosnan) is disappointed with his sons talent.Eurovision is a film that feels like a stylish 1980s music video with its European celtic like music and costumes, lighting, and visuals. One wonders if the writers and director was high on something from its trippy and weird style. It does have its fair share of comical moments. I did find the film to have its charm with the performances and decent story about Lars and Sigrit trying to chase there dreams.The performances are fun and weird in a good way. Which is what it is trying to be with its stupid humor. The film does run a little too long with its running time. Running at 2 hours. The direction does have an uneven pacing. Lars and Sigrit singing and having their musical duo is a lot of fun and flashy with its songs and set design. When the characters are not in a musical moment.

Lovely Stuff,"Will Ferrell delivers yet again, cementing his place as the funniest actor currently entertaining us today. He has a unqiue talent in being able to take the mickey out of anything without causing any offence. On paper, this reads like the kind of movie a lot of people would avoid. Camp, sequins, crappy Euro pop/rock, but give it a chance and enjoy an hilarious musical that you can watch with the whole family. Another skill of Ferrell's is his skill in entertaining with virtually no offensive language or adult content at all. The story is full on fantasy, with gorgeous looking characters, Toe tapping, campy music with dazzling daft theatrical stunts. But it just works.

By all means watch - but nah,"I'm a long time fan of the Eurovision Song Contest, and it's nice of Will Ferrell to make a movie about it. But it really is a bad movie. I liked seeing the previous participants (of recent years) and he got the gist of the contest down. However, the story was a bit to far fetched for me and it didn't do much for me humour-wise. I guess that's just me not really enjoying Mr. Ferrells type of comedy. I did laugh, but mainly it was hard to watch and a good half an hour to long.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

(To be fair we do have European sensibilities). So I was already a Eurovision fan when I watched this movie. What a hoot!! I've watched it maybe 5 or 6 times now in full, but I'll often scan for my favourite scenes. I love everything about it. It's funny and very warm. All the actors do a great job but I must give a special shout-out to Dan Stevens' turn as Alexander Lemtov ... genius!! So many quotable quotes! ""You are beautiful and kind. I handsome and rich. This is typically very winning combination"". Gold!! And as for Rachel McAdams' innocent charm (and beautiful smile) ... perfect. Script is funny, songs are great and the mood is perfect.

Couldn't finish it.,"Now look, I'm not some holier than thou fancy film reviewer person who thinks that the only films are good have to be directed in france by a 90 year old renowned artist, and I like a lot of stuff that would be considered borderline low brow, bad humour, and as a final note many Will Ferrell films are great and he certainly can be funny. HOWEVER, this just wasn't one of those movies. I couldn't bare to sit through the entire thing as I just completely lost interest. Between two characters I didn't like speaking in very simple ways (hehe icelandic people silly dumb simpleton they speak simple because english bad) there wasn't really much I cared about, nothing to make you want to see what happened in the end; I think the major problem was that I genuinely couldn't care less about what happened to our main protagonists.
There's loads of films that can be very much enjoyable even if they're bad because you laugh at it rather than with it, but this was one of the first times I've felt so perfectly balanced in the middle: Not good enough to be genuinely enjoyable, but not bad enough to be a fun silly time, just miserable.
I can't really put into words why I'm so put off by how unfunny this was but you just gotta take my word for it, cheers.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Eerily moving and obviously fun,Well what can you expect from Will Ferrell? This is one of his films where it's not overly comedic. The right amount of laughter is of course required but the whole Eurovision journey of common dreamers was just deeply moving. The portrayal of family relationships is also a good mix for the drama. I also love how versatile Rachel McAdams is. You'll never expect her doing a musical comedy such as this and keeping up with Ferrell antics.,9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Sweet, touching and feel - good romantic comedy!","This is a wonderful feel good romantic comedy starring Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams as a fictitious Icelandic duo ""Fire Saga"", Lars and Sigrit, who inadvertently end up representing their country in the Eurovision song contest. Although often ridiculed by even their own town folk, they nonetheless ultimately bring pride to their country and their hometown.The movie has been panned by some critics, who I felt kind of missed the point. Perhaps they were expecting a more traditional Will Ferrell comedy. But essentially, the movie is a winking tribute to the sometimes gaudy and goofy world of the eurovision contest, and also a romantic comedy (as Sigrit is in love with lars, who is oblivious to it all). Pic also features many cameos from contest winners who do a raucous sing-a-long in a nightclub, Demi Lovato and there are numerous fun and rousing musical numbers throughout it's runtime; meanwhile, Dan Stevens shows up in a slinky and uproarious turn as a Russian singer. Pierce Brosnan does a fine icelandic accent as Lars' fisherman father. There are some funny bits as well, including a laugh out loud moment involving elves. Yes, elves.The songs written for the fictional band such as Volcano Man and Ja Ja ding dong are suitably silly, while ""Double Trouble"" and especially the soaring closing number ""Husavik"" is a real show stopper and a rousing capper to a completely feel good movie.So best to ignore some of the critics; especially during these dreary times of pandemic and lockdowns, it is great to watch such a heartwarming, funny, tender and uplifting movie. Sure, it is schmaltz, but it's high quality schmaltz. When McAdams sings Husavik at the end, you will likely cheer.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Painful,"To say that being a Will Ferrell fan is challenging is an understatement. I've never laughed harder than in some of his films, and others I can't even get through. This one would fall into the latter category if not for the covid lockdown, but there just isn't that much else to do right now.
You could argue that some of the supporting actors have good performances, the Icelandic cinematography is pleasant, even the songs aren't that bad (well, they're supposed to be bad, but they're good at being bad). You could criticize the film for plot or scenes that basically plagiarize other Ferrell projects (Old School, Zoolander). But ultimately, a comedy just needs to be funny and this is not. Other than one scene where he is yelling at some American tourists, there is nothing close to laughable in this film. Also, Will is looking awkwardly old for a guy who was supposedly the same age as his musical partner when they were children.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

If you have watched Eurovision before you may understand some of the jokes better, but even if you never heard of it before you can still enjoy this movie a lot. Just don't expect an amazing plot and and great script, it's a silly uplifting comedy with the characteristic weirdness and over the top jokes by Ferrell.

Song spoofs: Good. Everything else: Bad. Really bad.,"To give credit, the musical numbers are spot-on Eurovision spoofs. They capture the Eurovision song genre perfectly.

But this is C-list material at best. The jokes are tired, rehashed....tired. If anything, Will Farrell and the always charming Rachel McAdams with their fake Icelandic accents make things worse. Casting a pair of young Scandinavian actors in the lead roles might have lightened things up a bit, but of course that would miss the point that this is a Will Ferrell movie.Get hold of old Eurovision song contests.

I hope the Icelanders like this better than I did.,"Decent watch at best, I don't want to see it again, and I can't recommend it unless you just like laughing at foreigners.Imagine....Pitch Perfect, with middle age characters, but instead of the 90% of somewhat interesting or even bland characters, the movie is centered around the 10% of annoying (potentially offensive) stereotypical characters you could have written out of the movie. I don't know if the producers just thought, ""What's whiter than Iceland"" and figure it was okay to make fun of them for an entire movie, but that's pretty much what they did.I can't say if it's accurate, I don't have a lot of Icelandic jokes in my pocket, but SO MANY people had to endorse this that it is just sad this was made. This could have been a great American Idol style of movie, none of the nationalistic humor was necessary.They took the ""Off the bus from Kansas"" trope, and set it in Europe, barely anything particular to it, let alone special.Don't get me wrong, the singing is all great, but that's what audio programs are for, and they certainly had the budget to go the extra mile with this one.The writing is actually pretty good in this, it's just coated in herring (see, that's probably a Swedish joke).I'd really like to see an American version of this so we can let two top notch stars like Will Ferrell and Rachel McAdams loose and not have to feel bad about it.",4.0,Anonymous,Music

In 2020 hindsight, advantage Iceland.It's heart is in the right place. On its sleeve. I think it will garner some new Eurovision fans. I won't be one of them.

THANKS TO WILL FERRELL'S SWEDISH WIFE WHO INTRODUCED HIM TO THE EUROVISION SONG CONTEST:),"Beyond my expectations, it's a wonderful film which truly reflected the enthusiasm and passion of the Eurovision audiences, who were excited by the spirit of competition throughout the Europe, days even months before the final day.I can say that it is a very nostalgic movie; it took me all the way to my childhood memories. Absurd dance choreographies, interesting, exaggerated costumes, the firm belief that the contestants must perform their songs in English in order to win, but nevertheless, they salute their fellow citizens by sprinkling few words into the lyrics in their native languages while singing their songs... These are all the details that you can capture if you are familiar with Eurovision Song Contest. Clearly Will Ferrell did his job very well and he did extensive research before even he shot the movie.Will Ferrell is always a good comedian and has shown it in his previous work however the biggest surprise for me was that Rachel McAdams' acting performance was superb in a comedy genre and the two were a great duo.I loved the side characters as well like the decent, self-adoring and possibly gay Russian guy (even though there isn't any homosexuality in Russia!?!), loving and caring Icelanders, good hearted naïve American tourists etc.In these pessimistic depressive pandemic days I am glad that I watched this film.

Auto-Tuned,"The auto-tuned songs aren't bad, whether they be melodic or parodic, but as a comedy-drama, ""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga,"" it's a cluttered series of miscues. Even the title is an overlong and questionable attempt at humor with both the words ""story"" and ""saga."" I can can count on one hand how many moments in the movie gave me mirth. Any attempted exploitation of cultural differences becomes a lost cause. Only the anti-American ranting from the American Will Ferrell in an American production somewhat works. Trying to poke fun at homophobia in Russia, for instance, is just depressing. Besides, why every hack piece of slapstick needs a love triangle in the first place is beyond me, although, still, the drama here manages to work better than the comedy. The ghost and elves stuff is stupid (albeit, the line, ""The elves went too far,"" is kind of funny). A lot of the rest is the usual dick jokes. Perhaps, my favorite gag is Ferrell's blasé response to the beauty, leaping wales included, of Húsavík, Iceland. Indeed, ""Eurovision Song Contest"" is in stark contrast to the usual cinematic leveraging of nature in the better pictures set in the Nordics. This one spends more time in a pub watching TV than, say, beside snow-covered mountains, more time swirling the camera around actors lip syncing than on any battle between man and nature.Oh well, at least, Molly Sandén can sing--providing the voice for Rachel McAdams's character.

Regarding who sings what, I listened to Swedish singer Molly Sanden and I prefer McAdams voice (if you pay attention you can hear when she is the one singing). I had a good time, I got entertained, this is all I ask from a movie, thus a ten. I must add a sidenote regarding Eurovision. It is well known that countries do not send their best over there with the true intention to avoid having to pay for the cost of hosting the show. This is not something made up for the movie, unfortunately.

"Great songs, one very good scene....and that's about it","I wasn't expecting a lot from this film, after all I have come used to the silly humour often Will Ferrell puts on his performances. However, I have to admit this film let me down quite a bit, not only because most of the jokes didn't land or because is too long, but for the simple fact that the story, style and structure is all over the place, seriously is like having in a film instead of 3 acts have 6, that is not unusual whatsoever, the problem is that 3 of these 6 acts felt like a tiring third act that left no impact. On top of that the two leads Lars and Sigrit, I understand they want them to make them funny in a bit bizarre way and thanks to the Ferrell and McAdams experience it feels they try way too hard, but I am afraid they come up way too unlikable. I don't hate this film, in fact I would rather watch this that let's say ""The Greatest Showman"" as the songs and the Eurovision part of the film are quite well done, I could find myself listen to them on spotify, but this review is for the film and not the songs.

Good writing, good timing. The conflict towards the end was a bit simplish, but still okay, and believable for the story. The music video at the beginning was amazing too!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A bizarre experience all round,"Rarely have I been so utterly confused by a film. I didn't really know what I was supposed to be getting from this movie although I still happily watched it to the end.With the exception of Rachel McAdams, this movie features some of the worst acting you could hope to see. And then there's the accents. What the hell was that about? It would have been funny if it wasn't borderline offensive. Pierce Brosnan in particular should really consider retiring after this embarrassing display.There are some funny moments and some fittingly camp music but for the most part I was just a bit baffled as to what was unfolding before me.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Ignore the critics,"Do not be deterred by the metascore or the scathing guardian review. How they can describe this joyful piece of touching silliness as ""pointless"" when it landed in the middle of lockdown is beyond me.

Storyline Stolen from Father Ted,The premise of this movie was an episode of Father Ted in the '90's. Almost exactly the same story. I'm a fan of Will Ferrell but I was surprised that the movie ripped off Father Ted so blatantly. Instead of Iceland it's Ireland in the BBC show.,4.0,Anonymous,Music
Somehow Heart Warming. Loved Every Minute 🍿,"Funny and light hearted Will Ferrell & Rachel McAdams are an absolute hit together.

As if every pitched idea was kept,"The Eurovision extravaganza is undoubtedly quite comical, and especially seen from a distance, such as from the U. S. Unfortunately for the filmmaking team behind the spoof Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga, the Eurovision is in many ways spoofing itself each and every year. It's a spectacle which is already more satirical and over-the-top than what Will Ferrell et. Al. Is able to depict it as in this uneven comedy. The film isn't only a parody on Eurovision, however, it's also a parody on all things Icelandic. In this respect, the dabs are arguably less on target and far more stereotypical, but nevertheless occasionally quite funny. The subplots involving Pierce Brosnan and Mikael Persbrandt, respectively, are more effective than the creation of Will Ferrell's man-child character. The main problem with him is in the writing; the dialogue simply isn't funny enough. It's as if every idea that was thrown at the story pitch meetings was kept. His asexual romance with Rachel McAdams as Sigrit is the usual cringe stuff that some may find funny, but the film doesn't really come into its own and hit a nerve until the very end, when the denouement of the Alexander Lemtov character (brilliantly played by Dan Stevens) and the performance of the song ""Húsavik"" lifts everything to a welcome emotional conclusion. The real star of this show is Molly Sandén, who sings all of Sigrit's vocals. Look for numerous past Eurovision stars in cameos, particularly in the ""song-along"" segment, which is director David Dobkin's best achievement here.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Overly long with some funny moments.,"""Eurovision Song Contest: The Story Of Fire Saga"" has funny moments but running a little over two hours makes it hard to fully enjoy.
.
In this comedy, when aspiring musicians from Iceland are given the opportunity to represent their country at the world's biggest song competition, they finally have a chance to prove that any dream worth having is a dream worth fighting for.
.
I'm going to say it again and again, but the real buzz kill here was the run time. There were many scenes that could've been edited out and many scenes (especially the contest ones) were repeated over and over. Ferrell and McAdams were surprisingly good together. Rachel McAdams delivers a funny performance you don't often see her portray. The real scene stealer though was Dan Stevens as the Russian competitor; I'd watch a movie just about his story. Overall, a few funny moments, catchy songs, but way too long, making it an okay film.

"Terrible, Nil Point","Possibly the worst film I have ever watched. Poor acting, poor script and desperately unfunny.
That said, its worst crime is the outright racist depiction of Iceland and the Icelandic people. I have visited Iceland and the people there do not speak with those ridiculous accents which made them sound like half-wits. Nor is Iceland some backward 3rd world country (Farrell's character amazed by a mini bar in a run down Scottish hotel that he thought was the height of luxury). The hotels in Iceland I've stayed in have been far superior than any I've stayed in in New York.

Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga Review,"Don't let the title fool you, this isn't a documentary. This movie is yet another mediocre comedy film from both 2020 and Will Ferrell. My biggest issue with this film is its humor and length. First of all, I really didn't find this that funny at all. I maybe chuckled a couple of times here and there but I never laughed at all. This film does not need to be 2 hours long. There is a lot here that can edited down or cut out entirely. This film also falls victim to many band movie cliches which makes it feel unoriginal and boring. The filmmaking here is pretty bland too. It's not poorly shot but it's blandly shot. It's not poorly edited but it's blandly edited and so on. One thing I did enjoy was some of the songs and performances. Although some of the songs are auto tuned to hell there are some that do sound genuine and they aren't half bad. Will Ferrell can't do an Icelandic accent to save his life but he was definitely trying which I commend him for. Same goes for Rachel McAdams and Pierce Brosnan. For his limited screentime, Brosnan did bring a lot of energy. I did enjoy his presence. If you enjoy Will Ferrell comedy movie's, then you would probably enjoy this.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

stupid and yet..Amazing,"I like Will Ferrel. I think that is important to know going in. I know a lot of people who hate his style of humor. I agree I liked it more when i was younger but he still gets some laughs out of me.This movie tries too hard to be a generic romance movie sprinkled with bits of greatness thrown in. The way they try to play certain events is just plain stupid. Like when they showed WIlls character had slept with another woman....it made no sense and was completely ridiculous. Can I break it down for you for just a moment.He was sleeping alone in his room at night...thinking about how the other girl is probably sleeping with that other guy. Then all of a sudden he is sleeping naked with another woman. Which suggests they were actually sleeping after having sex...but no the movie instead tries to play this confusing, stupid arc where no, they did not have sex..she just came over to sleep naked in his arms..What kind of sense does this make. None..ITs just a movie trope. And boy is it stupid.But then we get that crazy song where everyone at the part is singing and Im won over. This is a great movie!...until again they do something stupid. They keep on breaking up the group just so Will can be late while trying to get back on stage...they do this 3 TIMES...3 times...and its the same thing everytime it happens. Movie should have been edited down so we could not have to watch the same thing 3 times.But then we get the end song and everything is magical and amazing again.So for every stupid thing in here is eventually paid off with some amazing creativity.

Fun but dragged on and on,"Will Ferrell plays the normal middle aged, misfit, underachiever he plays in most films.
Here he is determined to represent Iceland in the Euro-vision Song Contest.Will Ferrell is less Will Ferrell than he normally is and shares the spotlight with Rachel McAdams who is very good.The characters are entertaining enough and they make a cute ugly-couple.
The comedy is a warm and fuzzy pastiche of the contest in the whole and pokes around at some national stereotypes - all in good humour.Most is spot on: half the fun of watching Euro-vision as a Brit is to see the U.K flop and then spend the next day moaning about it.At one point it felt like the film was coming to a head so I paused to grab a cup of tea and was alarmed to see there was over an hour left.
I was barely half way through!This is my gripe with this film.
It is much too long.
There are only so many ways you can depict Scandinavians as reserved, polite and naive before it gets boring.This film should have got in and out before you could think too hard about it but it massively over stays its welcome.

Worthy of Oscar,"This is a very nice film for the whole family.

For Eurovision fans I guess?,"After seeing the reasonably high rating on IMDB for this film, I figured I was in for a Will Ferrell comedy up there with Anchorman (which really grew on me quite a while after first seeing it), with a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. After watching it though, I feel that the high reviews must have been due to a Eurovision fan thing. I'm not really a fan of Eurovision at all so I watched this without any real investment in that aspect of the story. There were a few moments that were amusing but I felt that there was a long patch in the middle of this film that felt really un-funny and awkward to me. I was contemplating turning this off halfway though as I was embarrassed for having chosen to watch this with my family and everyone was starting to look at me and question my choice. This was sitting on a 2/10 for me but then thankfully
the film picked up with some comedy highlights and better pacing toward the end.

PG-13 Hollywood romcom that is neither romantic nor funny,"There are actually some interesting plot ideas and the cinematography is wonderful, but that's about the best I can say about this movie. The first major problem is that it's hard to take seriously two American actors pretending to be Icelandic and speaking with an Icelandic accent. Will Ferrell was just an awful choice for the role; he's too old, he doesn't have any natural musical talent (neither does Rachel) and he doesn't come off as a credible pretend-musician. On top of that, there isn't any chemistry between him and Rachel McAdams (think about what made A Star is Born so successful). It would have worked much better had they picked an Icelandic duo that are actually musicians, but then it wouldn't be a Will Ferrell movie.More importantly, the movie simply fails at delivering any laughs. There were literally only two scenes where I was genuinely amused, one involving the Ja Ja Ding Dong guy, and another where Will knocks down a portable toilet. It's somewhat hard to comprehend how an actor like Will can be so entertaining in some films (Anchorman, Old Scool, Step Brothers) and so unfunny in others, but I think it has much to do with his narrow comedic range. Will is usually at his funniest when he plays the wild and selfish manchild, which is nothing like his character in this film.To sum it up in one sentence, Eurovision Song Contest is a forgettable PG-13 Hollywood romcom that is neither romantic nor funny.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

Made with lots of love,"Since Eurovison was cancelled this year this movie chose a good time to premier. It pokes lovingly fun and there's a lot of little easter eggs for fans. At times the jokes/plot gets a little too silly but overall this is a very fun, spot on parody of Eurovision Song Contest.Rachel McAdams were fabulous, Molly Sandén was a great fit as the voice. You couldn't tell Rachel was lip syncing at all. A lot of the supporting characters were great as well.The biggest minus I give is mostly the glaring, well known plot hole of a beautiful young woman who is for some reason attracted to a mediocre man played by the comedian who wrote the script.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Load of rubbish but enjoyable,"The film is a terrible cheesy story, yet I enjoyed watching it!
Yes Will Ferrell is terrible as he always is (except in Elf) but Rachel McAdams plays her part very well.
The joke song is actually wayyyy better than the main song of the film.
The best part of the film by far is with the portaloo.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"A funny, moving and memorable film",I loved this film. I expected to have a bit of a laugh and move on but it really touched me and had me crying by the end - in a good way. My partner and I have watched it several times since it came out and are now saving it till Christmas so it'll all be fresh again. I think it will be a classic in our family. So funny. So heartfelt. Full marks.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
It's just dick jokes,"Surprisingly this movie has a LOT of jokes about penises. Even the most popular song from this movie ""Jaja Ding Dong"" is just a dick joke. The movie made me laugh like once. Lion of Love was good I guess.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
12 Points from Pakistan,Finally a great movie from Will Ferrell with Rachel McAdams in it. It gave a slight nostalgia from Blades of Glory. The songs performed were also amazing.,8.0,Anonymous,Music
Just 1 star,"Amazing how many trolls came to make positive reviews.
Anyway, just 1 star from me because...
1. It has Will Ferrell.
2. Is from Netflix.
3. Because this film is a circus like Eurovision song contest as well.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun Escape,"I loved the soundtrack, the ridiculousness of Will Farrell, and the touching story. It was a great escape from a hard year with the pandemic.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"So bad, it's almost good.","This is one of those films that is fun to watch only because of how terrible it is. It simply is in the, ""so bad, it's good"" category. Nevertheless, as comedies go these days, I can't but help recommending this one.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
Filled a Eurovision sized hole in my life!,"Loved it, loved it! I am a huge ESC fan anyway and this captured the camp/kitsch spirit of the whole event beautifully. Great songs, brilliant staging and a great sense of fun!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
It's a movie and it's hard to follow...,"So, the movie... it's not a good call for a chill movie and that pass like it's nothing, I would be lying if I said that... it's tough and unfair, somethings are kinda disrespectful for me. Like, Songvakeppnin is one of the strongest national finals and it's said like a 'joke final for TV', it's not a nice thing.But well, somehow (no spoilers here) they made it to Eurovision in Scotland, I would love to see that again, and it was 50 minutes of the movie when I actually started caring about how it would end, then I stopped again knowing the rules and how unreal they are in the movie. But well... it all a long, LONG, a little horrible and you wanna quit, road to the end. But it ends and it's nice, some way I enjoyed the end and how it was treated.Also, Demi participation is irrelevant and it's like a cameo, nothing interesting.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Surprising Gem,Rachel McAdams is brilliant in this - as she was in Aloha. Will Ferrell's humour can be challenging but in this is fabulous. My most watched movie in recent years. Still really makes me laugh after 5th viewing.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
