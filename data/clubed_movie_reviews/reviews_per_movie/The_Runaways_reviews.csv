The latest of two versions,"This is an entertaining film version of The Runaways story. I say version because there is another film on this band called ""Edgeplay,"" which complements this movie perfectly. Essentially, ""The Runaways"" is Joan Jett's and Cherie Currie's version of things. In ""Edgeplay,"" which is a documentary, the rest of the band has its say.But let's discuss ""The Runaways.""Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Jett is phenomenal. She's got the slouchy guitar playing, the gum chewing, the swagger and the foggy voice nailed. Jett is all girl and quite pretty, but she's always had the manner of a boy. Stewart gets it right. She is not just twitchy Bella, for sure.If you've ever seen the real Kim Fowley (you can on YouTube), you will see that Michael's Shannon's portrayal of him is not at all over the top. In fact, many who knew him would probably say this depiction is too forgiving to the bizarre monster Fowley really was.Dakota Fanning acquits herself well as Currie, the band's sexpot singer. The movie gives Currie the only family backstory, probably because the movie is based on her memoir ""Neon Angel."" It would have been interesting to see Jett's back story depicted. The movie might leave you thinking she's a native Californian, but she didn't move there with her family until she was a teenager. She was born in Philadelphia and spent her childhood in Maryland.Some may question things that happen in this movie. Did they really write ""Cherry Bomb"" on the spot for Currie's audition? Did Fowley really teach the girls to dodge garbage thrown at them on stage? Did the Japanese really go THAT apesh*t over the band?Yes to all. Watch ""Edgeplay,"" where these and other facts about the band are discussed by the girls (now women in their forties) themselves in 2004. (The doc is available for instant viewing on Netflix.) This movie was made by Vicki Blue, one of the band's bass players (the actual band went through five bassists, which is why the bass player in ""The Runaways"" is a fictional creation called ""Robin"").I have my gripes with ""Edgeplay,"" mostly about the jittery camera-work, which I guess is supposed to be edgy, but is just pretentious and annoying. But it is the truth behind the ""truth."" ""The Runaways"" makes no mention of Currie's abortion while in the band or bass player Jackie Fox's suicide attempt. In ""Edgeplay,"" Fox, now a lawyer, even displays the scar on her wrist. ""The Runaways"" makes clear that these teenage girls fought. ""Edgeplay"" gets into why. In the doc, it is also stated openly that some of them were having sex with each other (and it wasn't just Jett and Currie). Hey, it was the Seventies.Joan Jett declined to participate in ""Edgeplay,"" despite the fact she is portrayed in a mostly positive light as perhaps the most ambitious, talented and level-headed member of the band. I was a bit shocked that at the end of ""The Runaways"" when you get the obligatory ""what happened to them"" text on the screen, only Jett, Currie and Fowley are mentioned.The most shameful omission here is the tragic Sandy West, the band's doggedly devoted drummer and perhaps the best female drummer in the history of rock (well, maybe until the Go Go's Gina Schock arrived). She and Jett essentially started the band, as shown in ""The Runaways."" Her history after the band broke up is sad. She was reduced to construction work. Her post-band life was one of drug using, drug dealing, guns and jail. She died of cancer in 2006, but in ""Edgeplay"" you can see her two years before her death discussing the breakup of the band, which clearly broke her heart. She never recovered.It is also wrong to ignore Lita Ford's post-Runaways modest success as a solo rock artist. She's also the most entertaining interviewee in ""Edgeplay.""All in all, I have praise for both movies. Both are candid portrayals of the first all-girl band in rock history, paving the way for the Go Go's, L7, Bikini Kill and, perhaps the most talented of all, Sleater-Kinney, a band that has also broken up, but in a much more friendly way.You go, girl rockers!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Inappropriate and in your face. The way any movie about The Runaways should be.,"""You hear that? That's the sound of hormones raging.""The Runaways is at the opposite end of the spectrum from most recent music biopics. Where movies like Ray and Walk the Line aim for emotional resonance and creating a connection between an iconic figure and the audience, The Runaways is about style, dramatics, and looking good. Which is pretty in line with what the band was about. The sobriety of those movies I previously mentioned wouldn't have worked for such a hyper- kinetic story as this one. Sure, the movie slows down a bit when the crash and burn sets in, but the focus on style, sound and imagery is never really replaced by anything else. And I mean that as a compliment.Michael Shannon didn't really work for me as Kim Fowley, but the movie wasn't really about him, anyway. The five girls playing the group seemed to have an inappropriate amount of fun with their roles, and who wouldn't? You can't help but be impressed by their performances, they play and act like a real band. But no doubt about it, this is Kristin Stewart's (Joan Jett) and and Dakota Fanning's (Cherie Currie) show. They don't let you forget it. Not many actresses their age would have the talent and the balls to take something like this on. They do it, and do it right. I left the movie with a healthy amount of respect for both of them.The entire movie plays out like a music video about all the things you would be mortified of seeing your teenage daughter doing, but of course, would make her cool to do. Which makes sense, as the director (Floria Sigismondi) is best known for directing music videos. The cinematography gleefully sells the same excess, ego, and intoxication that the Runaways' image did. All the band's songs that are woven throughout the movie keep it moving at a super-charged pace.You have to tailor the tone of a film to its subject matter, in order for it to be successful. The Runaways is the true(ish), female version of sex, drugs, and rock & roll, and I couldn't help but really enjoy every bawdy and inappropriate minute of it. Get in a Runaways frame of mind, or don't even bother with this one.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
The Runaways (2010) **1/2,"I became a huge fan of Joan Jett with her first #1 single, I LOVE ROCK N ROLL, back in 1982. For years I remained a devoted follower of her albums, saw her in concert up close at small venues, and even got to meet her in person on a few occasions including getting to go backstage after a gig in 1985. It was only once she'd become popular that I discovered that she was originally in an all-girl rock band called The Runaways. Thus I found myself going back and collecting Runaways records too. So for me, this film was something to look forward to.As Jett has confirmed in interviews, THE RUNAWAYS is mainly true, but there are some artistic liberties taken. The now-51, black-haired rock veteran stayed on the set so young Kristen Stewart (who portrays a teenaged Joan) could observe her movements and ticks, and also to make sure the story stayed somewhat in the right ballpark. The movie begins in 1975 and chronicles Joan's early years as a die-hard rock and roll chick with a rebellious nature who learns to play guitar and wants to form a hardcore, all-girl rock band (""No guys!"" she insists). She stumbles upon the eccentric record producer Kim Fowley (a faithful rendering by Michael Shannon) who likes Jett's cool spunk and determination, but is more struck with the seedy possibilities of exploiting an orgasmic teenage girl band with guitars (""Jail-F'ing-Bait!"" he exclaims with glee, pumping his fist). Together, Jett and Fowley seek out other band members. They comb the dark nightclubs where loud vintage '70s music by artists like David Bowie plays, for a blonde girl with just the right look to function as the lead singer for their group. It's there that they discover 15-year-old Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning), who's not far removed from her first period and who is desperate to become a singer. The Runaways are formed with Cherie up front possessing no strong rock chops, but getting pushed by Fowley and Jett to vocalize and gyrate like a slut having an orgasm. The girls practice enough to eventually get signed by Mercury Records and take off on a trip to Japan by 1977, which was the only place they struck it big, almost becoming as huge as The Beatles there. As many familiar rock and roll stories go, Currie becomes absorbed in the drug world and ultimately tensions mount within the group.THE RUNAWAYS was partly based on Currie's autobiography, and in a way she is the focal point of the story. Dakota Fanning does a pretty decent job handling this type of slimy material, considering she was only 15 herself during filming. It's too bad though that her character is just not that interesting and, for me, young Dakota never quite captured the presence of the real Cherie onstage. I'm admittedly more biased toward Joan Jett, but it's Jett's driving persona which is the most compelling ingredient of the film. I was concerned Kristen Stewart might think that sporting a dyed black haircut would be enough to become Joan Jett, but she actually nailed the aggressive nuances of Jett perfectly. Joan is portrayed as the one member in the film who treats the band seriously, loves and breathes the experience, is committed and tireless. It's a small wonder she had such a successful and long-running solo career after the group disbanded. And Kristen's singing just blew me away -- both Stewart and Fanning sang for the movie -- and Stewart sounds exactly like Jett as she belts out part of one of Joan's original early songs, ""I Love Playin With Fire"". Unfortunately, the movie only gets to see one song rendered in its entirety: ""Cherry Bomb"" (sung by Dakota), which was considered the band's only ""hit"", and was co-written by Fowley and Jett, specifically for Cherie to learn and sing. The rest of the soundtrack is pretty good, with background songs by Bowie, Iggy Pop, the Sex Pistols, and even the real Runaways themselves. As someone familiar with the original Runaways recordings, it was fun for me to pick them out in snippets here and there.The problems I had which kept me from giving the film three stars were that this isn't really anything we haven't seen before, and it's something of a typical cookie cutter rock screenplay with no soul other than the determined presence of Jett. Really unfortunate was that the other three female band members were largely ignored. Not so much drummer Sandy West (who died of lung cancer in 2006); she gets a few lines and respectful moments. But lead guitarist Lita Ford (who had some fleeting success of her own in the '80s) was strategically left out of the action because in real life she and Joan Jett's camp have undergone some personal problems (Ford says Jett's longtime manager Kenny Laguna ""disgustingly"" offered to buy Ford's life story for a thousand bucks). Reportedly, Lita has threatened to sue if not portrayed accurately in the film. While she is largely disregarded, there are moments in the movie in which Ford (played by Scout Taylor-Compton of Rob Zombie's HALLOWEEN) completely comes off as a whining bitch. Most outlandish is that real-life bass player Jackie Fox was completely written out and is now replaced by a totally fictitious character called ""Robin"" (Fox is a lawyer today, so one may assume the filmmakers weren't taking any chances). In 2004, one-time Runaway Vicki Blue made a documentary called EDGEPLAY which is worth seeking out for the real dirt about The Runaways. Joan Jett refused to participate in that project, but it's got recollections from Lita Ford, Jackie Fox, and Sandy West. It makes a good companion piece to this film, and doesn't pull punches. I had some fun with THE RUNAWAYS, but it's something of a watered down version of what actually happened and could have been a bit tougher and more dramatic. **1/2 out of ****",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Portrayal of Joan Jett / But What About Lita ?,"I thought the movie was a good portrayal of Joan Jetts early days. I will give Joan all the credit in the world, she is still making music and performing to this day. What about Lita Ford ?? I mean, when I think of Joan Jett...I think of ""I Love Rock and Roll"" ...When I think of Lita Ford, I think of songs like ""Kiss me Deadly"" & ""Close My Eyes Forever"" which were both huge hits in the 80's. The movie hardly mentioned her. The Movie did not even mention her at the the end when it was giving the updates on where Joan, Sherie & Kim...I think Lita should of at least been mentioned...she is still considered by many to be the Queen of Metal still to this day.",,Anonymous,Music
"""That's what you do—you sing and you strut around in your underwear""","Released in 2010, ""The Runaways"" chronicles the quick rise and fall of all-girl rock band The Runaways who released four albums from 1976-1978. I mean ""girl"" literally since they WERE girls at the time; for instance, when the band was formed in late 1975 singer Cherie Currie just turned 16 years-old. The movie is lightly based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway and therefore focuses on the friendship of Cherie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their relationship with their eccentric manager Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon). Riley Keough plays Cherie's ""better looking"" sister while Scout Taylor-Compton and Stella Maeve play band members Lita Ford and Sandy West.The Runaways had some brief success in the late 70s, but they quickly nosedived because they were teenagers and simply couldn't handle the pressures and temptations of the 70's rock 'n' roll lifestyle, particularly Cherie. The movie successfully illustrates this. Of course ""Cherry Bomb"" was a fairly well known song but, beyond this, they just weren't that popular. They were a here-today-gone-tomorrow act; a minor blip in rock history. You could say they were a good ""farm band"" for the more popular Joan Jett and Lita Ford. Speaking of the latter, Scout Taylor-Compton looks uncannily like her, but the character is given short shrift in favor of Jett and Currie. While this is understandable given that the movie was based on Currie's book and the short 96-minute runtime, there's no excuse for ignoring Lita at the end when the movie cites what the characters went on to accomplish. Since Ford was the second most successful Runaway in the music business, second only to Jett, this is inexcusable.Despite this grave transgression, the movie works because of the great performances of the principle actors. Shannon is particularly effective as the freakish Fowley (who passed away in 2015 at the age of 75). Unfortunately, with a movie that's only an hour and a half long they can only tell so much of the story. Currie described the real story as epic and that the movie is just a ""lighter kind of flash"" of what The Runaways were for two and a half years. Being a 70's rock biopic of teenage girls you can expect the sex & drugs elements with profanity, crudeness and a dismal pall. Like 1991's ""The Doors,"" the movie doesn't show much of the fun side of rock 'n' roll.If you can look beyond the vulgarity and ugliness, however, the movie has (some) heart. For instance, the genuine friendship of Jett and Currie, which can be observed in the phone call at the end; and the loving relationship of Cherie and her sister Marie. The sisters went on to record a couple albums together – 1978's BEAUTY'S ONLY SKIN DEEP and 1980's MESSIN' WITH THE BOYS – but their music career failed to go further due to Cherie's problems with drug dependency.I liked this movie better the second time I watched it. It's too crude and dreary for my tastes and it lags here and there, but it makes up for it with effective performances and the warm relationships noted above. Plus it has a rockin' soundtrack. If you watch recent interviews, you'll observe that Lita and Cherie grew up to be palpably honorable, beautiful women. Joan's cool too, of course; she's just not my cup of java, although I like some of her songs.The film was shot in the Los Angeles area.GRADE: B- (6.5/10)",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock-N-Roll Biopic Has Nothing New to Offer,"THE RUNAWAYS chronicles the run of one of the most successful all-girl rock bands of all time. The film is based on ""Neon Angel"", the autobiography of the band's original lead singer Cherie Currie, and it gives us a glimpse into the world of rock and roll as seen from the perspective of a group of teenage girls on their way to super-stardom. I had heard some good things about the film when it was first making the festival circuit, but I wasn't as impressed when I finally got a chance to see it myself. The cast did an amazing job in their roles but the film wasn't as great as it probably could have been.The problem with music biopics, particularly for rock stars, is that most rock stars seem to encounter the same problems: sex, drugs, booze, addiction, conflicting personalities, etc. So we get a lot of repetition with each rock star film and RUNAWAYS is no different. Cherie's decline into addiction, the in-band conflicts, the initial excitement of success and the eventual succumbing to the stress and strain of maintaining the lifestyle. It's nothing we haven't seen before in other films, it's just happening to younger characters. It's fine though because the performances are strong enough that it's easy to forget that the material's nothing new. My main problem with the film was that it came across as unstructured. It felt as if the filmmakers had just strung along random interesting events in the Runaways history and it made it feel like the movie was just wandering along. As a result, the movie loses it's momentum after their first major gig and drags through the last half. It begins around the time Cherie begins to lose control which is a shame; I should be concerned for her character, not bored by the meandering storyline.The film's saving grace is the cast. Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon did an amazing job. Kristen Stewart has earned some major credibility with me thanks to this film. I was concerned that a girl famous for her role in the TWILIGHT saga would ruin such an iconic role (Joan Jett) but she did a fantastic job and seemed to embody her perfectly. Dakota Fanning is Cherie and I've always thought of Fanning as one of the most talented young stars in Hollywood. She provides an innocence in Cherie's character at the start that makes the film interesting to watch when her stardom warps and destroys it. Shannon is the group's manager Kim Fowley. Fowley is apparently infamous for his aggressive style, and his training sessions with the Runaways are the best parts of the film.You can't have a music film without the music that inspired it and the soundtrack to the film is awesome. It's loaded with music from the Runaways and Joan's later solo run. The filmmaker's transport you back to the late 70s with their dedication to the style, from the clothes to the music and the fads. The movie has all the ingredients to make a great bio movie, but the execution prevents it from rising to what it could've been.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"grungy and formulaic, nothing special and yet worthwhile for its niche","On occasion, the atmosphere of watching a movie at a theater in a certain circumstance adds to the ambiance. Case in point, The Runaways: I saw it at my local cineplex, where, unbeknownst to me since I last ventured into a particular screen, the one where The Runaways played on (good old theater 8), the sound had gotten a little worse. It was crackly, though one could still hear voices and sound fx and music reasonably well, and on the side of the frames of the 2:35:1 aspect ratio, there was some black fizzle or something. For a more prestige picture or big blockbuster, it might have been a hindrance. For the case of The Runaways, it was just about perfect. This mid-1970's trip through a kick-you-in-the-ball girl rock group complimented the flaws in the stereo-sound and the picture, and it was like listening/watching a worn vinyl LP. This coupled with the attitude of the performances, and some of the songs featured, made it like a near Grindhouse event.That the movie itself is less than great was to be expected. This is one of those rise-fall rock and roll band stories, one you know well if you've seen at least two or three by now (pick your delicious poison, be it The Doors or even Dreamgirls - 'The Fabulous Stains' from the early 80's wouldn't be far off either). And it also has a distinction of being a rise-fall story for a band that was around for only a few years, a less-than-revolutionary girl version of The Sex Pistols, who all wanted to rock but came from different backgrounds and were beat down before they could fully develop rock star egos by a grubby manager/producer.For the Runaways, we mostly get the stories of Cheri Currie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kirsten Steward). Many will know the latter, since she's made several big hit rock singles, but some in the audience (unless you're already a big Runaway fan or fan of the movie Foxes) won't know who Cheri Currie was. Perhaps that was the appeal for the director, first-timer Flori Sigismondi, that we get a view into the lead singer and how she's actually got a family and a place she's coming from, as opposed to Joan Jett who (by the appearance from the film) just came off the streets and immediately had to play guitar or die or go to prison. Certainly that, too, has a bit of the cliché to it (un-attentive mother, alcoholic father, same old same old), but the filmmaker is able to straddle the line between Currie, Jett and producer Kim Fowley (unmistakably hammy Michael Shannon, maybe too hammy in some scenes).Here's the thing that works for the film though: as a real gritty rock movie, as a saga of characters rolling around LA (sometimes right under the Hollywood sign), getting wasted, trashing hotel rooms, getting into madness, being rockers who can stand up to those ""men"" that Fowley says don't want to see girls on stage. Subsequently in the story in the film, he exploits them for all he can, usually when they aren't noticing until it really affects their appearance as rock and rollers as opposed to beauty queens (or, of course, Currie as one). Again, some of these story elements are familiar, but this is not what makes the film so appealing - I didn't go to the Runaways to get a super-insightful script, save for a few little nuggets (i.e. they trained in a trailer!).I went to the Runaways to see rock and roll and rock as it blasted away without care back in the 1970's, albeit shown here as a brew of glam (Bowie) and punk (Pistols) and eventually with Jett and the Blackhearts as a straight up rock and roll band, and that's what I got. I was heavily impressed by the performances of Fanning- who can be legitimately sexy and make it both right for her character and uncomfortable for an audience member to see it in the flesh (and boy it is fleshy!)- and Stewart, who flexes her chops while on leave from the Twilight camp. As mentioned, Shannon is a little too over the top, as he was in Revolutionary Road, but that in and of itself is kind of a marvel, as he isn't taking it seriously, but still has a good time. And the music... ah, for the right fan at the right time, it's blissful to hear and the be blown away by even a movie version of The Runaways, who make one want to rush out and buy any song they recorded. Who knew a revealing, raw-cum-conventional bio-pic would be their best advertisement in years?",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Starry, Starry Night","Greetings again from the darkness. Getting dragged back to the mid-70's can be quite fun, especially when the topic is rock 'n roll. Based on lead singer Cherie Currie's autobiography, this film provides an overview of the formation, sudden fame, and equally sudden dismantling of the first all-girl's rock band, The Runaways.Joan Jett was the heart of the band, but it took oddball music producer Kim Fowley to put the band together and get the recording deal. Fowley may be the most interesting character in this story. Here he is played with force by the very talented Michael Shannon (Revolutionary Road).Instead, the story focuses on Cherie Currie and Joan Jett, mostly Currie, since it is her book! Dakota Fanning plays Cherie Currie as a confused 15 year old with a messed up family life. The family includes a mom, played by Tatum O'Neal, who announces she is getting married and moving to Indonesia. Currie's dad is a very sick alcoholic, so she is an easy recruit for Fowley and Jett. Jett is played balls-out by Kristen Stewart. Yes, Kristen Stewart from Twilight. Here she shows much more of the talent we saw prior to the Twilight series. She captures the fire and spirit of Joan Jett and leaves little doubt she will pursue her dreams despite all obstacles.Overall, the script comes up short and provides us little more than headlines and a quick glimpse. Would have expected much more on talented guitarist Lita Ford, who continues to work today. For a quick intro to the story of The Runaways, this one is fine. Just don't expect much depth.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sex, Drugs, and Rock & Roll","I've been a Runaways fan since 1976, so I had been anticipating this film for a long time. Having read Cherie Currie's book, Neon Angel, on which the film is very loosely based, I was pretty familiar with the broad outlines of the story. As with any film adaptation of a book, I knew they would leave some things out and streamline other things, and I also suspected the film wouldn't be as dark as the book, which turned out to be true.What the film really nailed was the relationship between the Runaways and their sleazy manager/producer Kim Fowley. Michael Shannon does a fabulous job playing this over-the-top character. His expletive-filled rants are simultaneously hilarious and cringe-worthy.The stars, Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning, are both excellent as Joan Jett and Cherie Currie, respectively. Stewart displays Jett's consuming passion for rock and roll and her desire to work hard to be a star. Fanning does a very good job balancing Currie's conflicting desires (to be a rock star and be with her family). It's no secret that the film doesn't spend much time with the other three members of the band. I have no problem with that, since Jett and Currie are, for me, the most interesting and most talented members.The film does a great job showing the band performing. Stewart and Fanning clearly worked hard to be believable as rockers, and it paid off. You see the progression of both characters from neophytes to seasoned performers, and it works. Another aspect is the struggle by the Runaways to be taken seriously. There were very few hard-rocking ladies in 1976, so they faced a lot of skepticism. The film shows this very well.The music is very good. The new versions of Runaways songs are good, although Fanning sounds nothing like Currie. The period songs are a nice selection, from David Bowie to Gary Glitter to the Stooges. The filmmakers nailed the look of the period as well. The clothes, hair, furniture, etc., are just right.Overall, this is an excellent film. I highly recommend it.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Engrossing tale of innocence lost ... with great music!,"Just caught a special screening of The Runaways last night at the Laemmle on Sunset, and it more than exceeded expectations. The leads (Kristen Stewart, Michael Shannon and Dakota Fanning) do an admirable job playing the sullen budding rock star, whacked-out manager and reluctant front girl. At first, it looked as though Stewart was going to fall back on her woe-is-me (woe-is-us who have to suffer through it) Bella character in Twilight, but her performance as Joan Jett soon showed a shyness and vulnerability that made the role three dimensional and overall enjoyable. Shannon gives a wonderful turn as Kim Fowley, The Runaways' too-brilliant-for-his-own-good manager and has some of the best lines in the movie (my friend and I were giddy every time he opened his mouth). But the real star here is Fanning as the innocent Cherie Curie, who didn't ask to be a star but was thrust into the spotlight nevertheless. Watching her downward spiral from innocent young woman (the film opens with her getting her first period) to trying to buy a jug of vodka for breakfast is where this movie soars above others of its ilk. With her big baby blues (wow, those eyes), Fanning portrays innocence lost more effectively than any other actress I can remember. She should be considered for many awards for her performance. Did I mention those eyes?All in all, The Runaways is a fantastic movie. The direction, though ""arty"" at times, fits in well with the rock 'n' roll themes. The script is nearly pitch perfect without being preachy or excessive. The performances great. The soundtrack genius (from Bowie to The Stooges to The Sex Pistols - and even a few Runaways songs). But what really adds to the authenticity of the 70's period piece are the costumes and set design, which transport the audience back into a time when women rockers were practically unheard of. Some of the fashion (where did they find all those platform heels?) even takes on a life of its own. Looking forward to watching this little gem again.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Authentic but unoriginal film-making,"Truth may often be stranger than fiction, but that doesn't mean it makes an interesting film, and this is a classic case in point. Having hit the music scene at the very end of the 70's and been immediately hooked by Siouxsie & The Banshees and their contemporaries, I was vaguely aware of Joan Jett, but not much more than that. Despite what I thought was an excellent central performance by Kristen Stewart, I didn't come out of the cinema after this film feeling that I'd learnt a whole lot more about Joan Jett, or her place in history. There was no doubt that The Runaways gave tradition a good kick in the teeth, and hacked a fearsome swathe through a stale, male-dominated industry – but the sense of how difficult and cutting edge it must have been to form an all-girl teenage band at that time felt underplayed.Instead, we are treated to a formulaic and generic sex'n'drugs'rock'n'roll story that applies to so many bands, concentrating on the interplay between the 2 leads and their producer/manager, egos over-inflated by sudden success and nihilistic burn-out. Whilst The Runaways may have been one of the first to go through this process in real life, in terms of rock biopics, they're very late to the party, and it just felt like a clichéd resume offering nothing that we hadn't already seen before in other, better genre movies – for example, both 'Breaking Glass' and the outstanding 'Almost Famous' are more accomplished, satisfying and engaging pieces of film-making, albeit largely works of fiction.So, a standard, angry rebel rock bio-pick that is well-made and thumps along nicely, but what it offered in authenticity (apart from the rubbish plastic dogshit) it lacked in originality. 6.5/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice Performances Sell the Film,"Runaways, The (2010)*** (out of 4)By the numbers but entertaining look at the girl rock group The Runaways and their lead singer Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) and guitar player Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart). The film follows them from being discovered by producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) to the touring, drug addiction and eventual break-up. It's hard to watch any rock and roll film today and not feel a bit of deja vu because all of these bios are starting to look like one another. I guess you can't blame the stories so much it's just that all of these artists pretty much lived the same type of lives and they followed the same paths of destruction. While we have seen everything here before, this is still a pretty strong film thanks in large part to some terrific performances by the leads. Stewart certainly has the look and energy as Jett and I thought she was very believable in the role. The scenes with her shouting, screaming and trying to take control of a situation towards the end of the film inside a sound booth was very effective. I also thought Shannon was terrific as the creepy, Frankenstein-looking producer who is as out there as any character we've seen from these rock pics. Scout Taylor-Compton is nice in her scenes as Lita Ford and even Tatum O'Neal shows up as Currie's mother. The real star of the picture is without question Fanning who makes the role her own and does so much with it even though we've seen that type of character before. I thought Fanning was incredibly effective as you could really feel the torture her character was going through and you could just see all the demons that she was battling. She certainly has the sexuality for the role but she also gave so much in terms of the character development that you can't take your eyes off of her. The music in the film was another plus even though I wasn't overly familiar with it. I thought the way they used the music in the film was effective and especially towards the end when Jett begins to break out on her own. I think the most entertaining thing here is the stuff we've seen before and that's the rise to the top and eventual fall. I think the film suffers when it tries to center on more professional relationships like the one between Currie and her sister. I never bought into that relationship and thought the film was more entertaining when it focused on the band.

seductive cautionary tale,"I am rarely interested in seeing new movies, but I knew I would have to see this one when I heard about it. I remember The Runaways, though I was a little too young to really understand or appreciate them. My older sister was wild about them. Thirty-five years later I still know the words to ""Cherry Bomb."" The film version of the Runaways phenomenon was not disappointing. It was extremely evocative of the heady, edgy years that were the mid-seventies, and the huge splash that The Runaways made in those years. All of the performances were very convincing, including Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett and Dakota Fanning as Cherie Currie. I have to say, though, it really disturbed me to see Dakota Fanning, who may still have been 14 when the movie was made, simulating sex, smoking, drinking, and taking massive quantities of drugs, not to mention recreating Cherie Currie's lewd and sexually sophisticated gestures while performing. I really hope, for her sake, that Dakota is NOT as sophisticated as she appears in this film. I am far from a prude, but I would never let my 14-year-old daughter play a role like this. The implications are really frightening. I hope that Tatum O'Neal, playing Cherie's mother in the film, warned Dakota about the dangers of living fast and hard at such a young age.Interestingly, the real Cherie Currie is and was quite a good singer and performer, and her Runaways performances were much more raw and electric that what Dakota Fanning delivered in an otherwise excellent performance. Maybe, hopefully, Miss Fanning really isn't sophisticated enough to inhabit such a chilling role. As graphic as the movie was, I'm sure it didn't show the half of what the real Runaways experienced as 15 and 16 year-olds. Anyway, the film is very effective and pretty original. It's good to see a movie where women get to break out of the mold, which is almost as rare today as it was in the 70s. Just one of the many reasons why I usually don't bother seeing new movies...",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Not too bad, but needs much more","""When you stop to let 'em know you got it down...it's just another town along the road""--Jackson BrowneThe sole intention of The Runaways (as a film) is to get inside the heads of the five girls who rocked the world in 1975. The film comes close to, and sometimes does hit the mark, but its general sense of drama is inconsistent. A large portion of the Runaways is too choppy, and many scenes feel like they are several minutes too short. I have a feeling that plenty of good material got lost in the editing room.I'm a little dubious about Kristen Stewart's future career as an actress. Though definitely more admireable than Twilight, her performance is torpid, and doesn't earn my sympathy. Dakota Fanning, is much better, perhaps because the camera is on her more, but she does a much better job of acting with her face.Their ability to portray rock stars on stage is impressive, but the music numbers are too brief. The Runaways left me a little frustrated, but it's still a film worth checking out, just take a moment before you go see it and ask yourself, what do you expect from it.(If it's actual music you want maybe the Runaways isn't the film for you)",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Well done, but a bit boring","When I heard that the movie was telling the story of one of the bands in which Joan Jett played, I wanted to see it. Expecting a deluge of estrogenic hormonal music and pure rock and roll, I was a bit taken aback by the artsy, silent, character oriented take of the film, but in the end I liked it.The movie is about The Runaways, an all girl rock band which reached cult status in 1975, but the real story is more of the young and lost teens that were part of it. All the actresses play well, Dakota Fanning again showing a lot of skill, and one of the executive producers in the movie is Joan Jett herself, so the story must be close to the truth.Unfortunately there is too little focus on the actual music and the pained silences of the characters turn this more into a drama than a band movie. The start is boring, the pace gets a little better towards the end, but I guess you have to be in the mood to like it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Slow, dull, tedious film.  A disappointing effort.","The story (or legend) of the Runaways is fertile ground for screenwriters and filmmakers. It has all the requisite elements that a good, wild, invigorating drama needs -- LA in the late 70's, some of the sleaziest characters the music industry can conjure up, the ""boy band"" prototype (in this case, ""girl band"") taking a new tack and opening up new musical territory, disaffected and angry teen girls from the Valley trying to make their mark in the world, young starry-eyed teens gaining a flittering slice of fame and living the alluring rock and roll life.This film, unfortunately, follows a self-indulgent, ponderous, ""explorative"" path that focuses less on the invigorating pace and action of the creative, high energy world of rock and roll in the late 70s, and more (far, far more) on the feelings, conflicts, attitudes and sentiments of the principal characters. It doesn't work. In fact, it fails quite badly.It's a slow, dull, tedious film that reeks of amateur, quasi-artistic production tones. A character tone piece is a tricky thing to tackle as a director and/or writer. It requires astute artistic instinct and sensibility, the ability to develop and promote scene and setting as principal (and interesting) elements that guide the film, mainly the characters, through the expository journey.This production failed, and what we get are a bunch of miscast young actors forced to overact and drag out both passive and active dramatic elements, ad nauseum. Again, it's tedious and amateurish, and it completely misses the artistic mark, which is to convey the look, feel, excitement and angst of the music industry in that era.I couldn't wait for the film to finally, mercifully end.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
history narrowed,"Oh yes, 'The Runaways' is a good movie. Also for those who aren't aware that it's about the first all-female group in history of rock.The plot narrows itself down to Kim Fowley (manager), Cherie Currie (lead singer) and Joan Jett (rythm-guitarist). Which is not wrong, but makes that you miss out on a lot of other interesting historical facts about this great Californian rock-band.About lead-guitarist Lita Ford, for instance. She and Jett were the only band-members able to continue their career in rock-music after the Runaways split up.About bass-player Jackie Fox, who left the band out of frustration for getting badly paid. Fox became a lawyer in the American music business instead.The great thing about the Runaways is the magnificent cooperation between their two renowned guitarists Joan Jett and Lita Ford. Between Jett's earsplitting rhythms and Ford's virtuoso lead. This cooperation really earned 'The Runaways' a place in rock history.Further 'The Runaways' were the first all-female rock-group at a time when people didn't even think about such a thing. And they also played their rock in a period when pop-music's trend was very soft, greatly influenced by 'The Eagles'.By the way, this film hardly contains any 'Runaways'-music. For this you'd better turn to internet or to a CD. To 'The Runaways live in Japan', for instance, a CD recording their live-concert from 1977 in Japan. At that time 'The Runaways' peaked in a country where they were hugely popular.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Running into Michael Shannon,"Michael Shannon is really great in this. He's really out there and almost steals the movie from our two leads (played by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning). I had no idea who they were playing or what the movie was about (having seen it at a Sneak Preview and generally avoiding reading too much beforehand).It's about growing up, about the music business, with very good performances. Though you might find it difficult to watch Dakota in a role like this, if you are used to see her as a kid. Well she's on the verge of becoming an adult and that plays into the role too of course. Kristen playing a sort of anchor in the movie. It is not a perfect movie, but it has many things going for it (the actors for one)!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Pedestrian BioPic, lifted by performances","Ahhh, the 70s. For me, in middle America, it was a time of 3/4 length sleeve baseball t-shirts and bell bottoms, polyester and frustration that my hair wouldn't fall into a straight smooth wedge cut. I was listening to pop music and dancing to Soul Train.On the west coast, things were more glam, with platforms and straight leg jeans. Watching the new movie, The Runaways is fun, because they do capture the essence of that time. Girls were taking this idea of women's liberation and pushing the envelope. An unsupervised teen named Joanie Larkin held on to a guitar that her Dad gave her and pursued big dreams of an all-girl rock band. Her story, along with Cherie Currie's memoir, Neon Angel, are combined to form The Runaways, which is the name of Joanie's band. She became Joan Jett, who teamed up with dodgey producer and promoter, Kim Fowley. They recruited Cherie and the other girls and shot to fame. But, this success story is also a cautionary tale, with 15 year old girls on their own, with raging hormones, unscrupulous adults and lots of drugs and booze available. I got to talk to Cherie Currie about those days, but I wish I could talk to her again, now, after the movie. There are so many more things I'd like to know. The book, Neon Angel, is compelling, but painful to read. The move, The Runaways, is compelling, but painful to watch. If you didn't know that much of what happens is true, you'd say it's unbelievable. I was interested in the story. The performances are excellent. I've never been a huge fan of Kristen Stewart, because she seems to play the same character, over and over. But here, it's almost as if she's channeling Joan Jett, and the portrayal is uncanny. Dakota Fanning is almost unrecognizable as Cherie Currie. Michael Shannon is creepy to the extreme as Kim Fowley. This trio elevates the movie above After School Special dialogue. It's the quiet scenes that stay with you: the band, in the back of a limo, after a long tour, looking old beyond their years; Joan, in the bathtub, crafting lyrics. Great story, some great performances, but the script and the storytelling fall short. I give The Runaways a 7 out of 10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
It's a review. So what?,"I love this movie, it's one of the best rock biopic's I've seen. I admire the deft touch with which Floria Sigismondi directed this movie. I like this director and hope she makes more movies. The film reminded me of how much I always loved this band, even though I cottoned on to them long after they'd split.Great casting and great performances which really captured the zeitgeist. Moreover, and this is really the most important aspect of the story – it successfully informs the importance of these womens' role in breaking down barriers and expectations of women in rock music and really paved the way for the female rock musicians that came after. And let's not forget Kim Fowley's insight and vision that played a big part in that. Rogue perhaps but this guy had a feel for true grit.This movie made me remember why I fell in love with Lita, Joan and Cherie in the first place. And the actors that played them couldn't have done a better job. Kristen and Dakota are exemplary. Special mention for art direction, costume and make-up and great cinematography.",,Anonymous,Music
The Runaways (2010),"""The Runaways,"" a film about the jail-bait trailblazing bad-girl rock band from the 1970s that spawned Joan Jett, succeeds because of how authentic it feels. The clubs are properly scuzzy. The dialogue is properly raunchy. The actors can properly sing. The hair is fried and feathered.It is based on the book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway by the band's lead vocalist Cherie Currie.Dakota Fanning in The Runaways (2010)
the band's jailbait front-kitten.Dakota Fanning saunters around on screen in her underwear, just as the real life Currie titillated a generation of young men. That includes me as when I was 12 years old my older cousin gave me a Runaway LP record, I played that crap out of it . I was infatuated with Cherie Currie. I lost the album but I own it on the CD format.Fanning delivers the progression of Currie from sweet little girl with a tough look to bonafied, drug-addled cherry bomb. And along the way, I buy it all. Dakota steels the movie she is tremendous. Fanning's performance is mature, emotive and as dynamic as I've seen from any young actress recently.Did Dakota and Kristen really sing in the film ? Yes. Jett raved about the singing abilities of Stewart and Dakota Fanning, who plays Runaways singer Cherie Currie, in the film -- ""The voices fans will hear in the live performance scenes belong to the actresses themselves. ""When you see Kristen singing, that's really her singing,"" said Jett.Kristen Stewart in The Runaways (2010)
The brooding, budding rhythm guitarist named Joan Jett -- a part Kristen Stewart slips into as easily . Stewart is a good fit for the tough but good-natured Jett, who carried on as frontwoman after Currie left, then launched a far more successful solo career.This entertaining film captures the struggles and the innocence of the members of the group who are just figuring out their own identities. 7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Recommended for fans of rock music.,"I have just watched The Runaways for the second time, and, as a fan of rock music, this is one of my favorite biographical film about a music artist or band. The film explains the rise and fall of the musical phenomenon The Runaways back in the 70s, and focus on the tension and drama of its performers, Cherie Currie and Joan Jett. The film does a very good job in retelling the story and the soundtrack is superb, especially the tracks that were re-performed by Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart. The film doesn't go any more further than that, and it feels a little short and unsatisfying somehow, even with a subtle ending. However with the powerful performance of Michael Shannon, Dakota Fanning, and Kristen Stewart - this film is a must-see for all fans of rock music alike.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Queens of Noise""- Still Reigning.","Based on the book ""Neon Angels"", by Cherie Currie, ex-sex symbol and lead singer of the 70's all-girl punk rock band, The Runaways, the movie doesn't disappoint. Apart from the experiences of the band itself, it touches on the subjects of sex and drugs, inevitable in the lives of rock musicians, especially in the 70's. Feminism receives its fair share too, the opening scene being that of Cherie's first period; somewhat icky, yet meaningful and symbolic of The Runaway's propulsion into a male-dominated industry.(""Girls don't play electric guitar!""- Joan Jett's guitar teacher)As a fan of the band, I was a curious to watch the movie,a bit annoyed by the fact that Kristen Stewart, whose main claim-to-fame was her bland, forgettable portrayal of Bella Swann in the tedious Twilight movies, was cast as Joan Jett. However, one really can't blame her for that, considering that the character itself was bland and forgettable, and there really wasn't much she could do with it. But I'll expound my anti-Twilight sentiments someplace else. At the end of the movie, I was left feeling sheepish about my judgmental thoughts that she was going to bomb,and was floored by her performance. Stewart's depiction of the female rock legend is near-perfect, from her manner of talking to her tomboyish body language.Michael Shannon (from Revolutionary Road) does a commendable job as Kim Fowley, the eccentric record producer/ songwriter, who managed the band. However, the true star of the movie is the immensely-talented Dakota Fanning. Her fantastic performance as Cherie Currie is guaranteed to leave gaping mouths and widened eyes, proving that she is definitely one of the most talented actresses of this generation. And, that she has clearly grown-up! It was startling to watch the same little girl from ""I Am Sam"", all grown-up, dazzling on-screen in skimpy outfits, sparkly platform shoes and heavy make-up, with the ""jail bait"" sex appeal and demeanor of the 'Cherry Bomb'. Not to mention the steamy shower scene and girl-on-girl action involving her and Twilight co-star, Kristen Stewart. Which, to be honest,I was somewhat scandalized by. It is eerie watching ex(just barely)-child actresses passionately make-out!It may not be a deeply moving biopic, but the incredible performances, great direction, and kick-ass music (From David Bowie to the Sex Pistols) makes ""The Runaways"" a more than enjoyable watch. Oh, and did I mention that The Runaways' songs in the movie weren't lip-synced to, rather, actually sung by the leading women? Some people just have all the talent. Hmmph.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie,"Great movie. It's told from Cherie's point of view. As most of you know, Kristen Stewart plays Joan Jett. A lot of people hang sh*t on her acting because of the Twilight Movies...

Don't overlook this movie because of Kristen Stewart and say ""Oh no she's the chick from Twilight"" Hire the movie. Don't get put off. That said, I think Kristen Stewart done a fantastic job playing Joan Jett. Excellent in fact... She's caught my eye, and I will be looking out for her in the future...

Very Disappointing,"The movie is titled ""The Runaways"" yet only tells the story of two members of the band... and the two least talented members as well. The best musicians in the band were Lita Ford, Jackie Fox, and Sandy West, and they are barely mentioned or shown. The movie ends up being a very self serving Joan Jett and Cherie curry promo and it is clear their egos and self interest got the best of them.For those of you who are unaware, ""I Love Rock and Roll"", ""Crimson and Clover"" and ""Love Hurts"" were all covers. Joan didn't write any of those songs. There is nothing wrong with that... I'm just stating that to enforce the fact that while Joan is very famous, she is famous for her covers, not really for her own music. She is a great performer and understands the attitude and ""look"" to entertain a crowd. Those skills are very important. I just take offense at how she ignored the other members of the band... especially when the other members were the REAL MUSICIANS who made the backbone of the band.If you are going to make an entire movie about the troubled family of Cherie Curry and her friendship with Joan, then don't title the movie ""The Runaways.""",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Still running,"I've read sentences longer than the scenes in this movie. It starts off at a sprint and keeps going and going and going. It's all about hair, shoes, uppers and downers, teenage angst, loneliness and heartache, and it all feels true. Rather than father hatred there's father longing, the sex is raw but not exploitative, and the performances are sensational. Riley Keough (Cherie's sister) and Michael Shannon are terrific, and Tatum O'Neal nails the very small role of Cherie's mother. ""It seems that two qualities are necessary if a great artist is to remain creative to the end of a long life; he must on the one hand retain an abnormally keen awareness of life, must always demand the impossible and when he cannot have it, must despair. The burden of the mystery must be with him day and night. He must be shaken by the naked truths that will not be comforted. This divine discontent, this disequilibrium, this state of inner tension is the source of artistic energy."" That was written about Goethe a long time ago, and could be written about Joan Jett today.

Life In The Fast Lane,"The Runaways is an entertaining story of the rise and fall of the eponymous band, with good lead performances by Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning as the mainstays of the group, Joan Jett and Cherie Currie. The story itself is a familiar one, no less so because it is probably largely true of the arc of many rock bands, an arc lampooned brilliantly by This is... Spinal Tap, and you will see comparisons between this film and that comic fiction, but what Christopher Guest did not stretch the limits of his fiction to are the wild-eyed antics of crack-pot impresario Kim Fowley, brilliantly played by Michael Shannon. Among the many fresh faces on show is an older one who was the child protégé of her day, Tatum O'Neal (ask your mum), daughter of Ryan O'Neal (ask your gran), as Cherie's mother.

Stewart steps it up in hazy 70s rock biopic,"I've never been completely sold on Kristen Stewart as an actress – she impressed everyone in Panic Room back in 2002 but has since been overshadowed by her own franchise, Twilight. But now, with the release of The Runaways, people might see the great actress that's been buried underneath three vampire movies' worth of pap.Chronicling the rise and inevitable fall of 70s all-girl rock band The Runaways, Kristen Stewart plays Suzie Quatro-a-like Joan Jett, a young guitarist whose rock and roll aspirations see her paired with 15-year-old Bardot bombshell, Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning). The two are brought together by crazed musical impresario Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) whose tactics for pushing the girls to their limit include screaming, 'Now, buckle up and get ready for boot camp, babies – you're gonna be trained like the Viet f**king Cong.' But with such success comes the classic trappings of fame including drugs, sex, booze and tension between band mates as Cherie's star rises higher than her cohort's. The more famous she becomes, the more she is tortured by the family she left behind including her put-upon sister Marie (Riley Keough) who cares for their alcoholic father.Director/photographer Floria Sigismondi has an expert eye which captures the wild 70s haze that surrounds the band as they perform throughout the movie. Fanning's portrayal of Currie is very engaging as she teeters between rock goddess and the little girl lost, struggling to decide where her loyalties lie – with her band or her real family. She almost nails it but she lacks the passion that drives Currie to join the band in the first place.Stewart on the other hand has Joan Jett down pat and is utterly believable as the dykey guitarist/songwriter whose occasionally Sapphic relationship with Currie is tested by drug use and Fowley's manipulation. Michael Shannon proves himself to be an absolute wonder as the maniacal Fowley whose eyes flash with dollar signs when he realises that he can market the girls as jail-bait. Hey, sex sells.The film is based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway so it's more than a little biased towards Currie's personal journey yet still manages to provide Stewart with enough material to shine as Jett. It's wild, sexy and filled with pumped up rock and roll performances that make for an enjoyable dose of 70s nostalgia.",,Anonymous,Music
A Nutshell Review: The Runaways,"There's Johnny Cash, and there's Ray Charles, and now get ready for Hollywood's latest biopic on the all female rock group The Runaways, based on lead singer Cherie Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway, from which the screenplay was adapted from. Written and directed by Italian filmmaker Floria Sigismondi, as far as biographies on musical legends go, this film still adheres to the same formula, but only because the fate of the stars are such that temptation to go wayward comes stronger for anyone who's a somebody, and frankly such meteoric rise and fall makes for an engrossing drama.With bands though, an additional element comes in the form of inflated egos that have to be massaged. Unfortunately out of the five members, only drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) share some of the spotlight up front, with the remaining two Lita Ford (Scout Taylor- Compton) and Jackie Fox (unmentioned by name in the film) relegated to draping the background almost anonymously and one might think that The Runaways are a trio. And similar to what Alvin and the Chipmunks Squekeul did as a parallel to real world happenings, band managers, in this case Kim Fowley played by Michael Shannon in an arresting performance who knows exactly what's required to survive in the dog-eat-dog industry, almost always want to sex up and boost the lead's popularity even further, which will cause unhappiness amongst the others in the same group. But who can help it, since from the onset both Kim and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) wanted a Brigitte Bardot sex kitten to front the lead vocals for their band, who comes in the form of Dakota Fanning's Cherie Currie.Much has been said of Dakota Fanning's performance as Cherie Currie, and true to form she shows again why she's probably the undisputed actress of her generation. I strongly believe if she stays the course and not get distracted by the glitz and glamour that most teenage stars in Hollywood will likely succumb to, then movie fans, and fans of hers, will be in for many treats in store as she expands her filmography. So far she has been confined to playing her age over the last few years, and her role here as the jailbait of a rock star allows for a descent into vice coming all at once, dabbling with almost every vice you can think of. Her Cherie pouts as she experiments with fleeting same sex relationships with Joan Jett, swearing, no hesitation in showing the middle fingers, puffs away on cigarettes, does cocktail and hard drugs almost everywhere, and like a one-up in portraying the state of drunkenness as to what she had done in Push, though still not very convincing. It's Dakota Fanning like you've never seen her before.Kristen Stewart managed to barely hold her own against her co-star's more charismatic and iconic turn, and thankfully the opportunity came in the last act of the film with the formation of Joan Jett and the Blackhearts, who are heard rather than seen since this is The Runaways biopic. It served the narrative quite well though in ending the film with the unfortunate demise of one and the creation of another, highlighting Joan Jett being the brains and creative force behind the bands. Between the two girls, hers is the edgier role playing very well opposite the sex-kittenish one that Fanning has on her hands, and put together they just crackle and come alive with plenty of energy on stage, or when practicing in their trailer park behind closed doors, working on new songs. Forget Twilight, as Stewart shows that she has enough mettle in her to take on more challenging roles rather than a girl who has to deal solely with relationship woes with unreal creatures.The Runaways contained enough subplots happening outside of the music industry to give it an all round experience, and since the story's adapted from Currie's book, there's an examination into the sibling rivalry between Cherie and her sister Marie (Riley Keough), and some had mentioned the more controversial aspects of her life had been omitted from the film, such as instances of sexual abuse when young. Then there's the entire episode of their visit to Japan recounted as well, and became the fulcrum for possibly the best stage performance by the stars in their roles, and to sow the seed of discord as well. The pacing of the band's formative years, success and downfallThe film has its production sets and art direction to thank for in bringing back the nostalgic 70s, as well as the rock-n-rolling songs from the mentioned bands, some performed by the real deal, while others ably imitated and covered by the reel ones, which is oh-so-important to be convincing. It's a film that deals with girl power in an almost alpha-feminist way, but human failings affect everyone regardless of gender.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Weak story telling and bad directing broke these Runaways up....,"I don't know why all the love, I thought the movie didn't cover anything about the Runaways in depth, it was random scenes in their career that really didn't jell into a real movie about them or explain anything about their lives. The movie was just the chick from twilight doing a hammy Jett impression and Dakota in not one of her better acting jobs as Cheri.With that said, the 70's was a interesting time for music and the Runaways were one of the better of that period. This movie was very superficial about their rise and ignores a lot of key details. It doesn't even establish that this band went through various musicians and spanned half a decade. If you took this movie as gospel you would think they had one Hit and maybe two albums in the span of a year then broke up, because a time line is never established.The movie needed a re-edit to clear through the muddled directing and poor story structure. But it wasn't bad, dunno about recommending it on it's own merits. I had to google about the girls and the band just to figure out what was trying to be told. But hell Joan was in a class of her own in the 80's, in the 70's the Runaways had a lot to learn and a lot of potential. Too bad the movie ignored most of the band and told nothing.But hell, I guess if you have Dakota fanning acting as a half naked Jailbait 70's rock princess on drugs and The twilight Chick running around in her underwear most people won't see the the plot holes or crappy directing and rave about it's originality for all the wrong reasons.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great film but lacking depth,"This film is a biopic of the first teenage all-girl rock band who made it big back it the late 70's with hits such as 'Cherry Bomb' and 'Queens of Noise'. The film charts the first few years from the formation of the band right through to the trials involving drug addiction and fights within the band.What I liked about The Runaways: the style, the music and Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart in roles a million miles off what I have seen before. As far as music biopics go it seemed quite short or perhaps not as in depth as I would have liked. I had read a little bit about the band when I had heard the film was being released last year which made me want to see more however it ended a little abruptly for me. I'd not heard any of the band's music before nor did I know anything about the band themselves - thankfully they didn't scrimp on the music or the costumes.The film focuses mainly on band members Cherie Currie (Fanning) and Joan Jett (Stewart) from when the band was formed, to them getting signed by Mercury Records right through to Currie parting ways with the group and Jett releasing her first solo album.Fanning makes the transition from child star to adult actor well and looks great as the lead singer of The Runaways. Stewart shows there is more to her than the Twilight films (and general all round powtiness - hey it works for Team Edward/Jacob so don't knock it).In the film there is only one family back story which was for Cherie Currie, which included twin sister Marie whom she later went on to release records with. This made for a more intimate insight into the character.I would have like to have had one for Joan Jett also as there is an interesting character tale there, and one there was definitely room for.My favourite quote from the film was from the band's Manager Kim Fowley played by Michael Shannon: 'The Runaways were... a conceptual rock project that failed.... Do I regret that they turned on me? No, I'm glad they turned on me. It shows spirit. If I'm training a wild dog, and the dog bites my hand, I know I've trained him well...

like a bad episode of  vh1j's behind the music,"This movie paled in comparison to some of the shows vh1 has done about bands. There's usually just a lot more craziness going on that what this movie showed. Sure there's drug use, but it's tame for some rockers.The movie starts in LA where Joan Jett and Cherie Currie are still teens in the club scene. Joan teams up with a music producer and they find other players for the band and eventually hire Cherie to be lead singer. The band's big gimmick is they are still teens. Next thing you know, they are touring overseas, which I don't see how since they didn't have parents with them. They start the drug use, but nothing to wild. Cherie gets a big ego and gets more attention, leading to tension in the band.

Here Comes the Cherry Bomb,"The Runaways is a biopic about the first all-girl rock band from the 70's with Cherie Currie as the lead singer and Joan Jett as the second voice and guitarist. The movie is directed by Floria Sigismondi, who is mostly known for directing music videos. Floria also adapted the screenplay for this film from Cherie Currie's autobiographical book Neon Angel: The Cherrie Currie Story. What makes this an interesting movie is that Joan Jett actually produced this film so we have both views from the main stars of The Runaways that paved the way for other female rock bands in the future. I really enjoyed this biopic and found it one of the most entertaining films of the year so far thanks to a good screenplay and some great performances from the entire cast. The music in the film is also great and Dakota Fanning surprised me with her good vocals. I was not familiar with The Runaways before watching this movie, but I did recognize some of their songs. Cherie Currie might have received all the praise during those early years, but who later rose to fame was Joan Jett, and anyone familiar with the rock industry has heard of her. This is the story of the band she first played for before reaching true fame with Joan Jett and the Blackhearts. Whether you enjoy rock music or you don't the movie still is worth your time because it has some great performances and is really well produced, and I guarantee you that by the end of the film you will want to read more about their story.From a very young age Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) had a dream of one day making history by forming the first all-girl rock band. Rock and roll was her life and it was a way to get away from all her troubles back home (which aren't developed in this movie). One day she runs into the legendary music producer, Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) who is seduced by her idea and introduces her to drummer Sandy West (Stella Maeve) so that they can start playing together. All the band really needs now according to Kim is a hot lead singer and they find in Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) the perfect one because of her David Bowie and Bridget Bardot look. Or as Fowley puts it: ¨I like your style. A little Bowie, a little Bardot, and a look on your face that says I could kick the sh&t out of a truck driver.¨ Since the film is based on Currie's autobiography we do get some background about her family. She basically lives alone with her teenage sister, Marie (Riley Keough) because their mom has left with another man to Indonesia and their dad is an alcoholic. Cherie finds the perfect opportunity to pursue her dreams and joins the band. The movie begins exploring the early years of The Runaways and their rise to fame, along with some of the issues the band faced from arguments to drug addiction. Of course there are a lot of things that are left out in a two hour movie and the film doesn't delve too much into the character's past, but it works nonetheless as a biopic about the band.Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart prove that they can act in more serious and independent roles and don't have to rely on their star power or act only in blockbuster movies. They give really good performances in this film and are a major reason why this movie was so successful. It would not be fair to ignore Michael Shannon in this film, because his role as Kim Fowley was excellent. It was a supporting role, but he shines in every scene and is also a major reason why this movie worked so well. Yes, the movie does have its flaws because there isn't enough time to delve in the characters past nor perhaps the real struggles that the band faced, but it is a great movie that will leave you wanting to learn more about their story. The Runaways has a pretty realistic and raw feeling to it and I think Floria Sigismondi did a great job as a first time full length director in this film and with the screenplay as well. I think this is a movie worth seeing whether you are a fan of rock or not. It reminded me a lot of Sam Raimi's Control (a biopic about the 80's band Joy Division) which a lot of people haven't seen either.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
the runaways...very disappointing,"The long awaited movie the runaways has finally been released in Aussie this week..being a runaways fan from the tender age of 12! (yes 12)to following the careers of Joan Jett and Lita Ford right through to present day I was looking forward to this! hell yeahHaving read both versions of neon angels by Cherie Currie (the first one is quite watered down) the more recent version contains a better portrayal of what these girls experienced under the guidance of Kim Fowley.Was the film accurate? No, a lot was eliminated.I would think because of the Jett/Laguana camp which is one point I cannot understand,Why Joan would allow herself to be portrayed as a rampant lesbian.For yrs the deal of her sexuality has been ignored/denied.As for the others, they offered Lita Ford a thousand dollar for her life story and she told them where to get off!There was no mention of Sandy West (rip) at the end of the movie only Joan,Cherie and Kim.. Jackie Fox original bassist was going to sue if they mentioned her as she thought it was crap too!Kari Krome wrote cherry bomb with Jett for Cherie's audition. there was no mention of her?? Kim was abusive and controlling . I feel the movie portrayed him as an eccentric guy with a caring heart. would I have allowed my daughter to go with him,NO! it shows a shot of him going to see Sandy West, her mum answers the door to him in horror.True,but he was wearing a bright orange jump suit and heavy makeup,it didn't show that, only his reflection in the mirror.the audition for dodging trash was accurate.On the road?/ he made Joan in charge?mm don't think so. Scott the tour manager was seducing Cherie Currie who fell pregnant and had an abortion which was not covered.It wasn't made clear how Kim drove a wedge within the band, he pimped Cherie off with well known singer of the day whilst it was that time of the month in the book he uses her up and spits her out out. The corset? she didn't buy in japan,she saw it in a shop window before one of their earlier gigs and changed out of her jumpsuit in a cramped toilet/come dressing room before jumping on stage to the horror of the other girls.As for the tour of Japan Jackie fox left when her bass was broken and she hurt herself with a broken bottle.I felt when Cherie character said no, to recording and walked out they made this the end of the band but they went on a further two?more years with albums released but this was not mentioned. or the fact that the girls went in different directions, Sandy and Lita toward metal and Joan a more punk edge. It basically said Joan was ""lost"" til I love Rock and Roll became a hit.?According to Cherie's book she worked in a linen store not cake supply shop for less than minimum wage. The scene were you see her trying to buy booze was when she lived with a drug dealer who supplied her in cocaine . Also the scene were she rings her sister to come get her is very close to the phone box scene from the Rose I thought.She was a drug addict but had the support of a loving family til her sister became pregnant and refused to help her anymore.I feel Dakota did not portray the real Cherie,she is too young and pure.thats not a bad thing!! Kirsten Stewart got Joan's mannerisms down pat but,all we could see was Bella. I think she will be type cast for ever. If you want a true portrayal of life in the Runaways Edge-play by Victory Tisler Blue is the one to watch. She was the replacement bass player to Jackie fox, who has gone on to be a film maker. There are heartfelt and truthful interviews with Cherie, Lita,Jackie, and Sandy Joan was asked to contribute and her and manager wanted to see product and put an injunction on it banning runaways music being used, amongst other things so she wasn't included in the final product. Would I see this movie again?? I don't think so, would recommend you see it?Not really pay your money take your choice. the runaways music is brilliant, it has always stood out for me, the girls were only 16/17 years old at the time of the runaways first album but they sounded like pros.There were so many other things in the movie that was wrong, but hey, I didn't live it.! So if you want to listen to great music by a teenage girl band, forget the Donna's, forget Avril Lavigne, the Runaways kicked down the door that led the way for woman rockers!!! well for all girl band that is.. because of them we have Girlschool, L7, Rock Goddess and all the other fine metal woman of today.so kudos to you Joan for having the dream. Lita ford for being the rock goddess you are, Cherie for having the balls to release your story, Jackie fox for being a great bass player, Vicki Blue for replacing her, and RIP Sandy West a girl who only wanted to play rock and roll!!!",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Not Girl Scouts,"""You dogs would be lucky to get a gig singing in the shower. Go sell girl scout cookies."" Manager Kim FowleyThe last half of the '70's was a time of growth for me, away from rock 'n roll and toward family and profession. For the Runaways, the first all-girl arena-filling rock band, it was a time of the sex, drugs, and . . . well, you know the cliché already.The Runaways centers not on Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) but the drug-addled lead singer Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning). Although Jett had enough ambition for all five girls, Currie had the bod and the Monroe-like sexiness. Fortunately, after Currie abandons them for a confused notion of home, Jett finally goes it without her and pumps her fist for millions of ""I Love Rock and Roll"" in 1882.For a couple of years this band made believers of those hard core rock fans who thought girls didn't belong in the same hall of fame as the Beatles. More sexy than that iconic band but less talented, the Runaways serve as a caution about the heady, amoral world of rock stardom.This film seems more interested in seeing what the band looked like (director Floria Sigismondi has built a career in video) than in the development of character; my case in point is her missing opportunities to mine the Jett persona rather than the Currie anarchy. She does better with the charismatic manager, Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon), whose combination of abuse and love was crucial to their tough style and endurance in a man's world. The training sessions in his trailer are a fine representation of the incubation and the working-class roots of their lives and their genre.I'm feeling once again that I don't want a ride back there in the Hot Tub Time Machine—the scene is scary and dicey. I'd much rather stay home and tap into my Internet connections with news of contemporary bad actors like Jesse James and Britney Spears. Now they would fit even better in Sigismondi's superficial world",,Anonymous,Music
Decent if slightly disjointed rock bio,"This was pretty good; dirty, raunchy, in your face and capturing the spirit and essence of the mid 1970's perfectly.The story follows the conception and early days of ""The Runaways"" an all girl punk band that took the world by storm and focuses mostly on the tumultuous relationship between Joan Jett and Cherie Currie.I'll admit to questioning the casting here and initially having a hard time excepting Dakota Fanning in the role of sex-kitten junkie Currie. She does a fantastic job though and her downward spiral was the part of the story that interested me the most. I'm not a huge fan of K-Stew but she looks just like and captures the toughness of Joan Jett really well. I did get tired of seeing her in leather pants in every single scene though. The clothes and hair in general are super fun, the music is great, the story as a whole felt kinda disjointed. Michael Shannon is suitably weird/sleazy as their manager. 8/12/14",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Rock'n""roll Biopic Not In The Best Of Shapes","Oh yeah, it is a way too difficult to film biopics about real rock bands. If the members are still alive, they can meddle in the process, send a scathing review after the film is made, or ask to be withdrawn from the script altogether if they fear their part in a given movie would be not so good. Or even the time limits of a film, even if the band in question, The Runaways, exited for not so many years, still, many many key events have to be omitted or so heavily shortened that any fan will end up scratching their head and asking whether it was what they wanted to see. Mind you, this version is not bad at all, as a musician myself, I must admit that the rehearsal process and backstage routine are depicted admirably well, and the whole grudge of a song learning, sound check, and pre-gig booze is here at an excellent realistic swap. Still, the short timing of the movie leaves much off the camera, and the whole thing seems a bit too rushed and sometimes ruined. The main actors do their part well, Kristin Stewart as Joan Jett is surprisingly decent, dark, menacing, self-destructive and deep. Dakota Fanning as Cherry Curie is another winner, with her blonde angelic looks and wild persona. The rest is a bit dubious. Kim Fowley? Was he that weird and queer? Lita Ford? She is present, but her fiery guitar and her fiery persona are shown so briefly and little, that one can only feel shame. The bassist? Her name? Poor dear, she never even uttered a word. Sandy, the drummer? She is cool at the offset, but then she is somehow lost in a mire. The rushes ending and vague scenes with bathtub and sea leave us a bit perplexed, and the whole wrap-up is a bit too confusing. Anyway, this is not a bad effort, and yeah, can be watched at least once, even for their sake of beautiful ladies and their long legs. Kidding. The movie is good.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Run Away with the Runaways,"The Runaways were the first all girl rock group, put together by a sleazy manager who saw a gap in the market. In their line-up was a very young Joan Jett... she would go on to much greater things with a group called The Blackhearts who would score a huge hit with a cover of I Love Rock And Roll, which would sell over ten million copies in the USA alone. The reason you probably haven't heard of the Runaways is perhaps because a) They had a massive falling out when the co-lead singer, Cherie Currie(!) decided to quit early into their creation, and b) Judging by the material in this movie at least, their music wasn't actually that good. Oh well, c'est la vie...The 70's was all booze, sex and drugs according to those who witnessed it, and the film demonstrates that in graphic detail with a catalogue of debauchery and mayhem. Quite how these young bodies can stand so much abuse is beyond me, but hey... If all the Rolling Stones are still alive, I guess that's possible. There's also an awful lot of profanities exchanged between these amateur musicians... if you took any of these girls home to meet your mother, she'd most likely have a heart attack, You can't help but feel though for all they THINK they're doing for feminism, they're still being exploited in a different way... And most of their fanbase seem to consist of either dirty older men, and young girls who should know better.Dakota Fanning completely ditches her good-girl image as the depraved and vulnerable Cherie, who sleeps with girls and boys during the course of events and snorts more blow than a cheap hooker. Kristen Stewart also surprises as the openly gay Joan Jett... free of the shackles of her usual downbeat roles, she portrays the boisterous and spirited young future star with relish. The reason why, despite all the talent on show, this doesn't score higher is not much happens in the 90 minute run time... Just a few performances of their one hit song and an impromptu trip to Japan, before Cherie leaves and the movie is as good as over. Oh, there's some stuff involving Cherie's fractious family life and the crush Joan has on her, but none of this is particularly exhilarating.They may have been trailblazers in a way, but in my opinion the footprint they left on the industry was smaller than a mouse's. There are no real classics in their repertoire, and the only people who fondly remember them these days are either blinded by nostalgia or devotees of Joan Jett who adore everything she does. It's rather odd that a studio would bankroll a film about an average band that struggle for a few years before ending acrimoniously, such groups are ten a penny. But I suppose the fact they're female gives it novelty value, but not enough to convince me they were anything great... even if they had stayed together. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning's best performance,"The Runaways was honestly one of the first rock and roll movie's I have seen where I didn't know much about the band it was talking about. I only really heard of Joan Jett because of her song 'I Love Rock 'N Roll'. I didn't even know she was in a band, thats how rock and roll challenged I was. But from the love of Kristen Stewart I really wanted to find out about the band. I've loved Joan Jett for a very long time but I didn't know much about her, just her music. Now I got an inside look at who she was and how badass she was. All the other Kristen Stewart fans out there, especially on Twitter, showed me what an amazing movie this was going to do.The Runaways were and still are such an inspiration. They defied what the ""norm"" was back when they started their band and they broke molds. This movie did the same thing. No one is producing movies like this. Especially important to say is this is Women's History Month and this movie really brought to light how amazing women can be with they fight for their rights and what the love. The Runaways believed in rock and roll, they wanted to be something new and bold and a figure in music no one has ever seen before. They did that. Unfortunatelytheir stardom was short lived, but they left a lasting impression on the world.Luckily my generate born in the 80s will get to hear about how amazing and influential they really were from this movie. Even though it is not a bio-pic, it still gives you a closer look to exactly what it took to get that band started back then. Woman were NOT equal to men in those days and we as women should be honored to share this earth with women who fought for our civil liberties.So yes this movie changed my life, it has made me a rocker and I LOVE IT...all the actresses and actors did amazing. I will never forget seeing this movie at the Advanced Screening in NYC on 19th street. It was the highlight of my spring break and this WAS Kristen Stewarts best performance. I support her and most importantly I support Joan Jett and The Runaways.AMAZING MOVIE. WILL SEE IT AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Running,"Recruited for what would become a pioneer all-female hard rock band in the 1970s, two teenagers have to contend with whether to promote their music or sex appeal as per the wishes of their eccentric music producer in this film based on the true experiences of the title band that propelled Joan Jett to fame. The film is based on the memoirs of the band's lead singer, Cherie Currie, and the film is mostly spent on the dynamics and rising tensions between Joan and Cherrie, with Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart both convincing in the respective roles. Fanning has some particularly good moments towards the end as all the fame gets to her head and a final conversation between the pair provides a perfect note for the film to end on. In order to focus on these two big personalities, the film uncomfortably ignores the other three members of the band though, all of whom are so lightly developed that they remain completely interchangeable throughout. The fact that Cherie's family background gets such a large focus over Joan's when they are equal protagonists does not quite sit well either. Never to mind, the film is well paced enough that there is rarely a dull moment with Michael Shannon stealing every scene he is in as the band's off-the-wall producer with the craziest twinkle in his eye as he gets them to practise playing while food is thrown at them (!) and as he keeps going on about all negative publicity being good. There is also a lot to like about the girls' determination to succeed in a traditionally all-male industry no matter what it takes.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
You hear that? That's the sound of hormones raging.,"The Runaways is a biographical film about the 1970s all-girl rock band of the same name. The film was written and directed by Floria Sigismondi, who based the screenplay on the book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway by the band's original lead vocalist Cherie Currie. It stars Dakota Fanning as Currie, Kristen Stewart as guitarist and vocalist Joan Jett, and Michael Shannon plays record producer and band manager Kim Fowley. The film charts the formation of the band in 1975, their rise in a male dominated music world, and their subsequent implosion.For a few short years The Runaways kicked butt, breaking down the barriers in front of them, put up in a male dominated rock world, they paved the way for girl power to actually mean just that; some decades before the term became popular. However, as good as it is to see some recognition of the band on celluloid, Floria Sigismondi's movie is hardly an effective or enlightening piece. Choosing to focus mainly on the relationship between Jett & Currie, Sigismondi's intentions are perhaps understandable given the film is based on Currie's own book. But not only are the rest of the band passed over (so not really a Runaways film then), but Jett has next to no back story for us to work off. Which given that the time afforded Currie's burn out has been diluted (the powerful stuff in the book is absent), means the story isn't all that interesting. It may snapshot the era well, but this is no history of the band at all.The film also suffers greatly for its by the numbers formula. Band gets together, find their musical mojo, become big, take drugs, have sex, fall out and split up. OK this is a gender reversal piece, that lends it a certain historical value, but aside from some fun anarchic moments along the way, this is about as rebel yell as throwing litter on the floor. The constant sense of there being so much more hangs heavy and further brings to light how shallow and bereft of characterisations the script is. On the plus side, Sigismondi gets great performances out of Stewart and Shannon, the latter is suitably manic and weasel like. But even this is offset a touch by Fanning, who works hard to make the script work, but she never once convinces in the way that Stewart does. The soundtrack is top notch, with music from Iggy & The Stooges, David Bowie, Suzi Quatro, Sex Pistols and of course The Runaways themselves (including work from Fanning & Stewart). While the costuming and Benoît Debie's cinematography bring visual treats as the mid to late 70s comes alive.But for a film that opens with a splat of menstrual blood on the floor, and one that is about an important and in your face all girl rock band, The Runaways is sadly a disappointment and unable to shake any trees. It's like going to see your favourite band to then find out it's actually the tribute band on instead. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Love!,"I really love this movie. First off, I'm a Krisbian, and have always been a fan of Dakota Fanning. This movie took me back to the 70's and I loved it. Of course the movie changed up some of the things that actually happened, but that's usually the case with movies anyways. I thought Kristen Stewart as Joan Jett was an excellent choice and she was super hot playing her role! Kstew and Dakota had really good chemistry. Kim Fowley's character in this movie was very interesting and I think Michael Shannon did a really good job. I just love this movie, it's girl power! And aside from the film, I advise reading ""Neon Angel: Memoir of a Runaway"" written by Cherie Currie because it helps in understanding what really went on.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Powerful Performances, Uncaptivating Story,","The Runaways is a good movie with a reasonably well developed plot and a stellar cast. The performances are hands down what makes this movie, Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning have an electric chemistry that is both powerful and believable from beginning to end. The highlight for me was certainly Michael Shannon, who had a very enforcing, engaging delivery as Kim Fowley, stealing every scene he is in and integrating the films overall theme perffectly.I was, however, disappointed that the movie was not properly biographical, I would like to have seen the bands actual career develop, but it takes a lot of leaps instead and passes over pieces of information that should be vital to the plot of their story.It also makes a lot of stylistic cinematography choices that, although intriguing and well shot, felt like the crew was trying too hard to make this film different. The story itself is really not that interesting and the way that they tried to compensate for that seemed a little desperate to me.Fun while it lasts, but forgettable. In no way perfect, The Runaways is still an enjoyable journey that fans of this group or these actors should certainly check out.Explores the relationship between Joan Jett and Cherie Currie as they form their band The Runaways.Best Performance; Michael Shannon",7.0,Anonymous,Music
My first major letdown of 2010,"Aside from The Expendables this was the only other movie i was looking forward to in 2010. This was also the first major disappointment of 2010 movie wise. The starting scenes to this movie have Roxxi Roller wailing as the background music, so I'm thinking wow this is going to be so cool....well it started to falter from there. I love Dakota Fanning as she seems to be the next break through star however her lacklustre performance in this was only a chip of my problems with this film. First of all there were 5 girls in The runaways not two although after seeing the credits i can see why Joan Jett herself executive produced this project. The ending credits has what Joan and Cherie did for the rest of their careers once again.....what happened to the other 3 girls? As being an old fan of Lita Ford i think she did quite lucratively for a spell??? One unfortunate is that Scout Taylor Compton who portrays Lita in this didn't have a bigger role in the film as she is another astounding break through actress. Alas Lita Ford didn't want anything (for reasons unknown) to do with this film. This is my first feature from director Floria Sigismindi and will be my last if she directs any more movies like this. There is a rainbow in this however and that alone is Michael Shannon's portrayal of slimy Runaways manager Kim Fowley I have seen things in the 80s on the real Fowley and Shannon pretty much nailed it! Stewart was impressive at times as Joan Jett who apparently was side by side through the making of this with her. Stewart seems to nail all of Jetts queaks and quirks and does an honourable job here. The rest of the movie pretty much left a bad taste in my mouth. Give the script to Scorcese and lets get a good bio about the band.",,Anonymous,Music
The Runaways,"What I liked about The Runaways: The music The ladiesWhat I didn't like about The Runaways: There wasn't enough story there Not a good timeline of events Didn't flesh out the characters- not even Jett or Currie who were the main focus Never really had a momentI recently saw The Runaways, and here's what I thought:It's not bad but not great either. I kept waiting for a moment that never came, which is not to say there aren't neat things about this bio pic. It certainly garners interest in the music and the ladies themselves, but it didn't satisfy me. It just sort of whet my appetitite, which may have been the point. The Runaways were short lived and saw much of their success overseas, but it also consisted of five kick ass, talented woman. The movie chooses to focus on two- Jett and Currie (and moreso on the latter).Acting-wise, there are some pretty interesting performances. I say interesting because I think Kirsten Stewart functions better as a supporting player than an actual lead. When I think of all the things I've liked her in (Into the Wild, In the Land of Women), she hasn't been the lead. Dakota Fanning finally successfully sheds her little girl image with the role of Currie (unlike her finger licking role in The Secret Life of Bees). I think she made an excellent lead and was at times on the cusp of greatness but never quite delivered, which is why I don't foresee a nom. This could've been due to unfamiliarity with that particular lifestyle or the somewhat ""underdevelopedness"" (if that's a word) of the entire pic. Still, it's engaging, and I never felt bored albeit unsatisfied with the ending. The band's breakup for me seemed to have come out of nowhere.The director is as provocative as the women she brings to life on film. The shot she chooses to open the film with sets the tone perfectly. The era seems authentic, and the mixture of bright, dingy colors create a stunning visual backdrop amidst the sex, drugs, and rock. The band's performances are stellarly captured with some strong vocals delivered by both Stewart and Fanning.Overall, I think this film will surprise people but may prove to lite for fans more familiar with the band, its history, and music. However, I think that if you aren't familiar with The Runaways, by the film's end, you'll be a fan. 6 out of 10 stars.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyable 70's flashback,"There's probably a lot of things they could of done differently but I think the thing that the movie effectively captures is the energy of what must have been a wild, intense ride from the point of view of teenage girls. They went from nowhere to completely uncharted territory without many rules. Crazy. And it was on that level that I enjoyed the movie. If you're looking for a deep insight or some bigger message I don't think you're going to find it.One criticism I had that other people have written about was the lack of development of the other band members but there may have been reasons for this. For longtime Runaway fans, Sandy West was as big a part of the band as anyone. Lita Ford, while not achieving quite the success of Joan Jett, was pretty successful and well respected in the metal genre. In a sense The Runaways were the female version of the Yardbirds. Okay, that's may be a little bit of a stretch but it's kinda true.I give them props just for getting this movie made and not watering it down to get a more Twilight fan, age friendly rating.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Chicks who rock,"I have been a fan of The Runaways for a couple of years and was pretty intrigued by the idea of a biopic about them. I was excited to see the portrayal of young teenage girls getting thrown into the highly adult world of hard drugs, alcohol and sex.I can honestly say that this movie didn't disappoint me. Stewart who plays female rocker Joan Jett was a treat. She gave a good performance as the rebellious and cool singer but I was never worried about her acting, I'd seen her in the movie Speak and knew she'd give it her all. She didn't let me down as I watched her raw and emotional performance. Dakota Fanning also was an excellent cast as Cherie Currie. She plays the innocent girl spiraling downward into the explosive world of rock n roll superbly. Stella Maeve is also another awesome cast choice. She is great to watch as Sandy West and I found myself smiling every time she was on screen. The last actor who made a profound impact on the film was Michael Shannon who plays eccentric band manager Kim Fowely. He is dynamite on the screen and I loved his sexist and harsh ways. Shannon dug deep and became a monstrous asshole.The only thing I had difficulty liking was the haphazard progression of the film. I read Currie's ""Neon Angel"" and was expecting something a little more cohesive from the film. I don't know if Sigismondi was using it as a technique to further enhance the chaos of the band but it just annoyed me a little. As I said I like the movie. I enjoyed the grungy and hard examination of the 70's rock and roll world. The acting us great and so is the material. I love the music, always will, and found it faultless in the film. Fanning and Stewarts vocals are on key as is the awesome ability if the girls to play their instruments.I recommend you watch it if you love music and enjoy a good trashy/grungy film about girls behaving badly.

"Surreal, fast-paced band biopic","I saw The Runaways at the Sydney Film Festival and loved it. It captures the look and feel of a bygone music era that is fascinating even if you didn't live through it and even if you're not much of a rock music fan.Possibly because most of the real-life characters are still alive, the story isn't as gritty nor the characters as flawed as they probably were. There's a sense of glossing over certain areas, and never travelling very deep below the surface. We get barely any backstory on the characters, and their motivations are not always clear. But in some ways this shallowness is an advantage, along with the visual sequences used to convey drug-taking and breakdowns. They give the film a mystery and a music-video quality. At times I was even reminded of Twin Peaks.Michael Sheen's performance as Kim Fowley is outstanding. It's been claimed in many reviews that he's portrayed as the ""bad guy"", and certainly many people in the audience appeared to react to him like a pantomime villain. (It was surprising how shockable the Sydney audience seemed in parts). To me Fowley came across as a good guy: a brilliant producer who knew his craft, knew how to train a music act, knew his audience, knew his media and promotions. Yes: he knows that jailbait is a big part of the appeal of a young, all-girl rockband. But his interest is portrayed as purely commercial, not personal. He's surprisingly stand-off and arms-length with the band, he doesn't even travel with them on tour.Dakota Fanning is brilliant as Cherie Curry: I recently watched a video of the actual Cherry Bomb performance in Japan and the costumes and routine are almost identical. Fanning has that rare acting quality of absolute stillness - even vacancy - at times, which is gripping. Riley Keough as her twin sister Marie is very well cast: the two girls look eerily alike in many scenes. Kristen Stewart is also impressive as Joan Jett, though her character doesn't get quite the same focus, given the film is based on Curry's autobiography. Other than the drummer Sandy West, played by Stella Maeve, the other bandmates are rarely heard from. Which is a shame, because Scout Taylor-Compton as Lita West puts in one great scene near the end.You may leave with the impression that there's a place for ""The Joan Jett Story"" and that it would be a more interesting, and probably more honest, film.

An excellent biopic with good music and interesting characters,"Today was the second time I've seen this film within a week. Prior to seeing it I knew nothing about the 70's girl band called The Runaways (indeed I was initially expecting a fiction about girls who run away). I thought it very interesting to watch how the girls of the band came together. Their transformation from naive but determined adolescent girls into hardened rock stars is depicted in a very watchable mix of the shocking, the touching and the everyday. The acting of all the main actors and actresses is of a high enough standard to make the characters totally credible. Considering their ages I am certainly impressed by the acting of the two main female roles. They also look very attractive - especially in the many close-up shots. The direction is for the most part unobtrusive apart from on two or three occasions (I won't say when) at which times I thought it was very effectively used. I'd say this is definitely a better than average movie which will justify more than one (if not several) viewings.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The Jailbait Chronicles...great attention to the visual detail, but the narrative drifts and then splinters","Five teenage girls living in and around Hollywood in 1975 form a hard rock band which is fueled by sexual exploitation and driven to exhaustion by an adult manager with a talent for salacious promotion. Director-screenwriter Floria Sigismondi, working from Runaways vocalist Cherie Currie's autobiography ""Neon Angel"", does a fabulous job at recreating the look (and feel) of mid-'70s Los Angeles; from the stifling suburbs of the Valley to the street punks and dopers of the inner-city, Sigismondi's film has a visual pull and a gritty elegance that is, at once, immediate and nostalgic. Unfortunately, the time-line of events is a mess, with the band seemingly reaching international success (and finally imploding) in less than a year. The filmmakers are too concerned with getting to the cautionary aspects of this tale without giving us enough of the band's history. There was a lot of hard-hitting drama going on behind the formation and packaging of The Runaways (including distinct personality and musical differences between the real band members--Currie, Joan Jett, and Lita Ford among them), but this facile exploration of the group is mostly interested in headlines and druggy montages (which just eat up time on the clock). The costume design and art direction are spot on, and Sigismondi gets a lot of energy going in the film's early stages. However, when the band falls apart, the movie quickly follows suit. The narrative, choppy to begin with, skitters along to a wobbly conclusion; it is unsuccessful in building an emotional impact due to a basic failure in shaping and sharpening these characters. ** from ****",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Cool band deserved a better film.,"Back in the 70's, The Runaways was one of the first all-girl rock bands, initiated by then 16-year-old Joan Jett, who later went on to gain world fame with her band The Blackhearts. Now, I might be somewhat biased on this particular subject, because I am a huge fan of 70's (punk)rock, and especially female rock artists, but I am also a very critical film reviewer. The Runaways therefore, leaves me feeling in limbo.I love musical biopics as much as I love the music itself, and since The Runaways falls exactly into my favourite genre of music, I thought this film would be nothing other than a win-win flick for me. However, I felt rather quickly discouraged from the build-up on. When you are telling a true-to-life story, I consider it an important issue to let the audience know who we're dealing with, what's going on and perhaps most importantly, why. These are real people and I want to know why they are who they are, and what motivated them to walk their chosen path in life. The film starts off with alternating scenes of Joan Jett and her soon to be band mate Cherie Currie. Doing stuff that, well... isn't that interesting. It doesn't tell us much about these girls except that they like punk rock and David Bowie. Honestly, having only seen the film last night, it's all I can remember about the first 15 minutes or so. And so the film continues.They form a band, are taken under the wing of weirdo record producer/manager Kim Fowley, become famous and at some point, break up. The way director Floria Sigismondi tells the story, you'd think it was actually that easy. And this is exactly where the problem lies: bad direction. Possibly even worse editing and screenplay. We are given almost zero back-story of the lives of these young girls, and strangely, literally nothing at all about the personal life of Joan Jett. What makes it even stranger is the fact that the real Joan Jett was actually executive producer of this film, which completely puzzles me considering her part was so badly written. Her character comes across as not much more than a bystander in her own story.At least we're offered snippets of information about Cherie Currie. We know that she comes from an instable family and that her sister (who is in fact her twin – something I had to learn from Wikipedia since it's never told in the film...) is the only one she is at least somewhat close to. Again though, strangely, what is never told here is that this girl was raped when she was 14 – an incident which strongly determined the person she would become later on. Very weird to leave out of a biopic.It is my understanding that the rest of the band didn't give permission for their life story to be used in the film, and it shows. On the one hand, it's a shame because the back-story of the band is already so badly underexposed. On the other, I can't blame them, because this film would have done them no justice whatsoever.The story of The Runaways is told as though it all happened overnight: formation, fame, break-up; in what feels like no more than a short year maybe. When in fact they released four albums, three of which with Cherie. Truly awful screenplay.The actors though, are not at all to blame. Kristen Stewart embodies Joan Jett perfectly, she's got the looks, the voice (she sings all her parts herself) and the swagger. Dakota Fanning as Cherie does a very good job also. Although she may not look or sound that much like the real Cherie Currie, her acting more than makes up for it. But then again, anyone who's seen Dakota before, whether as a child actor or teenager, already knows she's a very convincing young actress. The rest of the band, much like their characters, are barely there to be noticed...The part of Kim Fowley is played by Michael Shannon, and he approaches it with a ""love it or hate it"" attitude. Personally, I think he was an absolute scene-stealer (which is not necessarily a good thing, because obviously this film is not about him – though it is the direction that is to blame, not the actor), acting completely over the top, crude, and horribly inappropriate. Though I can see why some people absolutely hated his character. Simple: there is nothing likable about him. He's an a**hole, and a big one too. As an acting part however, it was obvious that Michael Shannon had a ball playing this guy, and I think that's what makes his role very enjoyable to watch.The actors really do make up for a lot in The Runaways. All parts are equally well-played and very enjoyable. But when the technical aspects of a film are this poor, not even the best actors in the world can make it a success. Zero story, zero character development, shoddy editing and, worst of all, not enough music! Probably the stupidest thing about the whole film – you'd think that, in a film about The Runaways, there'd be more than two or three original Runaways songs! Yet we have to listen to ""Cherry Bomb"" over and over again, and we get only titbits of their other songs. Sheesh.The Runaways may not have been the most groundbreaking band in history, but they certainly were a cool band of young rock chicks, and they deserved a better film than this one. I would say it's fun to watch once if you're into this kind of music, but that's it. Such a shame.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Enjoyable, But Not as Great As Expected","This film is something of a biopic, following the band the Runaways from its inception to its disbanding. In particular, the focus is on Cherrie Currie and Joan Jett, leaving the other members -- notably Lita Ford -- as mere background footage.I liked ""Runaways"", but it's really not all that great. If you don't already have a solid understanding of who Joan Jett, Cherrie Currie and Lita Ford are, it didn't really explain things. It was also lopsided in that it focused on Joan despite being based on the book about Cherrie, and Kristen Stewart made very little attempt to go outside her ""safe"" range of acting. In other words, it was like watching Stewart, not Jett.Dakota Fanning is capable of amazingly innocent or not-so-innocent roles, but despite this film being based on Currie's biography, her character comes off as the minor one to Joan Jett. Granted, as Jett today is the bigger star, this makes sense... but then the focus was disjointed. Fanning was able to be a dirty glam-loving rebel, so it is too bad her part was played down.Beyond that, as I said, the focus was disjointed and you had to know the story going into it. Nothing was expressed too explicitly, so when the band rises and falls, and meets up with various problems, it seems that none of them are fully explored. One solution would be to add twenty or thirty minutes on to the movie, but this would do little to save it if that filler was just more of Kristen Stewart.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Hello Daddy Hello Mom im your ch ch ch Cherry Bomb!,"This is an amazing movie, my two favourite actresses Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning.Great soundtrack aswell, huge fan of The band The Runaways. Great performances of both Kristen and Dakota.Highly recommend this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
better than expected - Kristen Stewart was good,"Sure the Runaways were the first all female rock group and made it a huge for such a short time but their music never impressed me. Patti Smith is still way more punk rock than all the members combined (even at 60 plus years old). This movie wasn't so much about the music or their attitude but about growing up and maturity.Kristen Stewart probably secretly can't wait to be done with her type-casted twilight days and show her real talent than the vampire soap opera. She was great in Into the Wild and Adventureland but I believe her performance in The Runaways has been her best to date. She portrayed Joan Jett's attitude very well (even cut her hair to look like her) and sounded very much like Jett's voice.Dakota Fanning on the other hand . . . not so much. She bored me. She seemed to try to hard. Fanning at age ten acted like a thirty year old so I feel her ego got in the way of this movie. That and she was so miscasted to begin with. It's a shame they couldn't get Evan Rachel Wood. Her part required lots of range and all we got was her half blank look and a voice that never even sounded like Cherie Currie.The movie is short. Without credits at about 96 minutes. I liked the way it ended. It left me wanting more but not in a bad way. My biggest complaint was the lack story with the other three members. The big message I got out of the movie was Jett wanted everyone to be equal in the band. The lead singer shouldn't be the only member everyone remembers but all we got out of Sandy West was she's was very sweet? Lita Ford seemed like a bully while Robin never really said a word except for maybe a ""yeah"" a couple of times (which is a shame because I like Alia Shawkat). The whole movie was 95 percent Currie and Jett. In fact, at the end we find out what happen to only them and the producer.Michael Shannon was a pretty good playing the crazed and perhaps controlling producer Kim Fowley. Though his performance was over the top at most parts, it was probably written that way. Shannon is a very skilled actor (watch Revolutionary Road).In short, The Runaways won't stick in your mind by the end of the week but it does get a thumbs up from me and turned out to be a much better movie than I expected. I didn't expect really anything.*** / *****",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Juvenile,"This movie is hokey and feels juvenile. So many cliché characters and techniques used, from Dakota's 'daddy doesn't love me' teeny-bopper character and the sexified older sister with a d-bag boyfriend, to Joan buying her leather jacket in change, huffing paint and being told girls can't play electric guitar. Regardless of the validity or truthfulness to these occurrences, they look bad on film. The character development was painful and uninspired. I'm insulted for the people this is depicting. Poor acting from all parties. I don't mind Kristen Stewart as an actress, but she looks bored in most of her scenes. Dakota Fanning still doesn't grasp her roles. Big gay Bill Hader as their manager / producer is stupid. The scenes throughout the first half of the movie are choppy, and it makes it feel as if this band was just thrown together. Which, in all honesty, it probably was. I did a quick youtube search for ""the runaways, cherry bomb"" and it sucked too.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
GRRRRL GROUP,"Good artful docu-drama type thing bout The Runaways, one of the most influential ""girl groups"" of all time, long before Belinda Carlisle and Spice Girls brought their girly grrl power. Attractive cast with Kristen Stewart, not quite a Joan Jett look-alike, but equal in beauty factor and spunk, and Dakota Fanning, as mentioned in the film, a Marilyn Monroe for her time, although she survived, just barely. Michael Shannon is also xlnt as their appropriately provocative and tyrannical manager. Real slice of teen life in the '70's and some notable sequences: camera follows drunk Fanning teetering on snakeskin platforms through a maze of grocery aisles as she barely maneuvers a shopping cart containing: 2 onions and a bottle of vodka, leaning on the handle for dear life as if it was a walker for someone 5X her age; and the sensitively shot girl on girl action is positively operatic.

Better if your're a fan..,"When a young Joan Larkin renames herself Joan Jett and manages to introduce herself to music manager Kim Fowley the ball is well and truly rolling. 15 yr old Cherie Currie auditions for the band and The Runaway are born. For this young girl group, success comes eventually with a recording contract and a tour of Japan where they realise the magnitude of fame, something that perhaps takes it's toll on the young band members. As the story progresses, so do the girls, as they discover love, sex, drugs and booze, while back in the real world family matters get ignored and priorities get mixed up.All based on real events with The Runaways being the beginning for some of the members having long careers, well Joan Jett at least, this film is for non fans a sort of coming of age movie set against the music industry that is quite standard in it's story. It is then lucky that we have a stylish looking film which also has two fine performances at it's core. Kristen Stewart is far from her Twilight days as Joan Jett in this and actually shows she can perform well, but the real surprise here is Dakota Fanning as lead singer of The Runaways Cherie Currie; her performance is really superb and shows how much she's grown.The film isn't a stand out for me otherwise, it roles along well, but it really does feel too standard in it's format.

San Fernando Valley of the Dolls,"Edie Sedgwick does Tarantino in this grimy tale of androgynous, pixie, she-beasts.

I do not subscribe to todays trendy loathing of Kristen Stuart, but must admit her Joan Jett is not very dynamic. She looks right in the hair and makeup, but her impersonation seems forced. Fanning steels the show, helped along by an enthusiastic Kim Fowley as portrayed by Michael Shannon. The film also has a great sense of era and atmosphere.But if you're trying to find a good movie in this, you're missing the point. It's an enjoyably bad movie, about enjoyably bad music: a gloriously heinous tribute to lowbrow glam, and an unabashedly vulgar study of D-list celebrity...a sort of half-a$$ed, suburban parody of Valley of the Dolls.

"Satisfying, engaging, well made","Biopics, as a film genre, tend to suffer from artifice, forced through a grinder to condense a (fraction of a) life into 90-120 minutes. This goes double for music biopics, particularly those focusing on multiple people behind a band, as endless tropes are roped in to tell a story. Humble beginnings, disaffected youth, stars in their eyes, fast living, rocky roads, large and conflicting personalities - they're all here, with an extra dosing of sexism on top, garnishing a classic tale of sex, drugs, and rock and roll. All these elements are a bit of a weight to bear, especially as the movie first begins. However, I'm genuinely pleased to say that 'The Runaways' is a lot stronger than the lows that these recognizable, common strains portend, and everyone involved here carries great strength and intelligence to bring the film to life. Whatever reservations I may have had as the picture first began melted away fairly quickly - I think this is fantastic.Director Floria Sigismondi demonstrates a brilliant, keen eye for orchestrating shots and scenes and guiding her cast, and her screenplay, adapted from Cherie Currie's own memoir, is outstanding. Alongside Benoît Debie's vibrant cinematography and Richard Chew's sharp editing, Sigismondi and her crew and collaborators construct a feature that's unexpectedly engrossing, and at its best just as electrifying as the rancorous music that fills the soundtrack. Everything about the production design and art direction seems expertly built to feel as dank, dingy, sweaty, hot, and charged as the figures and the story on hand, and it roundly succeeds. Costume design, hair and makeup, lighting, filming locations, set design - every last detail is pulsing with nasty, dirty, harsh and biting life. Ultimately, as much as the first act felt contrived, overfull and pushed along, it was only to get to the meat of the project. Where it matters most, 'The Runaways' advances with a natural ease and fluidity that lets every little turn hit with the necessary and intended impact. No one is more surprised than I am at how good this actually turned out, but color me impressed!Just as much as those behind the scenes, the cast is to be commended for solid performances that imbue their characters with tangible piss and vinegar. Even those in supporting roles are noteworthy, with Riley Keough, Alia Shawkat, Stella Maeve, and Scout Taylor-Compton rounding out the assemblage with appreciable heart and soul. More visible still, reliable Michael Shannon is churlish and prickly as infamous, dubious, renowned producer Kim Fowley, chewing scenery to make the man as unlikable and outlandish as possible. Above all, of course, Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning are wonderfully striking as rock legends Joan Jett and Runaways frontwoman Currie. Theirs are displays of range, nuance, and presence, giving the raucous, wild young women terrific spirit and stressed vigor. Just as Jett and Currie's tangled partnership was the core of their band, both individually and as scene partners Stewart and Fanning dominate the screen. As young as both actresses were at the time this was made, I think 'The Runaways' is a fine illustration of the skills they both possess and have further exhibited in abundance since and elsewhere.Viewers who don't enjoy the stylings of biographical movies are unlikely to find anything here to change their mind. Most true near the start, there are indelicacies and motifs that have populated many a similar title, and it's fair to question if the length will be worth our while. That value manifests pretty fast, however, and the film is actually rather direct, rejecting the more fantastical embellishments that sometimes accompany the cinematic interpretation of musical journeys. Everyone working on the production contributes fine, practiced capabilities to let the saga of Jett, Currie, and their bandmates and cohorts speak for itself, and feel as real and honest as any like feature could be. When all is said and done I find myself pleasantly surprised by just how entertaining and satisfying 'The Runaways' turned out to be. Outside of those hallmarks of the genre that are tried and true, but also perhaps a little tired, no one specific fault comes to mind here, and at length it's an absorbing, fulfilling movie experience. And that's enough for me.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
This Movie Rocks,"""The Runaways,"" a biopic of the titular teenage girl rock band, may not be a particularly revelatory or substantial film, but, c'mon, neither is the music; it is, however, constructed in such a way that I think better mimics the flow and style of popular music than in other such tuneful biographies. It's a rousing good picture and sound to view and listen to throughout. Doubtless, it helps if you like the music, but the cinematography and montage is as saliently hectic and roaring--even sensitive subject matter such as sexualizing minors, taking financial advantage of them, or drug abuse aren't dawdled upon for melodramatic points. You know, sex, drugs and rock and roll. I'll take this over, say, the more recent ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (2018) or ""Rocketman"" (2019), with their pretensions to something more.Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart do well in the leads, too, and Michael Shannon is again entertaining in a role that calls for some showy acting. I've never yet seen any of the ""Twilight"" movies in their entirety, and I'll probably be OK if I never do, but I've been impressed with the work of some of the series' actors in other movies. I recently saw future-Batman Robert Pattinson in ""The Lighthouse"" (2019), and besides playing cool here, Stewart has earned acclaim elsewhere, including for ""Clouds of Sils Maria"" (2014). I haven't seen as much of Fanning, but I liked ""Coraline"" (2009) and ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019). I suppose my point is that it's nice to see youths, like Joan Jett and other members of the Runaways, succeed in showbiz beyond the initial kiddie craze that launched them to stardom.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Stinky-stinky-stinky-stinky STINKY BOMB!,"The Runaways were a wicked rock'n'roll experience. An excitement generated live, but never transferred onto their recording. Hence their popularity was short lived. Joan Jett was able to capture a trace of what they were aiming for on her bubblegum hits of the 80s. But the high point of the Runaways experience wasn't musical. It occurred in Cherie Currie's autobiography published long after the break-up. Her vivid and insightful writing ranks among the best celebrity bios ever. As entertaining in its own way as Errol Flynn's ""My Wicked Wicked Ways"".Twenty years after publication, Jett and Currie let the movie industry have a go at their story, knocking the Runaways back to square one - their story a mess, the Runaways experience again transferred poorly for the masses. The chief element missing is rock'n'roll spirit. There's nothing cool like that here. A lot of pretentious posing by Hollywood types aping MTV videos from the 90s, smarmy camera-work and all. There's nothing of a punk or 70s rock aesthetic in the art direction. It had an alleged $10 mil budget, which pulls it way out of the ""Independent Cinema"" category. It looks and feels like 100% prefab Hollywood mainstream media junk. No unique vision compels the camera.The only point to the story is the climactic neon lesbian scene between Stewart and Fanning. It's the one spot in the narrative that starts to sprout wings. But, like every other intriguing element of Currie's book, writer/director Sigismondi flushes it down the toilet to nowheresville. No emotional relationship is formed between the characters. Cherie's book is about real characters, their complex relationships interrelationships and their reactions under pressure. Sigismondi's cliff notes version shows that she hasn't a clue about what needs to be done to put this on the screen. Human relationships no longer translate in the plastic one-dimensional 21st century Hollywood mind. Organic narrative strands do not compute.Her camera shows us a handful of generic washed-out characters, none of whom care about any of the other generic washed-out characters and nobody appears to be minding the music. Where Currie's book presents situations with a sarcastic tongue-in-cheek, Sigismondi extends a disconnected grimness. Where Currie planted her anger and wit, Sigismondi reaps incoherent navel gazing. What were the Runaways ""rebelling""against? The boredom of suburbia? A male dominated music industry? That isn't clear. The slight adversity they meet is set up by Sigismondi like so many straw men.Kristen Stewart is OK – it looks like she watched a few episodes of Happy Days and channeled Jett through The Fonze. Better than Dakota Fanning who is hopelessly out of her league. She doesn't have any idea of what to do with the character. In her own movie, Cherie ends up being a big unsympathetic blah – and this is probably pretty close to what Lita Ford thought of her. I guess they don't teach techniques like Projection and Communication in Hollywood acting schools anymore.Michael Shannon plays Fowley as if he were the Mad Hatter in a Batman episode, except not as terrifying. Sigismondi obviously needed to create a Hollywood villain and pegged the stencil on Fowley. What she and Shannon fail to understand is that villains don't think they are villains. If an actor plays Richard The Third believing he is a Bad Guy what audience wants to sink their teeth into a moldy stereotype like that? It's not just historically incorrect, it's boring.Hopefully the movie industry will never get interested in pimping The Shaggs story – a far more talented band and one that had a much deeper impact on rock'n'roll than Joan Jett and the Runaways ever dreamed. If you want to see a good movie about The Runaways check out ""The Fabulous Stains"". It's more accurate and contains authentically scurrilous rock'n'roll aberrations.",1.0,Anonymous,Music

So it was with some trepidation that I eventually watched it, hoping it wasn't all that bad.Sadly, it is. Kristen Stewart is indeed talentless. What could have been an edgy and intriguing look at one of rock's more controversial bands turns into a fairly lacklustre join-the-dots docu-drama. Much of this is the fault of the director, Floria Sigismondi. However, Kristen Stewart's lack of ability to play anything beyond one-dimensional characters doesn't help, especially as she plays the main character, Joan Jett.Stewart is aided and abetted by Michael Shannon, who, as Kim Fowley, tries too hard to be dark, quirky and edgy and comes off as over- acting.Dakota Fanning makes up for this, to a degree, by putting in an excellent performance as Cherie Currie.There are some other pluses: the music is great, of course.

you would think a hot rock chic movie with great music would be awesome,"So I watched the movie ""the runaways"" based on the book by Cherie Currie and released in 2010. So is it good, I saw ehhh. It is really for me a 6.5 on the IMDb scale, a movie between 6.5 and 7 on this scale in my opinion could suck could be good, it depends on what you like, but doesn't have that magic something that makes most people say that was pretty darn good, like say another Dakota Fanning movie called ""Man on fire"", which is awesome. It is an indy film and one that got some critical praise, but for me it was just o.k. This really sucks, I wanted to love this film because well it is a rock chick movie, with a very hot make-out scene involving a young Dakota Fanning (who is growing up before our eyes) and that depressing vampire chick Kristen Stewart, truly awesome music including the stooges and the sex pistols, and well in general sex, drugs, and rock'n'roll. So you think with that pedigree it would rock. And at first this movie did, but then it just got sort of boring (even with the drug abuse) toward the middle of the movie and just stayed that way, flat. The acting is pretty good, and the casting of Michael Shannon as Kim Fowley was perfect. If you want to get a sense of the real Kim Fowley watch a good documentary called ""Mayor of the Sunset Strip"" about Rodney Bingenheimer, who played a role in the runaways career as well. Some might find this movie awesome, and I would not discourage someone from watching it and forming their own opinion, but when I hit pause to go do the dishes when there is a f'd up Dakota Fanning in lingerie in front of me you know there has to be something missing. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Kristen Stewart is Hot as Joan Jett,"Young Joan Jett is one of the hottest women in rock 'n roll and I think Kristen Stewart was a very fair choice to portray her. However, as pretty as Dakota Fanning was in this movie I felt it was ridiculous for her to play Cherie Currie. There was just a constant sense of *awkward* every time Fanning tried to be the sexually aggressive and wild lead singer of The Runaways. If you look at old photos from the Mid-1970s, Cherie was even cockier than Joan - though Joan always had that solid confidence - and it's ludicrous to have a sweet girl like Dakota Fanning play her, I'm sorry.Otherwise this is a cotton candy type of movie, really fun and light and inspiring. The bulk of the film focuses on the formation of The Runaways (as it should) but then it just kind of blandly fast-fowards through the band's break up and Cherie Currie's struggles with addiction, also never mentioning the rape of Jackie Fox by the obnoxious and sleazy Kim Fowley. The women in the band turned on him for much more serious reasons than are portrayed in this 2010 flick, and anyone saying this movie is ""in your face"" has apparently never left their mom's basement.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"""That's what you do-you sing and you strut around in your underwear""","Released in 2010, ""The Runaways"" chronicles the quick rise and fall of all-girl rock band The Runaways who released four albums from 1976-1978. I mean ""girl"" literally since they WERE girls at the time; for instance, when the band was formed in late 1975 singer Cherie Currie just turned 16 years-old. The movie is lightly based on Currie's book Neon Angel: A Memoir of a Runaway and therefore focuses on the friendship of Cherie (Dakota Fanning) and Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and their relationship with their eccentric manager Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon). Riley Keough plays Cherie's ""better looking"" sister while Scout Taylor-Compton and Stella Maeve play band members Lita Ford and Sandy West.The Runaways had some brief success in the late 70s, but they quickly nosedived because they were teenagers and simply couldn't handle the pressures and temptations of the 70's rock 'n' roll lifestyle, particularly Cherie. The movie successfully illustrates this. Of course ""Cherry Bomb"" was a fairly well known song but, beyond this, they just weren't that popular. They were a here-today-gone-tomorrow act; a minor blip in rock history. You could say they were a good ""farm band"" for the more popular Joan Jett and Lita Ford. Speaking of the latter, Scout Taylor-Compton looks uncannily like her, but the character is given short shrift in favor of Jett and Currie. While this is understandable given that the movie was based on Currie's book and the short 96-minute runtime, there's no excuse for ignoring Lita at the end when the movie cites what the characters went on to accomplish. Since Ford was the second most successful Runaway in the music business, second only to Jett, this is inexcusable.Despite this grave transgression, the movie works because of the great performances of the principle actors. Shannon is particularly effective as the freakish Fowley (who passed away in 2015 at the age of 75). Unfortunately, with a movie that's only an hour and a half long they can only tell so much of the story. Currie described the real story as epic and that the movie is just a ""lighter kind of flash"" of what The Runaways were for two and a half years. Being a 70's rock biopic of teenage girls you can expect the sex & drugs elements with profanity, crudeness and a dismal pall. Like 1991's ""The Doors,"" the movie doesn't show much of the fun side of rock 'n' roll.If you can look beyond the vulgarity and ugliness, however, the movie has (some) heart. For instance, the genuine friendship of Jett and Currie, which can be observed in the phone call at the end; and the loving relationship of Cherie and her sister Marie. The sisters went on to record a couple albums together - 1978's BEAUTY'S ONLY SKIN DEEP and 1980's MESSIN' WITH THE BOYS - but their music career failed to go further due to Cherie's problems with drug dependency.I liked this movie better the second time I watched it. It's too crude and dreary for my tastes and it lags here and there, but it makes up for it with effective performances and the warm relationships noted above. Plus it has a rockin' soundtrack. If you watch recent interviews, you'll observe that Lita and Cherie grew up to be palpably honorable, beautiful women. Joan's cool too, of course; she's just not my cup of java, although I like some of her songs.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

"""The Runaways"" is a good record about a lost time, but when the film ends, we know little about its members","Written by Sigismondi herself based on vocalist Cherie Currie's book entitled ""Neon Angel: The Cherie Currie Story"", ""The Runaways"" presents the band's trajectory since its formation, when manager Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) is contacted by the guitarist Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and ends up hiring Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) to take over the band's vocals. After rehearsals, the group goes on tour and ends up achieving meteoric success, which would be slowly undermined thanks to the group's and their manager's internal problems.Still in the first act of ""The Runaways"", young Joan's guitar teacher says that ""women don't play electric guitars"", exposing the prejudice that prevailed at the time and announcing how difficult the mission of those young women was in a world as sexist as the of rock. However, the difficulty also represents an opportunity, something that businessman Fowley quickly sees, as until then there were no rock bands formed exclusively by women. The sequence that follows the formation of the band, in fact, is very interesting, with Fowley looking for the lead singer in a club and, later, teaching Cherie to sing in the way he understood to be correct to gain the attention of the male audience.The title of the film refers to the band, but the plot focuses only on two figures in the group: guitarist Joan Jett (Stewart), a rebel by nature, and vocalist Cherie Currie (Fanning), a young woman who sees in music the opportunity to escape your family problems. The Runaways are effectively formed when the crazy producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) enters the scene and prepares the teenagers in a kind of ""military rock training"". Just over a year separated the rehearsals in the trailer for the first album and the group's first international tour in Japan. And even less time, the rampant use of barbiturates and cocaine, the ego disputes within the band or the conflicts involving Fowley, a major bloodsucker - who years later directed works by Kiss and Slade. Too young, with little family structure, exposed to immediate success and demands from record companies and fans, the Runaways succumbed in 1979.The film passes through your eyes without saying anything or leaving you feeling nostalgic. Assembling the facts in a precarious and illusory way, we are unable to even capture a third of the essence of the true band. Based on the book ""Neon Angel: The Cherie Currie Story"", written by Currie herself, the question remains whether the work is about the vocalist and her partner Joan Jett, or a portrait of the band. From rehearsals to success, from success to drugs, from drugs to conflicts and the inevitable end. Everything is compressed in an incredibly mediocre way, with the other members simply being excised from the process. Clearly all eyes are on wunderkind Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart, playing Cherie Currie and Joan Jett, respectively. The agility of the script only helps Cherie's transformation, first an angelic girl and then an addict, who in the last act has great moments of conflict. Joan, on the other hand, simply tried to lead the band, but without the strength for the task, as she was also inexperienced. Furthermore, the relationship between Joan and Cherie ends up very subtle, which on the one hand is positive for the film mainly because it makes it sexier, but on the other it leaves open questions about the love between the two.In biopics, what counts most, besides a good story, is the cast's interpretation, just as we had Joaquim Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon in ""Johnny and June"" and Jennifer Hudson in ""Dreamgirls"", to cite recent examples. As has always been the case since she was revealed in the film industry, the highlight is Dakota Fanning, half girl and half woman, half angel and half devil, who screams in ""Cherry Bomb"" and reveres herself in her own music, but the sweetness of his voice away from the microphones shows his lost childhood. Fanning easily transitions into the different positions her character requires and carries the film with intensity. Despite the girls' talent, the result, like the entire film, is devoid of its own soul. While Fanning seems uncomfortable stripping away, literally, the innocence of yesteryear - where she spoke to animals and was always intelligently fascinating -, Stewart does a little better with the ""tough"" Jett, but despite delivering a satisfactory performance, her mannerisms shy girl (who are already becoming a jerk) end up undermining the final result, showing that there is always a bit of ""Bella"" from the Twilight saga in her characters.For his part, Michael Shannon has fun composing the eccentric Kim Fowley in a very exaggerated way, which could sound caricatured, but ends up working thanks to the way he brings to life the great scenes in which he trains the girls to face the world in the cramped trailer. . Treating them aggressively, he fails to notice that Cherie never fully connects to that world, dividing herself between life on the road and concern for her family. He is also the one who tries to transform her into a mega star, causing frequent confrontations between the vocalist and guitarist Lita, played by Scout Taylor-Compton, who can do little with the role at hand, almost always appearing aggressive and showing jealousy. Cherie's sickening story - in fact, Lita did not give up the rights to adapt her story, which allowed Cherie and Joan, enemies of the guitarist and always present in the production, to create a version in which she was the great pivot of the group's separation.Using a restless camera most of the time that seeks to reflect the girls' state of mind, the director manages to give an agile rhythm to the narrative, thanks also to the good work of editor Richard Chew, who with quick cuts manages to give dynamism to the band's performances. , in addition to standing out in sequences that value narrative economy, such as the signing of the contract in which the reports that appear on the screen give the exact idea of the group's success in a quick and efficient way, even if it sounds cliché. However, the script makes the mistake of focusing exclusively on the band's development, leaving aside personal aspects that could give more depth to the characters. Thus, Cherie's family is the only one we know, which highlights the strategy of forcing our empathy with the vocalist (after all, the book that inspires the script is hers).Highlighting Cherie's rebellious side through the room full of posters of David Bowie, Eugenio Caballero's production design also succeeds in recreating the band's extravagant clothing with precision, as in the show in Japan in which the vocalist appears in a provocative outfit, in addition to, of course, Joan's stylish jackets and t-shirts. In addition to them, the colored hair, the painted faces, the drinks, cigarettes and drugs (which appear quickly, but enough to give credibility to the project, since we know that they existed in profusion in that environment) always show that those Girls were really wild, something practically unthinkable at the time. And finally, the cramped trailer in which they rehearse appears filled with golden tones on the ceiling, symbolizing the glorious future that the group had ahead of them. However, Benoît Debie's photography explores the dark side of the places they frequent, such as bars and night clubs, illustrating the band's underground aura. On the other hand, when Joan and Cherie kiss for the first time, the photograph highlights reddish tones to symbolize the ""sinful"" nature associated with the act (or, simply, the passion between them), exactly as happens in the electrifying performance in Japan, which also takes on the sinful aura normally associated with rock music. And since the show was mentioned, Lillian Berlin's soundtrack is quite lively and consistent with the spirit of the film, being composed most of the time by songs from bands led by women.But not even internal conflicts prevent them from getting excited when they arrive in Japan and see all those fans desperately running after them, in a rare moment that gives them a sense of the band's importance. But the predictable argument over Cherie's sexy photos begins the conflict that will lead to the end of ""Runaways"". Not even the California sun that shone so brightly during the group's rehearsals appears so strongly in the melancholy final act, which narrates the band's decline after their meteoric success. After the end of the Runaways, Joan revealed that she was the one who cared most about it all (""This is my life"") and, not surprisingly, she recovered from the blow and managed to create her own band, being responsible for the eternal hit ""I Love Rock n Roll"".""The Runaways"" is a good record about a lost time, in which we see how young people's lives are easily ruined by the accessibility of experiencing the world. A story that remains current and reflects the thirst for life of today's young people, but which differs in that society is less oppressed than it was 35 years ago. Inspired by the real story of the meteoric success of the first all-female band in rock history, ""The Runaways"" has the merit of introducing the group to new generations. Still, the feeling we have almost all the time is that something is missing. We know the band's trajectory, the transitions from rehearsals to success and from success to decline are there, but, when the film ends, we know little about its members.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The Vidiot Reviews...,"The RunawaysIf you ask me, The Runaways sound like the kind of band that one would go see with a pimp who is looking to replenish his underage prostitute coffers.And while the members of this rock n' rebellious girl group aren't hookers, they do have to swallow plenty of cockamamie ideas in order to succeed in the male dominated music industry.Formed by eccentric record producer Kim Fowley (Michael Shannon) in 1975, The Runaways are comprised of 5, 16-year-old female musicians clad in leather and lace. With the precocious Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) on vocals and the ill-reputed Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) on rhythm guitar, the group garners a huge fan base. Unfortunately, the road takes its toll on the inexperienced girls and they lose themselves to drugs, drink and ego, ultimately tearing the band apart.Based on Curry's memoir, The Runaways is a satisfactory biopic of a band that spawned more successful solo careers than 1# songs, however, while it has its merits, i.e. visceral visuals and sleazy soundtrack, it's just not that tragic of a band biography.Besides, everyone knows the most shocking disintegration of any musical collaboration is, and always will be, the breakup of a one-man-band.

Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning prove the the doubters wrong in this fascinating biopic.,"Credit IMDb.In 1975, San Fernando Valley teen Joan Larkin reinvents herself as Joan Jett, a guitarist who wants to form an all-girl punk band. She pitches the idea to a sleazy manager, Kim Fowley, who pairs her with a drummer and then searches for a face: he finds Cherie Currie, at 15 the perfect jailbait image for his purpose; by luck, she can sing. Two others round out the band, ""The Runaways."" Fowley books a tour, signs them to Mercury Records, and packs them off to crowds in Japan. Seeds of conflict sprout early: Fowley puts Cherie front and center in the publicity, she's soon strung out on pills and vodka, and jealousies arise. Without adult supervision, where can Joan and Cherie end up?Even though I have a huge crush on Kristen and think she's a tremendous talent, I didn't have much hope for this movie. Joan Jett was such a dynamic individual, a one of a kind, and the fact that Kristen Stewart and Dakota Fanning were slated to play Joan and Cherrie worried me. Luckily the two were up to the task. The story was very engrossing, and I loved how it unfolded. This a prime example of how you should do a Biography.Performances. Kristen Stewart does her own variation of Joan Jett and I was utterly engaged by it. As I said, I am a big fan of hers, but I questioned the casting decision, wondering if she had been miscast. Turns out I was pleasantly wrong, and she delivered a great performance. She looks great with the Rocker hair too. Dakota Fanning also delivered a great show as Cherrie. She's clearly growing up, and if what I saw is a testament to the future, the future holds bright things for her. Michael Shannon steals every scene he's in with his performance. He was awesome. Scout Taylor-Compton's role isn't as big as Kristen's and Dakota's, but she did fine as Lita Ford.Bottom line. The Runaways is a great movie, it's as simple as that.

Watch! Solid and well acted biopic,"""The Runaways"" is an amazing slice of the 1970s and depicts the unexpected rise of an all- girl rock and roll band. This was in a time when women weren't really considered or allowed to be rockers.The main three actors: Kristen Stewart, Dakota Fanning, and Michael Shannon are each excellent in their portrayals as Joan Jett, Cherie Currie, and Kim Fowley. Stewart encapsulates the tension, edge, and desperation that was a teenage Jett during the time she was frantically trying to make her career happen. Jett lives for the music, whereas Currie did not and that came across beautifully. Shannon acted as the eccentric and off-the-wall, and often vulgar legendary record producer to a tee. Stewart and Fanning have that electric and elusive ""chemistry"" that Hollywood always seeks for. Their relationship in the film is poignant, and well past believable. The roller rink kissing scene, in particular, where they shotgun a joint is thick with sexual tension. The casting director got this one right.The supporting cast: Tatum O'Neal, Scout Taylor-Compton, and Riley Keough to name a few were each outstanding in their small roles as family members and for Taylor-Compton portraying metal legend Lita Ford.However, the music is naturally the driving force behind this film. Stewart, Fanning, and Co. all sang and played very well and very accurately. The ""Cherry Bomb"" performance is on point and Stewart's roller rink performance of ""I Love Playin' With Fire"" is the epitome of Joan Jett. The ""Dead End Justice"" performance is equally well done. No bones about it. The rest of the soundtrack is great. Suzie Quatro's ""The Wild One,"" Bowie's ""Rebel Rebel,"" Nick Gilder's ""Roxy Roller,"" and The Stooge's ""I Wanna Be Your Dog"" and ""Gimme Danger"" are all excellently placed and suit the scene very well. The inclusion of Jett's post-Runaways songs, ""I Want You,"" and ""Crimson & Clover"" and ""I Love Rock N Roll"" are great too.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Just another one,"I don't know much about The Runaways, other than the fact that they were an all girl rock band from the mid 70s. As a person who likes rock music in general, I was drawn towards this film. So now that I got to see it, this is nothing more than a generic rock n roll film.I don't think you need any further explanation if you've seen a few films of the same type. But if you haven't, here's what the content mainly consists of. Sex. Yep lots of that. Band members doing it with random people and even with each other. And drugs, obviously. They'll smoke (I consider cigs a drug), snort coke, drink even though they're underage, take pills and all that stuff. A very retarded thing is how they managed to smuggle tons of drugs onto a Japanese airline. It's really hard to believe considering that was an international flight.Another dumb thing about this film is how everything fall conveniently into place. Want a manager? Oh, there he is, on the other side of the street. Don't have any members for your all girl band? Take 2 paces to the left and there's your female drummer. Go to the right corner of the bar and there's your female vocalist. Other members will just appear magically. They get popular in what, 2 days? That's what it felt like anyway. And due to the cliché rock n roll unhealthy lifestyle and the oh-so-mean manager, the band falls apart towards the end.I don't know how much of this is actually based on truth. As Joan Jett was part of the production, I'd say a good amount. But the crap is just so hard to swallow. With the exception of the central characters the acting is quite stiff. Whatever, the only real redeemable thing about the whole movie was the decent music. Sure it was a bit entertaining, but as a person who is not familiar with the band, I don't have a good impression of them. I wonder when Hollywood will actually make a film that actually discovers the positive side of rock n roll, like the loyal fans, the ideologies and I don't know, the MUSIC perhaps?",3.0,Anonymous,Music
What a Dud!,"Just having Kristen Stewart smile, look tough and leathery, and lipsync does not make a movie! Dakota Fanning mumbles her lines as she was apparently told to do. And Michael Shannon plays Michael Shannon, with a dose of repetitive misogynism. There's not really a plot. As for the characters, they're so unlikable that you can't even root for The Runaways, or Joan Jett, to hit it big. There's probably an interesting story to tell, but it's sorely missing.

"""The Runaways""","""The Runaways"" isn't much of a film, but it has so much damn style that it's hard not to be intermittently enthused by music video director Floria Sigismondi's music video of a movie. Her chipper cutting and blisteringly upbeat Joan Jett/Runaways soundtrack makes, on one hand, for spontaneous and thrilling tour sequences, which on the other, emphasize how hopelessly average the narrative around them is. Sigismondi has worked with the likes of Sheryl Crow and David Bowie, and understands the symbiotic relationship between sound and image—The problem is that when the film rolls sans tunage, she can't quite find the rhythm.I suppose she didn't have the best script to work with, and as she's also credited with the adaptation of Cherie Currie's book, I'm inclined to blame conservative manipulation of fact in her writing before her direction. Knowing literally nothing about the Runaways as a band going in, I couldn't care less if ""That's how it happened."" In truth, I found their rise to superstardom in the first act of the film fortuitous to the point of contrivance.The truth may be stranger than fiction, but watching characters I met ten minutes ago immediately succeed isn't endearing, it's alienating, especially in proximity to yet another groaningly caricatural cinematic businessman. You've got Giovanni Ribisi in ""Avatar,"" Jon Bernthal in ""The Ghost Writer,"" and now Michael Shannon in ""The Runaways,"" all in the span of, what, four months? Hollywood, I get it. Corporate guys are weasels. Even your corporate guys. With the omission of Jeremy Piven, I just don't find it funny or compelling anymore. It's cheap, lazy character writing.But Shannon's performance in ""The Runaways"" is a minor gripe compared with its overall insubstantiality. The band biopic is nothing new, and while I commend Sigismondi for not watering down the sex, drugs, and rock and roll to cater to the sort of PG-13 audience that would eat up anything Kristen Stewart is doing by peripheral association, her film is still intellectually immature and fundamentally broken.For starters, Stewart as Joan Jett has every reason to be our protagonist except a book deal. Cherie's got a louse of a father, a strained relationship with her sister, and a burgeoning singing career complete with a trendy drug habit. Really, movie? The 'price of fame' angle? Give me a break. The family stuff should carry weight, and doesn't, because the bulk of the film is bubblegum, which I'm perfectly content to chew. Just don't tell me it's a three-course meal.""The Runaways"" is overlong. Its second half, which sinks into the band's inevitable downturn of fortune, comes to a screeching halt to flesh out story bits that I didn't care about to begin with. Sing that ""Cherry Bomb"" song again.The problem is there's no reason to care, and entertainment value alone doesn't cover for the obviously weak story. And if the story is weak, as I suspect it is, because it's based nearly to the T on the honest to God truth, then with all due respect, it doesn't make for great cinema as is. Aspiring biopic writers, here's a tip: lie a little.It's ultimately character that begets emotional gravity, not an event itself. Pill popping, drunkard dads, and band infighting don't amount to a hill of beans unless I really care about who those people are.Sigismondi's film is strung up on the rack and pulled from both ends until its neither frenetic rock pic nor indie coming of age story, which is a shame, because the former is executed so well. When the music stops, it's all too clear that as far as drama goes, ""The Runaways"" is an absentee.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Luke-warm Currie,"Two of the hottest stars of the century and a storming soundtrack ought to make for a cracking good movie, but this film lacks in critical areas - most notably script, direction and editing.As for the terrific twosome, Stewart edges it in my book, more convincing in the role of Jett than Fanning is as Currie. Maybe that's an age thing - Fanning has to go to some dark places, perhaps a step too far for a young, polite and maybe naive girl. Stewart has a few years advantage, and would appear to have embraced this role more thoroughly. I don't think either had a lot of time to rehearse.However Fanning easily out-guns her elder in the singing department. If she was so inclined, she could front any rock band in the world. I had to double check she actually was singing. Somehow I can't see her taking this path, but I for one would love to hear more of her full and powerful vocal abilities. Stewart plays along to the guitar very well, and certainly has the attitude of a rock chick.Meatiest role by far is that of Kim Fowley, and Shannon laps it up with aplomb. As for the other band members - and this is a common criticism of the film - the are really only bit parts. I can forgive this - the film would have to be 4 hours long if everyone was to get equal coverage. Stewart and Fanning are the stars and the film is basically about Jett and Currie, based on a book written by Currie, which presumably is why that part steals the limelight.Some of the scenes are polished, faultless, whilst others appear rushed and under-rehearsed. There are gaps in the script (maybe due to memory loss?!) and it all fits together rather like a jigsaw with half the pieces missing. It's a good film, but it should have been a great film, and Dakota Fanning should (and could) have made this the performance of her life. Kristen Stewart wins my admiration and deserves the plaudits for throwing herself into her role with 100% enthusiasm, whereas it would appear to be just another day at work for Fanning.Dakota, you can't get by just by being a great actor - you have to show you're a great actor. I always get the feeling acting is a little bit of a sideline for you - and maybe rightly so, with school and college. I hope when you finish your education and all that goes with it (which no-one should deny you) we will see the ""old"" Dakota cramming every ounce of her boundless energy into film roles.So, Runaways fans might wince at this film, but it manages to evoke enough of that 1970s spirit of excitement and innovation in music to satisfy those that were there, if not those that wrote the songs. I loved the cinematography, loved the music, and loved the performances. I just wish I'd be blown away by them.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Fun Film to Check out,"The sub genre of biographies on the most glorious musicians of our time has grown much over time. One of my favorites has to be ""The Temptations"" (directed by ), and this film is up there for me. Now like all genres, these films have a fairly general chain of events. A nobody craves to share talent with world, manages to reach limelight, but then is consumed by drugs and falls. Do I find this a weakness? No not necessarily, for every genre has its own tendencies. The super hero must save his love interest, Tom Cruise must dance in almost every movie he's in, Godzilla has to stomp on Tokyo, and every horror has the dumbass who calls out to the darkness expecting a friend. Don't even get me started on the near pointlessness of romantic comedies. These conventions aren't always present, but still often are and it's not always where you're going with a film but just how you get there. And also consider the fact this film and others like it are more or less pieces of history, so running into these conventions isn't really avoidable. Celebrities have a tendency to do stupid things.For this film, the very enjoyable aspects lie in its sensuality and casting choices. The jail bait Dakota Fanning is bound to draw attention, and this is probably the only film in which I can partake starring Kristen Stewart. They're well aware their playing guitar legends, and so they both do quite well. And Michael Shannonas is just cool. The performances are pretty good and the soundtrack, if you're a fan of Joan Jett and her work, is damn good. Be sure to check this one out.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Compendium of clichés with great acting,"I don't think I have ever given 5/10 to a movie, as that is such a neutral, wishy-washy evaluation. If a movie is not good, it is usually bad or annoying to some degree. Yet 5/10 describes ""The Runaways"" perfectly. It is neither good nor bad.On the good side, the acting is indeed good. I don't think I have ever seen an actor capture a living celebrity as perfectly as Kristen Stewart captures the young Joan Jett. In voice, appearance, personality and mannerisms, Stewart is indistinguishable from the real thing. It is an amazing performance. Likewise, Michael Shannon did almost as good a job as ultra-pretentious huckster Kim Fowley, although Shannon is more physically imposing than Fowley and looks more like Dee Dee Ramone than the actual Fowley. Shannon plays ultracamp but doesn't really look it. Dakota Fanning wasn't quite as good at playing Cherie Currie, the real Cherie being thinner and hotter and looking much older than Fanning. Fanning seems more innocent and diffident than Currie did on stage, but maybe that is closer to reality than Currie's stage persona. The set designers and costumers really put a lot of care into getting the 1970's fashions and furnishings right. Also much of the music is quite good. However only a minority is Runaways songs.However acting alone cannot carry a movie. The script is just a compendium of rock clichés, the sort of fantasies a sheltered early teenager with a low threshold for rebelliousness would have about rock stars. Difficult startup playing house parties that get busted by the cops, lame rebelliousness, alcoholic or abusive parents, exploitative manipulative Maclarenesque manager haranguing his charges about rock & roll being all about sex and rebellion while misappropriating their revenues, lesbian experimentation, record deal with unhip record industry execs, screaming fans on overseas tours, rock magazine headlines, seedy hotels, male chauvinists saying a woman's place is in the home, personality clashes and drug addiction leading to the band's downfall. It's not necessarily inaccurate, but you've seen all this a squillion times before. There is no real story outside of this series of clichés, nothing at all unexpected. It's not notably boring or annoying, but sure isn't interesting either.Still at least it's not a live action comic book for 13 year old boys or a Prince Charming chick flick for youngish single women, which every other film seems to be nowadays, so it's worth seeing if nothing else is on.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Oscar worthy but too real for Hollywood ?,"This movie had great writing, great acting,a moving story line and for a period piece projected you right into the 70's underbelly of rock n roll......I think Oscar missed the boat on this great film. Perhaps it was a tad too real and needed to be some comedic farce.The elite of holly wood don't tend to look outside the box unless the bottom line pads their pockets. Too bad really because this gem is right up there with Whip it for great directing, top notch role players and getting it right as far as cast to movie production.For me personally the best way I can describe a film is I buy it watch it and if it's really good I listen to the commentary and special features. I don't waste my time on a film not worthy watching a second , third, fourth time. This film deserves your attention .",9.0,Anonymous,Music
A massively missed opportunity barely watchable.,"I love Joan Jett, I had the Runaways bootleg live album, one of the first albums I ever bought, back in the days of Vinyl and real rock and roll. While the Runaways birthed Joan Jett and The Blackhearts this movie doesn't really touch on that until the last 30 seconds of the movie and of course, that's the most interesting part of the story. This movie would have been better if they got rid of the fat chick from Arrested Development, who had no place in the movie at all. There's so many amazing stories from being on the road, but this movie is flat, and boring, and confusingly, about a bunch of underage chicks on the road in a rock band.. I mean.. come ON. This script is tame, and as such retarded since it doesn't emphasize the most interesting thing about the Runaways, Joan Jett, or Lita Ford for crissakes! Don't do a movie about rock and roll if you don't have the balls to show the scenes of what it's all about. I will say the casting for Lita and Joan Jett was pretty darn good and OK for Cherry.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great film about the 70's hard rock band,"If you are a fan of the 70's hard rock band The Runaways, or classic rock and roll in general, then you will enjoy this movie about the band at the height of their popularity and the struggles they went through, simply titled ""The Runaways"". The movie, written and directed by Floria Sigismondi and based on front woman Cherie Currie's autobiography, ""Neon Angel"", shows what it was like being a woman in the rock and roll industry back in the 70's.Kristen Stewart does an excellent job portraying Joan Jett with her dark jet-black hair, edgy style, and passion for rock music. Dakota Fanning also does a very good job portraying Cherie Currie, the innocent high school girl turned blonde rock star. Both actresses made their characters very believable, especially Stewart. I wish the other bands members had more attention though.The soundtrack mostly contains Stewart and Fanning doing remakes of Runaways' songs such as ""Queens Of Noise"" and their signature hit ""Cherry Bomb"", but there are only three actual Runaways songs on the soundtrack. It would be better if there were more Runaways' originals on the soundtrack, as someone who could watch this movie might have never heard of The Runaways and would be curious to check out their music. It would be more appropriate if they included more original Runaways' songs rather than Stewart and Fanning remaking them.While I do have a couple critiques about this movie, overall, I think it was excellent, especially if you are into classic hard rock music. If you're looking for a good rock and roll movie to add to your Netflix, you should definitely add this one. Full of sex, drugs, & rock and roll, ""The Runaways"" is a fantastic film about what it was like trying to make it as an all-female rock band in the 70's.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Unoriginal rock n roll flick,"This film does have a good visual style, but nothing about is really interesting. Didn't give a crap about any of the characters in this as well, although it's based on a true story. The plot is basically about a group of girls mainly focusing on the members Joan Jett(Kristen Stewart) and Cherie Currie(Dakota Fanning) and both the actresses that played them did a decent job. Anyways they are trying to make it as a band during a time when girls was looked down upon for doing those things, such as rock n roll. And although it has the cliché sex, drugs and rock n roll scenes that is very cliché in this film, it just was not interesting what so ever. The performances of the main ""The Runaways"" were well done but that is the only positive thing I can think of in this film. Yeah it shows some of the characters like Joan Jett and Cherie Currie going through tough times, but didn't really care for it or had my sympathy. A group of young girls forming the first all-girl rock band may seem like a good idea, but it just wasn't well crafted. Mainly because nothing about this film was original in anyway, everything in this has been done before except much better and lacks depth.4.6/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Stewart Shines As Joan Jett....,"I've heard people say time and time again that they have no interest in watching this film because they hate the Twilight films so much...Well I say...Perhaps I may be able to convince them to change their minds...Because this film is wonderful...I look at Kristen Stewart the same way as I look at Robert Deniro...I know that seems like a strange comparison...But it's really not...Try looking at it like this...Question: What kind of movies is Robert Deniro most ""Famous"" for..??

Not quite,"To be honest, I expected this movie to be only a middle of the road offering and that's essentially all it is in the end.Watching and listing to it, I couldn't help but feel like there was so much missing on multiple levels that it became a very frustrating experience to sit through it.Is it shocking? Hardly. Should it have been? It would have helped.There's nothing in the film that's anywhere near ""in your face"" as you'd expect, based on the music, other than Michael Shannon's most awesome performance.I've seen a LOT of films about rock bands - some fictional and some real, and this I'm afraid pales in comparison to not only ANY great film, but all those that attempt to depict the personalities involved.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Sex And Drugs And Rock & Roll,"...And more sex,drugs & rock & roll,and even more sex,drugs & rock & roll. If you haven't quite figured it out yet,this is the tale of the rise & fall of the 1970's pre-Glam (glamour-a sort of post glitter rock genre) rock band,The Runaways. In 1975,Kim Fowley,who is/was something of an icon on the Sunset Strip in Hollywood,who was associated with the likes of Frank Zappa & the original Mothers Of Invention,Jonathan Richman,to mention but a few, discovered a then,unknown guitar player named Joan Jett,who wanted to rock out in a big way & helped form The Runaways,and made them a success. 'The Runaways' attempts to tell their story of the road to success,and it's hard falling down. The Runaways lasted little more than four (or so) years,and recorded a few L.P's for Mercury,before burning out. Italy's own Floria Sigismondi,known for her work in music videos,directs from her screenplay,adapted from the novel 'Neon Angel' by Cherie Currie,based on her own life as ""rock & roll goddess"". Joan Jett acts as one of the executive producers. The cast includes Kristen Stewart,who moves up in a big way from her usual shtick in the Twilight series (another one is due sometime later this year,or next year),as Joan Jett. Dakota Fanning, looking dead eyed & myopic as Cherie Currie. Stella Maeve,as Sandy West. Scout Taylor-Compton,as Lita Ford,and Alia Shawkat,as Robin,as The Runaways. Michael Shannon is the very over the top,Kim Fowley,who is part Svengali,and part Frankenstein's monster as their manager,as well as some brief on screen time by Tatum O'Neal (yes,THE Tatum O'Neal, of 'Paper Moon'fame),as Cherie's mother. My two obvious gripes with this film is some of the historical goofs (I won't go into details,as not to spoil it for others,but musical historians will pick it up in the flick of an eye),and how the film mostly focuses on the working & personal relationship of Joan & Cherie (the rest of the Runaways seem to be little more than a backdrop most of the time). The biggest winner of this film (for me,anyway)is the music,which not only includes songs by The Runaways,but Iggy & The Stooges,David Bowie,as well as other period music of the era. For anybody born after 1985,who wonders ""what was the music of the '70's all about?"",this film will give you a brief peek into an open window of that decade. Rated 'R' by the MPAA,this film contains strong language,and much reveling in the Rock & Roll lifestyle (sexual experimentation,including nudity,much alcohol & drug abuse...mainly by minors),much on screen smoking",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Kristen & Dakota Run Away With It,"I must admit that I was not aware of the girl group, the Runaways, before hearing about this movie. However, I was very familiar with Joan Jett. The movie's two young stars are both excellent in their roles, and I can tell that Kristen especially nailed Jett. Dakota's portrayal of Cherie may have nailed it, but I am not in a position to know for sure. Kristen and Dakota are both child stars who are now beginning to make their names as adults (or close). Both clearly have the chops.Stewart, a special favorite of mine, need not constantly be associated with the Twilight movies, as she is creating a body of work that far surpasses that type of role. It is time to stop being surprised when Kristen Stewart turns in a top-notch performance -- top-notch is now the norm for this talented actress.The Runaways does suffer from a routine 'rock idol' script, and in my opinion, concentrates too heavily on the Cherie character. I'd have given Stewart more lines and screen time. Hence, my nine instead of ten stars.",9.0,Anonymous,Music

"Rock 'N Roll, Sex, and Drugs","When I watched this film, I wasn't expecting much, but was greatly surprised from what I saw. Coming from a person that doesn't like Kristen Stewarts acting, she did a perfect job of portraying Joan Jett. I love Joan Jett as a singer, her voice is fantastic and even though she's all girl, she acts like a boy; Kristen Stewart portrayed this to a tee. I am also very impressed with Dakota Fanning; she has always been such a good actress, and she will not fail your expectations in this film. It was very entertaining to watch the True Story of how the Runaways started and ended. This movie did a great job portraying the events of what happened, making it flow well, and very entertaining to watch. If interested in further learning more about this band, there is a great documentary called ""Edgeplay"", with the real band members talking about what happened.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sex, Drugs and Rock 'n' Roll","It's the same old same old we have our corrupt musicians trying to make it big with hit after hit and then a downfall. I don't like the fact that in the business of music it's like a broken record and repeats the same thing over and over again in this case a plot that does nothing for The Runaways and just looks like ever other musician movie out there. It's a lazy film, but I do enjoy the music just wish they went more in depth with the band rather than making it so distasteful. Now I know nothing about The Runaways so I shouldn't really say anything, but this is a film out there for everyone to see and this is my review of the film so you can shove it. Anyways not the worst film in the world I say it's more of bad and good. 50-50.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"Rent the DVD, invite your friends and have a slumber party","What does one say about a movie that's really good but could have been a great?First off. Why was it really good? Well because The Runaways were the first all female rock band that wrote their material and played their instruments. The fact they were charismatic eye candy was a bonus for us males - so God bless'em for that. That makes this an important movie.This type of genre tends to fall flat on its face, especially for musicians, when an actor is cast that can't play their respective instrument or mime the vocals. So when Joan Jett (played by the very gifted Kristen Stewart)is playing the guitar and singing, it appears authentic. Didn't hurt that Kristen resembles Joan Jett either.Dakota Fanning is another gifted actress. Only difference is she exudes a wholesomeness that should have banned her from playing the role of Cherie Currie. But she handled it like a true pro. Folks. we're talking,"" Sex, Drugs, Booze and Rock N Roll."" Plus, she sings amazingly well on these tracks.Casting Elvis Presley's granddaughter as Cherie's twin sister Marie was a great choice. The role was small but gave her the opportunity to mix-it-up with the pros and shine.Now.How could it have been made great? Well,simple; more emphasis on the other band members, especially Joan Jett. The story line leaned too heavily on Cherie's family life leaving me wanting to know more about the other group members family life. I still don't know diddly-squat about Lita Ford's life. We actually get to see Sandy West's Mom's horrified reaction after Kim Fowley comes to their home. And as for Joan's family life? Well forget about it. Not a peep.And I don't recall the bass player, Robin, played by Alia Shawkat from the sitcom Arrested Development having any dialogue! We see they played in Japan. But did they play at CBGB's ? It desperately needed that kind of balance.It would also have been nice to show a photo of the real-life Runaways in 1976 that morphs into how they look today, just before the ending credits. Cliché? absolutely. Relevant? Very much so.As a final note, the commentary is not to be missed. It has Joan Jett, Kristen and Dakota dishing out morsels of interesting background info. It too is rated R because of Kristen's penchant for whimsical profanity.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't look for the facts. Look for the truth!,"Does this film tell the whole story of the band The Runaways? No! Of course it doesn't. How can a film tell the whole story in one hour and forty minutes? When it comes to any film based on real events, whether it's Gandhi, Braveheart, Ray, etc, people have some very naive expectations concerning accuracy and truth. But any film based on nonfictional material is not a recreation of events. It's a representation of events. You're not watching a story. You're watching a summary. Many would tell you that this is Cherie Currie's summary and therefore a movie about her and not The Runaways. Because that is the case, doubts are aplenty not only about the accuracy but the integrity of this film. If by some miracle, there were four more movies made, each from the perspective of a different Runaway, the accuracy and credibility of each one would be challenged by passionate fans, moviegoers and those who were actually there.What you get with this film is a thoughtful and captivating look into the era. It was a time when rock n' roll was still dangerous and a girl who wanted to play electric had a lot to prove. With Dakota Fanning's portrayal of Cherie Currie, you get a compelling performance where fragility and innocence mixes with angst and anger. Just like that cherry-shaped firecracker, Dakota can appear sweet and harmless. But if she feels the heat, she could easily be the bomb that blows up in your face. Kristen Stewart's portrayal of Joan Jett is a glimpse of iconic individuality in the face of sexist adversity. And when you think the performance might be veering towards one dimensional monotony, you see her start to crack. When an argument in the studio turns destructive and friendships deteriorate, Kristen's Joan betrays a vulnerability that is damn near heart-breaking. Michael Shannon threatens to steal the whole movie as he gives a larger than life portrayal of larger than life producer Kim Fowley. The character represents everything that is exciting, immoral and ultimately detrimental in the world these girls find themselves in.Any film dealing with the familiar rock n' roll archetypes of sex, drugs and losing it all is bound to be at risk of floundering in clichés. These may be apparent, but only the insufferable cynics will let them get in the way of the truth. And this film does tell the truth. When these girls are on stage, the music, mind, body and soul are in perfect alignment. In those moments they are the most familial, the most powerful and they are so beautifully dangerous that nobody can doubt their strength. It is the purest high that they could ever achieve. The problems arise when the music stops. They walk off stage and they have to deal with family, love, friendships and future. The most obvious way to escape it all is to try and recreate the high. For many a rock star, the answer is never far and for Cherie Currie, the answer was only a pill away.But in the end, the only high that matters is the music because the music is what everyone remembers. If you're looking for the truth in this movie, there it is.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

You probably won't learn much as this is predictable stuff,"The story of the Runaways is an interesting one. Joan Jett wanted to form an all girl rock band and she did with Cherie Currie singing lead vocals on some songs or most songs.There are so many questions that I would love to see answered about The Runaways and Joan Jett and unfortunately, not all of the questions are answered in this film. In fact, very few questions are answered here. We do get to see Kim grooming the band and trying to get the performances out of them that he felt would make them successful but really, we've seen those scenes before in other films.If someone really wanted to get the story of The Runaways out there, why not deliver the story instead of delivering a predictable rock-n-roll band on the road type of story?I almost feel like if I want all my questions answered I would need to read Cherie Currie's book Neon Angel. This film sort of skims over the surface without digging or exposing too much detailed information.It's too bad because I like Joan Jett and Cherie Currie and I wanted to love this film but it just didn't go much past what one would expect from a film telling a story of any all girl rock-n-roll band. It's exactly what you would expect.I doubt anyone will actually learn much here about the individuals themselves.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Only Two Members of the Runaways?,"I was reading someone else's review of this film, and he asked the question in my summary heading. The answer to that is simply. Joan Jett was the executive producer and Cherie Curries book was the basis of the story. Lita Ford was written off as a villain, and Jackie Fox was background scenery. Had this film been made today, I don't think Jackie's story would have been left out. Ironically Jackie went on to become a graduate of Harvard Law School and came out with her story of being raped by Fowley. Micki Steele's involvement would have been interesting as well. What a shame. I'll look forward to a real documentary about this band in the future that tells the complete story of everyone, and isn't transformed into the Joan Jett show. I would expect this from Gene Simmons. I gave this an 8 because at least two members got to tell their story, and problems associated with this band's startup. Also it shows what a jerk Kim was to the human race.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
My favorite movie!!!,"The Runaways is my all time favorite movie, based off of Cherie Currie the ex-lead singer of the runaways book called neon angel, of course it's a movie so there were some things in the movie that were not correct but the runaways movie captured the essence of the real runaways band. This movie stars amazing actors such as Kristen Stewart who plays Joan Jett, Dakota Fanning who plays Cherie Currie and Michael Shannon who plays Kim Fowley, they all out on great performances, especially Kristen she was really committed to the role. The Runaways was the very first all girl Rock band who were tough and rebellious and in the movie it really captured that, also people in the other reviews said some things about how besides Cherie and Joan the other members weren't included enough in this movie that is because lita ford the lead guitarist of the group refused to let them use her story, next is Sandy west, Sandy died in 2006 and couldn't really get much of her story without it coming from her and also Jackie Fox is a lawyer now and the crew for the runaways movie didn't want to take any chances also because the runaways changed bass players throughout.

"Highly recommend, great acting and brilliant music","The Runaways were part of the hard rock revolution and were an all female group. The movie is the story of Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and how she created ""The Runaways"" with Kim Foley (Michael Shannon) as their manager. Along the way they recruit Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) to be the bands lead singer and face. This is a very realistic look at how drugs (alcohol included) was part of the bands daily life and eventually their downfall. Joan Jett continued after the Runaways disbanded and became a major force in hard rock music throughout the 70's and 80's and still performs today.The Runaways music is some of my favourite music of all time and in the movie Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart actually sing in the live music scenes. I am a fan of Dakota Fanning and Micheal Shannon, but I did not know too much about Kristen Stewart, who is a fine actress and I look forward to seeing more of her work. If you are a lover of hard rock, watch the movie and listen to the Runaways discography. I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Formulaic but well done,"Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning) is a rebellious teen winning her 10th grade talent contest as David Bowie.

Then Kim and Joan recruit Cherie into the band. Kim toughens the girls into an edgy rock band.Dakota Fanning is trying to do more rougher roles. Kristen Stewart has a good handle on the tough young chick character. The girls do a good job. Then there is Michael Shannon. He is amazing in this.

Direction is another positive aspect with just enough blurry, overexposed fast moving close-ups to make it a real Rock n Roll Movie, without turning it into a 1h40 headache!

Pretty Good Rock Biopic,"I like rock music, I like Joan Jett, but I didn't know much about The Runaways, I know a bit more now, and enjoyed the film. It is the best film I have seen about a rock band, ever!Dakota Fanning and Kristen Stewart were great, as well as the supporting cast, the film was well made, well directed and well shot, and covered the story fairly well, my only quibble is that they could have done more of the music rather than focus on the problems, however that is entertainment, people prefer to see the seedier side for some reason, and this film fills that role, but apart from that I liked it.Its called 'The Runaways' but in reality it is mostly about Cherie Currie, its a pity they did not include more of the relationships between Cherie and the rest of the band, I suppose because the others (Lita Ford and Jacki Foxx) did not want to contribute and Sandy West had died, but they covered her relationship with Joan Jett well (Joan did contribute).Well done!",8.0,Anonymous,Music

I wasn't a fan of Joan Jetts or the Runnaways, because I thought they were too mannish and raunchy. I was aware that the movie very well could be, as well, and I was right. Sometimes good movie-making depends on being able to omit/edit things to make way for a wider audience, as well as not to offend them with unnecessary B.S. - Then on the other hand, sometimes good movie-making depends on being able to show the truth and grittiness of situations. In this movie I felt there were things that could very successfully have been omitted, without loosing any of the gritty truth. They also didn't delve into the band's other members, which I can't help but believe that there were many fans of this group who were disappointed not to have seen more of their characters involvement in the film.",,Anonymous,Music
