"Michael Bay's World War II is entertaining, yet deeply flawed","For the past two decades now, Michael Bay has been known littering his films with countless explosions, and with this heavy special effects, garners wide success at the box office. Here, Michael Bay steps into the war genre with this intense, dramatic retelling of the fateful event that pulled America into World War II in the 1941. Set near the dawn of World War II, Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett play Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, two Airforce soldiers who have been best friends since childhood. As they grow up, they are caught in a love triangle when they both fall in love with beautiful nurse named Evelyn (played by Kate Beckinsale). Things get pretty complicated when Danny and Evelyn are transferred to Pearl Harbor where Rafe returns from fighting overseas in Great Britain to find the two are in a relationship. Next morning, December 7, Danny and Rafe wake up to find hundreds of Japanese fighter pilots dropping bombs on Pearl Harbor. The two friends arm themselves with the F-51s in attempt to fight off against the Japanese fleet. With the U.S naval base devastated and thousands of innocent lives lost, the U.S declares war against war. From there on, Dafe and Rafe and their army lead by Lieutenant Colonol James Dolittle (played by Alec Baldwin) prepare for a fight against Japan to overcome their country's catastrophic defeat. This film also features Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Captain Dorie Miller, the first African- American in history to be awarded the U.S Navy Cross.The bombing of Pearl Harbor was one of the most shocking moments in the history of America, and it makes interesting subject matter to be told on on screen. Although this movie does manage to paint the horrors that took place during that fateful day, this film does suffer from some flaws that director Michael Bay is often known. Now with a war movie being directed by Bay, audience should go into this movie expecting abundance of explosions and this film plenty of these during the 40-minute action sequences that takes place during the attack on Pearl Harbor. The entire scene is very well done and the special effects are great. The scene really captures the grim details of what the civilians of Pearl Harbor suffered through as we watch countless of people killed from gunfire and drowning, as well as others who suffer some gruesome injuries. This entire scene is quite difficult to watch and it really pulls at your heart strings. Now here is where the film falters. Along with the whole Japanese attack and its aftermath, audiences are treated with a romantic subplot involving Josh Hartnett, Ben Affleck, and Kate Beckinsale that takes up a good portion of the film. What we get from this is poor acting and cheesy dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsale, including a line ""I love you so much it hurts"", a line that is highly laughable and far too corny, especially when dealing with a war flick. The whole love story is not terrible, but definitely takes more than what is needed of the film. With the whole story, the film ends up running 183 minutes.Pearl Harbor is certainly not one of the best war movies in Hollywood and definitely not the best of what Michael Bay has to offer. I feel that this could have done better if it was handled someone like Steven Spielberg who has been masterful with the World War II genre (Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List). Overall, this is film is not terrible. Despite some of its flaws, it still works and is entertaining to watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"It May Be Long, but at Least It's Dull","About one third of the way through this mess, my daughter left her friends and came to me for some money to go to the concession stand. I asked her if they were selling pillows there. This is one of the longest movies I have ever sat through (at least that's what my back tells me). It has some of the worst writing I have ever heard. The set-up and the romantic intrigues are predictable and uninteresting. There is absolutely no suspense. The whole plot is contrived. Oh, yes, there is an endless attack by the Japanese, but by the time it happened, my mind was wandering. As far as those tragic lovers, I thought I was watching a bunch of eighth grade girls and boys ticked off because she said he said she said, whatever!! Then, of course, we have Jimmy Doolittle, going on his raid to make up for what those guys did to us. What a slap in the face to the real event. How can a director with 135 million dollars make the attack on Pearl Harbor dull. Yes, it probably looked like that. Those bombers and fighters moving clandestinely in on the island--destroying the fleet with no conscience. What about a script? What about the building of some sort of momentum? How about focusing on the realistic politics of the time and seeing the world from both sides. I was so disappointed in this film. People wonder why it's so expensive to go to the movies these days. It's because the studios are footing the bill for this kind of bilge!",6.0,Anonymous,History
"C'est magnifique, c'est ne le guerre pas!","(Please excuse my French, it's probably wrong)
 
 Roll up, roll up! See the cinematic spectacle of 2001! See the horrible 
 deaths of 2500 or so people commemorated by a film about two guys who 
 fly fast planes really fast. See them go ZOOOOOOOOM, see them go 
 WHIIIIZZZZ! See them reprise the 'flypast and debriefing' scenes from 
 Top Gun. Watch the beautiful love story unfold. See the true love two 
 people have for one another tested and broken when Kate Beckinsale 
 comes between them.
 
 See a fine young actor reduced to playing Token Black Guy. Watch as he 
 fights to prove he's more than a Token Black Guy, even though he's 
 given so little to do that he ends up as nothing more than a Token 
 Black Guy (even though, unlike the two guys in the planes, Token Black 
 Guy actually existed).
 
 Watch the awful bombing of a military target. Watch the heroic bombing 
 of a city. Watch Jon Voigt recreate Peter Sellars' unforgettable 
 character Dr. Strangelove.
 
 Watch the whole reality of war, and the lives and deaths therein 
 trivialised to make a Big Dumb Action Movie that thinks it's some kind 
 of ghastly tribute to the American dead of December the 7th.
 
 Or better still... don't!

 paced romance, fighter planes zooming all over the place and nice 
 explosions, check this out. It's a lot of fun. Just don't take it

Multiple love stories with some action scenes in between..,"Pros:
Very good special effects that stand the test of time.
Nice action scenes.
Good acting from some of the cast.
Cons:
Too long!
Mainly focuses on the love stories and the war scenes are something like a break from them..Overall a quite good movie but not great or something epic!
And 3 hours! is too long, maybe the love stories should be a bit shorter eg. 30 minutes shorter in total.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Its entertaining,"Unlike some other war movies, Gallipoli, Full Metal Jacket etc Pearl Harbor seems to be more focused on entertaining rather than deep characterisation of a morales tale.So not looking for the answers to those deep questions regarding war, this is a movie of love, loss, action and entertainment.I'm not sure fun is the right word so lets go with enjoyable.Its a long film that keeps you engaged and interested the entire time.What more can we really ask?",7.0,Anonymous,History
I'm confused with all the hate of the film.,"I've never written a review before but after seen how many people are saying this film I thought I better.
I actually think the film was great the main premise of the film which I feel most people have completely missed is a bond between two guys that is as strong as a brotherhood hood. The alpha one who has the confidence to take over the world and the quiter one both who would die for each other in an instance. And maybe it was just me but I really did feel the emotions that they feel throughout the film. It seems like a lot of people hate the film so maybe I'm missing something but i think its a great film. The film is not totally accurate but films don't need to be and I film is long which is the reason I suspect it gets so much hate.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"""Get me into a damn plane!"" Ben, I think the more appropriate request would be ""Get me into a half-decent movie!""","After seeing this film, I have to say that I'm glad I listened to what all my friends were saying about this film and only paid attention to less than half of this film. The two battle scenes were what I found worth watching, and I hadn't expected anything else, from what everyone told me about the film. Had I not been fully aware that nothing other than those two scenes were worth watching, had my state of mind been completely open to this film, I would have hated it, and my review would have been a thoroughly negative one. It's more than likely that I would have commented on Jerry Bruckheimer's and Michael Bay's lack of actual talent and their extreme use of explosions(usually overplayed and overdone ones) to cover this up. But I won't. I won't comment much on plot, pacing, acting or characters. I could complain that this is just another typical, empty Hollywood film that takes a historical event and smothers in with romance and sappy sentimentality instead of bringing the real story(as if it didn't have enough impact on its own), much like they(seemingly; haven't seen it, for obvious reasons) did with Titanic. I could argue that the plot is thin and everything but the actual historical events seem bland and unimportant, that the acting seems flat, the pacing excruciatingly bad and the characters paper-thin clichés and stereotypes. But I'll try not to. Instead, I will comment on the two battle scenes, for those who share my point of view on the sappy romantic drivel of many late epic films. They look pretty good. The effects are impressive, though the CGI is overly obvious at times. Most of it looks good, and the overuse of explosions supposedly won't bother most action fans(though I, being in favor of realism in war movies, found this to be quite bothersome and annoying). If you really like strong war-action, you should check out a movie that delivers more of it(like Black Hawk Down) or at a far more realistic approach to it(like Der Untergang). However, if you want to see the Bruckheimer version of a war scene, by all means, see this film. I warn you, though, most of it is simply not worth paying attention to. I recommend this to fans of war movies with Hollywood action scenes and/or people who can't watch a movie that doesn't contain romance. 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Someone get me a pair of scissors!,"What a great film this could have been!  The recreation of the attack on Pearl Harbor is some of the best film-making ever - an extraordinary and moving sequence made utterly believable by state of the art special effects. It ranks up there with the opening sequence from ""Saving Private Ryan"" and the sinking of the ""Titanic"" as one of the most harrowing ""disaster"" sequences filmed in recent years.  But like both those other two films, PEARL HARBOR is desperately in need of a decent script to frame the disaster sequence.Okay - I could almost accept the hokey old love triangle romantic plot - certainly the stars are great to look at - but the dialogue really sucked: ""I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you"". Please!  And all those hero shots from the ground, and the slow motion love bits, and the soppy music, and the eternal sunsets...But what this film really needed was an editor!  The climax of the film is the attack on Pearl Harbor - an American defeat.  But it seems the film-makers decided that the American audience wouldn't be satisfied with this - and so the movie grinds on and on for another hour or so dramatising a revenge attack on Japan.  And we're supposed to believe that this attack was fought by the very same guys who were on the ground in Hawaii.  I mean we all know that America won the war in the end, so did we really need this long epilogue?Personally I'd cut out all the Roosevelt and the Japanese high command scenes and concentrate on the experiences of the people on the ground at Pearl Harbor.  The Japanese stuff was all completely unbelievable anyway. The sad loss would be the superb performance of Jon Voight as Roosevelt - but maybe they could make another film about him.  I'd also end the film after the attack at Pearl Harbor, as the survivors pick up the pieces.  So why not have a shorter Director's Cut - a novel concept - that makes this film the great film it could have been.  If you like I'll lend the scissors!",3.0,Anonymous,History

Another puff piece from the master of puff,"Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls' is merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the 40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all. Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn (Kate Beckingsale), who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers', `say' or `ain't' in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic if one had actually been there.The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I dislike Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.  Thanks Jerry.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Why the hate?!,"I rewatched this the other day for the first time since I saw it in the cinema all those years ago, and I really enjoyed it.I do agree that the romance element of the film dominates it a bit too much, but even so, this is still a decent movie. It would have been cool to have a bit less romance and a a bit more dog fight scenes, but hey ho.It's a perfectly watchable movie with many great actors in it, and the plot is incredibly easy to follow. For an early 2000s movie, the plane scenes were done really well and still hold up today - I don't know if they used CGI, but it looks good even 20+ years later.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Slightly underrated, but not overly spectacular","After seeing this only a week ago I felt slightly compelled to write a review on it. Let me just say first off though, that while it was most certainly not the greatest movie ever made, it was also definitely not the worst. Pearl Harbour tries to tell us about the ordinary people who were effected by the drama that occurred on December 7, 1941. It's main characters are I guess somewhat believable. Rafe (played very badly by Ben Affleck) is a charismatic, and slightly cocky pilot who just can't wait to be a hero. Standing in his shadow is the much more insecure and more logical friend Danny (Josh Hartnett i thought played him surprisingly well), who looks up to Rafe like a younger brother looks up to his big brother. And lastly Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) who is a slightly stereotypical 1940's girl who just can never make up her mind about what to do.The plot is rather predictable, I suppose. Rafe falls for Evelyn. Rafe goes off to war and is assumed dead. Evelyn and Danny fall in love. Rafe is suddenly not dead. Danny and Rafe get at it over Evelyn. Pearl Harbour is bombed. Evelyn picks Danny over Rafe. And then we all know what happens in the end... Although the romance was a bit Jerry Springer, and there was absolutely no chemistry between Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale, Pearl Harbour manages to keep you interested in the characters and what their fate will be.Positives:Hartnett and Beckinsale both provide relatively good performancesspecial effects were extremely breathtaking in the bombing sceneJon Voight is the highlight of the film as Franklin D Roosevelt (best scene in the movie) - battle scenes are very well developedsupporting actors were just as good as the main actors, providing a bit more interest to the ""ordinary"" people of Pearl HarbourNegatives:once again, Ben Affleck was not at all talented in this movie, his acting was very woodencheesy script ( way too many cheesy romance lines to count)Alec Baldwin as a ""hero""? eughhistorically inaccuratenot enough of Cuba Gooding Jr.my main problem is the ending. It was an absolutely awful one in my opinion.To be honest, it wasn't the greatest movie ever, I watched it, it was worth the 4 dollar rental and I did cry a bit at the end. I think the main thing people can debate is who the love of her life was... Rafe or Danny? My vote will always be on Danny. I mean, the parachute scene? =)Anyways, 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Gets Worse with Each Viewing,"Any time I watch Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970) I feel obligated to re-watch this film. Nothing in this movie can be defended except the scenes portraying the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. That is only 30 minutes of the film. But even then the quick editing and computer graphics ruin the portrayal. Tora! Tora! Tora! is by far the better film. Yes, it is dated. Yes, it has its flaws. But it conveys the historical events in a way that a novice actually learns something about history. And the real strength of the film is in portraying the attack with real effects and no CGI. It has incredible visuals and the terrifying sound of the engines screaming through the sky and the bombs falling. There is no comparison between the two films. Watch Tora! Tora!

Not as good as I expected,"""Pearl Harbor"" comes off like ""Titanic"" meets ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"". It's a three hour epic that has shades of those two movies, and in the end I was kind of disappointed. This film should have been better than it turned out to be. The big problem with this film is the director, Michael Bay. Bay directed this film pretty much the same way he directed his last film ""Armageddon"", sloppy and inconsistent. With the exception of the Pearl Harbor attack sequence which is excellently done, most of the scenes before that attack come off as corny and ridiculous. And the love triangle between Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale doesn't even stand up to the love story between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in ""Titanic"". However, the big scene when Pearl Harbor comes under attack is a tour-de-force sequence. The special effects are superb and horrifying. But just think at how much better this film could have been. If Steven Spielberg or James Cameron had directed this, ""Pearl Harbor"" would have been a much better film. Spielberg and Cameron are directing geniuses compared to Bay, who foolishly tries to integrate comic relief in the first part of the film which comes off ineptly silly. But he's got the special effects in the right place. So all-in-all, I was kind of disappointed with ""Pearl Harbor"", the film that was predicted to be the biggest hit of summer 2001, but ended up being a slight box office disappointment (at the time of this review the movies' gross was at $197 million, still below $200 million). It's not an awful film, but it could have been better.**1/2 (out of four)",7.0,Anonymous,History
Superb film - Believable acting - Well written - Severely underrated,"I seriously do not understand the utter hate toward this film by critics when writing their reviews. ""Historically inaccurate"" or ""Just another love story"" or ""boring!""... If you want to see a film that is totally historically accurate, watch a documentary for heavens sake. This movie goes way out of proportion to what really happened that day in Pearl Harbor, but it is a MOVIE! Get over it. It's not supposed to be real.The film as a whole is brilliantly written; it's not too soppy with the romance and not too over the top with pure action. People are saying that it's just too much shoot 'em up and too many explosions. Well, I got news for you... They're at war! Bombs will go off and guns will be fired from all places possible. If you want to see a movie that's not so explosive, watch Twilight.To me personally, character development is very important in a movie and I believe Pearl Harbor succeeded with this. I grew attached to individuals and felt vulnerable as a member of the audience at the best of times. Absolutely superb watch, and I'd highly recommend it!

Superb! An epic that takes you on a rollercoaster of emotion.,"This movie has been trashed since its release, but is a true epic.  The performances by Affleck, Hartnett, and Kate(who looks like an angel) are all strong and convincing, and the special effects are so realistic that it will make your stomach churn.  It is rare that a film affects me that way this one does.  One minute I was laughing, the next filled with anger, then in awe of the action, and I even cried.  Those who have trashed this movie are the people who go in expecting non-stop action for the entire 3 hours, and those who have labelled it another mindless blockbuster, without giving it a chance.  Don't get me wrong there is PLENTY of action involved, but it is more than just the action that makes the movie.  What makes the movie in my opinion, is the love triangle, and the strength of Raef and Danny's relationship and the situations that life throws at them.(This is coming from a guy, so it is not the chick flick that many label it as.) I have seen this movie twice already, once with my brother and the other with my girlfriend, and we all loved it.  As I said this is a movie for both guys and the girls. While the script isn't anything Oscar worthy, it definitely draws you and keeps your interest, and builds up to a beautiful yet horrific climax, after all, this isn't just a movie about the bombing like many people go in expecting. I was not one of those people so I went in with an open mind and just hoped there was plenty of action throughout the movie(Which there was)  Beckinsale was absolutely georgeous, and perfect for the role of Evelyn the nurse.(After watching her performance, I was glad Charlize Therone did not take the role) I have always been a fan of Affleck and once again he did not disappoint, but the strongest performance was by Josh Hartnett who I have been following closely from his early days in The Faculty, and H20. He really steals the screen every time he is on.(even when sharing it with Affleck)Critics may have blasted this movie, but in my opinion they went in with the frame of mind that they were already going to blast it, so don't take what most of them say about this movie too seriously, and give it a chance, it is definitely the best movie of the summer so far, and has all the makings of an epic.  SO GO AHEAD AND SEE WHAT I AM TALKING ABOUT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT. I know I will enjoy this movie time and time again. (****) out of (****)",7.0,Anonymous,History
The sleeping giant awakens. Awesome blockbuster!,"Even before this movie's release it was hard to hide from. The trailers only hint at the visual spectacle it is. Expertly directed by Michael Bay and written by Randall Wallace, this truly qualifies for epic status with its nearly three and a half hours running time. Outstanding visual effects; the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is ruthless,  relentless and totally chaotic. Hans Zimmer's musical score is grand as it is haunting.The story is a reenactment of one of the most tragic days in America's history, but a lot of the facts are very loosely interpreted. Albeit few can walk away from this movie with total disappointment or a dry eye. Two childhood friends(Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett)learn to fly and go off to join the war and end up falling in love with the same Navy nurse(Kate Beckinsale). The three lead characters are out acted by the brilliant performance of John Voight as President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Alec Baldwin succeeds in making Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle look smug and arrogant. In smaller roles, but notable work in support comes from Cuba Gooding Jr., James King, Mako and Tom Sizemore. Kudos to producer Jerry Bruckheimer for a project well done. Romance, drama, and dynamic war action...PEARL is interesting and enjoyable; a must see.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"I Don't See Why this Movie gets So Much Hate,","Pearl Harbor is a terrific movie with a well developed storyline and a fantastic cast.I really don't understand why this movie gets so much hate,it's a good story and despite the historical inaccuracies,I think it stays true to the events in the way that the characters behave and the drama that develops throughout.Many people complained about the love story,saying that it was unnecessary,but I completely disagree,the development of these three characters and the love and rivalry that occurs makes their story a lot more personal, it is definitely what kept me watching for the whole three hours,it was sweet,romantic and tragic,and I don't think the tragedy at the end would have been any bit as upsetting without this conflict that was shown previously.Ben Affleck,Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett all deliver great performances,they really became these characters and were living in the moment for each scene,there was great chemistry between all three,and despite some of their lines being very cheesy,they certainly didn't deserve Razzie nominations.Where the movie does fall flat is the fact that it tried to be the Titantic of war movies,I get that it was a huge movie at the time and Michael Bay was trying to make his own version of it,but trying to be like another film is never a good mind set for filmmaking and that is certainly a significant part of why many people criticized this movie.It may have a few flaws,but I still had a great time watching Pearl Harbor and certainly didn't consider it a waste of three hours,and would recommend it to anyone looking for a good drama or war film.Follows the lives of two best friends as they enter the war as pilots and both start to fall for the same woman.Best Performance: Kate Beckinsale",8.0,Anonymous,History

I did"", I screamed at her from outside the house, while still getting down from the cab that I took from the cinema. What a great movie it was. The images of the gusty air-force combats and the invasions are still in my head, the sounds of the thunderous cannons still roar in my ears, and the gentlemanliness of the army men, with their uniforms and planes, still leave me grasping for more, as did the jam-packed theater.Why did it have to get over? Why couldn't it last just a tiny bit longer? The sky high aerobatics, the machine guns, the fighter jets, the discipline, the pretty army women, the well ironed suits, the line of command, and the bigger than life climax, I adored it all. The chemistry between the leads is something to look forward too. The unconventional romantic relationship and the intimate scenes between the lovers spice up the movie and give a new twist to the plot.If you want to feel the thrill and the emotion of being at war and love at the same time, of being away from home, of being behind enemy lines, and of leading your country to victory, go and watch Michael Bay's extraordinary take on the events leading up to and involving thereof one of the most disastrous catastrophes of the era.Michael Bay never misses a chance to leave his viewers awestruck with his action packed works, with strands of deadly love. And he did it again with Pearl Harbor.  The movie, though titled Pearl Harbor, is much more than that just the bombings. The war is twofold: between countries and between hearts. Army Air Corps, Affleck and Hartnett, thick as thieves, become the target of a deadly love triangle, with the potential of encompassing their friendship, falling in love with the ever-pretty Evelyn, which results in a love-hate relationship being fired up between the two captains. But Bay has something new to offer rather than the clichéd. Their friendship is tested when they are sent off to war together, resulting in their hatred for each other ultimately turning, or rather returning, into a brotherly bond. The climax is sort of depressing, but that is overcome by the patriotism of winning the war.The motion picture is certainly not for the faint hearted. It is a mixed bag of emotions, and it is one that has many holes in it. The movie takes its audience through a variety of different emotions, starting at a high with love and patriotism, progressing to hatred and anger, and then ending into sorrow and dismal. The movie throughout, holds its viewers onto their seats and unleashes a surprise, a twist, every few frames, bounding them to think on what may follow next.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Historically accurate? No. Entertaining? Pretty much.,"When getting back to the movies of the 2000s we either love and praise them and name some of them cult movies or we absolutely hate them. This movies is neither. Is it a brilliant movie? Not by far! Is it that bad that it deserves the hate? Not at all. It's an entertaining friday night movie with a great music score, pretty good CGI, actually decent acting from our handsome Ben which we all love to hate for different reasons. It's indeed full of cliche romance (but it's a nice love trio there) and it's definitely too long, but I wouldn't say it deserves less than a 7.

The film's three-hour running time is excessive, and the pacing is slow and uneven with overblown action sequences and cheesy dialogue.The film's love story between Affleck and Beckinsale is also underdeveloped and unconvincing.

Garbage...,"The film ""Pearl Harbor"" is a mockery of one of the most horrific days in the history of the United States.Poor acting framed the most pathetic screenplay I've seen in years. The only part of this movie that's worth seeing are the historically inacurate, yet visually beautiful, CG shots from ILM. Absolutely gorgeous. Everything else, the acting, the screenplay, and the the slow-motion, go America, soft focus, Armageddon shots, are all crap.The whole world knows what happened on that day. In every country, in every history classroom, everyone the world over is taught of the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into WWII. It was a tragic event that affected the planet as a whole. Did Michael Bay and his goons actually think they could fool us?I'm insulted. I'm offended.The ordeal of watching is slop reveal itself one frame at a time on the screen before was a punishment that robbed me of eight dollars, three hours of my life, and my dignity.But did this movie about the bombing of Pearl Harbor begin and end with the bombing of Pearl Harbor? No.It began with a simple enough, somewhat romantic, get-to-know-the-characters kind of shpiel, but then that shpiel dragged on, and on, and on. Suddenly, one historical inaccuracy after another broke up the romantic, hour long intro, spotted with poor humor and neat little historical facts (""Do you own that $25,000 figher out there?"" - ooh, this movie is so cool because they did some research and found out that planes cost 25 grand).Then, for almost no reason other than wanting oil, Japan attacks Pearl Harbor because, get this, it's close. Not because of the fleet that's there or anything, just because it's close.In the film Tora Tora Tora, Japan planned and planned and planned, each member of the task force studying up on each and every ship that the United States held in the harbor. In ""Pearl Harbor"", Japan planned for a couple days and pretty much went ahead after their higher officers thought it was pretty much a good idea.And even after the bombing was over (and, again, thoroughly inaccurate), the movie didn't stop. Like a train full of manure, it needs a lot of track to come to a stop. This movie went on.All of the charaters we've so far come to know and dislike, are all still living without a scratch, having literally walked through the thick of the bombing. Everyone's given awards, lots of ceremonies, and then WHAMMO, we're heading to Japan to kick their ass.Please, people. I could go on, but I don't want to. The sun's out, it's a nice day, and I don't want to ruin it with any more talk of the worst film to hit theaters since Battlefield Earth. Spare yourselves, and read a book about the bombing if you absolutely have to get your WWII fix. Otherwise, just live life pretending that this movie never happened.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Pearl Harbor: Movie Review,"'Pearl Harbor' is a wartime drama that was directed by Michael Bay and released in 2001. The scriptwriter who worked on this movie is Randall Wallace. Before this movie, he wrote for such projects as ""Braveheart"" (1995) and ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" (1998). The soundtrack was created by unsurpassed master Hans Zimmer, who also wrote music for ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""The Prince of Egypt"", ""The Dark Knight"", etc. The stars that played the main characters were Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett. In 2003, Kate went on to star in ""Underworld"" and in 2004 she took on a leading role in ""Van Helsing"".On 7th December 1941, Japan launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, where the US Pacific Fleet was situated, leaving the US deeply shocked. It is a movie about war, love, courage and honour.The trailer, which I have personally seen more times than I had expected, really made me, and I hope you, want to watch this movie. The movie length is 3 hours 3 minutes and to my mind, this is just right. You can watch it the whole thing in one go. Moviegoers won't be able to look away from the screen because of the stunning visuals and deep emotions that they'll no doubt feel. Both the main and minor characters are highly convincing and during the whole movie, they effectively engage with each other and what is more, with every member of the audience.

Pearl Harbor: Michael Bay Style,"Pearl Harbor is what Titanic could've been if Michael Bay directed it, cause the similarities are very, well, similar. This one is set during a tragedy, the attack on Pearl Harbor in this case. There's also a love triangle, a very sappy one indeed.My main issue of the movie is well, the love story. It doesn't serve much in a wider context and feels rote and cheesy, it takes up most of the bloated runtime but there's a satisfying conclusion to it at the end. I must say, I wished the script was more focused on the relationship between the Navy's rather than this, it just screams Titanic to me. Other than that I didn't really have much of an issue with the movie besides the laughable script which I had a chuckle from. The cinematography is crisp and wonderful. The performances weren't half-assed unlike other Bay efforts but Ben Affleck was especially wooden here, as wooden as a log. Josh Hartnett fares better here and I found him more interesting. The action sequences here were mostly positives, there were shaky-cam scenes that were distracting but for the most part, it's typical Michael Bay explosions, its fun explosions especially at the attack on Pearl Harbor, the movies' centerpiece and also its biggest strength. It's a forty-minute extravaganza of special effects and signature Michael Bay firework-explosions. It made the movie for me.Im no historian but I found the Japanese reasoning to attack Pearl Harbor especially odd. The context here is that Japan attacked Pearl Harbor because America cut its oil supply. I kept asking myself, would attacking them make the situation better? Does it perhaps, restore the fuel sources?? I don't know, movie never says.Overall, this movie was serviceable, I didn't hate it to the point where I'd start ranting nor did I love it to the point of being infatuated with it. By all means, its decent. Should've focused more on the Navy instead of that goddamn trite love story, the more I talk about it the less I appreciate it.

There's the action for the guys, the love story for the girls, the accurate historical facts for the teachers, and it educates all. It really opens your mind to what happened on December 7, 1941, and it really shows you new points of view. For example, the director and script writer gave the Japanese general a conscience, so that he doesn't seem like the ""evil tyrant"" that some text books classify him to be. The special effects and all of the war scenes are amazingly realistic. Some say that the movie is really ""sappy"" and ""predictable"" but even if that is true, the acting, directing, and music goes together so well that you can't help but get sucked into the movie and cry when they cry, pray when they pray, and laugh when they laugh.

Excellent Cinematography,"Though ""romance"" is not listed in IMDb as one of the genres that fit this film, romantic relationships are central to its story. In fact, the entanglements of those relationships are a distraction.Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) are best friends who fulfilled their childhood dreams to be pilots. With Europe at war, and the U. S. mobilizing on the homefront, the two friends are separated when Rafe joins the RAF in its battle in the skies against Germany.This is a story about more than Pearl Harbor, but the surprise bombing of U. S. naval forces on Oahu is the dramatic focus of the action. The reenactment of the events leading up to the attack, and the actual attack on that Sunday morning, is an impressive achievement. During the attack, we follow the personal actions of the main characters and a group of Navy nurses who are stationed there. The chaos of that morning is captured as well as possible.The aftermath of Pearl Harbor is also part of the story. Historical accuracy is mostly preserved throughout.The acting is fair. One of the strengths of the film is the recreation of the wartime era in sets and artifacts. But the film's best attribute is its cinematography.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Not a bomb, but lots of explosions.","Pearl harborFor Europe, World War II began with Poland's invasion in 1939.  For China, it began eight years earlier with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. While the fighting waged abroad, the United States clung to its isolationist stance in the hope that these ""regional"" conflicts would be decided without them.  This laissez-faire attitude was shattered at 8:00 am on December 7th 1941 with the surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.   While the intention was to immobilize the US fleet before they could become a factor in the Pacific Theater, it instead served to galvanize a nation.True friendship is a rare commodity, something that Danny and Rafe are lucky enough to share.  Friends since childhood, they join the military together to become fighter pilots, find adventure and look after one another. Their relationship is strained by Rafe's decision to join the Eagle Squadron, a unit of the British Air Force filled with American volunteers.  Although upset, Danny tells him to be careful and promises to look after Rafe's newfound girlfriend Evelyn.  They soon discover that love and war are difficult bedfellows.If you skip the entertainment section of the newspaper, don't watch tv , never go to movies and live in a cave, it's possible that you haven't heard of this movie.  Maybe.  With a voluminous cast of name and no name actors, a budget bigger than most films gross, and lots of special effects, this film is going to draw huge crowds for the Memorial Day weekend.  I have no doubt of this.  What I'm curious to see is how the audiences will respond to it.Once again the trailers are deceiving: while there are hints of the romantic nature of the movie, the focus is on the attack of Pearl Harbor and leads you to believe that it will examine the whys and wherefores behind the event.   The bulk of the screen time (and at three hours plus there's a whole lot of it) is devoted to the relationship between the three main characters.   I found it interesting that the marketing campaign in Japan meanwhile stressed this aspect over the action. Enough about the marketing you say, what about the film?Historians and battle aficionados take note - other movies on this subject have been more historically accurate and informational.  This movie is the Coles notes version of the events surrounding the infamous day in question. However, that means it will be more accessible to the casual moviegoer and no one will quibble about the superb special effects sequences (it is often difficult to discern what is a set and what is computer generated).  I was surprised that the battle sequences, originally intended to be as graphic as those in ""Saving Private Ryan"", were considerably toned down.  They opted for hazy dream-like sequences at the hospital that proved to be more disorienting than disturbing.   The attack should have taken a more central role and been introduced sooner - there is little action for the first hour and a half - because younger viewers, and men (okay I'm generalizing here but it's true) will quickly lose interest.   Especially when they have to sit through mushy stuff.  : )While the romantic triangle is captivating (although things become a bit too complex at times - and no I won't give anything away here), the characters have little depth and the actors don't have much to work with.  Ben Affleck is his usual affable self, giving a far better performance that he did in his last romantic lead  (I've always liked him better than his cocky alter ego aka Matt Damon).   Kate Beckinsale (looking remarkably different that she did in ""Brokedown Palace"") acquits herself adequately as the lovelorn lead, and Josh Hartnett, smolders as the fresh new kid  (to me at least - I haven't seen him in anything previously) and demonstrates a modicum of skill along the way.  Others aren't so lucky - Cuba Gooding Jr. barely qualifies as a supporting actor (things have been downhill since the Oscar), and Alec Baldwin has the misfortune to utter some of the worst lines ever written.Ultimately, Pearl Harbor has the elements required to be a summer blockbuster: it's being released at the right time, it has impressive special effects and action sequences, the story is pretty straightforward and it is very American.  That doesn't mean that it's a good movie.  Don't expect too much and it will make for a decent matinee (albeit a long one).",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Good fighting scenes, okay soundtrack, bad inspirational moments...","Allright.. it wasn't as TERRIBLE as I expected, but it wasn't Saving Private Ryan, either.  The actors all seemed to fit their roles with the exception of Alec Baldwin's impression of Jimmy Doolittle.  As Doolittle, Baldwin DID LITTLE.  Jon Voigt was a great FDR, and had most of the jerky movements as our 32nd Prez.  I think that the first 45 minutes could have been a bunch better but what do I expect from Jerry Bruckheimer and his gang?  Cuba Gooding Jr.'s part wasn't really necessary except to appease the NAACP (no offense, but really.. where DOES he fit in?)

"Sappy love story, inaccurate history -- In short, *avoid*","I heard about this film while it was in production. I heard about how they were going to go out of their way to get all the right aircraft to film so things would look right. I heard how they wanted everything to look as authentic as possible. I heard that the movie would somehow encompass the Battle of Britain, Pearl Harbor, and the Doolittle Raid (??? - an early warning sign). I heard that they were going to stage the premiere on an aircraft carrier moored in Pearl Harbor, for an audience of Second World War veterans. They even managed to get one of the veterans attending the premiere to say complimentary things about the movie. I knew that special effects technology had advanced enormously since 1970, allowing the filming of things that would have been impossible in the previous big-budget movie about Pearl Harbor, Tora Tora Tora.So I thought ""Given all this, how bad can it be?"".The answer, unfortunately, is AWFUL. This may not be Hollywood at its worst, but it's pretty close.I don't know the origin of the phrase ""Titanic with bombs"" for describing this film, but it's pretty apt. One difference is that Bay and Bruckheimer together don't add up to James Cameron. Both films feature trite, sappy, predictable love stories (with every chestnut in the Hollywood Cliché guide clearly in evidence) layered over a real-life, tragic event. However, although I don't particularly like Titanic, I have some respect for Cameron's success in reproducing the appearance of the RMS Titanic and the events of the Titanic sinking on screen. I am prepared to watch Titanic (while fast-forwarding over the love story bits) just to see the history parts.Pearl Harbor fails this test. The portion of the film featuring the attack on Pearl Harbor comes off like a video game -- Lots of sound and fury, but no realism whatsoever. The problem here is that this is not only a real event, but an event of pivotal importance in the history of the United States. Worse yet, the event is still within living memory. How will we feel in 2061, when a director decides to make a movie about September 11, 2001, and casually re-arranges the events of that day to make the resulting film ""more entertaining/more commercial/more appealing to mass audiences""? Do you feel sick even contemplating that possibility? That's how I suspect that veterans of the actual attack on Pearl Harbor feel about this movie. The late Brigadier General Kenneth Taylor, one of the pilots who did in real life what Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett portray on screen described the film as ""a piece of trash...over-sensationalized and distorted.""Watch Tora Tora Tora instead. It's not perfect, but it's a pretty accurate telling of what really happened at Pearl Harbor. (Tellingly, Tora, Tora, Tora used veterans like General Taylor as advisers to make sure that they got most of the details right). A newer film with improved special effects is not necessarily a better film.",1.0,Anonymous,History

The nature of the mission and how it played out could easily support a love story without being garish.Plus, the Doolittle Raid deserves its own feature, not tacked onto the end of a movie like a forgotten coda.",2.0,Anonymous,History
"A good, entertaining movie.  Don't expect Saving Private Ryan though...","I think the reason many critics hated Pearl Harbor is that they went into it expecting Saving Private Ryan.  Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor is no SPR. Then what is Pearl Harbor, you ask?  It's a popcorn movie.  No, it's not a war movie in the traditional sense.  No, it is not a great movie in any sense of the word.  It is an entertaining movie, and I heavily enjoyed it.First off the bat, I'll discuss some of the bad stuff.  I didn't like how the movie started.  There are no opening credits, just a short cut of the title.  The opening, in my picky opinion, was too short.  I think that they could have slowed it down and made it a bit more dramatic.  Oh well, this will do.Problem number 2: While some parts of the movie move too quickly, other parts move too slowly.  Many of the romantic scenes are nice, but they draw on for too long.Next Problem: There isn't much here that you haven't seen before in terms of character in story.  I could have (and did) predict the entire movie before hand.  The story is that cliché.Okay, another problem: This movie didn't take enough opportunities.  There are so many stories involving Pearl Harbor, that I was disappointed that the never told any of them.  Well, they did tell of Doris 'Dorie' Miller, the first black man to receive the silver cross.  But there are so many other stories.  The USS Nevada tried to make a run for it out of the harbor and got shot to death.  I think that would have been great.  Another historic disappointment to me was the USS Arizona.  Correct me if I'm wrong (please), but I read in a book that a torpedo hit the ballast tanks (or what-have-you) underneath the Arizona, causing a massive explosion that shot the ship into a 90 degree angle with the water.  It sat there, pointing into the sky for ten or twelve minutes then crashed back down into the water.  The Virginia or the Utah, I cannot remember which one, was connected to the Arizona, making repairs to it when the Japs rolled in.  When the Arizona shot up like spring, the repair ship was thrown like a toy boat into the shore, where it landed face down in the mud.  There are so many chances this movie could have taken, but sadly, this isn't Spielberg quality.  Oh, and please, I don't want anyone crying about the historical accuracy.  I know some things are fictional in this movie, but Lawrence of Arabia and Gladiator are filled with made up crap, so stop your bellyaching.Final problem: the movie is too long for its own good.  After the tragic happenings of Pearl Harbor, the movie goes to the Dolittle bombing of Japan. I think it would have been better just to end the movie at Pearl Harbor.Okay, the good stuff.  This movie has the best special effects of the year (at least so far).  Some special effects range from spectacular/photo-realistic to something I could have made in PhotoShop.  But, when they're good, hot damn, they're good.Another good point is the movie is very entertaining.  I can't really explain how, it just is.Well then, next point: this movie will get your patriotic blood pumping like never before.  Well, at least since you saw SPR.  Lots of people said Gibson's The Patriot made them feel proud to be an American.  Well, I never liked that movie, and let me tell you, when our boys start fighting back against the enemy, I have never felt so proud.In conclusion, Pearl Harbor is not a great movie.  But it is a good movie. If anyone hates this movie, they cannot call themselves Americans.  As a film critic of sorts, I admit the movie has a lot of problems.  Hell, that's an understatement.  This is a mess of a movie, and yes, it could have been much better.  But see this movie for what it is: a fun popcorn flick.  I still can't believe people expected this movie to be Spielberg material. I mean, really, this is Jerry Brockhiemer and Michael Bay.  These guys made The Rock, Topgun, and Armaggedon.  What the hell do you expect from people who have never made a serious movie in their lives?   I laugh at you.If you want a realistic war movie in the Pacific, just wait a few years. Steven Spielberg has bought the rights to the great, GREAT book, Flags of our Fathers, which is the true story of the six guys raising the flag on Iwa Jima.  I hope that he makes it, because it will be one hell of a movie.Rating: 6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Great Special Effects. Not so good story line.,"Before I went to see this movie I heard that the reviews were going to be not so good for it.  Friday I read the paper and it was excactely as I thought ,but since I don't like critics even though I have become one.  I said I am going to see it.  I did and I agree with the critics this time. First of all the Special Effects were absoultely awsome.  I mean this is one of those movies where it is very hard to tell the anything digitaly created. It was just so great.. The plot is were I had problems It seemed that Ben Afflek and Josh Hartnet seemed to get into Every single major battle out of coincedence... Don't get me wrong it was good but it's not worth the hype.Grade 8/10",7.0,Anonymous,History
From Here To Stupidity,"First, the errata: Dorie Miller wouldn't have been flirting with Evelyn.Dorie Miller died on a ship a few years after the attack and received his medal posthumously. He did, however, fire the 50-cal and it is believed he shot down one or two planes. His captain also survived in real life.Oh yeah, people smoked. A lot. They also played poker.No nurses died in the attack.The Doolittle raid was tidied up for Hollywood.While factual, I still do not believe that Jon Voight could ever have sired Angelina Jolie, but give the man props for his creation. His acting? He said it best in the movie, after the attack: ""How bad?"" It is true that America scrambled a few fighter jets and shot down a few Japanese planes. This may have been one of the reasons that the third wave was called off (Japan suffered 29 casualties).The plot? The first half is ""From Here To Eternity"" while the second is Tora Tora Tora. The action scenes of the attack, which run a full twenty minutes, save the film. You really get a feel for what it was like to be bombed like that. Where the film almost, but not quite, perishes, is how it attempts to insert a chick-flick into a war movie. The result is what I imagine it would taste like to mix milk and orange juice, two things which are fine on their own but not pleasant when combined.The movie's other main strength was in its portrayal of the Japanese as an honorable nation that felt it had to conduct this war to preserve its place in the world. We have certainly done this ourselves, and the film also captured the sense of total victory experienced by the Japanese pilots, many of whom are now interviewed for documentaries on the war. One cannot help but respect the efficiency of the attack, including how the Japanese altered their torpedoes so they could navigate the shallow waters of Pearl Harbor. Without question, we got our tails kicked good, and from a military standpoint, it was one of the most lopsided battles of all time.The movie chose to end with the Doolittle raid, but it would have been smarter to give minor screen time to that attack, and more to the role it played in our winning the Battle of Midway, which was the true turning point of the war. That battle was won by mere seconds, as our bombers beat the refueling Japanese bombers to the attack by a whisker.The film is a good way to show a historical event to a young audience that can smooth out the inaccuracies in the history books or on the internet. The cast could have been stronger, but Affleck (Rafe), Hartnett (Danny), and Beckinsale (Evelyn) do not drop the ball while carrying the film. Jennifer Garner as the mousy Sandra was an interesting performance, especially in light of her future stardom. Dan Akroyd as the decoder was convincing as only he can be. It was good to see an SNL alum play his role well in such a big-budget feature.Watch it on cable if you're an adult, and keep the DVD around for the children for when they have a history bug. At 3:20, they'll be occupied all evening.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Overblown rubbish, don't bother","I had the displeasure of seeing this in the cinema in 2001. I got free tickets somehow, I think I won them in a raffle or something.Had I known it was going to be this bad, you couldn't have paid me to see it. I have seen it a couple of times on TV since and have sat through parts of it due to sheer boredom, a mistake I am unlikely to repeat while I still have full control of my cognitive faculties. This film is shallow, historically inaccurate, dumb, loud and jingoistic. It's an insult to the Americans, the Japanese, and the film industry. John Wayne's guilt at dodging the draft caused him to churn out war movies that are more watchable than this turkey. The acting is woeful and the characters are paper thin. Affleck and Hartnett mumble through their performances.Alec Baldwin has a few good lines as Jimmy Doolittle, but he's wasting his time here. Beckinsale is underfed eye-candy. Cuba Gooding Jr plays Token Black Guy, and the normally watchable and engaging John Voight is reduced to a caricature of FDR.The attack on Pearl itself is kinda shoehorned in there as an afterthought, oh yeah we've spent 2 hours doing this love story, we might as well put some ships blowing up while we're at it. There are some good VFX in the attack sequence, but slick graphics and explosions do not make a film. Oh wait, I forgot, Michael Bay directed this, didn't he. Oh well.

"With this budget, an astonishing lack of star power","Well, Industrial Light & Magic certainly earned their fees on this one. The battle sequences are truly something to behold. But that still leaves almost 2 hours of movie to sit through. The framing story is OK, but simply doesn't match the rest of the film. There is, for the most part, no one on screen that demands attention. That has that special something, that charm, that charisma, that makes you unable to tear your eyes away from the screen. That thing I call star power. This lack is amazing in a film with this kind of budget. Affleck doesn't have it. Josh Hartnett has it even less so. Kate Beckinsale, while very pretty, and a good actress, doesn't have it either. Jon Voight was kind of an odd special case in this film, with his heavy make-up, he didn't look at all like Jon Voight. But he didn't look at all like Roosevelt, either. Now, Alec Baldwin, as much as it pains me to say it, does have it. But he wasn't in the film long enough to make up for the rest of the cast. The definitive Pearl Harbor movie is still ""Tora, Tora, Tora."" (And for the last part, ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"") I gave this one a 6 just due to the amazing visuals in the battle scenes, but if not for that, it would have been a 5.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Cliched, predictable, over-patriotic, riddled with historical inaccuracies...but spectacularly entertaining!","Yes, ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" is a better Pearl Harbor film.Yes, it was ridiculous they shoehorned the Doolittle Raid into the movie so America scored a victory - five months of real time covered in about five minutes of film.Yes, ""Pearl Harbor"" was chock-full of historical inaccuracies.Yes, the acting from all and sundry was wooden (putting it mildly), the characters were cliched beyond words and the plot was predictable as all get-out. (Who couldn't see, like, everything coming?) Not to mention unbelievable at (many) times.Despite all of that, Pearl Harbor was thoroughly entertaining.The Japanese attack sequences, though admittedly full of historical inaccuracies, was spectacular. Michael Bay can do big-time action sequences in his sleep. He's the best. The GOAT, if you will. This sort of thing is right in his wheelhouse, and he doesn't let the side down.Hans Zimmer's score was brilliant. Faith Hill's anthemic ""There You'll Be"" was good, too.The visuals from start to finish were epic, whether it was New York City, the Battle of Britain, the Pearl Harbor Raid, the Doolittle Raid or any scene featuring planes and Kate Beckinsale.Check your credulity at the door.

The Film just doesn't work!,"Yet another piece of hollywood drivel by Ben Affleck - the actor who can't seem to find another Oscar hit after ""Good Will Hunting"" or a performance that would actually challenge him (Chasing Amy). Pearl Harbor was a movie whose whole purpose is to try to please as many people as possible, and fails to do that on all fronts. While a lot of the big details ARE historically accurate (The lipstick, Cuba Gooding Jr's character, the fact that two planes DID get off the ground to fight back at Pearl Harbor, and other small things) the story just doesn't really ""take off"". Without spoiling the movie, one can say that the love triangle portrayed was a typical hollywood romance with no dynamics.  Invariably, anyone who's seen a romance can see where the romance will head. The battle scenes show gratuitous violence.  There were many more explosions in the movie than there probably were in Pearl Harbor or Tokyo. And, as it turns out, Dan Ackroyd gives the most convincing performance... and he's monotonous, with only a few lines! Also, while there are several scenes that seem to skip around, and are used to portray the plot and describe the history (ie, FDR standing, the Japanese planning the battles), it also distracts from the movie.  They even try to portray the movie from the viewpoint of the Nipponese, by having a ""voiceover"" read the letter than one of the Nipponese pilots is writing home. In the end, I gave this film 6.  Generous, because of the somewhat historical value... The movie itself goes nowhere for 3 hours.  They tried to do a Titanic/Saving Private Ryan... but in the end, they got the worst of both movies.

How USA entered into the 2nd World War,"Although the film showed a sentimental story of love triangle I see it more as valuable for the scenes related to the attack of Japan in Pearl Harbor and the events previous to it than for the sentimental story of those young persons. Pearl Harbor was a criminal act where the Japanese used all strategic weapons including the surprise factor. This is well shown in the film as well as the way the Japanese prepared and accomplished this aggression. Another aspects touched were that US hesitated to enter into the war while the allies like UK were already fighting against German nazis, that some experts in US were even able to guess the aggression of Pearl Harbor but not considered possible, the way president Roosevelt reacted to the aggression and the way he compelled his army to respond. From this point of view the film is highly valuable while the sentimental story is perhaps much better than the one shown in ""From here to eternity"".",7.0,Anonymous,History
Alert! This is a raid on history accuracy! This is no drill!,"You heard me people! If you're an history buff looking for authenticity , this movie is not for you.Indeed, it seems obvious that making an history movie was not the intention of Michael Bay at all. Many of the historical facts of that dreadful day have been overlooked or deliberately tweaked. I can cite the Eagle squadron, the one Rafe flew with during the battle of Britain , which is pure fiction or the fact that both heroes are able to switch from fighter pilots to Bomber ones in a blink of an eye which was a good one. So if you are only looking for authenticity, I should suggest you to watch movies like Tora!Tora!Tora! instead which are far more accurate.But it has also its moments and besides those flaws, this movie is very entertaining and enjoyable to see. Some of the scenes will glue yourself to your seat with their beautiful shots and action. The Attack on the fleet itself is masterfully done for example. The 30 minutes long part is truly breathtaking both visually and orally. Michael Bay is a master in this area and he proves it once again with that masterpiece. It has now become a classic on YouTube and it's deserved.Now as a romantic girl, I couldn't help myself being moved by the love story between the characters. Sure the dialogues are more than cheesy sometimes but it's touching anyway and will make you smile. It's also not the most original story I've ever seen but it's entertaining and enjoyable to see so who cares! I remember crying at the end of the movie especially the last scene which was heartbreaking.So leave the history out and enjoy the movie. It may not be the perfect flick but it's not a bad one neither. If you are forgiving about the historic mishaps, you will like it.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Michael Bay is a hack!,"This movie robs the day of it's historical importance and replaces it with an incredibly annoying love triangle. The dialogue is laughable.

Tora!"" for a more intelligent, comprehensive, passionate, and ultimately more fulfilling movie about Pearl Harbor. Remember: Michael Bay = action tripe.",1.0,Anonymous,History
A lost romantic age of fleeting unity,"Is Pearl Harbor the most unfairly panned movie in the last few decades? I'd say so.You have to put yourself in their shoes. They had no internet back then, only each other and what they made out of it. Everything was more concrete and immediate, you knew what the stakes were and what you had to do.I just love the cultural atmosphere of this movie. Both men and women can appreciate the romantic angle of this film.I also like the juxtaposition of the personal wholesome folks with the high-level incompetent strategic action. These guys and gals didn't know what they were up for. But they had class, and handled their tribulations with with grace. When Evelyn is suddenly forced to judge who is to receive care and who is beyond it, it hits hard.Technically, the CGI is seamless (even today). The real planes? Fantastic. The cinematography is excellent, enhancing the characters' feelings (the cockpit shots are well used here). The air battles and the sound of the fighters bring out the goosebumps. The dogfights are the most exciting ever put on film.Hans Zimmer's music elevates each scene yet again.I'm not sure where the low scores of yesteryear were borne out of. The culmination of materialism of the 90s resulting in the cynicism of the 2000s? I think the film critics of then (and now) just hate anything wholesome and nationalistic.Whatever the reason, with the utter disaster Hollywood has become, we have to seek greatness from decades ago.As a history buff, the only thing I wish they had fixed was to not use modern destroyers and carriers in the establishing shots as it breaks the immersion a little bit (the green screens in the bombers are actually real). I'm sure they could've replaced them with believable CGI like they did with the rest of it.But the story and characters are sill great.

Pearl Harbor,"After about half an hour, I started to wonder if this film was going to take as long to get going as a pearl takes to form in an oyster! It's a close run thing, as it must be around eighty minutes in before the Japanese come to the rescue of the audience and introduce some action into this over-long and dreary romance. Certainly it is all handsomely presented with Ben Affleck (""Rafe"") at his most swarthy as he gets it to together with ""Evelyn"" (Kate Beckinsale). Having put us through the usual ""how to get the girl"" shenanigans, though, he heads off to the UK to help in the Battle of Britain. It's from here that reports reach her that he has been killed. Enter his best friend ""Danny"" (Josh Hartnett) who tries to console her before, well you can guess the rest. You can also easily guess that Affleck was being paid way too much money to be out before the fighting began in earnest, so back he duly arrives and a yawn-making love triangle takes over the plot. When we finally do start to focus on the events of December 7th, 1941, the action partially redeems this film. Twenty minutes of a quickly paced depiction of the meticulously planned destruction of the US Pacific fleet that caused mayhem and carnage upon their ill-prepared quarry. The creative use of CGI and intricate photography illustrate well both the human catastrophe as well as the significant destruction of materiel. Of course, our two survive and together with their erstwhile CO ""Doolittle"" (Alec Baldwin) are drafted into the retaliation plan than involves a perilous, long range, bombing attack on Tokyo to demonstrated that they still have the capacity for potent response. This is two films, really, and I much preferred the later stages. Even then, though, it has a shockingly poor script and the characterisations are weak and undercooked. The technology is used well, but that's about all I can say for this sentimental and meandering offering.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Epic Failure!!!,"OK the action sequences were fantastic, the music was wonderful and gripping, the Pearl Harbor attack was intense. It was, at many points, very emotional and made me a bit teary eyed because I felt for all the brave men and women who died on that fateful day in December 1941. Now let's get down to why this movie failed miserably:1.) First off, the movie is way too damn long, I mean, Jesus, one would have to spend half a day watching it as the makers failed to edit many scenes that didn't need to be in the film.2.) Historical inaccuracies are everywhere. Little and small. I read a list of all the inaccuracies in this movie and I couldn't possibly write all of them down in this review. That's how bad this film is. If you'd like to know what these inaccuracies are, check out Wikipedia and search Pearl Harbor (film). Trust me, the list of historical inaccuracies is long.3.) Waste of talent: Tom Sizemore, Jon Voight, Alec Baldwin, and Jennifer Garner are given relatively minor roles in the film.4.) This is what really upset me. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, I thought it would be about the events leading up to that fateful day. In fact, it's about a cheesy love triangle. A LOVE TRIANGLE! This entire movie is centered around three shallow characters surrounded by characters just as annoying as they are. The Pearl Harbor attack doesn't come till the middle of the movie. There isn't much attention given to the events that lead to the attack, just these cliché characters. Pearl Harbor just seemed to get in the way. This is like a cheesy soap opera or a World War II version of Titanic. I mean, how much more cliché can it get?5.) The Pearl Harbor attack was an intense, action-packed sequence, but even that was incredibly flawed. First off, why is there a pee-wee baseball game being played so early in the morning? Second, when Hartnett and Affleck get up in the air, it seems like they shoot down about 20 planes. In reality, the Japanese air losses were at a bare minimum. Third, there is too much emphasis on CGI effects. Fourth, it really made me laugh when a group of about 5 men went up into a tower and shot down an enemy fighter with rifles and automatic rifles ..... right... Damn they must have had good accuracy.6.) Kenneth M. Taylor is a legendary hero of Pearl Harbor. He was one of two pilots who got into fighter planes and began engaging and shooting down Japanese planes. The other pilot was his friend, George Welch, Affleck and Hartnett depicted the pair. Taylor called this film ""A Piece of trash, over-sensationalized & distorted"". This was a man who was there and did these heroic feats, so you can't take his opinion lightly. This is proof that this film is a disgrace to our veterans.Overall, this movie was a huge disappointment. If you are going to do a movie about Pearl Harbor, then do it right! Seriously! Thousands of good men tragically died that day in one of the most defining moments of American History and they make a movie centered around fake characters and a cheesy love story. Michael Bay, whether you realize this or not, I think you disgraced a lot of WWII veterans. This film had so much potential and ultimately failed to deliver something spectacular that could have had a major impact in film. My recommendation: watch Tora! Tora! Tora! A far more faithful retelling of the Pearl Harbor attack. Pearl Harbor had a large budget, but at least Tora! Tora! Tora! Had heart.",3.0,Anonymous,History

Affleck who im my opinion is a brilliant actor and a great action star really shines in this movie. But the movie really belongs to the other two stars Beckinsale who i must admit was excellent even though i have never seen any of her movies.  But of my favourite and up and coming actors Josh Hartnett who i thought was brilliant in both Halloween H2O and The Faculty really shines here and hopefully will promote him into the a list.A lot was said about the boring first hour but i thought the first hour really went with lighting pace. A lot was made of the effects and they were absoultely brilliant but instead of making this just a effects movie they have added well rounded characters a interesting storyline and the effects add to the overall movie making it a real joy to watch.

Pearl Harbor evades political analysis of the causes of the 1941 attack and presents an amazing visual spectacle. Pure enterteinment.,"Only a director like Michael Bay could turn the tragic Japanese attack on the US naval base at Pearl Harbor during World War II into pure entertainment. Despite having declared on numerous occasions that his new film would be a ""tribute""to the thousands of men and women killed on that occasion, the filmmaker seems to have given up on his noble purpose and decided to stick to the genre that consecrated him: that of inconsequential action, absurd and full of clichés. On the one hand, it's impossible to deny that the director was successful, as Pearl Harbor is truly an entertaining film; on the other hand, it's a shame to think that ""fun"" was the most he could get out of such a brutal event.The story takes place in 1941, when Europe is already at war, but the United States is not yet. European leaders accuse President Roosevelt (very well played by Jon Voight, in a very convincing makeup) of being on the fence. Meanwhile, Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), an American pilot who from the early days of his life spends all his time alongside Danny Walker (rookie Josh Hartnett), his best friend and also a recruit in the Yankee Air Force. Rafe falls madly in love with the beautiful nurse Evelyn (the English Kate Beckinsale).An expert pilot, Rafe is invited to fight on the European front, on the side of the British, as the Americans continue to stay out of the conflict. Much to Evelyn's dismay, Rafe accepts the invitation and - literally - goes into battle. Needless to say, the beautiful nurse is serving the army right at the Pearl Harbor military base in Hawaii. From then on, a lot of water will roll under the aircraft carriers, as every good student of history knows that on December 7, 1941, Japan launched a mega attack on Pearl Harbor, killing more than 2,000 Americans and finally causing the departure of the USA from the fence of war.In fact, the entire plot that revolves around the love triangle starring Affleck, Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett is impressively obvious, never involving the viewer due to its schematic development and stereotyped characterizations. In fact, I venture to say that this 'love affair' couldn't matter less, since its resolution (bad, by the way) causes only indifference in the audience. Much more interesting is the relationship between two secondary characters, the stutterer Red (Ewen Bremner) and the nurse Betty (James King), but unfortunately, the film doesn't seem to realize this, preferring to focus on the rivalry between friends Rafe and Danny - which, by the way, is simply ignored at the conclusion of the story.Precisely for all the fantasy created in ""Pearl Harbor"", the story is hidden, the bombing carried out a year later in Tokyo, minimized, and the United States - as in other super productions such as ""Independence Day"" and ""Born on the 4th of July"". - comes out as victim and hero. Despite all the criticism that the film received at the time of its release, it is worth mentioning its positive points: one of them is, without a doubt, the ability to keep the viewer entertained during its three hours, despite the wait of almost an hour for the juicy attacks. Japanese to the US Navy. The misfortune is such that, to avoid too strong a shock, the scenes in which thousands of people are taken to the only hospital in Pearl Harbor are made out of focus.Like Roland Emmerich and Peter Hyams, Bay has a habit of always putting special effects above the story he intends to tell. Thus, the characters and situations present in the Pearl Harbor script serve as a mere excuse for the filmmaker to fill the viewer's eyes with explosions, planes and other digital feats created by the wizards of Industrial Light & Magic. In fact, even screenwriter Randall Wallace declared, in a recent interview, that his script was radically altered by Michael Bay and his patron, producer Jerry Bruckheimer, claiming not to be responsible for the bad dialogues present in the film (at one point, for example, Ben Affleck's character tells the nurse played by Kate Beckinsale that he is in pain, and she replies, ""It's your nose that hurts."" Affleck's inspired response: ""No, it's my heart.""The screenplay by Randall Wallace (Braveheart) was also accused of being boastful and superficial, with the same defending himself against the accusations alleging creative differences with the director, which ended up harming the final result of his work. Moments like when General Doolitle (Baldwyn) says they'll win the war because of ""volunteer heroes like them"" get to be embarrassing, and even the actor's charisma doesn't make up for it. Not to mention the utopian final speech, which shocks due to the lack of commitment to the reality of the facts and summarizes the American ""victory"" in the 2nd world war to the success of a small group of marines in a suicide mission that carried out a surprise attack on a military base in Tokyo, which had little or no influence on this whole scenario (and facts such as the cowardly US nuclear attack on Iroshima and Nagasaki are totally ignored). Leaving the production's boastful ideology aside, Pearl Harbor presents itself as an efficient example of popcorn cinema (it remains Bay's best work in the direction), with remarkable moments, grandiose action scenes and a visual to fill your eyes.On the other hand, the film takes on a new lease of life during the sequence that illustrates the attack on Pearl Harbor. Extremely realistic, this is the high point of the projection, binding the viewer to the chair thanks to the fantastic visual effects and the electrifying direction of Michael Bay (always competent from an aesthetic point of view), who makes the most of John Schwartzman's beautiful photography and the excellent sound editing performed by the team of Christopher Boyes (the same as Titanic). In addition, the director also manages to maintain a good atmosphere of tension during the final act of the plot, which recreates the bombing of Tokyo commanded by the heroic General Doolittle (Alec Baldwin).In fact, heroism is a recurring theme in the filmmaker's filmography - and, therefore, there is not a single character who behaves differently in Pearl Harbor. In this way, it is practically impossible to analyze the performances of the members of the cast of this production, since they all invest in the virile and stoic side of their characters. Even so, it is worth mentioning the beautiful performances of Cuba Gooding Jr. And Jon Voight, who steal the (few) scenes in which they appear (plus, it's always good to see Dan Aykroyd in more serious roles).Following the wave of ""political correctness"", Pearl Harbor evades political analysis of the causes of the 1941 attack and seeks to avoid even showing too much blood on screen (with the clear aim of reducing its censorship and increasing its audience). With that, the war illustrated by Michael Bay becomes relatively innocuous and - except for the adrenaline of the action scenes - it never manages to provoke the spectator's reflection. Patriots aside (and the film is full of them), Pearl Harbor ends up arousing a feeling that violence may be necessary, as the audience is made to cheer during the American retaliation to the Japanese. And this is the film's biggest sin: unlike the wonderful Saving Private Ryan, which accurately illustrated the horrors and unjustifiable savagery of war, Pearl Harbor glamorizes this type of conflict, as if we should all scream ""Yes"" right now. In which Tokyo is bombed. The impression that remains is that Bay and company were filming the sequel to Armageddon. After all, for Americans, seeing their country destroyed is seeing the end of the world. There again Affleck and his heroism, a beautiful brunette (who even physically remember Liv Tyler) and a love story that will change the world.It is unfortunate, however, that American producers have not yet managed to combine technique with content, special effects with filmic sensibility, computers with cinematographic language. It is clearly perceived in Pearl Harbor the intention to be understandable and consumable by all and any type of public, leveling the story down and eliminating any detail that might not be intelligible to the great mass of the movie ticket consumer population. At the end of practically three hours of projection, the feeling of waste remains. The clear impression that Jerry Bruckheimer and his colleagues, seeking only and exclusively the easy box office, missed a great chance to go down in the history of cinema.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Romanticised war movie.,"Having watched this movie I thought that it was ok, it wasn't amazing but it did have a lot of action which made the cringy romanticised war movie that little bit more watchable. I think that the love triangle between the 3 main cast did make this movie that little less epic just because I think the action scenes are great which is a speciality of Michael Bay. I do think that this movie didn't need to be 3 hours long, I think this movie did focus on the love triangle a bit too long. I would recommend if you have enough time to watch however I don't think this movie is a need to watch unless you like dramatic romance.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood At Its Worst,"I wasted three hours of my life watching this crap . Sure as hell I won`t be wasting too much time writing a long review .I hated this movie , it`s so full of anachronisms and cliches and I`m so glad everyone else has pointed them out , but the two ones that made me laugh were Josh Hartnett announcing "" World War Two has just started "" . Hey since the second world war started more than two years before in September 1939 you just know this is from an American ( Read Hollywood ) perspective , not that it was called "" World War Two "" for a considerable time afterwards , and the scenes where Gooding Jnr bellows "" Yo who`s da man ? "" Yo right on bro you zap those Jap mofos with your 90s street vocabulary . Most excellent dudeI did like the bit where Ben Affleck screams "" Get me into a goddamn plane "" because I thought the producers and screenwriter had used up every cliche in the book by that point. Nice to be proved wrong , though I don`t think I`ll be proved wrong when I say Affleck will never win an Oscar for his acting ability .My heart had a nice little holiday when I found out this flopped both commercially and critically . Maybe now the Hollywood system can concentrate on making films with good scripts and little FX before they bankrupt themselves .

Frighteningly Realistic Depiction of the Attack on Pearl Harbor,"""Pearl Harbor"" re-creates the Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. The battle scenes using convincing miniatures, blended in with the latest in state of the art computer animation, give us a frighteningly realistic depiction of the that attack. The effects are so convincing that you believe that you are watching the real thing.But Hollywood makes the same mistake it made with that other epic, ""Titanic"" (1997)..it tacks on yet another syrupy love story. This time there is a love triangle involving Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett as gung ho pilots and Kate Beckinsale as a nurse. As in all love triangles with a war theme, you know that one of the principals will pay the ultimate sacrifice.The love story dominates the first hour of the film and drags on far too long. Once the attack begins we are treated to some of the most realistic battle scenes ever put on the screen. We are also made to feel the pain of the men and women who sacrificed their lives that day.The leads are OK however, the film would not have suffered too much had the love story been minimized. There also is a long list of familiar faces in small cameo type roles. Cuba Gooding Jr. stands out as the first black man to win the Navy Cross, Jon Voight does a good FDR, Mako is the Japanese Commander, Alec Baldwin plays the a pilot commander and Dan Aykroyd and Scott Miller turn up in other roles.All in all ""Pearl Harbor"" gets a passing mark based on its awesome battle scenes, but looses points for the over-long love story. Imagine the film that could have been had they filmed the attack around a story such as ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953).",7.0,Anonymous,History

good film,"It's been a little while since I've seen Pearl Harbor, but I have to comment on the special effects. The special effects portion of the film was striking. The part when the bomb hits the USS Arizon and literally blows it out of the water and in two, now that spectacular special effects. As for the flying portion of the film, when Affleck volunteers for duty with the Royal Air Force, I thought the action scenes were really good. This movie could have been a great chick flick if there wasn't so much violence. I gave this movie a 7. Mostly because I was in the service and saw how much was added to make it seem more realistic. The three main characters, Affleck, Hartnett, and Beckinsale were good. I just couldn't see Baldwin, a huge pacifist, playing a hero like Lt. Col. Doolittle. They could have found someone better to fit the role.",7.0,Anonymous,History

The only other thing I can say is to quote Col. Kenneth Taylor, one of the pilots the characters portrayed by Affleck and Hartnett were based on. Col. Taylor said of the film, ""a piece of trash ...over-sensationalized and distorted"". Tora! Tora!

A friendship that even war will not break,"The first magnificent shots of the film ""Pearl Harbor"" are set up in a romantic mood, and the music of maestro Hans Zimmer is creepy. A great story of two friends who, since childhood, dreamed of becoming pilots and plowing the clouds, seeing sunsets from a bird's-eye view and defending their country. The film will give the viewer 3 hours of excellent video, gorgeous music, memorable special effects and, of course, a dramatic story.Director Michael Bay has always been famous for his ability to stage epic pictures well. His handwriting is easily recognizable thanks to the cool picture and attention to detail. Bay took up the real story of the Japanese army's military attack on Hawaii, when the entire Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor was destroyed. This is a sad page in the history of the United States, as well as another demonstration of the treacherous attack of the aggressor, the like of which the world has already seen in June of the same 1941 by Nazi Germany in relation to the USSR.It is always difficult to film historical events. It is even more difficult to fit the colorful history of people into them. Yes, so that the viewer really believes, and even more difficult, so that the characters fall in love. The film succeeds in everything. Here is a representation of many historical facts, real people and participants of those events, excellent motivation of the heroes who suddenly realized that their strong and seemingly indestructible country suddenly becomes broken on the western front. And by whom. Those who assured of their friendship and the absence of aggression.The director skillfully narrates about those events from several participants at once. Famous historical figures and ordinary soldiers and officers appear in the frame. Bay tells important stories of people in several additional storylines (for example, the story of the dark-skinned cook Doris Miller, who did not flinch at the crucial moment and showed himself properly).Bay's film is a patriotic movie that is designed to remind, first of all, the Americans themselves, as well as the whole of humanity, that it is possible to fall heavily at the hands of the enemy, but also to become stronger, because there are necessarily those who will lead the rest, set an example and help not only survive, but also win in the war by joint efforts with the allies.But still, the main story of the film is the story of two friends and love for a girl. A very complicated story, where there are no rightists and guilty. There is a confluence of circumstances and a bitter regret that it happens this way and not otherwise. The story is complicated, but instructive. It teaches you to love, to be true friends, to seek peace even in war, to go to the end and always remain human.""Pearl Harbor"" is an unforgettable film from the master of visual Michael Bay. Excellent shooting of battle scenes, bright and sad moments of the war, which are shown in a big way. But more importantly, in my opinion, the authors managed to show the story of ordinary people with their problems of love, with their experiences and with how they learned to live, losing loved ones. This hardened them and made them stronger. And the film itself inspires and teaches in our seemingly peaceful time to remain human, to love, to be friends and to look to the future with hope.10 out of 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Quintessential Hollywood Big production,"Pearl HarborPearl Harbor is Hollywood at its most ambitious. From glossy photography, beautiful wide-angle shots, eye-widening special effects and exceptionally good-looking people playing the lead characters, it offers a lot of eye candy to those who are willing to sit through the long movie. In fact, it reminds me of a big cake with a recipe in which the makers tried to include all the tried-and-true ingredients of a commercially successful movie: visual treats, humor, drama, action and a story involving love, passion, friendship, vengeance and a good dose of patriotism. It almost seems as if director Michael Bay wanted to challenge the audience with all these elements to be entertained by a movie twice the length of a typical feature without lapsing into boredom.  If that was the challenge then he succeeded: it was entertaining, it really did not feel like three hours, and I, at least, did not feel bored at any time during the movie.My impression is that most of the negative reviews are critical of the movie because they are looking for something that went beyond its intentions. Definitely, A Saving Private Ryan this movie ain't. But I believe that one should evaluate a movie, as one would any other work of art, for what it is and not for what it should be. Take the love story, for example. It has been criticized by many as being extraneous. It is true that a story about philosophical and ethical questions raised by war (and treated in Ryan) would have been more fitting in the context.  As it stands, the life-changing attack could have been replaced by a natural disaster without losing much from the gist of the story. But what would a quintessential great Hollywood production be without a love story?  Besides, the beauty of Kate Beckinsale adds to the visual aesthetics. Another possible charge against the movie might be that it tends to glamorize war. That may be true, but again, this movie is not meant to be a propaganda call for arms, but just a few hours of good entertainment. I must admit, though, that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the WTC, the reply of William Baldwin's character to a question-that if he ran out of plane fuel, he would `find the sweetest military target and try to kill as many Japanese as possible'- sent chills down my spine because it illustrated how righteous the terrorists must have felt. I suppose the recent events highlight the movie's rudimentary treatment of the philosophical issues and conflicts associated with war, especially if one considers the obvious similarities.In the end, if you eat this cake to be enlightened by some new insights, you will be disappointed. If you eat it, however, to enjoy it for its own sake, you will.",,Anonymous,History

Please don't believe the critics,"Why there are so many bad reviews for this movie is absoloutely baffling. What I have just got back from watching was an incredibly tender, poignant and brilliantly acted film.  I simply can't comprehend the critics.  Were we watching completely different movies?  Was the UK release dramatically different from the US?  I doubt it very much.  So why do people refuse to give this movie the respect it deserves?So what if a few liberties were taken with the actual facts of Pearl Harbor? That's the movie world for you.  They're not out to educate people on the finer points of war; if you want that, take a History degree.  The film was made to entertain, to inform to a certain point, and to commemorate those who died during this awful tragedy, and on those three levels it scores highly.Pearl Harbor may not rank up there with the classics, even though it would be a lie to say that it doesn't want to.  It has it's flaws; the dialogue is incredibly corny throughout, Ewan Bremmner's pilot with a stutter is in bad taste, and the three main characters aren't really given enough material to develop on.But if you can look past that, and look into the beautiful love story unfolding with a war horror story, you'll see something truely magical.  The three leads are all perfectly cast; Kate Beckinsale is both beautiful and believeable as the woman at the centre of the love triangle, with best friends Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett competing for her love.Likewise, Ben Affleck gives another great performance as the headstrong, loyal Rafe.  He's got both the looks and the acting ability to propell him into A-list status that he's long deserved.But the real find here is Josh Hartnett.  Heart-stoppingly beautiful, and an amazing actor, especially considering his age and past film history, he really captures the emotion as sensitive Danny.Pearl Harbor deserves much more praise than it's getting.  If you think about all the hard work and effort that's gone into it, there's no excuse for not giving it a mark at least over six.  It was never going to live up to the hype the media created for it, and there was bound to be a backlash as soon as it was released.  But if people for once ignore the critics and skeptics, and go to see this with the same expectations you'd go to see a less-hyped film, I garuntee you won't be disappointed.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Comedy,"This is hands-down one of the funniest movies ever made. The script and acting are hilarious!

I honestly cannot believe they approached this important subject with any respect at all.This is supposed to be a war movie right? Then why is the majority of the film consumed with a hilariously bad love story which has all the believability and relevance of a boiled potato? Why are there more historical inaccuracies than you could shake a stick at? Why is reknowed comedy actor Ben Affleck involved? His idiotic mugging through every scene is simply impossible to take seriously.Hugely amusing, and as a comedy I would not hesitate in giving it top marks. But be warned, if you want a serious war movie this is guaranteed to offend beyond all reasonable boundaries of good taste. These people have no shame, and the racist undertones only lend more laughs to an already unbelievably tongue-in-cheek outing.

"Better than ""Armageddon"", I guess...","Michael Bay is a filmmaker whose ineptitude knows no bounds.  It's really astounding to me that a guy of such limited ability gets these huge budgets and choice summertime opening weekends.With ""Pearl Harbor"", he has once again employed his standard bag of tricks - lots of noise and plenty of special effects in place of any substance, jingoistic patriotism in place of any meaning.  Of course, this is what a vast portion of the movie-going public loves, so I guess his budgets shouldn't be surprising at all.To call this movie a comic-book version of the early days of World War II would be insulting to the comic book medium.  The intent is for ""Pearl Harbor"" to be a ""Titanic""-style tragic love story.  The flaw with this plan is that it's built on characters whose only distinguishing characteristics are their names.  I never got a chance to care about which of the two flyboys the nurse would choose - the phrase ""love triangle"" applied to the movie is accurate in that it's two-dimensional like a triangle, inaccurate in that I didn't ever get a sense of the characters being in love.The centerpiece of the film is, of course, the Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor.  Bay's staging of the event has at least one merit: it reminds us of the brilliance of Steven Spielberg's D-Day invasion sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" by being so limp in comparison.  Where Spielberg was able to introduce method and meaning to the madness of his battle scenes, Bay merely gives us dozens upon dozens of explosions, and shot after shot of Japanese planes firing their torpedos.  What could have and should have been a memorable, virtuoso Hollywood battle scene instead winds up playing like it was put together with stock footage.Blame for the picture's stupidity can't rest entirely on Bay's shoulders, of course.  The writer, Randall Wallace, must take his lumps as well.  Not only is every twist and turn of the plot as predictable as the sun rising in the east, the dialogue is as bad as in any movie you'll see this year.  When the invasion begins, one character brilliantly explains, ""I think World War II just started.""  I wish I had the space to go into detail about how and why that line is one of the most idiotic lines in any film ever, but I shall spare you that particular rant.  Desperately trying to show that the Japanese are not just the stock villains of War-era movie serials, he gives us the sad and wise Japanese admiral with fortune-cookie dialogue such as ""A truly brilliant man would find a way to avoid war"" and ""I fear we have done nothing more than awaken a sleeping giant"" (which serves the dual purpose of making the Japanese Admiral sad and wise and also reminds the audience that the USA is going to go kick some Japanese booty and get revenge!).It makes me kind of sad how many people are going to swallow this tripe, go back for seconds and thirds and rave about what a great movie it is.  My advice?  For less than the price of a matinee admission to ""Pearl Harbor"" you can go to your local video store, rent ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" and get much better films covering the same events.",1.0,Anonymous,History

But it doesn't look good on anyone else's filmography.Now, I admit that it's much more difficult to make a realistic WWII movie now than it was 50 or even 40 years ago. But it can be done. Saving Private Ryan is a good example, HBO's Band of Brothers is another. Filming a simulated attack on Pearl Harbor is more difficult than a simulated assault on an empty beach.

"Inaccuracies, anachronisms and cheese, oh my!","Right up front, let me confess to having been a World War II nut since early childhood.  You may thus understand the depths of my disappointment with this movie.  I believe Roger Ebert said it best: ""The Japanese attack an American love triangle.""  I find it inexcusable that such a pivotal event in history, and one as well documented from just about all angles, can come in for such slipshod treatment at the hands of moviemakers, but I guess I shouldn't be too surprised.  Just let down.If the producers can expend so much time, money and effort to make everything look big and splashy, why not go the extra 1/4 mile and make it look *right*?  Spielberg managed it for Saving Private Ryan, even with the somewhat far-fetched plot device.  Flaws abound, and have been pointed out in great depth elsewhere (the most glaring are the guided missile frigates in the harbor, the off-scale appearance of the Oklahoma as she capsizes (with an impossible torpedo hole in her starboard side, which was shielded by the Maryland *and* Ford Island), no mention of Nevada's dramatic attempt to get underway and subsequent beaching, etc).To my legion of fellow critics I say, ""read your history before trashing the 'token black' Dorie Miller subplot"".  Ship's Cook 3rd Miller did, in fact, give aid and comfort to West Virginia's dying captain, did, in fact, man a machine gun for 15 minutes (during which he believed he shot down a Japanese plane) and was, in fact, the first black recipient of the Navy Cross (awarded in early 1942 by Admiral Nimitz).  Aside from the mistaken coffee-service bit (he was actually bagging laundry at the time) that was one of the things the producers got *right*.Focusing on the Dolittle Raid, I saw only lost opportunities - how Dolittle convinced his superiors to let him fly, the fates of the crews (who flew solo rather than in formation and were scattered all over the place afterwards) and Dolittle's dejection at the ""failed"" raid and his subsequent accolades... all of this was jettisoned as the producers got out the Ritz crackers and Velveeta and went for the cheesy, contrived, convenient resolution of the *important* part of the movie, that cockamamie love triangle.In sum, so many opportunities, so little follow through.  Rent ""In Harm's Way"" for schmaltz, and ""Tora Tora Tora"" for the attack itself.  Better yet, snag a copy of ""At Dawn We Slept"", and read up on the historical tapestry that this movie never really touched.",,Anonymous,History

The accuracy is not terribly important because it's a movie folks.

Not as bad as they say.,"My take: An expensive, old-fashioned epic rather than the historical event it promises. Not nearly as bad as critics have reported.Since its release and up until now, Bay and Bruckheimer's version of ""the day which will live in infamy"" remains much-maligned and heavily criticized. Sure it's melodramatic. Sure it's about as accurate as a kid playing with toy planes and boats in a bathtub. But I thought PEARL HARBOR, as an old-fashioned melodrama set on a historical event, is an entertaining romp, depending how you look at it. Despite Bay's self-importance, PEARL HARBOR is a gorgeous, visually-stunning, unashamedly clichéd and old-fashioned epic that, while a mile away from perfection, is also a mile away from what critics make it look. Where else could you possibly still hear such dialogs as ""...And then I kissed him"" or ""I'll be back for you""? Where else could you have a love story as complicated as a love triangle about two young pilots who both fall in love with the same girl, a nurse, amidst their duties in the impending war? How many movies still give as that gung-ho action as planes who go ""woosh!!"" in the air, chasing and gunning each other down? PEARL HARBOR offers them all, the old-fashioned way. It gets trite and cliché in doing so, but I think that's just part of fun.Like its obvious inspiration, James Cameron's mega-hit TITANIC, the movie is cut into two parts. The first act involves a love story, in this case a ménage à trois involving crack air pilot Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck), hopelessly devoted to gorgeous nurse Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), who volunteers to fight in the Eagle Squadron in England. Unfortunately his plane is shot down in the Battle of Britain is he's reported dead, much to the mourning of poor Evelyn, while Rafe's best buddy Danny (Josh Hartnett) provides her comfort. Will these two end up together? Well, after they cuddle in a parachute hangar, indeed they do, much to the anger of Rafe, who turns up alive and seeing his girl in the loving hands of his best buddy.But they really have no time to argue when history interrupts. Japanese Zeroes swoop down in the harbor on the morning of December 7, 1941, having been devised few days earlier by Admiral Yamamoto (Mako), who's famous line of dialog (""I fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant."") is only briefly mentioned here. The attack itself is immense, delivering all the explosions, disaster and trauma of the actual attack, only with neat CGI planes and sinking battleships. But just when the movie should have ended at this point, the movie throws in an additional hour devoted to the Tokyo Raid led by Lt. Col. Dolittle (Alec Baldwin, in a clichéd but acceptable role). Running nearly as long as 3 hours (or more!), PEARL HARBOR really doesn't need the extra hour, even if it just for the sake of ending the film on a happy note.But despite the prolonged running time, PEARL HARBOR just about gave me my money's worth. It's a terrific turn on the old 1940's romance movies (as Bay describes it). It's sappy, melodramatic and a bit cliché, but entertaining as whole. The performances were adequate, with Affleck and Hartnett playing bland yet reliable cocky heroes. But Beckinsale deserves some praise who looks and acts like a classic beauty, something that would be right at home with an old-fashioned lover story. Jon Voight momentarily appears as wheelchair-bound President Franklin D. Roosevelt, but goes way over the top in a scene where he literally stands in his own two feet, despite the fact that he was affected by polio. Cuba Gooding Jr. lands an important role that's reduced simply as an extended cameo while Baldwin and Colm Feore play clichéd roles of real flesh-and-blood historical figures. But what it lacks in human and character dimension, it makes up in pure spectacle. The special effects are breathtaking and the production design is spectacular. Hans Zimmer's score is adequate to the film's dramatic and patriotic tones (with the addition of Faith Hill's theme song ""There You'll Be"", there are guaranteed misty eyes while the credits roll).There are definitely better films about Pearl Harbor, including an accurate one (TORA! TORA! TORA!) and a similarly dramatic one (FROM HERE TO ETERNITY). But just because there are even better choices doesn't mean the lesser one's make bad choices. PEARL HARBOR, while never going to be on the same league as the said films, is still an enjoyable piece of ""they don't make 'em like this anymore"" entertainment. For accuracy, go see TORA! TORA! TORA! But for pure, old-fashioned entertainment, PEARL HARBOR just about gives me what I have paid for.Rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Want a documentary, watch Tora Tora Tora; want a great film, Pearl Harbor is perfect.","As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good. Everything about it. The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form the summer blockbuster Pearl Harbor. Upon reading reviews of this film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers. They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of ""the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory."" What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all. It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans all over the country. Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves. Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it. It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail.",10.0,Anonymous,History
The biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season begins.,"By Dean KishThe biggest blockbuster of the season weighs in as the summer movie season officially begins. Like the $139 million dollar juggernaut that it is, Pearl Harbor roars across the screen as Ben Affleck and Josh Harnett star as best friend aviators. Rafe (Affleck) has to leave his best friend behind when he joins the highly-respected `Eagle Squadron' out of Britain. The Eagles battle the Nazis as America still refuses to enter World War II. Rafe's beloved Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) is a nurse and is just getting  to know her fly-boy when he takes the assignment in Britain. Rafe asks Danny to look after Evelyn if anything should happen to him overseas. Danny is a man of his word. Tragedy brings down one of the three and the pain it causes brings their lives face to face with the horror that is the Japanese sneak attack of Pearl Harbor. That lone event changed the face of the world and America forever. Who will live? Who will die? And strategically, how will America overcome this disaster? There are so many ways to look at this film, that it's hard to narrow it down into one review. I basically see the film as three smaller films brought together as a huge 3-plus hour blockbuster juggernaut. The first film focuses on the love story of the three leads. The second is the actual events that transpire before and during the attack of Pearl Harbor and the third is the aftermath. Each of these sections of this huge film could have been its own actual film. Director Michael Bay really challenges himself a lot in the first hour of this film. The love story, subtle lighting and humor are really like nothing he has accomplished before. These scenes were great in that they show Bay is evolving as a director. I did find however find that the actual `love-story' plot was quite contrived and was an almost typical wartime drama scenario. Bay's CGI effects and rip-roaring attacks, throughout the second hour are amazing and very intense. These scenes are a marvel to witness. But the film seems to drag quite a bit as the attack dies down. The whole third hour seems like a sequel. Why didn't  screenwriter Randall Wallace (Braveheart) find a way to conclude the lead characters' story in the events of Pearl Harbor? Wallace's script had too much meat and did tend to flip-flop to a lot of different people not around Pearl Harbor. The script should have summed up the love-story in the first 20 minutes, trimmed down some of the flip-flops and narrowed the focus of the film to the actual events of Pearl Harbor. If this would have occurred the film wouldn't have been so long.The lead actors are dashing, daring, beautiful and wonderful to watch. Affleck is good as the steel-hearted hero who faces a moral dilemma. Harnett is believable as the guy who falls for his best friend's girl. But of the three, Beckinsale seemed to release the most range as she seemed to be the one tortured the most. I really liked her during the hospital sequences when the siege was happening. These blurred moments reflect the stress both within Beckinsale and in the events occurring. I really liked this technique. My overall favorite performance wasn't even by one of the main leads. Jon Voight's performance as Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Voight's grasping of the classic historical figure was incredible and it's amazing how he even resembles America's greatest president. I loved this performance and I do hope there is an Oscar nod here. Pearl Harbor's historical lay-out and  formula kind of reminded me of was how the mini-series `The Winds of War' was a set-up for `War & Remembrance' except they were two long and massive mini-series. Pearl Harbor may have included too much stuff in its story. The whole first hour could have been vastly trimmed to bring the actual event closer to the front of the film. `The Winds of War' and its sequel were the most ambitious complete World War II dramas ever conceived. Pearl Harbor may have been too ambitious. This American interpretation of the Japanese invasion is very respectful to the Japanese and doesn't show them as tyrants. I liked that the Japanese were perceived as doing a strategic thing and that they knew that they were awakening a sleeping giant. I am not sure if this is actually the correct portrayal of Japan during this time period but it definitely won't harm anybody today. Pearl Harbor is the kind of film that is meaty enough to spend those inflated theatre ticket prices on. It has something for everyone. (4 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Holy Stinking Garbage Heap, Batman!","This movie was pure garbage.  Not only does it play with history for mere entertainment (representing the deaths of thousands of people for their selfish cause) but it doesn't even do it well.  I feel like these screenwriters Michael Bay drags up are playing mad-libs with these scripts. ""Ok, this is where Alec Baldwin needs to say something to prove how tough he is, cause he's experienced and old."" Or, ""Now the president wouldn't say anything unimportant, and neither would Jon Voight, so how do we make him look stoic and heroic when accepting a flower from his servant?""  This movie just represents a scary trend in Hollywood: the relying on visual affects to make up for a lack of creativity of plot and characters.  I mean, the average American will miss out on quality, historically accurate movie experiences and just swallow this garbage cause it looks cool.  There's just no responsibility for someone with a big budget.  I just hope Michael Bay is proud of himself.  Wait, no I don't.  Don't see this movie unless you want to see neat-o visuals.  It's just not worth the three hours of confusing multiple climaxes loosely based around a cheesy love story with pregnancies and death and maybe even a long lost, eye-patched twin brother!  That last part doesn't happen, but I wish it did, so I could hate this movie more. Good thing it's impossible for me to hate this movie more then, huh?  Man alive!",1.0,Anonymous,History
you'd better study the Pearl Harbor tragedy in history books!,"Made by the same crew that delivered us ""Armageddon"" (1998), ""Pearl Harbor"" is a much less stupid movie than its predecessor and a more ambitious one. You find the actor Ben Affleck in both movies but he's better in ""Pearl Harbor"" than in ""Armageddon"" because he manages to avoid third-rate acting.It isn't sufficient enough to make ""Pearl Harbor"" one of the finest movies made in 2001 because Michael Bay's movie contains a quite important number of faults. Michael Bay wanted obviously to give to his movie a Hollywood extent and as a consequence it makes the film uninteresting. Moreover this is an unoriginal film because it borrows several sequences or ideas from other movies. For example, as it was the case with ""Titanic"" (1997), Bay chose to shoot the Pearl Harbor tragedy through the love affair between Kate Beckinsale and Josh Hartnett but this couple can't make the couple DiCaprio-Winslet forget. In short, this device appears colorless.But the Hollywood side of the movie can be seen at the special effects level. The action sequences are certainly impressive but they are crushed by special effects (when Affleck and Hartnett pilot fighter planes against Japanese pilots, you feel that you are inside a video game!).From a historical point of view, the movie only suggests an academic vision of the Pearl Harbor tragedy and we learn nothing new.Nevertheless when the film focuses on the very moving hospital sequences, Michael Bay knows how to create emotion.At the end, the whole gives a heterogeneous, shaky and conventional movie.",,Anonymous,History
"Romantic, flamboyant and defiantly old-fashioned","PEARL HARBORAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS-8(35mm and 70mm release prints)On the eve of America's entry into World War II, two young fighter pilots (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett) - friends since childhood - are driven apart by their love for a beautiful woman (Kate Beckinsale), but they're forced to set aside their differences when Japanese forces attack the US naval base at Pearl Harbor...One of the most expensive - and vilified - films of its day, this gargantuan epic stands accused of exploiting historical tragedy for commercial gain, courtesy of producer Jerry Bruckheimer (notorious for a string of opportunistic blockbusters) and director Michael Bay (previously responsible for such unassuming action fare as ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon""). This argument may - or may not - have merit, but as a *movie*, PEARL HARBOR is romantic, flamboyant and defiantly old-fashioned, like a 1940's picture postcard come to life. And as a spectacle, it's hard to beat: The attack on Pearl Harbor is one of the most breathtaking set-pieces in Hollywood history, offering a pilot's-eye view of the aerial bombardment, the destruction on the ground, and the horrendous loss of life. It may seem exploitative to some viewers, but Bay uses modern technology (including a terrific multichannel soundtrack) to capture the drama, heartbreak and horror of the occasion like never before.Randall Wallace's overheated script is a little too jingoistic in places (co-star Alec Baldwin is much given to speechifying in this regard), but the friendship between Affleck and Hartnett is depicted with great tenderness and affection, and while their dispute over Beckinsale is probably the least engaging aspect of the entire production, the pay-off still packs quite an emotional wallop. The supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Mako and Dan Aykroyd, with Jon Voight as President Roosevelt (his speech to Congress on 8 December 1941 remains as powerful today as it ever was). Try to see the R-rated director's cut, which offers a slightly more graphic - and therefore more honest - depiction of the death and destruction inflicted on American servicemen (and women) during the Pearl Harbor disaster.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Love it and Hate it,"Pearl Harbor is a very interesting movie. Now their are two sides to my opinion of this movie. The historian in me knows this movie is horrible in showing everything that occurred. But i love the atmosphere of this movie. Jerry Bruckheimer's movies always look good. I also am a sucker for war romances ( I love the Winds of War). If you don't like romance in war movies i would steer clear of this film. Although i would watch anything Kate Beckinsale is in because she is gorgeous. I did have a problem with some of the casting. Ben Afleck works in the movie but i hate Josh Hartnet in this movie.

Not to entertain - it's much more important than that.,"This film was absolutely phenomenal - I rated it a ten - but I would not call it a ""great movie.""  The reason I avoid that phrase is because of the connotation involved.  I will not see Pearl Harbor over and over again, I will not buy the soundtrack, and I will not put the poster on my wall. Here's why:World War II is an incredibly serious subject, and I feared upon going into the movie that it would be treated lightly or with sensationalism. Fortunately, the makers of the movie were much more sensitive than that. What we saw was a very real story about very true people.  The mixing of fact and fiction was miraculously executed, and it stirred the deepest of emotions within me.I gained new respect for my grandfather, who fought this war.  I realized as I watched that if it happened today, it would be my own brother battling to survive the fire and water of the Pacific.  I saw the film bear witness to children and the innocent and even the Japanese - for everyone who enters a war thinks God is on his side.  Most of all, I found myself thinking about my own inner self.  Had I been in that hospital alongside those nurses, would I have been able to save those lives?  Could I have made the tough decision?Most of all, I left that theater knowing that we must do everything we can to stop this kind of war from ever happening again.  At one point, a Japanese soldier calls his commander ""brilliant.""  The commander's response? ""A brilliant man will find a way not to fight a war.""Thank you, Michael Bay, for using the genre of film more responsibly than anyone I have ever seen.  Thank you, Randall Wallace, for writing a screenplay that shows respect for life instead of joy in fiery death.  And thank you to every name shown in those credits scrolled by - I stayed to read every last one.  Thank you for changing my heart.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Worth seeing but could have been a lot better.,"""Pearl Harbor"" is worth seeing, no matter what you may have heard.  There is a love story which takes up a major portion of beginning of the film but there is enough history in it to keep your interest.The historical details of the film are good for the most part, however there are some major problems here and there.  The first one I noticed was the uniforms of the U.S.  This uniform used for this film was wrong.  There had been some changes to it in the late 1930's when the army air corp was beginning its transition to becoming the USAF in the late 40's.  The second major problem was the ability of Ben Affleck's character of Rafe, being able to go to England and fight in the RAF's Eagle squadron as an activity duty U.S. officer in 1940.  This could not happen as the U.S. and nearly 50 other countries had signed a neutrality treaty before World War I.  This practice was strictly prohibited.  The third significant problem was the character of Admiral Kimmal of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.  He was not concerned with the Pearl being attacked and in fact, NO ONE was concerned at all.  At that time in history, it was considered far too difficult to take two carrier groups over 4000 nautical miles and hit Pearl.  The fourth major problem was the character of Jappannese Admiral Yammamoto.  He was portrayed as just a leader and almost seemed an after thought.  In fact, he was the most brilliant stratagist and one of the best leaders the Japannese had.  His planning of his attack on Pearl was painstakingly detailed and planned. There were also some minor problem, but ones that could not have been avoided, such as the visible features on the Japannese carriers that are only seen on our Nimitz Class carriers.The biggiest problem  I had with the film was the love story.  They spent way too much time on it and it detracted, severely from the story of Pearl Harbor.  They should have cut nearly 45 minutes of the love story and concentrated more on the planning of the attack on Pearl and Dolittle's raid on Japan.  This would have made the film much better and would have given more feeling and/or meaning to the film.  It appeared to me that Bay and company failed to realize that Pearl Harbor really ""means"" something to Americans, especially to the Vets.Overall, worth your while (7 out of 10).",7.0,Anonymous,History

A masterpiece,"Some people like Michael Bay, some don't. As far as I'm concerned, he does with Pearl Harbor what he has done with his two previous projects, ""The Rock"" and ""Armageddon"" to make them blockbusters - he gives us spectacular action sequences, interesting characters, and polishes each shot, each scene, to a fine finish. Yes, the movie has characters that are somewhat two dimensional and yes, the movie uses a tragic historical event as the backdrop for a cliche-ridden romance, but why is it that no one complained when James Cameron did that with the much inferior ""Titanic?"" Take a look at some of the classic war films - ""Bridge Over the River Kwai,"" ""From Here to Eternity"" - you will find highly glossed Hollywood romances and big explosions, but if they were dissected with the unblinking cynicism that modern-day critics use, they would be attacked with as much fervor that ""Pearl Harbor"" has been.

Pearl Harbor as Armageddon,"Every bomb hits the target, every explosion results in a huge fireball, and every bullet finds it's target, regardless of how it was delivered or lined up.It was really difficult to see an actual historical event turned into a Hollywood action film with all its preposterous battle hoopla.  I've seen interviews with Pearl Harbor survivors who say that the movie is pretty accurate.  This rather amazes me.  Either they have forgotten the details of the event, or they may not have actually been there.  My father was there. The battleships were tied together with walkways between them and to the dock.  There was no way that Japanese planes were going to fly between the ships, below the deck level, the length of the ships, but they did this repeatedly in the movie.  Dive bombers did half immelmanns to attack.  I doubt this was ever done in actual combat.  Bombs fell straight down, a physical impossibility when delivered from a moving airplane. Wasn't it amazing how all those guys who went through flight training together were always assigned to the same duty stations?  Pearl Harbor had such potential, with todays technology, but in the hands of an adolescent director, the result was quite pathetic.Alec Balwin's portrayal of the phenomenonly heroic Jimmie Doolittle was overly theatrical and moronic.  There was audible laughter in the theater during his major ""speech.""

Titanigeddon,"Before seeing this film it is important to note the following:1. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer 2. Directed by Michael BayConclusion: Expect a high concept storyline, a script laden with testosterone, stunning visuals edited within an inch of their life, a rousing soundtrack (preferably by Hans Zimmer), a bit of humour, a bit of sadness, and a HUGE amount of ""God bless America"".With this in mind, and with all expectations of a thought-provoking, 'sensible' film thrown away, Pearl Harbor is the ultimate summer popcorn movie.  Clearly, not everyone likes this type of film, and if your enjoyment of a film depends on the script and the quality of acting then this film could quite possibly make you ill.  I think it's reasonable to say that if you didn't like Armageddon, you'll hate this.  That's not to say that fans of Armageddon will necessarily like this as much.In Armageddon, Bay had 2 1/2 hours to try and fit in as much action as possible and the tone was decidedly tongue in cheek.  With Pearl Harbor, Bay and Bruckheimer have tried to go more serious by following the Titanic-approach of a doomed love-story.  While this does produce a more emotional ending, it comes at the price of action and pacing.  The first hour deals mostly with romance and really could have been cut down a bit. We get some relief with the English/German dogfight sequences which are the first suggestion that we are going to witness something truly breathtaking later.  In fact, though this first hour and a half feel slow and tedious at times, this makes the Pearl Harbor attack all the more exciting by contrast.The 35 minute attack is incredible with Bay's kinetic action style finally given a chance to shine.  There are similarities in technique to Saving Private Ryan but so what.  There are more than enough highly-original shots to compensate for the seen-it-before stuff.After the attack, the film never slows down again, since it tones down the romantic plot and concentrates on the more traditional Bruckheimer ""let's kick the bad guys' asses"" plot.  Consequently, the film becomes decidedly more Armageddon-y with numerous rousing speeches, heroic slow-motions, tough training for a dangerous mission, and an upbeat ending tinged with tragedy before the credits role accompanied by a cheesy, charts-friendly, love anthem.Ideally, the love story could have been shortened at the start because Bay is an action director and romance has never been a strong point in Bruckheimer films.  In fact, like the Rock and Armageddon, it is the male bonding that produces the more powerful emotional connection.Pearl Harbor is at the top of its genre - big, loud and, assuming you can switch your brain off, very emotionally powerful.  It is not a Titanic, it is not a Saving Private Ryan and to compare it to such films is unfair to the intentions of the film-makers.  It is an action film and Michael Bay has yet again proved that in this field of visual entertainment, he is the best of the best.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Technically excellent, but plot is slow and hard to swallow.","**+   Romance, War DramaA love triangle set against the background of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the Dolittle bombing raid on Tokyo.

Technically, the film is simply flawless!However, the story is disjointed and somewhat hard to swallow. It frequently drags, and would have benefited from tighter editing. Yet I was disappointed so little time was devoted to historical events leading up to the attack.But this film is primarily a romance -- with obvious comparisons to TITANIC. The attack itself lasts 40 minutes or more, and matches the intensity of the first reel of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It does a fantastic job of capturing the complete and utter confusion surrounding the surprise attack.There are Zillions of explosions, but relatively little gore for a war movie. In the end, I was somewhat disappointed. The audience I saw it with almost universally mirrored my feelings: ""I've seen it -- once.""",6.0,Anonymous,History
What happened to what could have been a great film?,"My suggestion: don't bother with this one. While it is beautifully shot, with some good acting (most notably Jon Voight as FDR), it is way too ""Hollywood,"" and too long. I don't understand why the makers would feel anything more than the attack on Pearl Harbor wouldn't be spectacular enough to cover in a film. Why go to the Dolittle raid too? Revenge, I suppose. Get back at those Japs! But we all know what happened with Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and that was way more of a spectacular revenge - - and decisive to the outcome of the war as well as consequential to mankind -- than Dolittle was. Also, what is with the 3 hour running time? I've always felt if a movie needs to run 3 hours, it had better have something good to say. This script just didn't have enough gas to propel its 3 hour span, even with the love story intertwined.Also, for me, a lot of the fighter scenes looked too ""Star War-ish"" with the CGs, although using real restored fighters exclusively is understandably cost-prohibitive for even a large-budget Hollywood flick.If you want to see a good Pearl Harbor film, check out ""Tora Tora Tora."" While not as ""pretty"" as the 2001 version, the 1970 film has way more substance and authenticity.",2.0,Anonymous,History

The neverending story,"What a dismal affair. Standard hollywood drek of 'fix it with CGI'. I don't care for the characters, and found myself wishing they would die. It was nice to see that, in spite of what happened in real life, through the magic of cinema the US practically won Pearl Harbor. The enemy are faceless monsters. The protagonists are personality-less idiots.But hell, it had all the hallmarks of Michael Bay...explosions explosions explosions. Oh, and some explosions. And then a brief pause before more explosions. At least they covered up some of the dialogue.Do yourself a favour, watch Tora Tora Tora.",1.0,Anonymous,History

My advice is, AVOID THIS MOVIE AT ALL COSTS.  It is even worse than Hannibal.",,Anonymous,History
Disgusting,"This movie goes beyond disappointing, and is downright disgusting.  A friend of mine who was a history major laughed all the way through it.  It tried to show the Japanese as the ""honorable enemy"" who regretted their attack, but thought it was necessary.  Ha!  The movie did not show all the motivation behind everything.  We showed that the US intended to block oil shipments, but not why.  We did it because Japan had invaded China (which was apparent at the end of the movie, but the link wasn't made clear).  Does anyone really think the Japanese didn't want this attack?  If they wanted a fight, why not call us out and face us down?  It was a low-life dirty attack, and the writer should be fined for presenting such a ridiculously ""politically correct"" joke such as this.Oh, but the hour-long massacre of men, women, and children had great special effects.",6.0,Anonymous,History
::sigh::,"Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay make entertaining low-on-story blockbusters... so why the hell did they try to tackle this? The trailer makes it look like a summer blockbuster of entertainment but all you feel after the grueling 3 hours is a sore backside and a stiff neck... and the sinking feeling half the film should have been left on some dusty cutting room floor.That aside though, there were a few good things... Michael Bay's eye for a good scene kept things moving for me, although the the raid on Pearl Harbour itself was more lifeless than the one shown in the trailer due to the complete lack of musical scoring. Hans Zimmer what the hell were you up to?As for the actors... well i never did like Alec Baldwin. Affleck reprised his role from Armageddon minus anything that vaguely made that character human. Hartnett and Beckinsale were alright. Cuba rocked.

Good overview,"Don't expect a documentary - This is the Cliff Notes version with an embellishment (love story) to make it interesting.  From what I know of history, the film portrayed the big points well.  For example, there was radar at Pearl Harbor before the bombing, and they did see something coming, but they didn't know what to make of it - since radar was new.  The 45 minutes of bombing about which Ebert complained served to convey the devastation and helplessness of the Americans - and the aftermath, if anything, was prettied up a bit for the movie but still very convincing.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Historically inaccurate but Danny Walker won my heart,"Pearl Harbor is a movie that holds a special place in my heart. Despite its historical inaccuracies, particularly in its portrayal of events during WWII, the film captivated me with a touching love story.The ever-so-charming Josh Hartnett's portrayal of Danny Walker was nothing short of captivating. His performance added a layer of depth to the character, making me emotionally invested in his journey.Sometimes, the dialogue felt overly sentimental or forced, but meh.It's essential to approach Pearl Harbor with the understanding that it is more a work of historical fiction than an accurate depiction of the events. If you're a stickler for historical precision, this might be a point of contention. But if you look past the inaccuracies, you'll find a movie that tugs at the heartstrings!",8.0,Anonymous,History
A Surprisingly Good War/Romantic Movie,"I have read alot of the negative publicity which surrounded this movie on it's release. It seemed to me few critics had anything good to say about it. In fact everyone seems to be calling the film a failure saying it bombed at the box office. Yet according to this website the budget was $135 million and it made $450 million worldwide, which seems like a decent profit to me.Anyway When I watched it recently on TV I was Pleased to find that this was actually a good movie.I enjoyed the 3 hour experience more than Saving Private Ryan (although it was probably not as good critically). Pearl Harbor was well made, the acting from the three main leads though not spectacular, was certainly adequate, Ben Affleck was quite good as the square jawed all American Hero type, Josh Hartnett was not bad either as his quieter best friend and Kate Beckinsale proved an attractive and quite engaging female lead (this was actually the first time I had seen her in a movie). The special effects were superb and the battle sequences realistic. Also some of the smaller parts, most notably Alec Baldwin as Affleck's commanding Officer & Jon Voight as President Roosevelt were very well acted indeed.I rated this film 6 or 7 out of 10, Ignore the bad reviews watch it and judge for yourself.",7.0,Anonymous,History

A perfect combination of war and romance movie - ending could have been happier though.,"A perfect combination of war and romance movie - ending could have been happier though.I did not believe I had the passion to write another movie review while dealing with a barrage of middle age crises until I rewatched this film just now. It was a sensation at the time of release mimicking Harry Potter(2001) and Titanic (1997) but over time critiques have built up and I feel this film is unfairly blamed and severely underrated. Hence it has been felt that I have an onus to clear its name.The plot is beautiful in that it weaves romance into a war story. You don't find many shows with both components, do you? I am somehow a war movie fanatic and have always loved Saving Private Ryan (1998), Fury (2014), Hacksaw Ridge (2016) and probably more recently 1917 (2019) and Midway (2019). But they are mostly about fighting without much romance involved. Pearl Harbor (2001) somehow breaks this pattern and offers a new perspective. Love triangle is probably the most tangible conflict that pushes the story forward, even though I don't precisely like this kind of story.Cinematography is excellent and fighting is intense. The attack on Pearl Harbor and the counterattack on Tokyo are all filmed with highly sophisticated cinematographic effect. The beauty of Pearl Harbor sunset has been magnified multiple times by the camera lens. Even the courting scenes are so sweet that they deserve many giggles. This movie did achieve top notch artistic performance.I always say no great movie can be accomplished without great actors. Acting is superb. Multiple Hollywood A listers like Ben Affleck and Alec Baldwin have undoubtedly increased the weighting of the show. Josh Hartnett is somehow a quiet achiever given his less high profile compared with the former two. Yet his acting is second to none. His unassuming boy face is an appeal.Location is usually the last but not least thing I mention in my reviews. New York, Washington and Pearl Harbor are all great places for this type of filming. The counterattack on the Japanese soil, known as Doolittle Raid, strikes a remarkable resemblance to the scene in Midway (2019).In all aspects I believe Pearl Harbor (2001) is an excellent film that deserves high rating. I'm not exactly sure where the cynicism and criticism come from. Perhaps people expect too much. Yes it is propaganda and I don't deny that. The Americans like to do that. So do the Chinese. But movies are all about soft power projection, let alone war movies. However, why can't we just focus on the movie itself and ask the following questions.Is the story and event something that interests you?Does it achieve impressive cinematographic effects?Do you like the cast and crew?Does the movie leave you something to relish post-viewing?My answer is yes to all above. Even a day after the show the scenes are still playing in my head. I'm just hopelessly and relentlessly a cinephile. I must say I was hoping for a happier ending though. The fact that Danny (Josh Hartnett) died somehow saddens me. But maybe this is the best possible outcome to end a love triangle. Politics is about finding middle ground.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Peal Harbor a good movie, not great, but good","Contrary to what most of the critics say, Pearl Harbor was a good movie. It was not a great movie, but a very solid entertaining movie. First, lets take some of the faults (real or imagined). One, it is too long. Yeah, it is a little too long, I will agree with that. Two, they left out important details that people should be told. Now this is funny. They complain that we are not told why Japan attacked, or why there are soldiers from Japan's army in China. If you know basic history, you should not these things. If they would have explained them, the critics would have complained that they had dumbed the movie down too much. Which is it? Are the film makers not entitled to assume that the audience knows a little bit about the subject. And where are they supposed to put these things in the movie, if it is already too long. Okay, I will admit the love story was a little lame, but it was not the worst love story I have ever seen. There have been entire romantic comedies based on a dumb love story.Now, lets take the good. The battle was done very well. I was not there, but it seemed very realistic. I think in demonstrated the impact of the situation well on the different characters, as well. All in all, I was entertained, and that was all I expected. Anybody who expected more out of this movie went into it with the wrong mindset.",7.0,Anonymous,History
9/11: A Romance,"Okay, so just a quick rant here, but imagine if 50, 60, 70 years from now filmmakers make a movie about 9/11; except, instead of it being about 9/11, it's a dumb soppy romance that has nothing to do with 9/11 itself. Wouldn't you be just a little p***ed off? I know I would be. Taking a horrible tragedy and turning it into an insanely stupid movie with a lame romance story would be terrible.Now imagine that that tragedy actually took place 50, 60, 70 years ago, and that the insanely stupid movie was released today. As a matter of fact, make it be Pearl Harbor. Oh, wait, THEY ALREADY DID THAT. Talk about totally disgracing and disregarding a horrible tragedy. Good job, guys; now let's watch you make fun of disabled people.Anyway, that's just my little rant. Now back to the movie...It was sh!t. The romance was stupid, the acting subpar, and the writing was like jamming a screwdriver into your brain through your ears.

Who made this stuff up?,"You'd think that in the decades since ""Tora Tora Tora"" (1970) and ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"" (1944) that there was room for improvement, maybe a more personal story or a more historically accurate one.  Instead comes this monstrosity, one of the worst war movies, or movies of any kind, I've ever seen.  Not only does it take enormous license with the events at Pearl Harbor, the Battle of Britain and Jimmy Doolittle's raid on Tokyo, but the plot centers on a hackneyed love-triangle plot that was worn out even in the 1940s.

I mean, it really can't be that bad! The worst movie I have seen, is the horrific ""The Blair Witch Project"" because I was not horrified by the story, I was horrified of the bad actors and bad story. ""Pearl Harbor"" Is definitely my favorite movie! This is why:1. Josh Hartnett (no doubt, I mean it goes without saying! He is such a talented actor that needs this attention! People need to know that he is out there! I myself am very proud of him! Not to mention, his charming looks!)2. The, what I call ""Half and Half Strategy.""

I couldn't help but see it 3 times (to date) and I'll probably see it many many more times, because it is so extremely good! Don't listen to the negative critics, movie-goers, and newspapers.

"Good, but not great","Pearl Harbor is not a war movie.  If you want a movie about the attack on Pearl Harbor, rent Tora! Tora! Tora! and save a few bucks.  If you want to see a movie about a love triangle that develops between two pilots and a nurse that just happens to be set in Pearl Harbor, this is your movie. For those of you willing to sit through 90 minutes of this just to see the attack, the wait is worth it.  The attack scenes are spectacular, but just a little too PG-13 instead of realistic.  After the attack, the two pilots are sent on a top secret mission to bomb Tokyo.  Again, if you want to skip the love stuff, rent Thirty Seconds over Tokyo.I didn't hate this movie, not by a long shot.

Tragic historical event reduced to a comic book story,"This movie is unbelievably bad. Problems are everywhere; let's start with the dreadful Titanic ripoff love triangle: they look like Barbie and Ken dolls, with plastic acting to match. The script is so corny and lame you'll be taping something over your ears to stop the pain. 21st Century anachronisms appear routinely, far too many to list. There is no heart for the people who died that day; the attack sequence is an exploitive, excessive, over-indulgent CGI field day that depict this tragic event as if it was comic book style mayhem.Ben Affleck fights in every battle you ever heard of, from Europe to Japan. I thought any minute they'd show scenes of him strafing Sioux Indians at the Little Big Horn, bombing Santa Ana's forces at the Alamo, or firing lasers at the Galactic Empire's Death Star.Since the whole thing is garbage, the director is to blame.

Pearl Harbor is an excellent action/love story based on a historical moment in time.,"I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end. The acting is superb by all, especially by Ben Affleck. You can't help but fall in love with the characters. I laughed with them, cried and felt their fear and loss. That's what I call good writing, directing, acting, etc. Everyone involved in this film deserves to be applauded. My father served as a pilot in the Korean War, long forgotten, and I feel these films give some concept of what these brave individuals went through. There have been many war movies made in the past. Everyone of them help us to understand what that generation went through along with hope for a better future.

Saving Private Ryan meets Titanic,"Pearl Harbor has great special effects, as do all Michael Bay/Jerry Brukenheimer films.  The problem, traditionally, with their films is the story.  I hoped Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart, would offset this usual weakness; he did not.The story is predictable and contrived.  You can almost see the producers gathering around saying, ""well Titanic and Saving Private Ryan were hits, so let's combine them and make Pearl Harbor"".  The love story is weak bordering on insultingly weak.  Also many of the supporting characters are paper-thinly developed.  For instance, why was Cuba Gooding in this movie? Did anyone care about his character?  It would have been better if they just abandoned the love story and focused on the war.  For instance, they could have focused on the bonds of friendship developed in war or the loss of innocence in war.  Doing so would have allowed for more fully developed characters.The strength of Pearl Harbor is the special effects and that's fine for a summer movie.  However, good special effects are not enough when the subject is Pearl Harbor.",6.0,Anonymous,History
This film should contain a health warning!,"There are very few films I've come across which actually make you want to beat yourself senseless with a heavy object. But this is surely one of them. Quite possibly one of the worst films ever made and I can't believe I managed to watch it through to the end! Twice. Once in the cinema and once on TV!First off let me say that I can understand the need to make a compromise between historical accuracy and the telling of a 'good story'. That assumes of course that you have a good story to tell, rather than this banal boiling-pot of the oldest clichés in the book.The heights of implausibility which this film manages to attain are just jaw-dropping. Saving Private Ryan managed to interweave an implausible story with historical events while maintaining a semblance of believability. Pearl Harbor just had me swearing obscenities at the screen in frustration!I can forgive the use of late-model Spitfires in the 'Battle of Britain' sequences. What is less forgivable is the portrayal of the Battle of Britain at all given that it took place in 1940 and not 1941 as depicted here! And it is never quite explained how Ben Afleck manages to get himself released from his duties with the RAF and return to Hawaii - I guess he decided he'd had enough and so handed back his plane and uniform! Isn't that desertion in most people's book?Some of the special effects during the attack on Pearl Harbor are, admittedly, not bad - despite the appearance of what appear to be quite modern warships in some shots! But the makers seem to think that the more special effects they can get into a single frame of film then the more realistic/impressive it will be! Unfortunately it just ends up looking like an intro-sequence for a Medal of Honor type game. Less is definitely more sometimes!Talking about effects - what was that all about with the sequences in the hospital during the battle? Did they get a dud batch of film stock that had been exposed to sunlight or something? It's all very well trying to be smart with film effects but sometimes you can end up looking like complete amateurs - which I'm afraid they do here.As for our intrepid heroes suddenly becoming experienced B-25 pilots - oh pur-lease!! At this point I had my head in my hands and was sobbing uncontrollably. The boys even manage to get involved in hand-to-hand combat, wiping out an entire Japanese platoon in the process. Presumably this was to show that our heroes were capable of going toe-to-toe with the enemy as well as just dropping bombs on them?Who on earth was this film aimed at? I'm sure the majority of filmgoers are not complete imbeciles but this is exactly who the target audience seems to be. It could be viewed simply as a romantic adventure yarn (although the romantic element is dire) but it seems to want to portray itself as much more than that, which is it's biggest weakness.If you want to be a heavy-weight historical drama then you just cannot mix in the sort of love-triangle claptrap and implausible plot lines that are in this.Dreadful.

But Hollywood, you blew it with your typical love story crap and the over-hyped American patriotic s*** we're simply tired of on the big screen.

Fails miserably as a historical epic but...,"Maybe it's just my love of WW2 aircraft and uniforms but I found this movie to be not as bad as many people have said.  Sure, it IS a terrible failure in it's attempt to be a love story as well as a historical recreation of Pearl Harbor, drafting in both Yamamoto and Roosevelt as supporting characters among other things.  One is reminded of that dreadful TV Mini-series from the early 80's ""The Winds of War"" in its incompatible and grandiloquent narrative.  The central love story though is actually not that bad and, like From Here to Eternity, it could have succeeded on its own merit of light-tragic drama with a minimum of expensive explosions and, at times, completely incredulous aerial combat sequences.Less is more and this film just goes for more more more, ultimately making it just another summer action blockbuster with little or no historical relevance aside from it's 40's look and feel.  A shame too, because if Bruckheimer and Bay weren't looking between every line for a mindless adrenaline rush this could have been a poignant tribute to the WW2 fighter pilot and Navy Nurse. Instead we get huge helpings of noise and action thrown at us, some of which is very realistic and fitting, some of which is as cheesy as any Star Wars dogfight over the deathstar, making you cringe at its phoniness.  When the dogfight and B-25 scenes are good they're very good.  But when they slip into unreal comic-book heroics they go way over the top.On the ground floor this film is a slap in the face to every Pearl Harbor veteran wishing their story might have been told in the vein of Private Ryan or Yanks.  But at times, as a romantic drama, it is very thoughtful and human, with some great buddy interaction between the flyboys and some down to earth sequences. Then it skews off into another movie with Roosevelt (Jon Voight has dreadful lines) and the Japanese Naval command, Admiral Kimmel, Doolittle, and so on. And of course this isn't helped by the insistence on embellished action. Even setting this story at Pearl Harbor was a big mistake.  The writer should have realized it after the first draft and set it in a more low-key WW2 locale.  The story of two pilots is not suited to Pearl Harbor where barely an American fighter got off the ground that day. And then the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo? If one of the men had been a sailor assigned to the Arizona and the other a pilot maybe there would have been more believability and logic to the storyline.The title reenactment of the attack on Pearl Harbor, at 35 minutes or so, is just an exploitive money sequence and has really nothing to do with the plot.  It does not even remotely feel realistic and captures none of the imagery we have seen for years in documentary footage which should have been a reference point.Overall, visually sumptuous and mostly well acted, Pearl Harbor has many redeeming qualities undone by its many excesses. Not a great film by any stretch of the imagination but still, not as bad as the reviews.If nothing else watch it for the planes!",6.0,Anonymous,History

An excellent film if you're looking for a 1940's style WWII film,"It's fashionable to bash Pearl Harbor, but in reality it's an amazing piece of film-making and tells a story that sorely needs to be told.So many people come to this film apparently expecting a modern, cynical take on the story - Quentin Tarentino's ""Pulp Harbor,"" if you will. This is NOT and is not MEANT to be that type of film.Instead, the film reflects a 1940s sensibility, in which we see America attacked without warning, and what it takes to go from the nearly complete destruction of the Pacific Fleet to the first, largely symbolic attack on the Japanese mainland, the Doolittle Raid on Tokyo.Many people find the dialogue and story corny, yet watch most any World War II film made during that era and you'll find the same. Talk to many who were soldiers then and you'll find that people often did speak using the same speech patterns many people find to be trite and sappy today. That's what Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer were trying to achieve with this film, and they succeeded admirably.Watching this film gives you, if you hadn't already had one, the deepest possible empathy for those who survived the events of that day, the most horrific attack America had ever suffered prior to September 11, 2001.If what you're looking for is a modern, cynical take on the events of December 7, 1941, this is NOT the movie for you. But if you'd like some understanding of just what happened that Sunday morning, and a feel for how America rose to the challenge that faced her, you will enjoy Pearl Harbor.Or, watch the trailer.

I Think World War II Just Started,"Michael Bay's ""Pearl Harbor"" is terrific, explosive, exciting, and technically well-made. John Schwartzman's photography, and the film's effects, are outstanding; and, many of the supporting performances would have been exceptional, in a better story. Unfortunately, this film is far too long, and focuses on a the lamest possible retelling of the eternal ""love triangle"" during a war setting.The film's length is not justifiable. First of all, the Japanese segments are pointless; since there is no attempt to portray them accurately, or with substance, they should have remained in the shadows. Secondly, the underused supporting cast's stories are even not worthy of inclusion. For example, Cuba Gooding Jr. appears to receive a medal, due to his race, apparently. And, Jon Voight appears to do his Franklin D. Roosevelt impression. But, Winston Churchill and Adolf Hitler appear as themselves. So, wasn't the real Roosevelt good enough?Ben Affleck (as Rafe McCawley), Josh Hartnett (as Danny Walker), and Kate Beckinsale (as Evelyn Johnson) make up the starring threesome; and, they are earnest and attractive, playing out the storyline like they were acting in an old movie. Still, there really isn't anything to this trio; compare them, for starters, with the extraordinary characterizations in the silent ""Wings"" (1927). Then, see ""From Here to Eternity"" (1953). Either of those film's stories would have been preferable to this non-smoking ""Pearl Harbor"".It's all so obviously contrived and predictable; and, with such good production values, a certain level of disappointment is assured.****** Pearl Harbor (5/21/01) Michael Bay ~ Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, Kate Beckinsale, Cuba Gooding Jr.",6.0,Anonymous,History

I think that may have hurt it at the box offices which is too bad because it really is as good as Titanic but never should have been marketed that way.,8.0,Anonymous,History

The Eat-As-Much-As-You-Like Movie,"At over three hours it's easy to see why the critics don't like it - they get bored - humdrum script, lousy acting for much of it, formulaic and predictable (and hey - they didn't pay for it!). For the rest of us, it's sort of good value for money if you like cheese, explosions, a nice love song, enough extras to repopulate China, and an indication that someone has spent an awful lot of dosh making a BIG movie to keep you awake long enough to work through one of those extra humungously big cartons of popcorn. Who cares if it's quality or not? Titanic won lots of Oscars and the critics didn't like that either. Pearl Harbor isn't up to Titanic standards, but it at least aims at that sort of scale. There's LOTS of big warships, LOTS of hunky naval officers, LOTS of beautifully made-up nurses-in-waiting, and OODLES of lovey-dovey triangular 'dilemma' stuff. Plus it's really easy to follow (quick synopsis - Japs bomb Pearl Harbour and bring Americans into World War II - geddit?) If you need to exercise your brain or artistic aspirations go and see Miss Saigon or read a book. Or you can always check out the Movie Gaffs websites to see some of the continuity errors and play spot-the-gaffe. (The bit where Ben Affleck makes his nose bleed with a champagne cork is cute - each time the camera cuts to his face the blood is there or has vanished or is back again!) If you want to go to the movees with a few friends who really aren't into films, go and see Pearl Harbor - they'll all think you're great for taking them to see a nice big blockbuster.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Worth the watch but not if you're a realism freak.,"I don't get why people are hating? its like..has any remake been better than the original? name one..crying because its not 100% accurate Jesus.I enjoy the movie even after watching it multiple times and the ending is a classic, but at the same time i'm not a war freak who wants everything 100% the exact same..i think the acting was decent and the relationship between the two guys make the movie what it is.The ending is probably what made the movie, some parts could of been a little better but its a MOVIE and people are saying ""too much action"" it was to fill the film..oh hey guys lets film a 3 hour movie and just do two scenes where we fight japs but then oh wait..everyone would say its boring and complain ""not enough action"" i think no matter what people will criticize a movie because it depends if you connect & enjoy it.I would say its worth the watch.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I Cheered for the Japs,"The acting, dialogue and plot were so stupid and the historical accuracy so lacking that no one could ever have enjoyed this. You can't even get drunk and like this movie. The love-triangle, betrayed friend, ""but we thought you were dead!"" stuff is just so trite and mundane that the mind boggles.When the Japanese planes finally show up, you find yourself hoping that a big, fat bomb lands right in the middle of this triad of mediocre acting and puts a permanent load of shrapnel in Ben Affleck's career. Worst of all is the insulting of the intelligence of anyone who knows even a little bit about what actually happened that day. No nurses died at Pearl Harbor. Sorry. No women in service died that day at all, actually. We all know that women made a good, solid contribution to the war effort, but historical fact cannot be shoved aside for the sake of symbolism. The women who died at Pearl Harbor were all civilians and, embarrassingly, were all likely caused by US antiaircraft shells landing in the civilian areas of the island, according to the National Park Service.So there you go. This movie, I am afraid, is sub-dreadful. It is much sound and fury and next to no substance.

Can you say amazing?,"Danny and Raif have been friends since childhood and now they're in the Army as two of the best pilots in the squadron. You quickly been drawn into their friendship.  This is the kind of friendship that lasts your whole life -- a friend that is more than a friend but a sibling of the heart.  Soon after you meet them as adults you learn the Raif has volunteered to fight for the British in WWII since the US has not yet entered the War and he's been accepted.  Then you meet Raif's true love Evelyn.  They have what you think is that meant to be kind of love.  Very sweet, romantic and then he breaks the news that he's going to war.  Danny is angry that Raif is going but not angry enough to end a friendship and Evelyn is of course upset that he is leaving as well, but he goes anyway.  Before he leaves he tells Danny if anything happens to me you have to be the one to break the news to Evelyn. Well as if a sense of foreboding Raif's plane crashes and all believe that he is dead.  Sharing a common grief together Danny and Evelyn fall in love. Then Raif comes back, turns out he managed to survive the wreck.  But this is months later.  Raif obviously feels betrayed and you under go the awful feeling of betrayal, a forever kind of friendship in danger and a woman stuck in the middle in love with both men.  To top this all off there is a surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor.  This movie has some excellent action scenes, the actors and actresses put in a stellar performance showing us pain in the rawest form.  Danny and Raif show the kind of bravery from which medals are earned.  Throughout this movie you will experience love, conflict, War and loss.      While it does bear some resemblance to Titanic because it re-enacts an epic in history and includes the element of love, this is not Titanic.  This movie is like Titanic meets Saving Private Ryan, but much, much more.  It is an amazing movie.  A definite must see.  I can't tell you how it ends though because then why would you want to see the movie?  It's worth the ticket and the time!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Y&R meets Admiral Yamamoto,"Given the generally ghastly reviews, I was prepared to hate this film. But I rather liked it. It's more of a love story than a war story. The special effects are outstanding. And the mood and feel of 1941 has been well captured. Negatives? Good as the effects may be, there are too many of them. I was wondering which was shorter, WW2 or the movie. Jon Voigt stinks as FDR. There is far too much shouting and yelling and too many war movie cliches. It's a three hour film which easily could have been trimmed to two. But overall, it's not anything as bad as the reviews have suggested. (Had an interesting thought while watching...

Alot of people didnt like the fact that the love story was a bigger part of the movie than the actual bombing, but I think that the build up with the love story just emphasises the tragedy and how it affected so many people. A movie has never touched me so much and Im not even American. It is a bit of a typical war love story but still good with great actors.I liked the fact that it didnt end straight after the attack, but showed another event, which gave it a sad, but good ending.It certainly deserves alot more praise than it has received.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Good movie with action sequences but bad romance,"Pearl Harbor I thought was a good movie. The movie follows the lives of two best friends, Danny, played by Josh Hartnett (Virgin Suicides) and Rafe, played by Ben Affleck (Good Will Hunting). Coincidentally they both fall in love with the same girl, played by Kate Beckinsale. It soon turns out to be an almost soap-opera like love triangle which to me is too ridiculous. Jon Voight (Midnight Cowboy) gives one of the most realistic portrayals and best performance as President Roosevelt. Also Alec Baldwin (The Shadow) gave a good performance as the head aviation commander. The movie also stars many other famous stars such as Cuba Gooding Jr., Dan Aykroyd, and Tom Seizmore. Pearl Harbor probably had to be one of the best movies on Pearl Harbor because of the realistic dogfights, the special effects, and the acting, especially Jon Voight's. Unfortunately the romance segments of the movie are stupid and pointless. If I were the director, I would try to keep the romance parts of the movie to a bare minimum. There are also, many fast camera movements during the attack on Pearl Harbor, which I liked. I am also surprised it got a PG-13 rating. The bombing of Pearl Harbor was pretty violent and bloody. Overall, I recommend this movie to everyone, but just skip the romance part of the movie. Other than that, you will like it.7/10 stars",7.0,Anonymous,History

Since when did P-40s turn, twist and do aerobatics that out maneuvered the Japanese Zero, probably the single most nimble aircraft in the early part of the Pacific war?

Sad waste!,"This movie wouldn't of been so bad if it wasn't for the terrible performances from it's leads: Josh,Ben and Kate. Totally to be expected from Ben Affleck though since almost every one of his movies sucks big time.The movie doesn't start getting good til like 2 hour some minutes into the flick when the japs bomb Pearl Harbor and that's really sad. Thank your lucky stars though VCRs and DVD players have fast forward buttons. In this movie you will be needing it unless you want to watch of course a romance between 3 people that was so terribly acted they should really be ashamed. If they wanted an interesting triangle to this dull romance they could of written in a 3 some. Might of well have,probably would of drawn in more interest.After the first half it starts to get better,to watch events that actually happened like some history lesson but with special effects...Yay...to make you forget about the crappy start to this so so movie.This movie wasn't too bad in action and special effects but the chemistry sucks between the actors. How can you get over a guy after 3 months after his death. Can anyone say slut? Harlet's the more appropriate word for Kate Pukingsdale.John Voight was great as always as FDR,even though I read some where FDR didn't actually get up I think he had help or some sh*t like that.The ending where *spoiler alert* one of the lead actors die,I could not have been more gleeful although they killed off the wrong one. If you can stomach the poor romantic performances in the beginning without heaving then you might enjoy this flick.

LOVE FIRST AND PEARL HARBOR SECOND,"It was a long movie and rather disappointing.  It was more a love story than the actual bombing of Pear Harbor.  It took an hour and a half to get the the meat of the picture.  The destruction of Pearl Harbor was fantastic in its reality and that was what Pearl Harbor was all about. This movie was more a love story which overshadowed the actual event.

It was just awful and I just couldn't get into it,"I know that there are some ""Pearl Harbor"" fans, and I'm sorry but to be honest this movie is just trash. It seemed to me that the director just wanted to have a huge action movie and lost all the details that this event really happened. They just added a huge love story in it that wasn't memorable and also that they were trying to make another ""Titanic"". I was looking forward to this movie when it came out, because I had studied World War II religiously and I couldn't believe this monstrosity of a film.Ben and Josh play Rafe and Danny, two American boys who grew up together and are in the army. Rafe seems to just be in love with America and one girl, Evelyn played by Kate, she's a nurse who helps Ben get back to health after a certain mishap with his nose. They have a romance, but when it comes time for Rafe to choose between his country and his love, which does he pick? You just guess. But when an accident happens in England where Rafe is, they assume him dead and send Eve the message of his death. She and Danny then become real close through this lose and you guess it! They get down and dirty! Rafe comes back though expecting everything to be the same as before. Shock! Eve is pregnant with Danny's baby; but that's the least of their problems when the evil Japenese are thinking about bombing an unexpecting army base, Pearl Harbor.The movie then just turns into nothing but action and makes the audience forget that this was real. I didn't feel a connection between Ben and Josh. If could actors just look more like they hate each other or didn't enjoy working together. Kate has a good performance, but unfortunately is not supported well by the other actors. The Japenese are made out to be total villains, even though what they did was wrong, but the movie might as well just should made them into those villains from the old James Bond flicks. The movie just doesn't work and doesn't deserve respect in any way historically.1/10",1.0,Anonymous,History

"Pretty good, but what's up with the love triangle?","After I first watched this movie, I loved it. However, I realized later that this film isn't very good. Here you have a movie about historical Pearl Harbor, however 3/4 of it is about a silly little love triangle. You're starting to get off track from the story. I think it was good to have a love story in there about waiting for her soldier to come back to her. When they added his friend in there it became about really stupid fights and to top it all off they added in the predicament of the girl being pregnant. This movie is entitled Pearl Harbor, so why don't you make it more about Pearl Harbor. Also, I don't know all the history about Pearl Harbor and the Dolittle Raid, but I've heard from some that a few parts of the history are way off. Perhaps they tried not to make it like Tora Tora Tora, but the love story that they had was a bad idea. But I will say that the special effects were awesome! If you have the 2-disk DVD, you should watch the special features because it's very interesting. Even though I hate the love story, it's actually not a bad movie.

A movie worth seeing that redeems itself despite awkward love story,"Having just returned from seeing Pearl Harbor in Dallas, my mind is still spinning from the incredible action sequences and stress that comes with opening one's self to the emotion of war. However, it took about 30 minutes before I decided I would continue watching the movie.The love story in the beginning was ineffective in its awkward way of dragging the viewer through a series of short scenes, then pouring on a dramatic musical score like syrup and including romantic dialogue that is reserved for the *end* of most love stories. The audience has no real attachment or concern for these characters before it is expected to feel deeply for them.But, the movie redeems itself with truly stunning action sequences. I am unaware how historically accurate they were, but in my opinion the movie portrayed the Japanese with a great deal of respect. Notice the Japanese-American military men helping to decode messages for the U.S. and working in the hospital. As for Cuba Gooding, Jr., I believe his character, though placed somewhat clumsily into the script, served to remind the audience of the often-ignored African Americans who aided the war effort.All in all, the movie has some cheesy moments and is flawed in its attempt at romantic sentiment. It is also, however, gripping in its action, moving, patriotic, respectful of many groups (women, African Americans, Japanese), and worth the price of the movie ticket.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Doesn't hold a candle to Saving Private Ryan,"STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsIt was interesting to see how blockbuster meistros Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay would make an action oriented film without all the modern,high tech gadgets,and Pearl Harbor showed the result of this.But it still can't beat the sincere humanity and internal fulfillingness of the best war film of recent years,Saving Private Ryan,released three years ago in 1998.But there are other problems hampering Pearl Harbor as well.The love story is cliched,the acting is hammy and there are long,boring parts.However,during the attack sequence,the special effects,which,let's face it,are what a large majority of the audience have come to see it for,truly deliver.Certainly not oscar worthy,but entertaining eye candy at history's expense all the same.***",,Anonymous,History
Another puff piece from the master of puff,"Given the choice between producing a popular film and a great film, producer Jerry Bruckheimer (Armageddon, Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop, ConAir) will always choose the popular film.  He is nothing if not consistent.  His films always make lots of money and seldom deliver much more than slick eye candy for the masses.  Bruckheimer has a golden opportunity to depart from his blockbuster mentality with this film, but he goes with his business instincts rather than taking a chance with a filmmaker's approach.  The result is another big budget crowd pleaser with a cotton candy plot and terrific battle scenes, aided by impressive digital effects.The script by Randall Wallace of `Braveheart' fame is the biggest problem. Wallace is clearly capable of writing an engaging script, but that obviously isn't what the boss wanted.  It seems that Bruckheimer has Titanic envy and tries to use the same formula of wrapping a piece of history around a love story.  Either that or he is trying to follow in the footsteps of `From Here to Eternity', the much acclaimed 1953 story that occurs as a prelude to the attack on Pearl Harbor.  However, FHTE did not pretend to be a story ABOUT Pearl Harbor, and only included the attack as another disruptive event in an emotionally tumultuous story.  While FHTE was a gripping and powerful story of love, hatred, lust and honor, PH is a trite and predictable love story that serves an interminable prelude to 30 minutes of terrific battle scenes. The inadvertent love triangle between best friends could have been predicted by a teenager (which seemed to be the target audience of this film, based on the PG rating and the sappy dialogue).  And of course the resolution of the dilemma is just as neat and obvious.  Personally, I would have preferred it if they had killed Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) in the attack and given Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) an opportunity for some real soul searching as they went on their top secret mission.  But such nuance is far too risky for Bruckheimer.Director Michael Bay (Armageddon, The Rock) isn't known for his subtle and insightful direction of human stories.  Bay is known for his explosions, and predictably the human story is bungled while the battle is extraordinary. Bay directs a period piece without much regard for understanding and reproducing the 1940's.  It seems all he cares about is the military angle. The costume design and hair for the girls costumes was merely good while the military costumes are perfect.  Mostly, the '40's feel is missing.  The music is all wrong.  It should have been big band music instead of the standard blockbuster symphonic compositions which did not fit the period at all.  Various details are overlooked, like the fact that well more than half of young adults of that era smoked.  Not one character in the film smoked, nor was there a single cigarette to be found in the nightclub scene.  Rent any film from the forties and fifties and notice how many people smoke. Everybody.  Another thing that is incredible is the fact that Evelyn, who was having morning sickness on December 7 is not showing in mid April, more than four months later.  Perhaps if she were 200 lbs I could believe that, but the lithe Evelyn would have shown more than a little pooch by then.Also missing are the colloquialisms of the day.  Not a single `swell', `dame', `jeepers' or `ain't' in the whole film.  No Brooklyn or Chicago accents.  Everyone speaks perfect twenty first century Funk and Wagnall's College English.The battle scene is a marvel of action filmmaking.  It is highly realistic as a depiction of the battle, but there was a lot of cheating that didn't escape the notice of WWII buffs.  It is pretty amazing that Bruckheimer got so much cooperation from the US government in being able to film in the Harbor.  The government even loaned the production company numerous mothballed ships.  Unfortunately, a lot of them were ships designed and built after WWII and they didn't bother to clean them up in post production. They built a complete digital world and left post WWII ships in the picture.  That is just poor attention to detail in a film that is all about detail.  Still, by any standard, this is fantastic action sequence that could not have been more realistic than had one actually been there.The acting is mixed.  Beckingsale is excellent as Evelyn.  She creates a very appealing romantic figure.  Ben Affleck is too moody and sarcastic in the role.  Josh Hartnett is much better, coming across as far more sincere and relating to his character better than Affleck.  Affleck seems content to play Ben Affleck in uniform rather than trying to actually flesh out a character.Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an excellent performance in a minor role.  Veterans Alec Baldwin and Jon Voight do a marvelous job as Colonel Doolitle and FDR.I rated this film a 6/10 on the strength of the visual effects.  It would have been much better if it had been about Pearl Harbor instead of being a schmaltzy love triangle story that coincided with the attack.  The entire event that is Pearl Harbor is shrouded in intriguing questions.  Did Roosevelt know about the attack in advance and allow it to happen to get us into the war?  Many historical facts indicate that was the case (it is thought to be more than just lucky that the aircraft carriers weren't in the harbor that day).  What was really going on in the minds of the Japanese? Were the diplomatic efforts of the US designed to force the Japanese into attacking us as a matter of honor?  As much as I despise Oliver Stone, this film would have been substantial if it had been done in his docudrama style (without the historical rewrites of course).Instead we have another puff piece by the master of puff.  Thanks Jerry.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Too ambitious, too over hyped","To start I must admit that Pearl Harbor has the most stunning special effects I have yet seen in a film yet.  The visual effects wizards at ILM have really outdone themselves.Now, I enjoyed the first part of the film.  The love story was hokey but acceptable (it really dissolves in the second part though due to poor scripting).  And the attack on Pearl Harbor is an audio and visual feast and I enjoyed it...until I realised that it went on longer than it should of and became repetitious and unnecessary.  The last part of the film became plain brain numbing stupidity and should have been cut short.  Overall, don't take Pearl Harbor as a history lesson, take it as popcorn entertainment.And to Michael Bay, stop trying to be too ambitious, the movie becomes over saturated.  This is WAY too much like James Cameron's Titanic, I'm not going to describe how, see it for yourself.  This is no surprise, as Bay is a wannabe Cameron.  Randall Wallace could have come up with a better script instead of this poor effort.  The dialogue is too clichéd and at times laughable.I give this film an average rating, but only for entertainment value, not for a deep, multi-layered film.  The cast is great, the production values are excellent and the film really is an audio/visual feast, let down by a poor script and over length.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Lest We Forget........,"A magnificantly produced and directed film, highly recommended to see especially on DVD.It is a fact that in 1941 a attack was launched on the US base of Pearl Harbor, and this film correctly in my view portrays the surprise nature of that reality. Interwoven into the history of that attack is the story of the friendship and ultimate love and sacrifice between two boyhood friends. I find this picture compelling and brilliant and am mystified why so many ""critics"" thought otherwise. Done with more gusto, enthusiasm and style than Titanic all the characters come across as interesting human beings and giving, as appropriate, humourous or dramatic performances. And the violent scenes are spectacularly good though horrific.Where this film rates so highly in my respectful view is that it can stand alone as explaining the surprise nature of what is Pearl Harbor, independent from the love story and vice versa. Further, the crux of this movie in post September 11 retrospect is about the failure of intelligence, or perhaps the failure to heed intelligence reports. Well done to the film-makers, please ignore the critics, you have a 10 out of 10 from me!!! -rbrb.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Lots of potential but...,"This movie picked for theme the bombing of Perl Harbor by Japan,an even happening on World War II.Portraying World War II would be the most logic thing to do.But no we are introduced on a pointless romance. The best scenes were by far those including the Battle of England between the British and German airforces,the best at this time.It was a three-dimentional point of view alright.But no remark of the damage done in Britain during the battle. The Japanese were at the time already at war with China before Germany's invade on Poland.They were experienced in war and trying to create an empire including Eastern Asia and most of the Pacific.They had learned to sacrifice for their country and that surrender means dishonorment.By far the most prepared for war.Were in this movie do we see any of this? I would like to see more of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,the greatest among the American presidents.And more of the Battle of the Pacific,which was among the hardest of the war.No we emphasise on a pointless counter-attack. No mention of current events either.Just in December 1941 great changes were happening without at all being mentioned here.On December 5th the Soviets obtain Kalinin while the Germans retreat.It was a disaster for Germany.On December 6th Britain declares war against Finland(alied to the USA and Germany both),Rumania and Hungary.The declaration was an insult to USA.On December 10th Japan invades the Philipines,on December 25th they capture Hong Kong,defeating the British,During the month the Americans continue to retreat against Japan which obtains a number of American islands during the process.Any of this mentioned? The happy ending of the war doesn't even mention the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.In a historical movie accurance plays a great part.In this one not at all.And if you realy want to see a great movie watch Chaplin's a great Dictator.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Most of my friends that hated it, were expecting a war movie with lot's of fighting, shooting, air battles, etc. I should have known when they told me that I should only watch the movie for the special effects that they really weren't into the movie for the story but they just wanted to see a blood and guts type of movie.I really enjoyed the movie, and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great story.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fair to Middlin',"""Pearl Harbor"" seems to elicit passionate opinions on both sides. Some think it's fantastic. Others think it's trash. I'll opt for the in-between.What they tried to do here is use the ""Titanic"" schtick. Take a historical event, whip up a love triangle, throw in a British actress named Kate and -- voila! -- instant success, right?Not really. But it's not as bad as some people say. The attack footage is amazing. It plops you right into the events as they unfold. But man, it takes a looong time to get there.If you rent the DVD and forward right to the fight scenes, you won't miss much. If you choose to sit through the entire movie, just know that it drags in spots, and it undermines its own credibility in scenes like the one where FDR rises from his wheelchair to prove a point. (That never happened.)What bogs down this movie is the amount of time spent setting up the event for which the entire film was made. ""Pearl Harbor"" didn't need to be three hours long. Maybe someday they'll do the opposite of ""Apocalypse Now"" and release a version that's 50 minutes shorter. Until then, keep that fast-forward finger limber.

I've just spent an hour reading all the bad reviews and comments on other boards, and it is amazing how many will not see the film but just KNOW it is horrible.  I was caught up in the story of the farm boys learning to fly and ending up at Pearl on that fateful day.  The romance is not unique, just as the thousands of romances of everyday people were not unique - just real.  The sneak attact (and you have to really hate the U.S.A. to believe it could have been stopped and wasn't) is an intense 45 minutes and by the end had me in tears. People in my age range will probably be caught up in the memories as well. I watched the survivors of Pearl Harbor,who were consulted on their memories for the film, on the History Channel discussing the film and the all agree they are glad the film was made even though it was a ""Hollywood version"" of what happened.  Just see it and decide for yourself.  I gave it a 7 out of ten, so shoot me.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A love triangle with the attack on Pearl Harbor as a backdrop.,"This movie has wonderful special effects and great attention to detail. The love-triangle plot is a bit cloying and the movie is overlong. Although generally historically accurate, there is a considerable amount of poetic license. The anti-climactic Doolittle raid on Tokyo was contrived for the purpose of resolving the love triangle, and, no, fighter pilots were not tapped to participate in a bomber raid. This segment is presented better and more accurately in  ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo"" and Spencer Tracy is a much better Doolittle than the self absorbed Alec Baldwin. Still it is worth a watch and it is a wonderful feel good movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The BD Spotlight,"Some might think I would describe this as a guilty pleasure, but that is not the case. I feel no guilt over enjoying this movie. It grabs my attention and keeps it throughout. I grow to care about the characters and I feel the scale and tragedy of the depicted events. There is a difference between good history and a good film. Pearl Harbor just happens to be only the latter. I can suspend my beliefs and sense of realism for a few hours in order to watch a movie for what it is. Perfectly imperfect is just fine with me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible movie worth seeing.,"I would recommend this movie to anyone. I think this movie is worth the price of admission. However, I would warn anyone who is about to see this movie that this is a bad movie. There is no question about it. This movie is contrived, bereft of inspiration and originality, laughably cliché, mawkish, under edited, and worst of all it is a testament to bad dialogue.You never for a moment believe the love story involving Rafe and Evelyn. Rafe (Ben Affleck) seems to fall in love with Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) because she is beautiful. Evelyn seems to fall in love with Rafe because he is pathetically persistent and has a cute butt. There is no intelligent and substantial foundation for a romance. Instead of writing in the substance needed for a romance the movie tries to induce romance using dramatic music, slow motion, all sorts of romantic clichés. The effect is that the love story becomes nauseatingly mawkish. You don't believe me? In one scene Evelyn tells Rafe, `I will never be able to look at another sunset without thinking of you.'The second love story between Evelyn and Danny (Josh Hartnett) was a lot better yet it got a lot less time. The reasons they have for falling in love are a little more complicated and interesting. Strangely the best love story, the only one that moved me was the one involving Betty (James King) and a stuttering sailor. That got the least time.The dialogue is phenomenally bad. Throughout the movie I kept wondering how a professional writer could possibly produce such unnatural, cliché-ridden dialogue. I suspect someone held a gun to Randall Wallace's head as he wrote the screenplay. Let me give you an example of a cliché. There is a scene in the movie where Evelyn runs to the train station at the last minute to find that Rafe is already on a train about to leave. The old lovers at the train station scene! Can you believe it? I couldn't. I started laughing. There were at least five points in the movie where the dialogue was so stunningly appalling it actually made me laugh out loud. Lawyers can be disbarred, doctors can lose their licenses, can't screenwriters be thrown out of the screenwriters guild? I am not exaggerating the dialogue in the screenplay is that bad.By now you are probably wondering why I would recommend a movie that has what I claim is probably one of the worst screenplays ever. I recommend this movie because the actual attack on Pearl Harbor is that good. You have to see it in a theater, just like you have to see the ship sink in `Titanic', or the battle scenes in `Saving Private Ryan.' The scenes allow you to see things so horrifying that you could never have imagined them. Before this movie I had read about the bombing of Pearl Harbor but I had never felt anything. ILM's brilliant work allowed me to experience what it's like to see people incinerated by bombs, to see sailors clinging to a sinking battleship, to see people being cut to pieces by strafing fighter planes. Now Pearl Harbor feels tragic to me and I have a new respect for the people who suffered through that atrocity.I recommend that anyone interested in this movie simply arrive about an hour late, just in time to see the bombing. After the bombing scene you should just run out of the theater as though it were being attacked by Japanese fighter planes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Fantastic, despite some hollywoodisms","Despite some obvious changes to make it a hollywood movie, Pearl Harbor is fantastic.  Fantastic computer graphics team up with real life action shots to make you think the attack had actually happened all over again.The romance triangle between the lead actors adds a sensitive, if not tragic touch to the movie and I have to say that the lead actress has the most gorgeous eyes.For somebody who is after a true action film, speckled with a touching romance, then don't miss this film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
How they wrecked a good movie..,"Are you familiar with the term 'addition by subtraction' ? Well that saying is the ultimate definition of this movie. Why the producers of this film allowed it to be ruined with an absolutely pitiful, and absurd love story puzzles me. There was more ""Hollywood"" in this movie than even Hollywood should tolerate. The factual events that occurred were depicted well, with amazing authenticity and reality, and would have been more than enough to make this movie work. However, each time the movie strayed form the actual event, the production suffered miserably. If you can get past the totally un-believable Hollywood mish-mosh this film is not too bad. But, it could have been so much better. Please keep in mind it is over 3 hours long... hey somebody bring back the intermission !",7.0,Anonymous,History

Will Definitely Make a Case for Biggest Bust of the Decade.,"Oh gosh a pure disaster of a film that is to the 2000s what ""Dune"" was to the 1980s and ""Wyatt Earp"" was to the 1990s. A totally disappointing would-be masterpiece that never does find its way and bores with a sappy love story more than it intrigues with a loud and empty action sequence that is interminable. It is 1941 and the U.S. is on dangerous ground as the attack on Pearl Harbor looms as Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale fall in love, but when it appears that Affleck is dead, Beckinsale starts to fall in love with his best friend (Josh Hartnett). A torrid love triangle gets in the way of the tenseness that made ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" such an interesting, albeit under-achieving, production. The attack comes, oh does it ever come, and Pearl Harbor is left in shambles. So now Affleck and Hartnett must put their differences aside when the U.S. couter-attacks in the almost unknown Dolittle Raid (which is not written about much because it too was such a disaster for the U.S. military). A long and sometimes incredibly dull film that does best when Cuba Gooding, Jr. is on screen. He co-stars as an African-American sailor who tries to earn respect from his contemporaries in a military that is fueled by racial unrest. Gooding, Jr.'s character is based on a real person who actually shot down several Japanese attack planes and was awarded a medal that was later taken back by the government. That possibly intriguing story is only given a minute glimpse as Michael Bay gets carried away with corny special effects and Randall Wallace's irritating screenplay. A major downer of epic proportions. 2.5 out of 5 stars.",,Anonymous,History

This film should be at the bottom of Pearl Harbor,"Wow. Where to begin? When I sat down to watch this movie I didn't know what to expect. I thought it would be halfway decent at best. Well, I was wrong. Way wrong. The movie is so long and drawn out it's terrible. You just sit there and think to yourself, ""why am I watching this and why should I care about what's going on?"" There is NO plot that's worth while and NO depth to the characters. It's just a bunch of Hollywood garbage. The love story and the war were not tied together enough. Actually, they weren't tied together at all. It was like there were two stories going on at once that have nothing to do with each other. The movie is called Pearl Harbor, but it wasn't about Pearl Harbor, it was about a romance that has no depth. Blah. Boring. The only decent scene is when the ships are being blown apart. Wonderful. And I love how Hollywood film makers add in garbage to spice things up. Like the dog fight with the American planes and the Zero's. That never happened. Atleast make something that's SOMEWHAT historically accurate. No history No story. No depth. No plot. Gotta love the special effects, though! BOOM! BANG! POW!

Great Cast! Great Characters! Great Effects! Good Acting.,"We really enjoyed this movie.  With Parents who survived WW2 and lived through many things during the war, many of us have much to appreciate.Pearl Harbor has a Great Cast- Great Characters- Great Effects and some very good acting. Yes, this is a real Michael Bay film.  Yes, we waited a few weeks to see it because of some of the reviews and comments but it was very worth seeing.The first hour was necessary contrary to some whiners.  This is not a documentary.  They had to give us people to understand, know something about and feel what makes them up.  Very good acting by all.  Great acting by Ben, Josh, Kate and Cuba to name a few.  All true Stars. No Academy award performances but close.Kate Beckensdale should land more movies after this excellent role. Not just be cause she is incredibly beautiful but because she can act too.The movie was long but so was the war with Japan.  The story keeps you hooked right up to the end.  Rooting for everyone.

"See for the attack, nothing else.","As i say above, this is really only worth seeing for the attack itself which just about tops Titanic in the effects department.  (In one small scene it just about tries to replecate it with the sinking of the US Arizona).  I still have yet to find anything to top Saving Private Ryan or Thin Red Line on this score, but a very commendable effort.But the rest of the film severely lets it down.  The love triangle is very clumsy and overcooked.  Cuba Gooding Jr couldnt have played cornball any better if he'd tried.  Although the score is a great piece of music you just know it was designed to try and crank up the emotional aspect and eek out a few more tears.  Put simply, cut from its three hours to a leaner two hour all out actioner would have been wise.",6.0,Anonymous,History
What exactly was the point of this film?,"Put extremely attractive young men and women into the fashions of 1941 but with the moral attitudes of the 21st century, add special effects, completely throw out any basis in actual fact in order to get an emotional reaction from the audience (here the film succeeds for all the wrong reasons), add a few rousing speeches, and you have Pearl Harbor. The only good thing about this film are the special effects, and even then I prefer the more primitively done Tora,Tora,Tora from thirty years before because it actually tells the truth about what led up to the raid in painstaking detail, actually taking the time to show what is going on with both the Japanese and the Americans and the mistakes and misjudgments made on both sides. If you want steamy love scenes and nicely done explosions and graphics, watch this film. If you want to be entertained while learning something about history watch Tora, Tora, Tora. You won't regret it.Just one word about the commentary track if you get the DVD. The best thing about DVDs of films directed by Michael Bay are the commentary tracks. Hearing this track, I could easily see where some of the bad dialogue came from. The problem is that Michael Bay interviewed many Pearl Harbor veterans, and he used the expressions they used in the movie. There's 125 different personalities crammed into a few characters that are spewing the bad dialogue. I'm guessing Mr. Bay took all the expressions these people said and had two or three characters say everything. So all the clichéd expressions the veterans used during their lives are shoved into 3 hours. That's my take anyway. Mr. Bay does admit that one thing he would change if he could would be the earnest dialogue because the younger people seem to think it's corny.The DVD is very cheap to purchase at this point, and is worth it for the commentary track alone.",4.0,Anonymous,History

It wasn't that bad,"I think it wasn't that bad. I was expecting an awful movie because of the comments found in this database. Before I walked in the cinema I was worried about the love story because I hate when movie makers insert stupid love stories into would-be good movies. I think the love story in the Titanic was more stupid than the one on Pearl Harbor. I hated the love story in the Titanic, I think it was very silly.I enjoyed Pear Harbor despite all the negative comments I have read before. I was ready to leave the cinema if the movie became unbearable but instead I found myself enjoying it. The action part, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, was fantastic and very real. As I said, the love story was bearable but I hated the scene when this couple make love at the air base. That was really an stupid setting for making love, specially totally naked. Definitely this movie won't be nominated for the Oscars. I think the director lost a great opportunity to make a better movie with all that money.

Could you care any less for the characters?,"I was very leary when I saw the previews for Pearl Harbor.  Each preview showed the same thing, the bombing.  And because of the producers, I was wondering if that part was even going to be good.  Since those two have a reputation for ""bang bang blow them up"" type movies.  I always wondered what is the rest of the movie about, since all they show is the bombing in the previews.  Well I found out last night why they only showed those parts!The movie is in 4 sections really.  The first is a little background on the two main characters (Affleck and Hartnett).  Then the love story begins. And I have nothing wrong with love stories.  In ""Enemy at the Gates"" there was a love story and it was well done.  But the love story in Pearl Harbor lacked emotion.  While watching I could truly care less about the characters, because the love story was so weak and that was the only place to meet the characters.  The only thing that kept me in my seat is the foreshadowing to the bombing.  The scenes with the Japanese planning the attack to me was great.  It added a lot of suspense and really created a tension that the love story lacked.The next part was the bombing.  This part was AWESOME.  Very well made.  YOu couldnt really tell it was CG, unlike some movies - cough - Mummy Returns - cough.  The dog fights were good and it was just a good part of the movie.  Now at this point I thought the movie was over.  And that they put the love story in to make the movie longer.  But in fact there was another 40 minutes.This 40 minutes consisted of the two characters (Affleck and Hartnett) going to be apart of the Doolittle project.  This two was a good part of the movie.  I think if they had not put so much time into the love story the movie would not have been so drastically long and would have gotten a higher rating from me.  The movie could have stood on it's own without the love crap.  Go see it.  It is worth it, but make sure you have 3 hours.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Boring! Boring! Boring!,"I'd give this comic book level history lesson a ""zero""{ not the plane} if I could. This film was obviously made for an audience that has no conception on what ""Pearl"" was all about, and will probably never know the real facts due to the politically correct blame America first attitude in contemporary left-wing dominated Hollywood.Basically it's a love story set against the events. None of the actors show a real sense or clue on what lifestyle was all about at that time.They seem way, way too modern. Their characters have contemporery feel that is totally out of place for the era.Not really too much you can say about them, except that they are very shallow and very, very boring.. Then there are the events themself, which almost seem like an afterthought. The planes fly in, bomb their targets and escape while we are caught with our pants down. The much ballyhooed air raid sequence looks more like a video gamoe or a sequence from ""Star Wars"" with all the CGI effects looking exactly like what they are. And how 'bout the part where FDR miraculously rises out of his wheelchair on his own? I'm surprised there wasn't a haleullah chorus and ""praise the Lord"" after that!There are so many anachronisms in this film that you can drive the proverbial Mack truck through them. Especially offesive are the US navy ships that were not launched until at least 30 years after the facts! Since the producers went CGI with it, why couldn't they do it right? I can go on and on ,but you get the picture. If you want the real facts, see ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"", There may be a few errrors there, but at least they got it right.

Incredible War Epic. The hate is obviously unwarranted.,"The film is one of the best War films, the history and story telling are great, sure there's some goofs & inaccuracies but it's bound to happen, not to mention this is an action movie so some leeway on historical accuracy can be expected. The movie really immerses the viewer in the chaotic action of the day and the gripping details of war. The cinematography is well done and the details of the ships and other aspects are really solid as well, a few inaccuracies but it doesn't ruin the overall feel of the movie.I know the love triangle detracts from the seriousness of the day and some might have an issue with this Hollywood aspect being inserted into such an important historical event but when considered overall it doesn't detract enough to say it was a bad movie.Final thought is, this is a great historical action movie that covers one of the most important events in history and in WWII, if you really let something as trivial as a love triangle ruin it for you that's pretty sad. The movie is one of my favourite war films.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Deep Independance Titanic Armageddon Harbour hits theaters - Who cares?,"Do we really need a three hour exploration of a love triangle with a Pearl Harbour background?  Thats what this movie is - do not be decieved by the trailers - this is not ""Saving Pearl Harbour"". It is the same as every single other big blockbuster.  You basically have two seperate movies - one with a hackneyed, cliched, ""I've seen this about a million times"" love triangle between two young friends and the woman they love, and the other a kick-ass action sequence which accurately portrays the complete and utter surprise the Japanese caught the Americans in.  The lines in the first hour and a half are SO CHEESY - but not GOOD cheese.  I can't believe Ben Affleck did not crack up saying his lines, they are that bad. ""I may be going to die, but thinking of you is what will keep me alive.  I can't die - I've only just met you.""  That is the caliber of dialogue between Affleck and Beckinsdale.I have to say, once the action heats up, and the planes start coming, the movie moves into what it should have been all along - get rid of the love story between the three main stars - concentrate on the horror and shock the attack inflicted on the American troops.  The producers and directors got this right - Pearl Harbour was caught not just with their pants down, but off, hanging on the chair, and neatly folded.  Problem is, you've been lulled to sleep by the horrible dialogue, cheesy acting and bad script, that the attack loses some of the punch it otherwise might have had.  Thats not to say its not powerful, but the people behind Saving Private Ryan had it right - shock the hell out of the viewers FIRST, then insert great story (Bruckheimer would have to get a good story before he tries it, but its not in this cookie-cutter movie).  Also, the bit with Cuba Gooding Jr.?  Did that not seem horribly tacked on to you?  Did it have ANYTHING to do with the rest of the movie, except to get another big name (not to mention black) star into the movie?  I'm sure the story of his character - the first black man to win the Silver Star - is an interesting one, but its just kind of thrown in there, as a side show (I kept seeing ""TOKEN BLACK MOMENT"" flash across the screen for some reason - this story deserved more emphasis and care then the producers gave it here - I feel sorry for Cuba..)In short, you've seen the movie before.  But at least Titanic had the cool bad guy.  Everyone in this movie is so whiny (Titanic also had Kate Winslet naked, but Beckinsdale expects us to believe she would make love with the man of her dreams with her UNDERWEAR ON...not terribly important, but another stupid moment in a stupidly conceived movie..).  Its worth going on cheap night to see the action, and the final moments with the squadron of B-17s attacking Tokyo (a little known historical tidbit dealt with quite well, and an aviation feat quite spectacular), but it doesn't overcome the first hour.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Leave it to Michael Bay to give action a bad name.,"First. This movie had great sets and decent actors and could have been something more than just window dressing if not for one major fly in the ointment...MICHAEL #@!$ING BAY!!! Why does this no talent hack continue to get work? I'll tell you why, because he has a sure fire formula working for him. He signs on to big budget flicks loaded with oodles of special effects and he knows all he has to do is launch all of the effects on the screen and people will pay big bucks to see it. Never mind the fact that every other element he is in charge of is going to suffer irrevocably. The Michael Bay motto seems to be, Bells and whistles to the point of irritation. I have never seen a movie of his yet where you couldn't stop groaning at the tired clichés, shotgun editing, and junior high dialouge.Pearl Harbor, I think, Is a special turd in the Michael Bay kitty litter box. Not only is it too long, its too trite, too hokey, too dull and too saturated with missteps that only a joke of a director like MB can perpetrate.

can't say it's awful,"Maybe it's because I watched it with little or no expectation, but I thought this film was OK. Great visuals, cool effects and just plain nice to look at. You could've freeze-framed many scenes and used them as wall painting. I loved the aerial shots of the planes flying over the blue ocean through the smoke in-between the burning ships. Really cool. Sure it was a little long, the pacing could've been quicker and the script better, but it was still fun to watch. Maybe it would've worked better as a (big budget) television mini-series. The pacing and sub-plots made me feel like it was one. And the retelling of the events leading up to, during and after the Pearl Harbor attack seemed fairly accurate, except for the side story about the love triangle of course. Even the Doolittle Raid, which I had thought was Hollywood's creation added to quickly give the audience something to cheer about, was an actual event that happened.

"Okay, but not a blockbuster","I was not overly impressed with Bruckheimer and Bay's project which has been hyped for so many months. It is a solid picture, certainly, but I could feel it being pulled in so many different directions that it was unable to become a war movie, or a love story, or a story of the triumph of the human spirit, all of which it attempted to be. You've basically seen all the effects before (some were taken almost verbatim from ""Saving Private Ryan"") and I felt that the love story, while good, needed to be something else. Either it needed to *be* the whole film, with the war as a background, or it needed to be left to the wayside entirely and instead concentrate on the tactics and emotions of war.In any case, the movie is worth a look, but I don't think it deserves the hype it's been getting.

I thought it was OK for Danny and her to get together only because it was three months after they thought that Rafe had died but to show us that Rafe and her got together at the end it made me think that she was flip flopping. Plus she lied to Danny when he said that he thought that she loved Rafe more that she loved him, and she said i love YOU Danny.

It's pretty bad,"I don't agree with the people who say this is one of the worst movies ever.  But I certainly don't agree with those who praise it as an underrated gem either.  It's in between for me - good special effects, decent acting, but a shallow storyline.""Pearl Harbor"" is ""Star Wars: Episode II"" a year early.  It's got stupid leads (though Affleck, at least, does decent, despite his stupid accent), an unbelieveable romance, and special effects to take your mind off the cheeziness of the goings-on.What this film has that Episode II doesn't is a good period feel.  Not every scene has a computer animated background.I do agree that the movie pretty much sucks up to the Pearl Harbor attack, and is okay afterwards, but as a whole, this is decent.I'll give it a 6/10 (what I gave for Episode II), because it's enjoyable, though shallow.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"Rent Tora, Tora Tora!","Weak, weak, weak. The battle set-pieces are well-done, but the ultra-contrived storyline is so very bad, you just don't care about the people getting bombed - they're just so much CGI filler. Ben Affleck turns in another square-jawed yet numbingly dull performance. Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale are far better, but can't rise above the material. Done far more effectively with far more primitive effects capabilities in ""Tora Tora Tora!""  Rent that and avoid this turkey. In fact, avoid any food Michael Bay has touched.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Don't waste your time ...,"... one of the worst films ever produced: sneaky evil Japanese warriors attack American hero fighters. What an unbelievable stupid script with this annoying love story.

My Review,"Events in history, in my opinion, can never be captured into a movie, at least not with full effect. However, Pearl Harbor does a great job at it. Although the first little while in the movie can be a bit boring to some people, it caught my interest. And when the action finally starts, it never stops. Bombs fly, planes soar, and machine guns mow soldiers down. I didn't experience the attack on Pearl Harbor, nor did anyone in my family, but I can imagine it was something extremely close to this movie. I'm sure that nurses and doctors in hospitals were swamped with half-dying people, and I'm positive that any soldier rushed to a plane so he can take action in the war. I gave this movie an 8 because in my opinion the movie was a little too long. I've watched this movie once in it's entirety, and everytime I sit down to watch it again I think, ""I don't want to watch this whole movie again."" But other than that I have no problems at all with this movie, I think Pearl Harbor is a great film and deserves more credit than people give it.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Boys-own stuff,"I did not know what i was going to make of this film at first, it's competing against a truly great film in 'Tora, Tora, Tora', and it certainly did not reach those heights, of the three principal leads only Mr Affleck and Miss Beckinsale were known to myself. Whilst mr Affleck indulged in his usual all-American super-hero persona (surely he needs to expand his range at some point), Miss Beckinsale was a real disappointment.  No depth to the performance, and no empathy with the time or location, not that the script helped, some of the lines made me grind my teeth with horror.""I'll give my heart to ..., but i'll never look at another sunset without thinking of you""?!?!A line i think you'd agree that would have had the pesky japs running for cover if it had been uttered on Honolulu radio on the night of the 6th December 1941.

A real scholar of the war would have had few quibbles most of the ships destroyed seemed to have been of a distinctly modern vintage, for a film that threw money about like it was going out of fashion, i don't understand why they did not hire some World War 2 era U.S. ships off a third world navy. Still this was minor, the aerial combat sequences especially those done with the Spitfires and ME109's were fantastic, the special effects team should be a shoo in for an oscar nomination at the very least.

What's the problem??,"I've read more than enough negative reviews of Pearl Harbor to last until next summer's blockbuster comes out. Apparently, looking for the good elements in a  film is old-fashioned and naive, but I found plenty to appreciate in this film.The cast is charming, funny, and believable. The stars are, perhaps, too attractive, but this is the way almost every movie is cast. Why rake Pearl Harbor over the coals for choosing appealing actors? The characters are memorable, and real, despite some cornball dialogue. Were all the critics expecting Shakespearian complexity in a big-budget re-creation of 1941? Even a less-than-poetic script can't diminish the impact made by this fine cast, who give the ""greatest generation"" an accessible, familiar face.Pearl Harbor's romanticized look at pre-war America certainly misses the mark on historical accuracy, in favor of beautiful shots and a politically-tactful summary of world events that led America into war. If the film had concentrated on facts and figures, it would have been an expensive documentary, and an obvious rip-off of ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Instead, Pearl Harbor gets involved with a group of people who lived through an extraordinary period of world history. It gives the audience,  especially young adults, the impetus to seek out more information about the attack on December 7, and World War II as a whole. Even those who criticize the film have been motivated to examine its flaws and to exhort the public to learn the ""real"" story of Pearl Harbor. Education and awareness of America's past is a positive outcome, regardless of the critical review of a film.As for the motivation behind Pearl Harbor, I must admit this is the weakest point. The film was not made for love of country, but for love of money. Released on Memorial Day weekend, in the year that will see the 60th anniversary of the attack, Pearl Harbor was carefully calculated to be a success. It is not as visionary and artistically inspiring as it should be, but it can be appreciated on its own merits.The film is touching and well-acted. It succeeds as a love story, a war epic and an action spectacular. It is well worth the price of admission, and is a fine addition to the ranks of WWII films from Hollywood's past.Rated 8 of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
everyone's being really harsh about this one...,"There's no way that this is the huge turkey that everyone keeps saying it is. okay, jerry's gone mad on the budget, and michael bay cuts like edward scissorhands, but there is a good movie in their somewhere. I am sometimes choked by the American style cheese that seems to ooze out of the flick, but it seems to represent that era reasonably well(as far as i know).The scenes of stuff exploding are great. It does feel at times like armageddon and the rock however. Michael bay perhaps hasn't learned all that much in the way of varying his style. He might not replace Kubrick just yet, but he does alright considering the subject.Again, everyone is calling it a waste of money. I pay the same to see any movie so I don't really care what it cost to make.

There was not even a hint that the American aircraft carriers, which were at sea and not in the Harbor at Pearl when it was attacked, were of concern to either the Japanese or the American military commands.

What was so different from what we were intended to see, to what we were forced to see?  Was it not marketable enough?  Was it actually quality writing?  What made this different...??Pearl Harbor failed on the same level as Armageddon.  The filmmakers actually thought that a small amount of action wasn't as important as a hokey love story, just a b**tardization of their own history..Buena Vista must think that their marketing schemes work as well..

I doubt any fliers flew down along streets between buildings during the Pearl Harbor attack.  I think the models in Tora, Tora, Tora were more realistic that the real modern-day ships they used in some of the explosion scenes, which were obviously not from the 1940's.

Worthy of the hype,"Billed as one of the blockbusters of the summer, Pearl Harbor provided three hours of entertainment with a few special nuggets and relatively few gaffes.  Although audiences will probably remember this film for its epic battle sequences, it was the emotions and the thought-provoking situations that made this movie a success.  This film fulfills the World War II combat film genre without resorting to many of its clichés.  The film may not be 100% historically accurate, but it gives a good example of the kinds of things that did happen.  Ben Affleck delivers a spell-binding performance as the film's hero.  He keeps it real by bringing out the character's weaknesses in addition to his strengths.   The plot kept the film moving, so the three hours literally flew by.  However, the love-triangle scenario gets too predictable at the end, and at times you wonder if the characters feel the same emotions of the tragedy of war that the audience is feeling.  The dialogue seemed a bit contrived in places, and a couple of lines seem to be lifted straight from previous World War II combat films.  The narrator at the end of the film is entirely unnecessary.  Rather than using the more effective technique of letting the audience decide for themselves what to take away from the film, the narrator tries to tell the audience what to think and fails by overdramatizing everything and sounding like a history lecturer.  One thing this movie did not contain was a prejudice toward the Japanese.  For the most part, the treatment was very even-handed by showing the Japanese pilots preparing for the attack and giving some of Japan's reasoning behind the attack.  The little prejudice that is shown should be taken as an accurate portrayal of the times rather than the bias of the filmmakers.  Overall, this movie definitely lives up to the hype.  The epic battle scenes and the moving post-battle scenes are worth the price of admission themselves.",7.0,Anonymous,History

An excellent movie!,"The day of May 25th dawned. I was planning on attending opening night of Pearl Harbor with one of my good friends, Laura. We counted down the entire day, giggling and thinking with smiles that we would see Ben and Josh in uniform very soon. Well, we got to see them in uniform, but we got much more...Laura and I seated ourselves in the theater. We were pretty quiet, but talked about our friends, other movies, food, etc. to pass the time. I noticed by the fact that the theater was huge that this movie was going to be something. But I didn't pay much notice of it except for that observation. Then, the previews rolled, the lights dimmed, and the theater grew silent...then I watched...Several times while I was watching, I kept saying to myself ""Are you really watching this? This is Pearl Harbor! The most talked about movie all year..."" I remembered the bad reviews, e.g. Rotten Tomatoes, and wondered how they could beat on a movie that was so wonderful. It was completely lost on me. I said to myself ""Were they even watching the movie?""As the movie ended, the lights came on, the credits rolled, and Faith Hill's unutterably beautiful song ""There You'll Be"" sounded from the speakers, I noticed the people were having a very difficult time getting up from their chairs, as I was. My hands were cupped around my chin, and I turned to Laura. She was wiping tears from her eyes. I finally got out of my seat quietly, as people began to exit the theater. Laura coughed, and said ""So how about we shoot all those people that gave this bad reviews?"" I heartily agreed, laughing.We stumbled up the stairs and outside, talking nonstop about how great the movie was. I took note that everyone walking out of the theater seemed to be having my difficulty walking, and I saw many wiping tears from their eyes and saying how awesome the movie was.Now, I'm no critic, but I have to say that this movie was probably the best I've seen in a long time. It ran the gamut from an epic-journey of grandeur, to a small-town tale of romance and heroism. The cast was stellar and refreshing. Ben Affleck shined in his role as Rafe, and delivered his lines wonderfully. Josh Hartnett was perfect for his role as well, as Danny Walker. He was both believeable and tremendously realistic. For Kate Beckinsale, this movie could be her big break. I was touched by her heroism and courage, and I felt my heart ache for her the entire time.Major kudos to Michael and Jerry, who were stars of this film without even being onscreen. They directed this movie very well, and the action scenes were phenomenal! Absolutely mind-blowing...astounding...I couldn't believe how good they were. They certainly did not disappoint.All in all...this is a masterpiece film. Critics trashed it...my friends trashed it...but I loved it. Ironic, I know.

Sink or Swim,"`Pearl Harbor' Sink or SwimThe film `Pearl Harbor,' opening Friday across the United States, will stir up more controversy than did the film the 1970 film `Tora! Tora! Tora!'. The 1970 film was far less biased than the new Touchstone Pictures film; it showed the attack from both the American and Japanese sides. The new film emphasizes a love story throughout the film between Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale) and two Army Air Corps pilots, Rafe and Danny (Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett). The film gives us 40 minutes of special effects action.The problem studios run into when either period pieces and/or culturally sensitive films are made is getting `it' right.  `It' is historical events in the proper sequence, correct historical figures, dates, and the like. In the case of films involving different cultures, depicting the characters of a particular culture is a sensitive undertaking due to stereotyping and personal biases.I grew up in Hawaii and clearly remember `Tora! Tora! Tora!' being filmed. The sight of fake Imperial Japanese Naval aircraft flying over Pearl Harbor and Hickam Air Force Base raised concerns and no doubt many memories from almost 30 years ago. The concerns at the time were not for the safety of island residents expecting another Pearl Harbor attack, but that the local island residents and tourists population which was majority Asian would not take offense to such a film being made. Concerns were put to rest when it was learned that the film would show both sides viewpoints in the attack, the film having American and Japanese screenwriters and directors accomplished this.`Pearl Harbor' is an American film, made for hard-core biased American audiences. The film is not meant to be even handed in its judgment of the Japanese actions before, during, and after the attack. Unlike the 1970 film, which was generally well balanced representing both sides, `Pearl Harbor' stereotypes all Japanese as being enemies of the United States. The studio has already felt the backlash from Asian American civil rights organizations; the Japanese American Citizens League (JACL) has voiced its alarm over the potential hatred and actions that may come from this film.We will see in the next couple of weeks how the studios handle any fallout that may occur as a result of the film. Touchstone Pictures parent company Disney is releasing the film in slightly different versions in Japan and Germany, emphasizing romance over battle. This was a very expensive film to make; one source of potential loss of revenue may be in the Asian film marketplace, where typically American action films do well. One interesting item is that if the film is not seen as an insult to Japanese people in the Asian marketplace, then it may be seen as a patriotic film in the sense that Japan kicked the stuffing out of the United States and that the romance in the film is secondary. This idea may play well in Japan, but for Japanese and Japanese Americans residing here in the United States this film may lead to a renewal of stereotyping and hatred.  Lets hope that one biased film doesn't rehash a 60-year old wound.",6.0,Anonymous,History
High Gloss Hollywood Eye Candy For The Brain Dead,"At one point during the attack at Pearl Harbor, a character says, ""I think World War II just started!""--ignoring the fact that no one used the term at the time. This is rather typical of the movie as a whole: obviously improbable, often flatly impossible, and flogging every cliché to the nth degree.Although it markets itself as a highly authentic depiction of the events leading up to and the attack on Pearl, PEARL HARBOR is essentially a three hour long and extremely improbable soaper about a love triangle between two friends and a navy nurse. This plot line, which occupies the first third of the film, asks us to believe the proverbial six impossible things before breakfast and predictably reaches a peak just in time for the Japanese attack. The second third of the film shows the attack itself.Although the attack at Peal Harbor is an exciting bit of film-making, it is really here that the film falls completely apart, asking us to believe that the two male leads not only manage to get their planes off the ground, perform all sorts of acrobatics, blow Japanese Zeros all over the sky, and then land safely to return to the woman they love. As if this is not absurd enough, the film then goes on to send both men off on the Doolittle Raid on Japan itself.By this point the men have been childhood friends, gone to flight school together, become pilots together, been through Pearl, and are now crash landing in China--and I began to wonder why they were bothering with the nurse; given that their primary interests seemed to be in each other they might as well have dropped their drawers and gotten in bed with each other too. Indeed, such a turn of events would have at least added a touch of curiosity value to this otherwise dreary bit of high-gloss cinematic nonsense.The DVD contains a History Channel documentary re Pearl Harbor that is very good, a ""Making Of"" documentary that is disgracefully and distastefully self-congratulatory, and a number of other extras, some of which you will need a computer to access. The picture quality and sound are excellent throughout. Sadly, the movie itself is not.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",1.0,Anonymous,History
boring and flat,"I found Pearl Harbor impossible to watch all the way through. I read a review of it which suggested that in terms of plot, it could have easily been a soap opera called ""The Pearl of the Harbor"" and I have to agree. Plus, I felt as if someone simply forgot that even megabucks productions need a little editing. Or in this case, a lot. It would have been much more tolerable at 100 minutes.Editing or not, the script was the biggest weakness. No depth, no real character development, no decent dialog for much of the time, and no fun moments at all! Come on, even the Big Boat movie had some fun lines! Few, but still... Of course, I should have realized what I was in for considering Randall Wallace also wrote the ridiculously overrated Braveheart, which was an even bigger waste of time than PH. (Though high in terms of unintentional comedy, something Pearl does not have going for it.)All actors - including those who can't act - are sadly wasted, ranging from Hartnett who's been better in every movie I've ever seen him in, to Affleck who's usually more entertaining, the underused Cuba Gooding Jr. (where have you gone, Rod Tidwell?) and on to the rest of them. Well, not everyone, actually, Alec Baldwin had an okay part, much better than what I've been seeing him in lately.Rent something else. Watch something else. 4.5 out of 10, and all of them for production and design, and because I've still got to rate it higher than Braveheart.",,Anonymous,History
"Not exactly Oscar bound, but Satisfactory","The first thing I have to say is this movie isn't as bleak as all the `respected' critics make it sound. From the reviews I've read, they make it sound like Pearl Harbor is the worst movie this side of `Dude, Where's My Car?' It's not going to win `Best Picture,' but it's entertaining nonetheless.There are several things that prevent this movie from being great. It's filled with cheesy lines (`I think World War II just started!') and pseudo-inspirational quotes (`I'm not anxious to day, sir, just anxious to matter.'). The worst thing about this film is probably the transition between the Ben-Kate-Josh love triangle and the Japanese and Military Officials. It often felt like I was watching two different and unrelated movies.The best thing about this movie is probably the superior special effects once the attack starts. The first half of the film is slow at times and I wondered when the bombing was going to start, but at the same time that sort of helped illustrate how unexpected the attack was and how unprepared the Navy was. Once it starts, you get a real sense what it was like and how devastating the attack on Pearl Harbor was.As for the cast, there's not shortage of attractive young people. Most of the secondary characters are an interesting and funny supporting cast. I have seen Ben Affleck act better, and his character Rafe is rather cardboard, but Josh Hartnett plays the younger and less confident Danny very well and gives him a little depth. Kate Beckinsale manages to rise above her limited material, and shows promise for future roles.*Warning: Female Gushing Ahead!* I find it funny that when you look at the voter breakdown, Females rated this film an average of two stars higher than males. You may ask why, and the reason is Josh Hartnett. This guy is a good actor, not to mention gorgeous and super sexy, and I came out of the theater thinking, `I must see every Josh Hartnett movie EVER.' (Which is like 3). Ladies, you will not be disappointed if you see this movie. *End Female Gushing!*It will probably have to settle for a couple MTV Movie Awards nominations, but it will entertain you. I've seen my share of bad movies, and this isn't a bad movie. Like most movie, you can't read too much into it. Just sit back, don't scoff too much at the cheesy lines and enjoy the eye candy.

Why does Michael Bay get to keep on making movies?,"Never before has one of the 'Team America:World Police"" songs been so apt. This is one of the worst films that has ever been made. Pearl Harbour is one of the most important events in the the history of the USA yet Michael Bay managed to butcher it completely with an overly and blindly patriotic film interwoven with a hideously written script and awful acting from all of the leads in the film, not even sparred by a former Oscar winner Cuba Gooding who delivers a complete turkey in his version of a 1940's Snoop Dog.This film did not even deserve one star, but I gave it one out of pity. After watching it, you will not feel a deep sense of gratitude for what happened in the war as you do with truly great war films. Instead, you wonder what on earth it is you have just watched. YOu wonder why you wasted such a lot of money on such absolute tripe.First off, Affleck and Beckinsale have absolutely no chemistry whatsoever in this film. Their relationship seems awkward and at times blatantly false. Furthermore, Affleck stooped to an acting low rivalled only by his performance in Gigli, one which did no justice to the first world war. Bay seemed more concerned with getting young American children to salute and to paint the Japanese as animalistic, and the British RAF as completely incompetent, whilst completely ignoring the fact war had been established in Europe and had been raging for a few years before this, epitomised by Dannys (Harnett) awful phrase ""I think World War Two just started"" after being asked what happened.A script interwoven with horrible clichés which look like they have been taken from just about every war film ever made.To put it simply, Pearl harbour is a film for a blindly patriotic American, and for people who do not need a storyline, or do not need well built characters, or do not need to see good performances and only want to see over done war scenes that prehaps overdo the actual destruction that was done, and turn Pearl Harbour from the provoked retaliation of the Japanese (a point which is overlooked) into the start of a war which pitts the world against the United States.Do not waste time or money seeing this film. And if you do, after reading this and the countless other negative reviews, then you deserve the disappointment that is coming your way.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Pearl Harbor. My favorite Movie,"Tonight I saw 'Lord of the Rings The two Towers' It was breathe taking. Beautiful in so many ways. I am a huge movie fan. Yet, out of the hundreds of movies I have seen 'Pearl Harbor' is my favorite. Some people say ""Oh, its to much like Titanic!"" and ""Its a chick-flick!"" but, truth be told, It is more than that. It may have romance and love and all of that in it but it also has history in it. Stuff in that movie actually happened. People lived threw that. People died in that. It is a movie that i could watch over and over again and never get sick of it. Well, thats just me.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Great War movie, even with the romance in it...","Michael Bay has impressed me once again with this movie.  Compare to his 2 other blockbusters, it is one huge step up on Armageddon (which I also enjoyed).  However, the ideas in Pearl Harbor are not as original as the Rock, and it re-used many ideas from both the Rock and Armageddon (you could argue it being the director's style, though).  The visual effects and sound are top-notch (you definitely have not see this before).  I was immensely entertained that's for sure.  Many critics suggested that the movie was too long and the first half was a waste of time.  I felt the opposite... I thought the movie took time to develop the characters and the story it wants to tell before sucking us into the intense attack scenes.  I like the way the romance was set as well, it was not as cheezy as I thought it to be. In fact, it's a lot better than the romance in 'Titanic'.  One flaw of this movie was the music I would say.  It was somewhat too ""romantic"" and repetitive in scenes where it should be serious and horrifying.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Ugh.,"Bad, bad, bad.Who cares about the romance? Stupid dialogue. It's hard to believe it's the same writer as the guy who scripted ""Braveheart.""The first part of the movie sets up the painfully boring romance. Later comes the attack.And unlike, say, ""Dunkirk"" and some other war movies, I never felt I was involved in a real war. I don't have the know-how to describe what the differences were technically that makes some war films feel authentic and this one feel like I'm in Hollywood all the time, even during the attack.Didn't care about anyone or anything that happened. I think I kept watching it because I couldn't believe how bad it was (and there was nothing else on).",1.0,Anonymous,History
"A story of love, friendship and honor.","I felt that the photography was very impressing, the color throughout and special effects especially when the attacking squadron flew between the our warships docked at Pearl Harbour.The story was very predictable, but I can handle a sappy romance as long as they are not too frequent.The acting was superb.  Alec performed a great Jimmy Doolittle with his raspy dictatorial voice, although, I had the distinct honor of meeting Gen. Doolittle who was brought to my desk for introduction in the 80's and his voice was not such, lol.I felt that the movie brought out a personal side to this historical event; the surprise, helplessness and devastation; not just in the attack but with the three main characters' lives.I cried through the whole movie, so ladies, take your kleenex.  The movie was so well made that every sad moment was followed by a comical moment. So, you are not left in the doldrums.There were about 1,000 attendees at the special advance viewing and at the end of the movie, we all clapped.  This movie/story left you with a good feeling at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,History
OK but too Long,"I guess if you take out the first hour of the movie you could say it was a good war flick.  However, that first hour is hard to sit through. The attack parts are done real well, I really liked when they show the prospective of an aircraft flying through the harbor during the attack, it is almost like a really good video game. But, for the price and the wait on line, it was a four hour experience that I wish I waited for the video.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Argh!,"How is it possibly to spend so much money on a movie so bad? It seems to me, that Hollywood finally has lost all sense of reality. Historically incorrect to the extreme. It is probably not the worst movie I have ever seen, but it is in my top ten!",1.0,Anonymous,History
More than just bad,"I actually have another comment floating around here, condemning the movie as extremely lazy on the part of all involved. But the movie is worse than that. Like Grease, no one seems to acknowledge how amoral the movie is(the glorified harassment of Eugene). I have heard defense of the movie as a summer entertainment film, not supposed to be taken seriously. Well, the deaths of hundreds of people is something to be taken seriously. This isn't like Independence Day, where none of it actually happened. People actually died. The movie is barely about Pearl Harbor, it's about acouple of people who weren't even terribly affected. Not to mention the rampant use of ethnic slurs being depicted as heroic(interesting also how black people are respected completely in the '40s). I recognize that that's how it happened, but don't make it look okay. I think we all learned after Saving Private Ryan that war is an awful ugly thing that ruins lives, and not fun thing to make simple enjoyable movies about. If you want a good war movie, watch The Bridge on the River Kwai, where war is simply two forces fighting eachother futily. Not this, where heroes blow away cardboard villains.",,Anonymous,History
PEARL HARBOR (DIDIER BECU),"Of course it was the movie everyone had to see, it was also one of the first movies that was used for the marketingtechnique that everyone should have a DVDplayer but what a waste of time, what a waste of talent, what a waste of movie in fact... The story is known, even your 12old year kid will know what the Japs did and so it couldn't have surprised at all, but still it did... The attack from the Japs belongs (just like the first 30 minutes of Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"") to the best what I ever saw in warmovies. Spectacular, frightening and with a rarely seen reality-factor. The speeches in the White House are good as well, the ones from the Japanese emperors as well but (and that's 2 hours) the lovestory sucked... It was boring, and it was a shame that they didn't opt to make a warmovie in historical style like ""The longest day"" as then it could perhaps have been the best warmovie ever but indeed we must see a dreadful lovestory...and why such a warevent is pointed out to two good pilots is beyond me, it's a slap in the face for all families who lost someone there.

"The team of Bay, Bruckheimer, and Ben do it again!","Okay, first off let me say that Bay and Bruckheimer are an unstoppable duo. Together, they create some of the most memorable movies to date, and Pearl Harbor will be among those movies. The overall presentation of the movie was fantastic. With stylish camera angles and some very slick CG, the movie looked great. The acting was top-notch. Affleck, Harnett, and Beckinsdale all played the leads very well, and Voight was brilliant as Roosevelt. As far as the writing goes, the love story was a nice touch, but it seems to be a trend nowadays to attach romance to historical events, Titanic anyone? But I will say the love triangle scenario in this movie was far more interesting than Titanic's. The second act of the movie, the actual attack on Pearl Harbor, seemed rather familiar to me. Was this a remake of the 1970 classic ""Tora!Tora!Tora!"" ? I mean a lot of the scenes seemed like updated versions of ""Tora!""...others were direct rip-offs, even some of the dialogue was taken directly from ""Tora!"" Aside from that little observation, the movie is very much worth watching. Whether you're a sucker for romance comedies, Greek tragedies, or all-out action flicks this movie has something for everyone. Just witnessing Affleck's color-changing face trick is worth the price of admission.",7.0,Anonymous,History

In fact, I recommend cinema students to watch this movie, so they will know what NOT to do.What most I disgust this movie is the complete mediocrity of the director to understand what makes a movie a good experience. I really don't understand why a guy that doesn't know that is working in cinema industry.A very bad movie.",1.0,Anonymous,History
An excellent retelling of the event that changed America!,"This movie is an outstanding effort to take a tragic life-changing event and portray it in a realistic and heart-pounding manner. The film is also backed by a very supportive and entertaining storyline, which includes Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale as the cast for a love triangle that makes the movie so it doesn't bore the audience.First of all, if all the entertainment business wanted to do with this movie was portray the attack on Pearl Harbor and only the attack on Pearl Harbor, the movie would only be approximately fifteen to twenty minutes in length, so there has to be some sort of storyline to back it up. Second of all, if all they wanted was an informative film that educates people about what happened sixty-four years ago on December 7, 1941, then they would be wasting their time with a pointless remake, as there already is a boring and disappointing movie out there like that entitled Tora! Tora! Tora! which was released in the year of 1971. No, they wanted something better. They wanted something that would attract a movie audience, not something that would attract a History Channel audience. In my opinion, this was accomplished successfully and wholesomely.Ben Affleck plays Captain Rafe McCawley whose only dream is to be a pilot. When a young woman named Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale) deliberately passes him when she tests his sight even though he wasn't deserving of the deed, he immediately falls in love with her and the two become an item with no time wasted. However, a tragic event leads to emotions composed of envy and revenge. When December 7th comes upon them, people find that they must fight for their lives and their only chance of survival is through strength and hope.This is a wonderful and brilliant film that is supported by an outstanding cast, an excellent storyline, and a tragic ending that is guaranteed to leave you in tears.A well deserved 10/10!",10.0,Anonymous,History
ENEMIES AT THE GATES of Pearl Harbor,"This movie is a perfect (I think) representation of the famous morning of 7th December 1941 on Pearl Harbor. The 40 minutes  of Japanese attack are the greatest minutes of the whole 194 minutes of this movie. The scenery is the best I have seen: a lot of boats, persons and Japanese planes. The story is a mix of Brave Heart, Enemies At The Gates and Titanic. The writer (Randall Wallace) is the same as Brave Heart, great movie. He (Wallace) starts to presents two young friends who dream to became ""warriors"", as he had presented us on Brave Heart(William Wallace, he didn't dream to be, he was pushed to be by the English), then this little boys became men, and ""warriors"" as William Wallace. And now we mix this story with Titanic and Enemies At The Gates, and this two men fall in love with the same woman, as on Enemies At The Gates, the romanticism of this movie make us remember the romanticism of Titanic, one very romantic story in a middle of a human disaster. After the ""great"" Japanese attack, The U. S. government decides to attack Japan. On this American attack we have two heroes, as on Brave Heart (one). The story have it originality, but make us remember a lot other movies.Finally, I think this movies is a great American movie, but it could be better. Not like Intimacy or Freedom, Pearl Harbor is different, it's easiest to understand the message and it's to entertain us. Intimacy and Freedom are two movies to appreciate like a painting.",6.0,Anonymous,History
one would be crazy not to like this film,"If I like the actors in a movie and the movie itself it OK, but but not that great I won't go to the trouble to see it in the theater more than once. ""Pearl Harbor"" has been in theaters for only two days and most people have seen this film once so far. I've already seen it twice and I love it more and more! I first saw the film late Tues. night b/c of a special situation and even in my tired state at 4 AM I was dangerously close to writing the production company to tell them how AMAZING ""Pearl Harbor"" is.Some critics have said the only good part about the film is the actual bombing scenes of Pearl Harbor, but I believe the love story gives a face to the suffering for those, like myself, who are unrelated to the history. We have been removed from the pain and US History lectures aren't enough to comprehend the defeat, complexities, and final W.W.II victory started at Pearl Harbor. I believe The movie is a beautiful representation of the situations faced by all involved with a great cast, very real special effects (better than any other movie I've ever seen), and amazing camera shots that capture the emotions (e.g. blurred spots and slow motion to show confusion or devastation).",10.0,Anonymous,History

It was so intense and emotional for me that I have to give ""Pearl Harbor"" credit for that.

The film was Stupid. I wished I had Not Watched it.,"* out of ***This film is an adaptation of the events surrounding the tragic American event that took place on the military base Pearl Harbor. The lives that were lost will forever be a sad reminder of the horrible nature of war. Unfortunately, this film is not a good portrait of the event. I feel bad for hating this film so deeply because the event that it is about is not one that should be screwed around with, and with such a tragic event you would hope that all the people who decide to do stories about it do it with care and respect for the event.Basically what this is is a three way love triangle in which the event of Pearl Harbor just so happens to happen right in the background. And with such an inconvenient event taking place at such an inconvenient time, everybody in the film, for no reason at all, is forced to act stupid and pretend that they don't know what they are doing. The only bright spot of the entire film is the Cuba Gooding Jr. character, who is brave, smart, and very memorable. Unfortunately, he gets surprisingly little screen time.When the event of Pearl Harbor actually occurs, we are left a little underwhelmed. The same things blow up repeatedly over and over with very little care for continuity and humanity, and more for just technical effect. Take for instance the sequence in which a bomb hits a boat and sinks it. The result involves a lot of people flying all over the place in all different directions and being blown to several pieces by different planes. The effect just comes off as gratuitous rather than sad. The CGI is terrible.The director Michael Bay, has made some very enjoyable action films that I cared for hugely. The Rock was one of the most entertaining action films of the 90s, The Island was entertaining, Bad Boys was pretty good though the sequel was just gross, Armageddon was the closest a film has come to giving me a heart attack, and Transformers was alright. So far Pearl Harbor is his worst film yet!",,Anonymous,History

Perfect for the Jerry Springer show.,"Don't waste your time with this movie, it will be 4 hours of your life that you will desperately want back after sitting through it. The movie revolves around a love story between a pilot and a nurse and the pilots best friend. The story goes through several dull hours of this relationship and then ends up with a situation that is more suited to day time television. The love story and how it ended made me want to throw up with disgust and boredom. The only redeeming qualities of this movie were the examples of jingoism at it's worst and how pride can be the downfall of nations.

Before Watching: Pearl Harbor (Theatrical version) (2001),"""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) is a movie following two pilots and a woman during the events before, during and after Pearl Harbor. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:First, there are two versions of Pearl Harbor - the theatrical version and the Director's Cut. The Director's Cut has slightly different love scenes and a lot of added violence and gore, as well as somewhat cruder language. The Director's Cut is therefore rated R and represent more accurately the shocking brutality of warfare. Depending on the viewer and his or her relation to war violence, either could be preferable, as the violence in the theatrical version is much more scaled down. This review is of the theatrical version:Pearl Harbor may be known and labeled by some as a slow, pro-American, over-explosive and historically inaccurate war movie - sprinkled with distracting love relationships on top. These labels could be justifiable; the movie is over 3 hours long with over an hour of set-up before the actual skirmish, which does feature a lot of explosions and destruction. Throughout the runtime, Americans are depicted as strong, charismatic heroes while the enemy (whether Japanese or German) are invasive and ruthless. Added to all this is plenty of anachronisms and details which doesn't make sense nor add up, and a lot of the plot does hinge on love relationships. It is a lot of spectacle and drama, and the violence in the theatrical version can feel inaccurate. These are all valid points to criticize, but in so doing, it needs to be known that neither of these points necessarily distract unless one is pre-occupied with them. As entertainment and as a vessel to carry an important story, Pearl Harbor holds up fine. The views are shot beautifully with a nice variance of vistas, the score by Hans Zimmer is swelling and fits the movie well, and the poignant points rarely feel blunt. The actors and actresses feel genuine as well.In summary - this movie does have faults and is therefore perhaps not for everyone. Still, the less this movie is viewed as a documentary and more as an interpretation with some liberty, the more enjoyable it will become.My personal grade: an acceptable 7/10.

Spectacular war film with routine romantic drama...,"If PEARL HARBOR had been made back in the '40s, you'd see a war film with a romantic triangle from stars like Tyrone Power, John Payne and Anne Baxter (ever see CRASH DIVE with Power and Dana Andrews both in love with Baxter?). What we have here is a good, old-fashioned romantic triangle yarn set against the spectacular bombing of Pearl Harbor.The action scenes are awesome with the relentless attack portrayed with searing realism. And the History Channel documentary on Pearl Harbor is chock full of details used in the screenplay, even including the bit about the cook who seized his opportunity to be a gunner.This is definitely a well-crafted film that shouldn't be panned as extensively as some of the reviewers here have chosen to do. The performances are first rate, sincere and earnest with Ben Affleck doing an outstanding job as Rafe, completely believable in his role as the pilot who is believed killed but returns to resume his romantic partnership with a nurse. Outstanding in supporting roles are Jon Voigt, strongly resembling FDR, and Alec Baldwin.A disappointment is the score, which I assumed would make full use of '40 swing tunes from that era but instead uses a bland love song that sounds like a leftover from 'Titanic' and never uses the music in a way that evokes the 1940s. Nor does it have any power in the dramatic moments.But above all, this is an enjoyable enough war film which relies heavily on the old-fashioned Hollywood triangle romances that came out of the '40s when patriotism was at an all-time high.",,Anonymous,History
The flaw of Hollywood perpetuating war,"Tremendous blockbuster directors get a pass with their heighten aggrandize display of depicting war history laden with special effects prevails as an attainable farce of reality. War kills people, innocent people.Pear Harbor-we lose the battle but we won the war... a tremendously blind sighted isolationist Congress that fell short of protecting our soldiers and civilians. No proactive response.Pearl Harbor has Dramatic pacing with a driving musical score can keep us riveted to our theatrical seats, obviously. The recreation of actual events in cinematic premise depicts a worthy payoff for executive producers.Editing a three hour war film is a huge achievement. But in this portrayal of a triad love story entwined with history is distracting. It fails in respect to lives given.There are poignant moments recreated in this project. With all due respect the optics are stunning. The plot points carry the momentum of a roller coaster ride movie.I attended a British prep school founded by former RAF pilots. Our headmaster had facial scars of disfiguring burns. He was a Spitfire pilot. Shot down seven tens, captured twice and escaped to fight another day. That's a story worth bring to the cinema.Anyway, the most blaring inaccuracy of this film is the fact that prior to American declaration of war in WWII, that is declaring war on the Axis powers, was that any American volunteering to fly for the British Air Force; especially the RAF, would be denounced as traitors to America insomuch to protect America from Hitlers evidence retribution to give validation that American corporate interests involved with the Third Riech's prosperity, that is the Reichsbank would be threatened.Any American volunteering to fight Hitlers draconian war for global supremacy-that is to protect England from Nazi aggression, was considered an enemy of America.As a retaliatory consequence, the US Congress stripped those Americans volunteering to join the RAF of their US citizenship and would be arrested as an enemy of the state.Churchill outwitted this disgraceful isolationist harbinger spurred on by right-wing extremist America First dribble by giving these courageous Americans immediate UK citizenship so they could participate in defending England during the Battle of Britain.These brave Americans were few but courageously noble in giving their lives for the good fight against fascist tyranny.After Congress declared war on the Axis powers, those surviving American fighter pilots were given their US Citizenship back!???So when Rafe gets allegedly assigned to the RAF as a volunteer it paints a falsehood that permeates in American trumped up patriotic blindness by glossing over historical fact and disgracing the lives given that gave us a potential to attain a democratic future after WWII.Sadly America now lives by a declaration of war on anything by hoping to maintain global supremacy.

"1/2 Sappy Love Story, 1/2 Eye Candy","I gave this movie a 6 out of 10 because I felt that a really great war movie was hampered by a sappy and contrived love story.  I realize that's probably what the makers of this flick wanted to appeal to a female audience (something Saving Private Ryan probably lacked), but it certainly didn't appeal to me.  In addition, the American propaganda is unending.  I can appreciate the obviousness of having a pro-American sentiment to this movie, but again, it's not something that sits well with a Canadian boy like myself.Aside from having to follow the contrived love story, the actors do a good job of acting (except Affleck and Baldwin...ugggh).

"""Pearl Harbor"", (2001) is an American movie which does not only deals with the Second World War but also a love story.","Michael Bay, the director, who also had great success with his Terminator films, delivers us here a film both historical and romantic. Yet, he's still being criticized due to an excess of special effects, which makes his movies less realistic sometimes, but not for Pearl Harbor. On the contrary, all of these special effects are true to what happened during the real attack of Pearl Harbor which creates a true combination between horror and violence. What's more, we could wonder why would have Bay decided to add a love story, because we could have done without it... But then, when we think about it, we could guess that it was a strategy. Indeed, the purpose of Pearl Harbor was to attract not only men who are fond of war and violence, but also women who love the romantic touch. And I think it worked well, as it is for a lot of women ""an amazing romantic movie"" before a war film. An important thing throughout the movie is the significance of the different shots. Actually, most shots are aerial, which is typical for a war movie. Bay uses most of the time these shots in order to show how much power the Japanese had on the Americans who were weak during that attack. It is even more obvious when we can see the American flag and the US vessels plunged into the water: it is the nation that is drowning. During the attack, Bay uses a lot of point of view shots, and thanks to these, the spectator can put himself in the American soldiers' shoes, and it gives us a feeling of oppression, fear and horror. We automatically feel pity for the Americans, who are being unfairly attacked. Furthermore, there are a lot of off-screen spaces, just like during the Japanese attack scene. One actor isn't looking at the planes while we, spectators, see it in the background, which means that there's even more planes we can't actually see. Indeed, each individual shot feels huge but also implies bigger things outside the frame. It shows you a lot for just a moment and then it takes it away. Michael Bay style is ""simply"" the use of movement, composition and fast editing to create a sense of epic scale.Yet, at the end of the movie, when we thought that everything was against the Americans, that they're definitely the victims, there is a plot twist. Indeed, they win; rescued by the Chinese soldiers and they are considered as heroes. When Danny dies, he dies as a real superhero. Right after his death scene, there's a fade out shot and we can see a Chinese soldier waving the American flag, which proves that the American nation is not, and never will be down. Right after this scene, there is another fade out which shows the American flag waving to the right, symbol of hope, of a better future. Then follows the reunion between families and the soldiers. Once again, Bay shows the dual vision of the soldier: he is not only a killing machine but also a man, who has a wife and kids. During that entire scene, the images are in slow-motion, and there's a music which is at the same time moving, sad, but also patriotic thanks to the trumpets. Music has a major role in Pearl Harbor. Thanks to Hans Zimmers' soundtrack, we are automatically plunged into the atmosphere of the movie. For example, when the Japanese attack Pearl Harbor, the music highlights how chaotic the situation is, how hopeless America is at this moment. Pearl Harbor is also known thanks to this amazing song called Tennessee, once again, created by Hans Zimmer. At the very end of the movie, there is a voice-over: Evelyn speaks and pays a tribute to the ones who died during the war. She insists that despite the fact that America may have known defeats and many casualties, she will always stand up and she will always fight for her nation and her pride. What's more, we learn that Dory Miler was the first Afro-American to receive the Navy Cross, which is once again a proof of a better future and hope. The movie ends with a child (Evelyn and Danny's child) who picks a flower. The kid is the perfect symbol of innocence, and the fact that he picks a flower highlights the movie's moral: no matter what happens, life goes on. Here, the flower might be the metaphor of rebirth. To put in a nutshell, Pearl Harbor is a movie which deserves to be seen because it is very representative of the horror of war. It is not only the attack of Pearl Harbor that Michael Bay denounces, it is war in general. However, we soon understand the second purpose of this film which is to glorify the American army and the American soldiers. Pearl Harbor is based on many American stereotypes which are close to ridiculousness: the slow-motion scene where we can see many soldiers moving forward an aircraft carrier, torsos bent, with a proud expression, looking fearless. And we often see it in movies, such as American Sniper by Clint Eastwood or Saving private Ryan by Steven Spielberg. Not to mention the soundtrack which is very patriotic but also overwhelming. We're really dove into each situation whether it is horrifying, romantic or simply touching, thanks to the music. What's more, we could say that Pearl Harbor also strengthen the idea of brotherhood during war which make the spectator feel even more sorry for them. To conclude, if you have never seen Pearl Harbor and you do want to watch it, you must expect to see a pro-American movie and an unnecessary but beautiful and romantic love story.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Could have been better,"This is supposed to be a World War 2 based movie. Its the sort of movie anyone would expect to be an accurate enough dramatisation of events that actually happened.Instead what we get is an attempt to make another Titanic by including a love triangle that is dominant over the whole history aspect. It just doesn't seem right.Being a historic epic, they could have cut down on the whole love story and focused more on what would have been relevant such as the Japanese preparation of the attack and the situation President Roosevelt was finding himself in. The sequence of the actual attack on Pearl Harbour was spectacular! Perhaps if they extended it and made it a more major part of the film it would have been more worthy. Another major flaw with this movie is that after the attack sequence the movie dragged on for another hour trying to give an epilogue which was totally irrelevant.I reckon if these were taken aboard, then Pearl Harbor would have been a much better movie and perhaps would not have flopped at the box office.",5.0,Anonymous,History
"Pearl Harbor, The Best of the Best","Pearl Harbor, in my opinion, is one of the best movies I have seen.  I have read may of the reviews by other members, and the derogatory comments they have made about the film, and yes, from their point of view, they are correct.What you have to understand before you can really appreciate a film like this is that although part of the plot is fiction, the rest is not.  This means that the creators have to make the film fit into the framework of established historical fact.  Not only the historic lines, but also the culture, the attitude of people in general, and the overall norms of that time.With this premise out of the way, I found the film to be very entertaining, romantic, and extremely authentic as far as props, attitudes, and historic content.  It was a well spent three hours that I would do again.For me, it really answered many questions I had about the WWII era that in my personal research, I could not answer. In addition, being a hopeless romantic, I really loved the story, which was authentic for that time, as to how people acted.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I really respected the way they handled the Japanese, not the usual propaganda evil, stupid enemy crap.  Honorable men, performing dishonorable deeds, but doing what they felt had to be done to protect the Empire of Japan.Summary: Go see it.

"I liked this one, I did.","ME SAYING SOMETHING ABOUT THE INDUSTRY:There a thing people have to understand. When wanting to recreate the battle of Pearl Harbor, for the reason of entertaining, you need money. A lot of money. And those money are bound to come from  people who have them, yes? These people, who lend you the money are bound to wanting to get their money back, yes? So naturally there'll be A LOT of poll-searches done on a project of this magnitude, before the filming begins, yes?So what do we end up having is a ""Usual"" story, with unusual images. Which is all the ""Pearl Harbor"" is... and that ain't all that bad.THE ""PEARL HARBOR"" WALKTHROUGHThe characters are thin, but believable (This is entertainment, people, not ""The late hour"" with Siegmund Freud), and the love-story that goes on for the first hour is okay. It's a warm-up for the inevitable.And then: Battle. For 45-minutes of incredibly digital imagery, you get a feeling of how stratigicly brilliant, the Japanese war-machine was. They blow up practically everything, which really is not that surprising to those of you, that know history a little.So: There's gotta be some sorta happy-end, right? For the americans, yes? So our pilot-boys, though strugling for the same woman, take on a suicide-mission to bomb Tokyo. This bit is a silly add-on, as nothing comepares to the battle at ""The Pearl"".And then: End Credits.ME TALKING ABOUT GOOD STUFF.I like first part of the story.

And naturally I like the battle-scenes, and the thinking: ""This is what it was like""I like the acting of:Ben Afflect Dan Akroyd Alec BaldwinI love the whole quality of sound and image. It's incredible. There's been masters at work here.ME TALKING ABOUT BAD STUFF:I don't really like the end-bit.

Unparalleled incompetence,"Upon hearing that we would be viewing this movie in our history class, I winced at the idea because I had not heard good things about the movie. However, I was one of those people who decided to try new things, and since we were watching it for history class, I figured it might have some promise. We watched the movie, and after only a few minutes of hearing Ben Affleck's and Josh Hartnet's dialogue, I felt ready to run out of the classroom. Yet I was only to discover that what began as a corny action movie later revealed itself to be an offensive masterpiece.The historical accuracies in this movie are slim to none. Michael Bay even uses freighters and equipment (targeted by the depicted villainous Japanese soldiers) that would not be developed for many years to come. The story's sappy romance and incredibly false acting (save for a much appreciated Cameo of Cuba Gooding Jr.) stands out as a complete annoyance in the movie, yet serves to take away the equally idiotic video-game-like plane fights.But what really is most unsettling is the overall mood of the film: it's an action-filled, romantic, heroic buddy movie. And it's also World War II. This film gives memories to the old John Wayne war movies and it's campy, almost unrealistic attitude with almost a bit of nostalgia, until you realize that this was made in 2001, a time when most people have realized that the subject of war, especially World War II, is not to be fitting for an entertaining popcorn movie. That in itself leaves the viewing standpoint completely uncomfortable, and almost wondering, with lines such as ""I think World War II just started!"", if the ignorance shown in this movie could possibly be real. The movie is false, campy, sappy, and in many views offensive to veterans who have experienced war firsthand. In addition, the film shows almost no respect to those who died in Pearl Harbor by showing overly dramatic death sequences quickly cut to make room for more time of Ben Affleck with his hair blowing in the wind.Overall, a complete lack of focus on a film as a whole and disregard for important events to make room for intense action sequences.

great movie but too long,"About the last movie I watched, it was one of the greatest film I ever saw. I mean seriously, it was gorgeous. It's called « Pearl Harbor », and is the story of the guys living in hawaii in December 1941. The story is based on historic facts, but not only, on a love story also. First, the music is absolutely great. It's signed by Hans Zimmer, which is a great composer. The photographs are wonderful, and show amazing landscapes. Secondly, the actors play of course very well, but play a role completely breathtaking. The characters are profond, pure, realist, and set a mindtrouble due of their comportement during the movie. Actually, this is truly my favorite movie. Because of the message, the thematic, the brotherhood and the jealousy between characters for the same woman. Do you know that the story told in the movie is the pure reality ? Actually the Japanese attack the Americans in December 1941 on Honolulu. A lot of controversies on the truth of the story has started recently, due to the fact the Americans may have known the attack of the Japanese on the archipel. So, the movie is very interesting, emotional, historic, and pass some good messages, but it also have the probleme that it long 3 hours non-stop, it's always on the American view that the story is told, and never from the vue of Japanese.

"POSSIBLY THE WORST ""FILM"" IN THE LAST CENTURY...","This movie doesn't deserve my time or my thought (or anyone else's for that matter), yet I feel the need to save my fellow mankind from degrading trash like ""Pearl Harbor,"" so I'm simply going to write a to-the-point review.     First, the single positive element this film has going for it are the special effects. They were fantastic in the one scene of the film that they needed to be--the prolonged action scene.  Yet I must ask...because this movie is about such an integral and vital part of history, yet is so appallingly horrendous in its acting, directing, and story, aren't these great special effects a complete waste?  The film makes it abundantly clear that the makers of this movie care nothing about the significance of the events at Pearl Harbor, but solely about gaudy imagery and box-office dough.  If this is the case, and boy is it ever, these special effects aren't in the picture to capture the emotions of a certain time and place, but rather to keep the ignorant drones that make up the majority of American society content in their seats.  The special effects here serve offensive purposes and are utterly drowned in the midst of a plot (saying this movie has a plot is a massive compliment on my part) that is so terrible one can't even come to appreciate the effects. I can envision the makers of this film predicting that audiences would be bored after awhile, and the timing of the battle scene is precise in a way only Hollywood can be-- the effects aren't intended to be meaningful or historically accurate; they're just to try and keep us from storming out of the theater. Anyway, I'm not even going to go into the acting, story or directing...take my word for it, they were all awful.  A handful of clever camera shots and wide, colorful cinematography were an agreeable viewing experience, yet in the end merely flaunted the film's high budget.  The cute lil' threesome leads represent the future of terrible cornball cinema, and the Michael Bay/Bruckheimer combo was almost too much for my stomach to take.  Please, if you have a brain, don't bother renting this movie.  Maybe if you're writing a paper on the formula of bad films, then its ok, but otherwise, let this movie collect dust on the video store shelf.  I especially don't recommend this movie if you know more-than-average about history, or if you're Japanese.  The movie paints a lovely patriotic picture of the conniving Japanese, hell-bent on destruction on the first half...but then, later on, we get the famous ""woke a sleeping giant quote""....oh, isn't it cute?  The little Japanese, always filmed in robes sitting in a circle in some ancient outdoor meeting ground, have learned their lesson.  Uh....I'm afraid things didn't actually happen like this people.  Does anyone know what stereotypes are? This movie made America look like a wonderful combo of heroes and victims, and, although people think it captured history flawlessly, it neglected to mention that America went on to drop nuclear bombs on multiple Japanese cities, killing hundreds of times the amount of Americans killed during Pearl Harbor.  The movie dedicated itself to showing the events leading up to Pearl Harbor (with the nauseating parallel plot of a 1940's love triangle), and then drops history with America as the hero's.  I can't go on...",1.0,Anonymous,History

Better watch something else.....,"This film would've been good, except for one thing:  Jerry Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer Films should've stuck with fiction.  It was obvious that they couldn't make a masterful film to describe the events of what happened that day, so they had to include a love story just to try and make it work as an epic.  It turns out to be more of a ""Titanic"" with battleships and zeros than a true historical account.  They also would go and greatly compromise historical accuracy for artistic intent, if you want to call a Bruckheimer film artistic.  The sequence where Pearl Harbour is attacked is very well done and the special effects are among some of the best and most realistic, but the cliched dialogue, addition of fictional characters, and the inclusion of the insipid love story really brings this movie down.  It may be entertaining to its intended core audience, the teenagers and twenty-somethings (although I am 19) that would absolutely adore cardboard cutout romance with the sex scene, but it would be perceived as a terribly mainstream film that fails utterly to be a gripping epic by those who appreciate good cinema.  It would, however, no doubt pay for itself in the box office this summer season.  But, high grossers are not always great films.  It's still worth a watch, but the *real* good Pearl Harbour flick is still ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"".  If you've not seen that film, watch it as it is a greatly accurate historical film pertaining to the subject of the attack on Pearl Harbour, and was produced in cooperation by American and Japanese production companies for 20th Century Fox.  As for the best summer film, I think that honor would go to the upcoming ""Final Fantasy"" picture coming this July.  - Reinhart",1.0,Anonymous,History
"That's ""harbour"" actually","Jerry Bruckheimer's latest large film - tipping ships over sideways, elevating Ben Affleck to Big Chin Leading Man, and not being as rude to the Japanese as perhaps one might have expected. Apart from the end bit.December 7 1941 is a fairly important date in American history. The Japanese launched a surprise attack on the entire US fleet as it lay at anchor (read 'parked up') in Pearl Harbor, in the Hawaiian islands. As a result, President Roosevelt brought the USA into the war, and that was more or less that, according to people who aren't British. And that's 'harbour', anyway.Our story follows two friends, Rafe McCawley and Danny Walker, as they grow up obsessed with planes and flying, and then the war comes and they get drafted as cooks. No, wait Rafe  Affleck  falls in love with a nurse  Kate Beckinsale  and then gets shot down over France and disappears and Danny  Josh Hartnett  falls in love with her himself, and they end up naked in Pearl Harbor together. Phew. This takes about 4 days of screen time and you're wishing the Japanese would hurry up, when guess what? Yeah, Rafe turns up, not burnt or anything  he was, like, hiding with the French for a year or something! Amazing! The same guy wrote this wrote Braveheart, so if you swallowed Willy Wallace speaking French and knocking up the Queen of England, this is nothing.So the love story comes to a head, and then the bombs start falling and the budget just triples, man. The critics hated the slush and okay'd the bangs, and some folks reviewing the DVD on Amazon obviously liked both and gave it 5 stars. This, in my opinion, would presumably make something like Runaway Bride into a work of immeasurable genius. What do they think is a BAD film?What is wrong with this film? Almost everything. Casting, plot, pacing, length, breadth, spelling... It's full of really off-putting cameos. Examples include boffin-typecast Dan Ackroyd as the Navy 'Intelligence' man who thinks something's up because 40 billion tons of dangerous shipping has gone off the radar. Yeah, we know. Why didn't you? One of the one million Baldwin boys  the old one  strolls around in Indiana Jones's leather jacket preening his hair-do and fingering his cheque as some horrible psychotic pilot person, who resurfaces to lead us into the most startlingly irrelevant ending I have seen since the 1999 European Cup Final. Almost as meaningless is Cuba Gooding's cameo, as a frustrated boxing cook who beats up honkies from other boats. You can imagine my profound shock when he turns Real Sailor and shoots down some Japanese plane attacking His Ship. Bring back Jeff Chandler and back projection if this is progress.The last hour is frankly unbelievable. The bacon sandwich dropped from my numbed fingers as the film resolutely refused to end. You see, after the Japanese go back to their ships  (Navy radar people: 'Oh, There they are!') there's what seems to be an entire other movie stuck on the end. We haven't finished with Rafe and Josh and Kate and that stuff yet  and not enough foreign people of dubious religious conviction have been sent to meet their particular maker of choice, obviously. 183 minutes is an awfully long time to spend watching people who you don't care about sort their problems out. Even if they do have guns.The love story is a bit silly, something akin to the Titanic romance, except longer and with quiffs, and the action scenes are interesting from a technical point of view but do not disturb like Ryan or rouse like Braveheart. The film looks like they didn't really care  one of those times when the hype gets you into your seat and the producer runs to the bank before you can figure it out and ask for your money back. The best thing I can say about the whole thing is that at least it gives you the opportunity to re-tell the one about the half-black, half-Japanese bloke who every December 7 would attack Pearl Bailey.",,Anonymous,History
Need to decide what the movie was,"I wish they decided from the beginning what they wanted the movie to be, a love story set in WWII or a war movie with a love story sub-plot. If they could have just gone one way or the other, I think you would have had a great movie. There was no depth to the movie at all because of this. All we knew about any of the characters and the plot was very little - Japan is going to attack because the US stopped oil shipments, the US parked all the battleships in a row (how about telling why our carriers were not there), the two fly boys are friends and only want to fly and they both fall in love with nurse who fell in love with both of them. Thats it. I would rather have learned more about Cuba Gooding's character, or more about Doolittle, or more of the history behind the attack, more behind the US attempts to decipher the codes, more of anything!!!

Three hours filled with ...nothing,"As a European I saw Pearl Harbor, and after three of the most boring movie hours of my life I wondered if in Hollywood they realize that also non-Americans go to the cinema.This is another Patriotic load of crap. It has got an uninteresting love triangle, bad acting and some (ok) nice special effects.This was going to be the Blockbuster of the year??? Those crazy Americans. Do they really believe that the audience would love this crap? I heard that Disney expected it to beat Titanic. They are so arrogant over there. How long did it last as the no.1 movie? ...A week? and rightfully so.As an audience you do not feel compelled with any of the characters. In fact you don't care if they live or die. And (in opposite of Titanic) you certainly don't want to see it once again. It's much too long and boring to go through it once more.In an effort to make a new Titanic they forgot that the strength of that movie was the emotional binding with the characters together with the great visual spectacle. That same thing made Gladiator a big hit (or did you think that it was the sight of the digitally built arena that did it for this movie?). No, this one (Pearl Harbor)just has some great effects and that's it.But maybe that the Americans think differently about it. They are in fact very patriotic (when I saw ""the Shadow"" in the states in '94, there is a line in that movie where Baldwin as the Shadow says to his opponent something like: ""Hey watch it, that's the US of A your talking about"" Every proud American soul in the theater started to clap their hands and cheer, I think that says enough) but then again, maybe it's even too much for them to handle.However as a European I could not appreciate this long movie.

Pearl Habor,"Pearl Habor is a historical movie directed by Michael Bay in 2001. It's a perfect way to show how America entered in WWII. There are three main characters: Captain Rafe McCawley played by Ben Affleck, Captain Danny Walker played by Josh Hartnett and Nurse Lieutenant Evelyn Johnson played by Kate Beckinsale. At the beginning of the movie we follow Rafe and Danny's childhood. They wanted to be pilot and some years later they join the Royal Air Force. Rafe is in love with Evelyn, since their first meeting. He goes to England to fight against the German Air Force: Luftwaffe whereas Evelyn and Danny are sent to Pearl Habor. When Rafe is back at Pearl Habor there is a surprise attack by the Japanese Air Force. This movie plunges us aptly in the horror of war. Through the actor's play of Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett we can feel exactly the solders' feeling during this period. Firstly through the childhood of the two young men we understand that a lot of little boys wanted to serve their homeland, to be soldier and wanted to participate in the protection of their country. Then, when Rafe goes to England and he announces it to Evelyn we understand it was difficult for a wife, mother, sister or whatever to see their husband, son, or brother leaving. And we see it's also difficult for Danny because a friend is precious and he is afraid of his friend's death. Moreover when Rafe's plane crashed into the sea he thinks all the time of Evelyn in order not do die. So we can see that women are very important to soldiers to give their strength and courage. This movie also emphasizes brotherhood between soldiers. Indeed during all the movie, the young men build a relation of friendship which seems to be very strong. And it's very important to mentioned that this sort of group, had need to the strength relations. During the scene of the bombing we can see the panic in the eyes of the actors. We can see soldiers crying and saying ""Mom!!"" This moment transcribes very well the horror which soldiers underwent during this historical event. Moreover with the sound and the special affects we can believe we are part of the scene, we are with soldiers, we can felt their fear when they see the first Japanese plane. We can see soldiers were ready to sacrifice themselves for their country. We can think that the beginning was a little bit long but I think it's important to follow life of those soldiers before the attack because we can identify with them thanks to the scenario. After seeing this movie I can say they were not only soldiers, cannon fodder but they were friends, husbands, fathers, and above all, they were human beings and they gave everything they could to their country.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Up and Down,"This movie reminds me of an old nursery rhyme: ""There was a little girl, who had a little curl / right in the middle of her forehead. When she was good, she was very, very good. And when she was bad she was horrid."" You can also sum up this story by saying in the main that the parts in the air are terrific, and the bits on the ground are rather bad.A good example or this is the romance segment between Josh Hartnett and Kate Beckinsale's characters. When they're flying in the air, it is really touching and effective. When they get back on the ground, it all gets tacky and clichéd. Again with Ben Affleck in Britain. The scenes in the air are breathtaking; while the shenanigans on the ground are pretty awful.Exceptions are the guy with the stutter, who I thought was very good; and the draft examination sequence, which I thought worked rather well. Also, despite the strong criticism, I thought Alec Baldwin was terrific as Doolittle; and the famed raid on Tokyo was a good climactic coda. But again; while the characters are in the air or around the aircraft; it goes brilliantly. Once they crash onto the ground, the film literally drops away into schmaltz.I have to say that I still prefer TORA TORA TORA as the better dramatization of this story, especially Jason Robards and Martin Balsam's characters. (My Dad totally loves this version however.) The best way to sum up this film is to say that, while it's not the great masterpiece it's obvious trying to be, it isn't nearly as bad as the critics who savaged it reckoned. It's just a moderately entertaining little story:- but that's something Hollywood doesn't ever seem to want to admit to now, is it?",7.0,Anonymous,History
Too many details overlooked,"A contrived love story unfortunately interrupted by a sneak attack.Why can't Hollywood figure out that a story like Pearl Harbor, or Enemy at the Gate is so perfect that it does not have to be dumbed down with a silly love story?After watching the movie I had three questions:1)  Why were there DC-3s equipped with floater bars.  For those that are not aware, floater bars are used for skydivers so they can hang more people outside the airplane before launching a formation.  Take a close look and you'll see them.2)  Why did do many planes in a single formation have the same tail number? Looked like one plane copied over and over again.3)  I thought Alec Baldwin was leaving the country if George Bush was elected.  Why hasn't he left yet?",1.0,Anonymous,History
Pathetic,"In my opinion the makers of this film have NO RIGHT to call it Pearl Harbour. It is a romance story and they simply set it at Pearl Harbour to get the audiences in.The only other film that has annoyed me so much is Titanic, which used exactly the same tactics.Neither film is worth watching for something like the first 2 hours, just a waste of time.  It is time that film makers were held responsible and not allowed to make rubbish like this on the back of a real story.",,Anonymous,History
Very entertaining and good for the whole family,The most fantastic thing about Pearl Harbor was that no one pilot could have been in so many places; however I liked the RAF interlude and the posters of Churchill. I like the FDR in the movie. This movie was patriotic and the Americans were without a doubt the good guys. My daughter does not like war movies but she liked this one (because of the romance elements). I found it very entertaining and would watch it again though it was not my favorite movie. I personally liked TORA TORA TORA better. I think you need to stick to action or romance they are hard to mix. THE KINGDOM in 2007 at least did not make that mistake Jennifer Garner is nice to look at but she doesn't have any dopey love scenes at least.,7.0,Anonymous,History
"poor fact, worse fiction","It is almost impossible to mix historic fact and actual personalities from the past with fictional characters and plot. The last one to do this really well was Leo Tolstoy, although Herman Wolk did a pretty good job in ""The Winds of War.""

Terrific!!!!:),"I think that this movie was one of the better ""war"" movies that i've ever seen this past year.  Correct me if im wrong but to me it was.  To me they actually chose pretty good actors to play the different parts.  All of them fit in their own place.  Maybe some parts of the movie could have been a little better though.  well in the part of the bombing, some of the bomb effects looked really fake.  but how much can you complain since they did have to use CGI and how realistic can you actually make it but it did look a little fake.  but other than that everything in that movie was accurate. there was another thing.  when the planes first started to fly over and the boys were playing baseball, they were saying that they had the time wrong because why would the boys be playing baseball at around 8 in the morning? but im not sure on that one, its just something i heard or read.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Love-Hate relationship with plenty dislike,"Pearl Harbor is a tough one for me. On one hand I fall victim to the scenery, the set pieces, the historical relevance and time setting, and Kate Beckinsale - but mostly the first three. Like many history buffs, I love a good WWII set film, and the 1941 environment in beautiful Hawaii is so visually pleasing, it can easily be the focus of your attention as a movie goer.Then there's the acting, the shotty love story (and although I'm no feminist nor a chauvinist, the story doesn't portray Kate Beckinsale's character in a very positive light as a female), the clichés and the historical inaccuracy and utter absurdity i.e. Dan Aykroyd sitting in some intelligence room just ""not buying"" what he's reading on the decoding machines. At many times it's difficult to sit thru, similar to the complete cheese content of Top Gun.As far as the actual action shots go (and I use the term action not in reference to the action film genre, but just scenes in which battle action takes place) they are not nearly as poorly done as other films. There is a good amount of live action material so the viewer is not overwhelmed, or should I say underwhelmed, by CGI nonsense. The P-40 or Spitfire scenes are fun and interesting to watch, although not all that accurate, but they still are visually pleasing. Much more true to life than the likes of, say, Red Tails.In the end, I think the only reason Pearl Harbor squeaks by with a 6 is the setting, the beautiful visuals of the island of Hawaii or the 40's set pieces, and the massive historical relevance of the Pearl Harbor incident.All of those positives must be actively searched for while wading thru piles of canine excrement in the form of sub-par acting and God-awful clichés (Josh Hartnet's ""I think WWII just started"" is repeatedly mentioned and rightfully so) along with many historical and factual inaccuracies, all of which are easily pointed out by anyone that knows much of anything about history, aviation technology etc.6 out of 10 solely for the setting and historical story behind all the terribly ""Hollywood stuff"".",6.0,Anonymous,History
Starship Troopers for idiots,"Pear Harbor is Starship Troopers without the irony, wit and intelligence.

See the Movie - Forget the Reviews,"This movie was terrific. The story was interesting and the war scenes were remarkable.

I have read the reviews in USA Today, the Chicago Tribune, and Roger, ""I still haven't been right about a movie"" Ebert in the Chicago Sun-Times. Ebert gave this movie 1 star. This is the same m***n who gave A Knight's Tale 3 stars. Pearl Harbor was exciting, the acting was excellent, and the actors quite appealing. The scenes of December 7, 1941 were as good as war movies get. For those of you who liked ""Saving Private Ryan,"" this is much better. For those of you who hated ""Saving Private Ryan,"" you will like this movie. It is more interesting and much less manipulative than Spielberg's alleged classic.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Mind Blowing Visual Effects,"No matter what anyone says, Pearl Harbor is a great movie.  The cinematography was absolutely gorgeous.  The Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball, bombs dropping, DoLittle planes crashing, planes flying over Japan in the morning, etc...  Special effects were hands down the best I have ever seen.  Another great thing about this movie is the soundtrack.  No matter how many times I hear it, it's always pleasant to listen to and it goes with the movie very well.I know there are many people who were disappointed when they first saw the movie.  Believe me, I was hugely disappointed too.  But I watched it again when it came out on DVD and saw the making of Pearl Harbor and the commentary.  And I realized how powerful this movie was.  Try not to view this as a love story, but rather a war movie.  It's a movie about Pearl Harbor with love story added to attract more audience.  The battle scenes were absolutely gorgeous.  Who could've done it better than Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer?Those who hate this movie so much, please watch it again.  Don't be a little baby and say this is the worst movie ever.

The only action was for like the last 25 mins of the movie, and some how (i don't know how that is!!), is that the Americans won in the end? Doesn't anyone find that strange? Cause the way i learned it in school was that they got slaughtered during that battle and it wasn't till WAY later that the Americans and they allies won!? Well i don't know, maybe I have it wrong.

Tries to do too much,"Excellent action replay of the actual attack but I thought the film was trying to be all things to all men, and that's never easy:1. The romance angle would have made a good film by itself2. The historical details were not as accurate as they could have been  - wasn't the liner 'Queen Mary' used as a troop ship in WW2 and painted all in grey ?  And the time when Rafe flew with the RAF in the Eagle Squadron was said to be 1941, but the type of combat action shown was typical of the Battle of Britain period in summer 1940. The Luftwaffe had given up daylight bombing raids over Britain by 1941 in favour of night attacks, i.e. 'The Blitz'. In any case its main activity in 1941 was supporting the German invasion of Russia.3. The account of the Japanese planning of the attack and the American code breakers attempting to fathom out what was going on is another aspect that could well have made a good story in its own right.But I think the way the critics have panned Kate Beckinsale's American accent is very unfair. It did not strike me as implausible, certainly no worse than the efforts of US actors to speak in English accents.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Pains me to say this:  What a letdown.,"Pearl Harbor had one of the best trailers I've ever seen.  The John Voight voice over even gave it a verisimilitude of a real FDR Fireside Chat.  The shots and staging were some of the best of any film to date.  Bruckheimer and Bay seemed on their way to hitting a grand slam.Instead, they hit a single.If you mute the soundtrack and script, most will agree that Pearl Harbor is perfectly filmed.  The costumes, settings (modern Navy frigates aside), and feel of the film were perfect.  The script, however, is horrendous.  Ben Affleck delivers the worst lines in movie history.  Beckinsale and Hartnett LOOK great, but have equally deplorable dialogue.  Why in God's name would you make Pearl Harbor into a love story?  It reminded me of the Saturday Night Live skit where they combined Crystal Pepsi and gravy to make ""Crystal Gravy.""  Some things just don't mix.No doubt, there are several well made scenes in the film.  Voigt's FDR is actually reall good, but again, we have the perennial dialogue problem. The actual bombing is riveting, but then we return to the moronic love triangle that hangs over the film like a sword of Damocles.  Alec Baldwin and Kim Coates provide throwaway characters -- perhaps the most shallow portrayal of Lt. Col. Doolittle possible.I'm at an impasse because the film could have truly been so much better. Bruckheimer had good actors, big budget, well-financed production, and talented writers.  Yet combined, he created anti-syngeries:  The best looking film with the worst story.I suppose it's impossible to expect every hit to be a grand slam. Bruckheimer did redeem himself with Black Hawk Down.  As for Pearl Harbor, just catch it on HBO reruns.  It's barely worth the rental on Video on Demand.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"Not a great movie, yet with merit","I'll get to the point.Things that were good about this movie include the marvelous battle scenes (though the whole ""jiggly camera"" thing is getting a bit overdone), the cinematography, the acting (pretty good overall), especially considering that the leads were cast more for their appearance than anything.  Don't get me wrong - they don't stink...they just aren't at the top of the list in terms of bards of the stage.The single worst thing about this film was the script (not even the most marvelous acting can overcome silly, corny dialogue).  At one point Jimmy Doolitle (Alec Baldwin) was commenting on the American spirit, and I was expecting Grandma to walk up to him with an apple pie, and for the local high school band to march across the air craft carrier deck playing ""Stars and Stripes Forever"", batons flying.Yes, the storyline was convoluted and unlikely.  And yes, it included some significant historical inaccuracies - though not quite as many as lots of war movies.   Still, the mere fact that it's generating an increased interest in WWII - and the incalcuable sacrifices made by so many during the war - gives it some inherent value.   How else will Mall Rats ever even conceive how grateful they should be to live in this country?  Granted, this movie alone won't do it.  Yet it perhaps may help.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Don't understand the bad reviews,"I thought this movie was a big success. I don't agree or understand with a lot of the reviews saying that it was poorly made or cheesy. I thought the film was very entertaining and also very accurate to the horrible occurrence in history. This is basically World War II titanic version. Titanic and Pearl Harbor do have a good bit in common. Based of of course a tragic true event in history, has a fictional romance between the two main characters, and they're both long!! But I love long movies so it's all good. I liked the romantic storyline Beckinsale had between her and Affleck and eventually Hartnett too. I thought all three of the main actors nailed their roles, especially Josh Hartnett, I very much liked him in this film, came a long way from Halloween H20 (another great film by the way). I also liked Alec Baldwin here too, good fit for him. The movie does a good job with handling both the romantic story lines and the with telling the true events of December 7th, 1941. The visuals were great! From the scenery to the very true to the period sets to the incredible effects during the actual attack scenes. Very well deserved academy award win there. And deserved nominations too, technically the movie looked wonderful. And I enjoyed the dialogue, story lines, and the cast. Don't listen to the critics on this one, give it a try. I loved how they handled the ending too, very well done. 8/10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Watch it for the bombing sequence,"Don't miss this movie because you heard that the history is inaccurate, or that the love story is poorly told, or that the characters are cardboard. These opinions may or may not be yours (they're not mine), but nevertheless, ""Pearl Harbor"" should be seen because of the impressive attack sequence.I've heard that some of the veterans of Pearl Harbor who have seen this movie thought the attack appeared a bit over-the-top, which is probably true, but it does do an excellent job of conveying the sadness, helplessness, and confusion of the event, of seeing all the destruction and wounds inflicted and lives lost, in particular the drowning of all those people trapped within the Arizona.  What an emotionally intense sequence, and I can only imagine how much more magnified these emotions were of the people who were actually there.The love story was so-so; you do empathize with the characters.  But, it doesn't really relate to the actual attack or serve any grand purpose in relation to the war.  Rather, the relationships were explored only as book-ends (beginning and end), and that's probably why it doesn't seem to work very well.  That, and I felt that the triangle was a bit... twisted.So, check out ""Pearl Harbor"" for the actual event itself.  For the attack sequence alone, this movie is worth watching.  You do get a love story on the side, which you may or may not enjoy, plus some extra patriotism (for Americans) with the Doolittle Raid retaliatory airstrike thrown in there, as well as a nice portrayal of the great President Roosevelt.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Impressive,"Michael Bay's films always split people into two categories.  They either like them, or hate them.  One thing both parties can agree on is the fact that his films move.  There is always a pan, a dolly, a zoom or some other camera trick that takes you farther than other films would.  With Pearl Harbor, Bay takes you back to Dec. 7, 1941 and puts you there as the Japanese begin there attack.  What leads up to the attack however, is a somewhat cliched first hour.  We are introduced to Danny and Rafe, two Tennessee fly boys who have designs on the same nurse.  We also are introduced to various other characters that enter into the grand scheme of things.  Through this hour, we learn who they are, what they want from their lives and begin to make a connection with them.  All of this may have been taken care in a little less time, but it's there on the screen, and like it or love it, it's not going anywhere.  Once the attack on Pearl Harbor begins, the first hour fades into the background and you are thrust into the confusion, the horror and the insanity of the early morning attack.  Planes dive in, strafing ships and people. Bombs scream through the sky and explode on their targets as the smoke gets thicker with each passing second. You witness the death of the Arizona, you watch as Dorie Miller mans a machine gun and opens fire on the attacking planes.  You get caught up in the moment and you feel charged as the American forces retalliate against the Japanese.  You then feel the pain and anguish as the wounded pour into the hospital and you see the fear in the faces of the nurses and doctors as they struggle to save their patients.True there may be some historical inaccuracies, and some facts may have been left out or combined into others.  Overall, Pearl Harbor achieves what it's makers set out to do. They wanted to capture the essense of what it was like to be there on that day.  In that regard, they have succeeded.",7.0,Anonymous,History

I love that film,"I watched it several times and most of all I love that love story, the setting and the atmosphere. As it is said in the trivia to the film here on IMDb Michael Bay received hundreds of letters of elder people who expressed that he got it right at what it was like at those times. And that is what I felt when I watched the movie for the first time. I really do not understand how some critics did not notice and did not respect and acknowledge that Michael Bay and his crew were able to bring us back to the early forties during war times. The behavior of the people, the clothes, the music, the band, the dressing, the make up of the women and the innocence of the (well, some) girls and boys looking for love are so impressive. I love the dialogs and the acting. The other main part of the film - what happened before, during and after the attack - is also very well shown, to my opinion. I love the talks of Alec Baldwin as Dollittle with the two main characters and the acting of Baldwin as well of Jon Voight as Roosevelt or Dan Arkroyd as intelligence officer. Michael Bay got it right. He focused on the main occurrences of the Pearl Harbour attacks and set them up quite well.There are a lot of lines and short sequences in the movie that are worth of watching.",10.0,Anonymous,History

While they were at it there is at least another thirty minutes of 'fat' in the film that could have been lost while they were at it. It detracted from the story and left a bad taste when you eventually leave your seat.I think this more than anything else account for the low scores it has received here and elsewhere. I know Hollywood/Americans were loathe to leave the story at the low point of there massacre at Pearl harbour. But, it would have been a much stronger film if you had.Also, the scenes cut in to try and minimise the poor reflection of the Japanese were bordering on farce in themselves.

A fine drama/romance combined with great war action,"""Pearl Harbor"" (2001) is a Titanic-ized version of the tragic events of Pearl Harbor-a fabricated drama/romance hooking the viewer into the deceitful attack of December 7, 1941.It's 85 minutes before the attack occurs so the drama/romance and build-up to the infamous day BETTER be good, and it is. It's believable too (except maybe for the premature sex scene, which inaccurately transfers modern morals to the early '40s). This first act successfully brings us back to the era of the early '40s and sets the stage for the attack. I didn't think there would be any action until the big attack but I was wrong, as we get some quality action when Rafe (Ben Affleck) goes over to Europe to fly for the British. There are also a couple of fight sequences.While dancing & drinking, Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale) comments to Rafe how shy Danny (Josh Hartnett) seems to be while he's shown just sitting at a table too shy to talk to a girl or ask someone to dance. Rafe responds that Danny is like a brother to him, that Danny's father abused him, and he therefore lacks confidence. While these characters are fictional, this is REAL. Much later, Danny goes to a woman's apartment fumbling & stumbling to ask her out. The conversation is, of course, awkward. He then walks away, speaking under his breath, ""You're such an idiot!"" This is good stuff.The film also shows that the timid average-looking man can win the heart of a beautiful woman just as well as the confident handsome man. It's simply a matter of passion, patience, risk, humble pie and playing your cards right.As for the Pearl Harbor attack, it's a full 30 minutes of great war footage. Critics argue that there are many historical inaccuracies in the film, but what? Seriously, what is so historically inaccurate in the film? I'm sure there are a few minor inaccuracies (maybe Jimmy Doolittle's boot laces weren't right, Oh, my God!!), but what film with a historical backdrop ever has everything 100% right? The gist of the event is accurate. And the subplot with Cuba Gooding Jr. As Navy boxer Doris Miller is a true story.The film is also respectful of the Japanese viewpoint as they meticulously plan, prepare for, and carry out their massive raid. I felt this was generous on the filmmakers' part since nothing can justify their deceitful and cowardly assault. They spoke with forked tongue of peace while planning the unprovoked aggression. Meanwhile there's a great scene showing the Japanese pilots the night before the raid, praying and psyching up for the attack. It's very realistic.After the attack, I knew there was a good 50 minutes left in the film so I was apprehensive regarding the remainder of the story; not to worry, though, as this final act compellingly details The Doolittle Raid, the first American bombing mission over Japan. More great war action.This bold mission took place a mere 4.5 months after the Pearl Harbor attack on April, 1942. The raid is notable in that it was the only time in US military history that bombers were launched from an aircraft carrier. Sixteen modified bombers with five-men crews successfully bombed 10 military and industrial targets in and around Tokyo. Unfortunately, this was a one-way mission and they were forced to fly to mainland China to land, crashland or bail out, IF they had enough fuel, that is. Most of the Americans made it to China and safety with the help of Chinese civilians and soldiers, but hey paid dearly for helping as it is estimated that the Japanese killed 250,000 Chinese, vengefully searching for Doolittle's men! Incidentally, Lt. Col. Jimmy Doolittle is greatly portrayed by Alec Baldwin and, true to history, the picture shows Doolittle taking part in the daring mission. More historical accuracy.Some criticize that the Doolittle Raid doesn't belong in the movie, but nothing could be further from the truth. If all the flick showed was the Pearl Harbor attack and the immediate aftermath it would've ended on a real downer. Showing the successful Doolittle Raid makes the film end on a positive note. What effect did the raid have at the time? For one, it caused American moral to soar from the depths. It has the same inspiring effect on viewers.In light of all the criticism I kept waiting for ""Pearl Harbor"" to stumble and fail, but it never happened. Yes, the viewer has to be open to the drama/romance as it leisurely unfolds, but this just helps make the viewer CARE about the characters before the tragic events inevitably occur. I'm not a fan of Michael Bay. I have zero interest in his ""Transformers"" films, but this is great filmmaking. It provokes interest in the events and inspires the viewer to research them in more detail.The film runs 3 hours, 3 minutes.GRADE: A.",9.0,Anonymous,History
God Awful,"This is one of the most horrifically exploitative money-makers in the history of American cinema. Is there no decency left?

I have never EVER seen a movie with such a laughable ridiculous unbelievable, not to mention stupid ending in all my years.This movie should be lost and forgotten amongst the likes of Cool as Ice, and Moulin Rouge!

"Good action bogged down by a sappy, banal love story.","Upon exiting the theater after ""Pearl Harbor,"" I was set upon by a man who referred to the American officials portrayed in the film as ""bumbling idiots."" It's a good thing he said ""Americans,"" because he easily could've been speaking about Rafe, Danny and Evelyn, the trio involved in a love triangle plot that is one of the movie's pitfalls. The sequence of the attack itself is magnificent, but is bookended by the development of the sappy love story and the American attack on Japan. It's not a good sign when, forty minutes into the movie, you find yourself favoring the trailer over the actual movie.Beginning a movie with character development is a good thing, but only if you know how to iron it out. The film opens in Tennessee, with childhood friends Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett) playing pilots in a barn. Moving along a couple of years, they are pilots in the United States armed forces, and like most pilots do, they spend their leave chasing nurses, who are just as man-hungry as the cadets.To make a long and tedious story short, Rafe meets Evelyn, falls in love with her, and is called away to duty in Britain. Circumstances intervene, and Rafe returns to find that Danny and Evelyn are now lovers, casting the whole relationship into strife just in time for the bombing of Pearl Harbor by Japanese air forces.The movie tries unsuccessfully to balance the love story with historical facts and events. Every now and then, we leave their happy lives together to venture to the United States War Department, where Captain Thurman (Dan Aykroyd) and President Roosevelt serve little purpose except to foreshadow the impending attack that we already know is imminent (the title, duh!). We're also given a dosage of Japanese movements, from their planning of the bombing to Japanese naval craft and planes making their way to Hawaii. If we had more of this kind of material, the movie just might work.But instead, it loses focus from the real story behind Pearl Harbor, settling for the love story in hopes of bringing out some sort of human drama to bring out our emotions for the tragedy as a whole. This brings out the ever-present ""Titanic"" machinations, as it also included fiction with history. Now, I cannot begin to criticize the historical aspect of the film; I know too little about the whole sequence of events to make a comparison. But what I can tell you is that ""Titanic"" was able to provide us with likeable, involving characters amidst a very accurate historical setting.For some reason, the same formula applied here fails. We can't really care for Evelyn, Danny and Rafe because of the story they are given. There's toomany romance clichés which bury the characters in a mess of break-ups and budding romance similar to the switches that an everyday, stereotypical teenage girl would make. Maybe that's an audience-targeting tactic, or just an honest mistake. Either way, the love story does nothing but add on the baggage, filling the cracks with sappy one-liners and unconvincing dialogue.And the movie's turn of events after the actual bombing itself is ludicrous and draggy. It makes Rafe and Danny out to be heroes known among all, hoping to instill some air of patriotism alongside flag wavers and cheers from the men in the water as they successfully down two Japanese fighter planes. Soon after, they must leave on a mission to Tokyo, where they set out to perform a counterstrike against the Japanese. At one point, one of the characters (I think it was Doolittle, played by Alec Baldwin), makes the statement that the mission is ""to avenge Pearl Harbor."" Obviously an attempt to connect this action with the previous sequences, but no such luck. It goes on for too long, and wouldn't you know it, there has to be more of the love story involved as well.Which brings me to my discussion of the actual attack portion of the movie. This is the section to see, if you are willing to stick it out until then. The intensity really does reach a high note as the planes begin descending on Hawaii, and although we know what will happen, it's quite exciting and moving to watch it all unfold onscreen. The bombing of the ships does not happen too fast, but gets it just right by taking its time in showing us the panic in and out of the ships in the bay. Another high point is the events that take place in the hospital ward, where thousands of wounded soldiers begins appearing. The movie does well with this entire sequence, not only because of some spectacular special effects, but because the love story characters are left alone to perform their real duties, leaving behind the sap and giving us a real taste of human drama.In summation, ""Pearl Harbor"" does not live up to the hype surrounding it. The human drama and excitement of the attack on American forces is drowned by the love story, which never reaches a level of reality, while the ending flatlines completely. I had many questions at the end of the movie: is this really the work of Randall Wallace, who also wrote the magnificent ""Braveheart?"" Do the filmmakers think that by ignoring the actual focus of the story, it will become more involving? I have one thing to say about the movie: the trailer is better.",,Anonymous,History
"Great War Scenes, Crappy Love Story","This movie has some incredible war scenes. The integration of action and CGI seems flawless and it is truly worth seeing the movie for the 45 minutes or action. However, the love story is very contrived and border-line ridiculous. After seeing the movie, I thought the love story should have been on Jerry Springer. Character development is a little slow, but a decent performance by Affleck does good. Alec Baldwin does way too much over-acting. Dont expect too much when you see this film.",7.0,Anonymous,History

"Pacific World War II, or aka Top Gun II","After Top Gun, the Hunt for Red October and Saving Private Ryan, one would expect Hollywood to make a film about the biggest American loss in war since ever, possibly a harsher strike, all in one even bigger than Vietnam. The battle of all battles that involved the United States armies into WWII in such a way that it makes you think that it was an emotional vengeful reaction towards what i would consider a really below the belt kind of strike by the fierce Japanese armies, mainly made up of fast planes and death squadrons of kamikaze culture war style. Although, on the other hand, stretegically the attack was a piece of work on the japs side, with possibly very careful planning and a lot of armed planes that would go early and fast to wake up the sleeping giant of the Americas, which sooner or later would have been involved either way.But enough about war, lets get into the movie with a stellar studded cast with Ben Affleck at the heigh of his career, Kate Beckinsale playing american playgirl very masterfully, as well as as Josh Hartnett who does a really good job in his role of the wounded heart soldier, closing in with afew notable mentions, best of which Alec Baldwin, who comes into the second act of the movie. The attack itself is played beautifully, even better in many ways than the Saving Ryan flick, plus the colorful shots of heightened glorification style. The special effects involved in the flyby, the rocket into the ship, the explosions and the hospital horror are one guilty pleasure clip after another, ending it with Affleck and his boys getting back into the air, which combines for the best part of Pearl Harbor visual piece ever made, bar none.The cast of the gang og soldiers and nurses play very well with each other, in fact I would say best among soldier collision army barracks parts, since the Thin Red lLine movie in Vietnam. The romance is very well set up with Ben Affleck seeming a bit over the top and too yakee, but that is to be excpected of him. Josh hartnett and Beckinsale i would say work together a whole lot better in a more natural way than Affleck, creating a trinome of American soap drama which really makes the movie worth it, not to mention Beckinsale reading letters from far away ashore the pacific, which just brilliantly adds emotion which titanically supplies the movie with a storyline of humanity and relationships.Here are the parts which DONT work, other than Affleck coming off too communisty, the second act is really unnecessary and it deviates the whole story too much with the atom bomb and takes it away from the Harbor hit too much, although Alec Baldwin does his part best and close to Hunt for October. It deviates and it makes it exhausting to watch, while the romance had ended and the best Hartnett ever seen dies, as half way excpected. The revenge may be also a human emotion and feature of life but it was too much, historically and militarily to make the movie a nasty exercise of ""napalm fire in Japan' kind of thing and it ruins the main purpose the film which was beautifully introduced in the first act, while it takes away from dynamics of relations of soldier nurse drama which was already providing the second act very well through the romance. The plane bomb with Baldwin really made it look a bit like a split up Modern Warfare episode. But nevertheless, although ovberly extended and too long it was still very watchable and enjoyable piece of Hollywood history.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Crap!,"Pearl Harbor may be the worst film I have ever had the displeasure of sitting through in the theatres.  Boring is probaly the best word to descripe this film, though you good use several others like: corny, crappy, sappy, trite, disrespectful, Titanic-wannabe, or just plain bad.  The dialouge is laugable, and the actors delievering it don't do anything to help matters.  The movie so badly wants to be Titanic but can because of Michael Bay.  He should realize that he is no James Cameron, and that every film he has directed with the exception of The Rock has been horrible; this guy has absolutely no talent what so ever and needs to get out of the film business.  Another thing that makes me angry about this film is that it is trying to make money off of one of the worst events in United States history.  In the movie soliders bodies are flung across the screen like extras in a Rambo film with absolutely no respect in the least bit. Everyone involved with the film should be ashamed for not only making one of the worst movies of all time, but for being so shameful with their handling of the matter.

We need a change.,"I find this film one of the most difficult ones to comment. It has so many good points and so many bad points that you can think it's either a good or a bad film.But, to avoid that complexity, I'll try to recall them and write them down here, and let you construct your own conclusion. Of course, you have to keep in mind at every moment that this is the most expensive film ever made so far. So these are the points.1) The music. I place it at the first place because it is in my opinion the worst thing in the movie. This film needed a soundtrack by John Williams, for example. He would never have used that ""minor seventh"" chord for almost all the scenes (including both love and war scenes), which makes the film so emotionally flat. In Gladiator we have a good example of what music can do to a film (not to mention Star Wars...).2) The script. Pearl Harbor has a really poor script, based on a simple and original idea but poorly developed. In Saving Private Ryan we have a simple and original idea brilliantly developed. The film is so predictable that 1 hour before its ending I already knew it (I think that even before that...). It's a paradox in a film which is based in a fact that's basically one of the biggest surprises in history. Well, you could say ""but history is already known"", and you would be right, but the film isn't already known until you watch it. In Titanic I really was surprised when the ship collided...!3) The look. This film succeeds in creating another world for us. We feel transported to another time, with plenty of details, and that's something remarkable. The nurses look like fashion models, and Evelyn puts lipstick on her lips in every scene, but I'm not really sure if things were that way in 1941.4) The special effects. Pearl Harbor has one of the best special effects I have ever seen. The war scenes are so real that they can override all the bad points we could find. A lot of CGI has been used, but it's well done and looks real. As a result there is the best recreation ever made of what the Pearl Harbor attack could be. As in Saving Private Ryan, we find ourselves inside the battle and understand what those people should feel.5) The message. I know that films don't necessarily need a message, but this one needed one. And it really has one, but with a wrong envelope. In Saving Private Ryan, the old man at the cemetery asks his family if he is a good person. He has no physical injuries, but his soul is badly damaged, and desperately asks for a redemption to rip that black ghost away from him. We call this CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT, and there's nothing of this in Pearl Harbor. Rafe and Danny kill a lot of people and pass through extreme situations, Evelyn lives the worst nightmare in her life, and after all of that we don't see any change in them. Most war films from the past (being most of them propaganda films) are the same way. That's NOT real, and doesn't help at all to send a message as we don't identify with the characters.You can make your own conclusions. This is mine: Film industry has lost its aim, which used to be art. They live for the moment, and don't care for anything but money. Nowadays a lot of good special effects are the perfect passport to success. All the other elements are chosen by its impact on masses rather than by its artistic value. And the artistic value is what really makes great films adored by masses, but in a long term.If you are curious about my rating to this film, here it is: 6-7/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"I don't care what the critics say, I like Ben Affleck and I loved this movie.","Pearl Harbor kept me in my seat from start to finish.  I could have lived without the love story (or at least with a different version of the love story, which is the most I can say without giving it away), which probably would have made the movie 45 minutes shorter and a little less commercial. But Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett made great war heros and their relationship brought a warmth that often doesn't exist in a war movie. Yes, Pearl Harbor was written to be a blockbuster rather than a critical success, but aside from Alec Baldwin's badly written part I thought it was a great lift-your-spirits patriotic movie in these times where we are no longer proud to be Americans (or at least afraid to show it).  And it was a good portrayal of young soldiers during that time.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Better Than Some Would Have You Believe,"No, it's not a great film, but it's a lot better than some would have you believe. Essentially, it's a 1940's style war film. This means patriotic verbal expressions and images, and a less than obsessive sense of historical accuracy. But (despite the marketing) that isn't the film's point. It's a romantic fantasy and a very good one at that. If you expect more from it, then you'll be disappointed in it. But I don't think this is a fault with the film. It's the fault of the expectations we bring to it, and a brow-beating marketing campaign. If you want to compare it to something, compare it to ""From Here to Eternity."" It's in that genre of films.  While not a great film, it is certainly a good, entertaining one. And for a long movie (183 minutes), it flies by very quickly.",7.0,Anonymous,History
An Angry Historian & Writer,"As a professional historian and published author I find it impossible to avoid throwing in a few comments about this film.   I finally went to see it this weekend (July 14th) long after the hoopla surrounding its release, and yes I did go primed as a critic due to what I heard from students who take my course on WWII.I left the theater feeling angry,  angry over the fact that the film could have been far more effective, entertaining, and revealing simply by being respectful of the history of that fateful day. Of course I understand the need for profit in film.   I've had several books optioned for the screen, and whether I am writing fiction or history, I of course have an eye on the bottom line.   And yet I would like to think that when it comes to certain subjects, that these subjects would be approached with the respect they deserve.  Pearl Harbor, D-Day, Gettysburg, the deaths of Kennedy, King and Lincoln are sacred moments in our history and when done on film should at least be treated with some respect.  I am not asking for a somber documentary, or even a high tech remake of ""Tora Tora Tora,"" but I was hoping for a bit more than the trivia dished out with an obvious eye towards marketing to the 18 year old female audience. I can not fathom why second rate directors and production teams feel compelled to trash over history in favor of improbable fiction, when so often the real stories are far more compelling. Spielberg did this beautifully in both Schindler and Private Ryan.   The real history was respected, the fiction blended in with skill and grace, creating films that are the highest level of entertainment, while at the same time being films worthy of historical respect.   I use both in my classes, and the most successful class I've ever taught involved bringing in four D-Day vets and opening the class with the first fifteen minutes of Private Ryan.   I would never dream of insulting my class, or veterans, with the use of Pearl Harbor. Of course I could carry on about the absurd plot lines, (come on, the guy would of gotten a telegram out the day he got out of France), the technical screw ups (1980s frigates as targets, flying in the wrong direction when the B-25s head to China. . .the sun is setting behind them. . . and the planes did not bomb as a group, and why did Affleck get on a train in New York to go to England when the Queen Mary was sitting in the harbor) but I think the issue runs far deeper. It is an issue of all the lost potentials of this film.   Sure, go ahead and create fictional characters in a real setting, some of the best books ever about history are actually historical fiction, but what was lost was the potentials of the real stories.  Forty five minutes less of poorly written romance replaced with a rich cast of supporting actors playing real roles could have transformed the film.    When the ""Oklahoma"" rolled over hundreds of men were trapped inside.   They touched on it in the film, but what a lost moment for a real character, the boxer who fought Dorie for example, with just a couple dozen lines of writing to develope him out and we could have better felt the horror of it.   Yes we did see Dorie, but it was sensed that the role was almost an obligatory salute to diversity, rather than a heart felt introduction to the gallant role played not just by African Americans but also Latinos and Filipinos serving that day.   How frustrating---all the lost stories that could have been brought to life. The Japanese side deserved far more, instead it was reduced to a few attempts at imitating Kurosawa's ""Ran"" with the outdoor sets and banners. I did like the dialogue of the pilot writing to his father, but damn it, here was a chance to create a real character, a pilot with a family, willing to die for his country, and then indeed he does die, shot down in the raid. If we had followed his perspective for just a few minutes the raiders would have been far more than soulless killing machines.   The only human touch I felt for the Japanese side was the gunner waving the children off, a genuine act which did reveal at least some humanity on a side that fought brilliantly even if it was for a cause that was wrong. As an historian yet again I left a theater frustrated at what could have been, and angered how a crucial moment in our history was reduced to trivia. I must repeat that there are certain moments in history which are sacred to a people and should be handled as such when someone wishes to make money off of them. This film trashed the memory of that day of infamy, and tragically another twenty years must now pass before someone attempts to do it right.  Unfortunately those brave few survivors of that day will no longer be with us to see it. I just hope that the next ""historical"" film that comes out does in some small way truly connect to the real history, and in so doing both the producers and the public will profit from the result.",,Anonymous,History

"An incredibly corny, war-glamorizing, anti-historical film that I found surprisingly entertaining","I did not want to like this film.  Much of the dialogue is corny and sappy in a bad 1930s Broadway musical kind of way.  The plot is barely focused on the historical details of the Pearl Harbor bombing, even though that is the title of the film.  There is a sort of light-hearted jovial attitude to this whole war business, as if everyone is just out to have a good time. Whenever Alex Baldwin's character spoke, it made me feel like laughing.  (I kept picturing him in that SNL skit about ten years ago where he played the boy scout leader.)  And yet, I found myself enjoying this whole film and wanting to see what came next for almost the entire three hours.  I did not ever get bored.  I laughed (sometimes when other people were crying, but hey, that's why you get when you write lines so sappy that they get stuck in the audience's hair) and I cried (mostly during the battle scene).  And that battle scene, wow, what a tremendous piece of work.  Just non-stop gripping action for an hour.  I guess my main comment on a film such as this is that I feel guilty for liking it because I believe that some of its images are so NOT the way life (or history) is.  Everything is just too easy in this flick.  But I guess if one accepts it as entertainment, then, eh, whatever.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Sleep-inducing,"It seems that this movie is one of the most hated movies ever made (at least reading comments here on IMDb and also listening to people commenting on it elsewhere). But then there's the other crowd who truly enjoyed it and thought it was among the best war epics ever. Myself, i must say that i have seldom seen a movie that felt so much like an endurance test. I was chewing on my seat just to have something to do while sitting in the theater.The problems with this movie are numerous and of catastrophic proportions. While a lot could be said about the atrocious acting and overly pompous style of the movie, that is not the main flaw. Rather the script is the main offender. Seeing that writer Randall Wallace has also written such epic manure as ""We were soldiers"" and ""The man in the iron mask"" comes as no real surprise. The scriptwriting here is terrible, and it's completely insane that the demands for the script were not higher on a movie budgeted at over 135 million dollars. Basically this is a script and story worthy of a porn movie. It's one hour build-up, one hour massacre and one hour slowdown in the end. Unbearably boring is the key-word for all three sequences.Because the main problem with this movie is not the keen patriotism, the laughable ""acting"" from Ben Affleck or the sappy love themes. No it's the combination of all these. It's not awful like ""We were soldiers"", nor is it crap in a ""bad but entertaining"" way. Rather it's just an insufferable bore. The only part of the movie where i was not half-unconscious was during the actual attack on Pearl Harbor. In that sequence one could easily see where the 135 million dollars went...Maybe it's just me. But still i personally feel that demands should be a little higher on a movie that cost as much as this one. The least i should be able to demand is that i don't fall asleep in my chair!

Horrible telling of the real life tragedy...,"I have to say that this has been the most disappointing movie that I have ever seen. It is proof that a huge budget can't make a great movie. The actors were horrible in their roles and the dialogue was uninspired and fake. Actors off the streets could have used more emotion than these ""so-called Hollywood stars.""  Goofs, such as showing ships from the 1980's, were just stupid and unbelievable. Does the director really think the audience is that stupid not to notice? The ""romance"" plot was so badly written it nearly made me sick. The only thing good about this film is when the credits appeared at the end. I almost felt like throwing my drink at the screen because the movie was so long, dragged out and just all together boring. Ben Affleck has got to be the most overrated actor I have ever seen. His performance in this film is almost as well done as Jake Lloyd from Star Wars. I give this movie a 1 but if you are curious I suggest you see it as well.

Fraudulent,"Allright, so I watch the trailer and I think it is going to be POSSIBLY even better than American Beauty.  I look at it and say ""Well geez, that is going to be one spectacular film"" and so, I get two of my closest friends and I go to the movies!  So, I sit there for the 3 hours 5 minutes, and enjoy the film, right?  Well, yes, I am a 13 year old female that basically saw the film only because the two main characters are incredibly good looking; I feel that probably many other females did the same as I.  The first time I saw this movie, I was blown away it was great, I got teary eyed, the special effects were great... and so I decided to see it another time.  I enjoyed it even more the second time, and then I bought the soundtrack.  You are probably thinking that I mislead you by the summary at the top ""fraudulent"" or that I don't know what it means, but let me continue.  So, I am overly touched by this film and I cried and all when ????? died.  Then, I went home and discussed it with my brother.  I guess that I didn't realize that the main reason I did like it was BECAUSE of the love story, which wasn't even based on a true story which totally takes away from this being a ""realistic, historical film"" or whatever.  I mean, the film was basically a love story that got ""interesting"" around the comings of the whole attack on Pearl Harbor.  I didn't go to it to see a love story, I wanted to see a historical film on a subject in which my history teacher lectured about, something that I found interesting.  The whole battle scene lasted 40 minutes, but then it basically went back to the love story.  That's basically forty minutes about what the movie is presented to be (about the bombing).  I did enjoy the whole Doolittle's raid part.  Though, although Ben and Josh are gorgeous, they aren't great actors, which was kind of a reason I turned out to not enjoy the film after hours of really thinking about it.  Probably the greatest actor, who played an incredible role, was that Jon Voight, the one who played F.D.R.  he put on an incredible performance and hopefully he will be in line for some academy awards.  So, if you know what happended at Pearl Harbor, you really don't need to see this movie.  I give it a 4/10.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Laughably awful,"One of the most anticipated movies of the summer, Pearl Harbor had the opportunity to be an epic. But it failed miserably.

Firstly, if you're looking for something historically accurate, don't bother. I'm not quite sure which war this movie was supposedly taking place during, because it sure wasn't World War II. Of course, if you like laughing at how idiotic Americans are, you have plenty of opportunities, for example, when one of the characters shouts ""I think World War II just started"" - in 1941.The acting wasn't half bad, but unfortunately the actors had very little to work with. The love story, which takes up most of the movie, had a plot more ludicrous than any bad daytime soap opera. The basic premise is a love triangle set against the events leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Ben Affleck plays Rafe, an American pilot who signs up for the Eagle Squadron and goes to Britain to fight, leaving behind Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale), his one true love. The plot is complicated when Danny (Josh Hartnett), his best friend from childhood, falls in love with Evelyn. Now, normally, I hate predictable movies, but this one would have been better off staying the course. Instead, its plot twists and and turns are so ridiculous, they turn the love story into a comedy routine.Not that this movie was all bad. It had its good points. The fight scenes in the planes, though short, were fun, as was seeing lots of ships get blown up. The special effects were definitely the highlight of the movie.Unfortunately, Pearl Harbor had far too little excitement and far too much stupidity. At over three hours, it was also far too long, especially considering how the entire battle at Pearl Harbor only lasted two hours in reality. It's really too bad, because with a cast including Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and the surprisingly talented Josh Hartnett, and one of the greatest stories of the twentieth century for material, it really should have been much better.",3.0,Anonymous,History
Movie-going public badly misled,What was promised in the trailers was not delivered in the theaters.  The studio used the special effects showing the attack on Pearl Harbor to get folks hooked then fed them a limp chick flick.  The movie stinks.  Big waste of time.,,Anonymous,History
Touching but unreal,"This is a good movie, with the most good looking people, beautiful, magnificent scene and great songs. However, the plot is too weak and dramatic. Definitely the romantic and patriotic emotion are so pure and touching. But it is too pure to be true. The real life should be always more complicated. I couldn't feel empathy because I am not in that environment and that era. What I will love more is love story about ordinary people. Ordinary people are more complicated, ordinary people are not that good looking to love each other from the first glance. Ordinary people may not be good looking, may not be so selfless, so brave, so patriotic. However, they would still be willing to understand another ordinary person, be willing to love and give.",6.0,Anonymous,History
More of a Firecracker Pop Than An Explosion,"Like a bomb, Pearl Harbor had a lot of potential. From the first movie trailer to the endless promotion, it kept building and building to that moment where it can break loose and explode into a fantastic movie, lighting up the big screen. But when that moment came, it merely let loose some crackles that fireworks would make and not the explosion it was very capable of.The movie begins in Tennessee, 1923. Friends Danny (Josh Hartnett, although this is a younger version of Danny first seen) and Rafe (Ben Affleck, with the same situation) are best friends and aspiring pilots. When the years pass, they've acquired their dream and are now pilots for the military. Soon, Rafe, by order of General Dolittle (Alec Baldwin), is shipped to fight in England, much to the distress of army nurse and Rafe's girlfriend Evelyn (Kate Beckinsale). But in America, Danny, Evelyn, and other army members are shipped to safety in Pearl Harbor (resulting in dramatic irony for us, since we know exactly how ""safe"" Pearl Harbor really is). Rafe's plane crashes during a fight, resulting in news to Danny, Evelyn, and other friends that Rafe is dead. But after a few months of grieving, Evelyn and Danny develop a love for each other, only to find out later that Rafe is actually alive and coming back to Pearl Harbor, making their romance a part of a love triangle.Cinematically, this movie was brilliant. The war sequence far into the movie was very compelling and awesome to watch. And one scene I thought was a little overlooked amongst all the publicity was the scenes in the hospital prior to the Pearl Harbor bombing. The blurriness and shaking seen was a great way to show the stress in that hospital.The acting was great too. Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett really showed us the strength of their acting muscles. Kate Beckinsale also made a very good first impression on me and I hope she'll get some more projects in the future. My personal favorite was Cuba Gooding Jr. as real military hero Dori Miller, a cook who took on fighting the Japanese during the Pearl Harbor attack.However, the dialogue was something that really bothered me in this movie. It had so many cliche'd lines, especially in exchanges of love. I'm not saying that in order to have a good script, you need great, dramatic, poetic lines. I mean, not every screenwriter is a poet or a classic author. It's just that where corny lines were placed, a much better line could've been used. One big example is when Evelyn and Danny are about to make love behind some curtains. Danny is over Evelyn, and you can almost feel their passion. It seems like it's going to be so romantic. But then, Danny speaks his sentence of love, romance, and passion...""My heart's pounding."" That's it. See what I mean? That was one of many scenes where the dialogue's potential was totally wasted.This movie could've been spectacular. And it was good. Great, even. Better than I had begun to think, what with new views of the movie surfacing. But it could've been so much more, and that's the only thing that disappointed me.7/10, B-",7.0,Anonymous,History

A MUST SEE,"I saw Pearl Harbor the weekend it opened.  I think it was an awesome movie that everyone should see.  It portrayed the attack on Pearl very well, as confirmed by several veterans of WWII.  It opened my eyes to the horror and reality of it in a way not many movies have done.And now the down side:  Normally I am a real ""chick flick"" lover and appreciate a good love story, but not in this one.

#1 Most Historically Inaccurate Movie,"I love WWII movies, I've studied WWII history my whole life. That is exactly why I rate this movie as awful. Because it is. Serious historians continually rank it one of the most inaccurate movies of all time.The list of reasons defy time and space to list, but suffice to say that the basic premise that a fighter pilot with no bomber experience would even be selected to train for as difficult a mission as the Doolittle raid defies belief. This is history for those who actually believe that ""Reality TV"" bears any resemblance to reality.Seriously, get your WWII history from books that were written by those who were there, and read from all sides. If interested, I can give you a good starter list. Hollywood rarely gets even close. Better yet, go volunteer at your local VA hospital or clinic while we still have some veterans around to talk to, and ask them!",1.0,Anonymous,History
Very average piece of work.,"I forgot when was the last time this was shown here on the television. I know they showed it here a few times. I did watched in one of those times it was on the TV.Given I am once a History student, and WWII was part of the syllabus, Pearl Harbor is also part of it...though not much in detail in my History textbook actually... Anyhow, I still watched the movie anyway. Given this is about what led to America's participation in WWII, I just kept my comments to myself till the movie ended.And I realised after I saw the movie, what is really going on? Okay, I think the love story part might had played a little too much and spoiled the entire movie almost. Speaking from someone who once took History, this is not really what I had expected at all.This one is very, very average.",6.0,Anonymous,History

Aproper title for this movie found have been somthing like ""Deadly love triangle: at pearl harbor""",1.0,Anonymous,History
amazing movie,"This movie, as many have stated is more like three movies in one. I think they are interwoven beautifully. The characters are all great and believable. Their situations seem real enough. The characters that really stand out for me are Josh Hartnett's Danny Walker, Kate Beckinsale's Evelyn and the actor who played Red. I enjoyed Alec Baldwin as Doolittle, also. I waited 2 years before I saw this movie and it is the human relationships that really drew me into the movie. Another story it follows is the build up of the Japanese attack. I thought that was very well done. And then of course there is the attack which is pretty amazing and realistic. All together this movie has a little bit of everything. I have been watching it over and over and over and have not tired of it yet. A number of people talk about the inaccuracy of the historical content. Seeing this movie has interested me in looking further into the event and they took some liberties but all in all I think they portrayed it fairly straight. I'm not sure why so many people seem to hate this movie but if you haven't seen it look past all their negative comments and give it a try.  I think you'll like it. I sure do!",,Anonymous,History
A visually stunning war drama with heartfelt music,"Pearl Harbor is one of those movies that gets a lot of hate, but honestly, I don't think it deserves all of it. People go in expecting a war film and get a romance drama instead, which seems to be where most of the criticism comes from. The plot focuses more on a love triangle than the historical attack itself, and while that might not be what everyone wanted, it was clearly the film's intention. If you can accept that it's a romantic drama set against a war backdrop, rather than a war film with romance sprinkled in, then you might appreciate it for what it is.Michael Bay's direction is exactly what you'd expect-big, explosive, and visually intense. The action sequences, especially the Pearl Harbor attack, are filmed in his signature style, and they still hold up today. The cinematography is clean, with dramatic wide shots of aerial combat, fiery destruction, and emotional close-ups. Where the film struggles is its pacing. It stretches certain sequences for too long, making it feel uneven at times. The final act, while exciting, feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the movie, almost like it belongs to a different story.Acting-wise, Ben Affleck, Josh Hartnett, and Kate Beckinsale do a decent job, but the material they're working with doesn't always help them. Their performances are solid but not standout, with some emotional scenes feeling a little forced. The supporting cast, including Cuba Gooding Jr. And Alec Baldwin, adds weight to the film, but the character development is mostly surface-level. The script has its moments but leans into melodrama too often, making some scenes feel more exaggerated than they need to be.That said, Pearl Harbor delivers where it counts in terms of visuals and sound. The action sequences are stunning, with incredible aerial shots, intense battle choreography, and a level of destruction that still holds up today. The sound design adds a layer of realism, making the chaos of war feel immersive. And then there's Hans Zimmer's score, which is hands down one of the best aspects of the film. His music elevates the emotions, making the highs more exhilarating and the lows more heartbreaking. If you watch Pearl Harbor for its spectacle, its music, and its grand-scale drama, there's a lot to enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
"When the attack comes, watch out!","Ok.  Let's be honest here.  Neither director Michael Bay nor uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer have ever been labeled as subtle.  Nor have they ever been known for script.  They are known for concept.  They are known for action. They are known for special effects.  And that, ultimately, is what PEARL HARBOR delivers.I will agree that the film takes a while to get started, and ultimately we in the audience have to suffer through as many bad lines as bullets fired by Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).  But the film is nowhere near as bad as the critics made it out.  It is not the root of all evil.  There is far worse dreck out there occupying space on a video store shelf.  The fact is that once the movie does get going and the and the Japanese attack, the films visuals simply soar.  Some of the sequences are amazing.  And this is where the heart of the film lies.  Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have created a visual spectacle at the expense of story and character (neither Ben Affleck nor Josh Hartnett are good enough actors to elevate what little material they have been given here).",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Patriotism"" does not justify this miserable script","Let me say first that I really wanted to like this film, despite what I had heard about it. It was much worse than I feared. Jerry Bruckheimer should be exiled to Bombay Films or beyond  for producing this overblown piece of garbage and then trying to sell it as a must see patriotic epic.The first hour of the film contains some of the most stilted, cliche ridden dialog I have been subjected to in years.  I know the love story was included as a sort of ""chickflick within the guy flick "" to appeal to female viewers, but the lady I watched it with kept bursting out laughing at the ridiculous cliches spouted by the contrived characters. (Maybe the target audience is really 13 year old girls.) Ben Afflech was incapable of delivering a convincing Southern accent, and many of his lines sounded like they were delivered in a not very good high school play.  This has got to be his worst performance ever. Ditto for Alec Baldwin.  Jon Voight has the only very good performance as FDR, but he is ""lost at sea"" in this one.What truly amazes me is that this corn ball script ever made it into production.The inclination to inflated, melodramatic dialog that writer Randall Wallace showed in Braveheart runs totally out of control here. Bruckheimer & Bay must have thought that dramatic lighting, sweeping cinematography, great special effects, and a lot of loud, Dances With Wolves style movie music would turn this turgid Harlequin romance into some kind of a patriotic, misty eyed nostalgia piece. Message to Jerry B.,  ""Garbage in, Garbage out!"" But what about the much ballyhooed action sequences? Admittedly, they were often exciting and, at times, inspiring, but IMO, Bay & Bruckheimer once again shot themselves in the foot by wretched excess.  For example, they spent millions on a very convincing computer generated recreation of the Japanese attack on battleship row, and then proceeded to intercut fake explosions on unmistakably modern US navy ships that happened to be moored in Pearl Harbor at the time they did the shooting.  For a movie that touted itself as ""as historically accurate as modern technology can make it"", this is the equivalent of having the the Nurses drive around 1941 Pearl Harbor in a red 1968 Corvette in the midst of 1939 Fords. Flashy but totally wrong. How could this happen? Bay's explanation on the DVD is revealing.  He says when they saw the modern ships moored in the Harbor, they got Navy permission to stage real explosions on them, so they would have ""real ships"" blowing up, as opposed, (I suppose) to historically accurate, but computer generated ships that they  had already spent millions to destroy in such dramatic and convincing fashion. The contradiction of adding modern guided missle destroyers to 1930s battleships apparently did not trouble anyone. If anything, this reveals a total lack of any real passion about producing an accurate historical depiction of events.  That was all just BS marketing talk.  The irony is that this movie really didn't even need those extra fireworks. If you have seen the film, you know that, if anything, it has more than enough slam bang explosions and the running time is much too long to support the shallow material.  So why add the modern ship explosion shots at all? Because, for Jerry Bruckheimer & Michael Bay, there are never enough explosions.  There is never enough loud,melodramatic music. There are never enough golden hued Norman Rockwell shots, piled one on top of another, oozing ersatz atmosphere. There can never be enough heavy handed, manipulative dialog. Because they fear if they let off the sensory accelerator for one second, the audience will snap out of it's stupor and realize that this film  has the depth and artistry of an over produced 3-minute MTV video stretched  to almost 3 hours. More explosions are better than historical accuracy 'cause the kids like 'em and the audience forgets, for a moment, about the very silly script..  Everytime the fireworks stop in this film, the shallow dialogue and endless cliches proved more deadly to this viewer than Japanese torpedos. IMO, on the DVD, Jerry B's lack of real confidence in the film is painfully obvious. He knows it is a turkey. Ditto for Randall Wallace -- he sounds like a defendant on trial. The special effects are sometimes amazing, but they cannot offset the endless, mind numbing mediocrity of the rest of this shallow film. Some people have said, ""well this is an important subject, and Hollywood has to make  trade offs to popularize the material and attract a wider audience.""  Fair enough, but there are good Hollywood epics and bad Hollywood epics, This is a really bad one, being sold as a ""must see"" because of it's historical content.. Using patriotism to sell second rate schlock is disgusting. I have no problem with pop Hollywood renditions of historical events, if they are reasonably well done.  I would recommend ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" any time over this flick. And,  IMO,  if you want to see a really good Hollywood war movie, set in this historical period, rent  ""30 Seconds Over Tokyo.""  It puts ""Pearl Harbor"" to shame.",1.0,Anonymous,History

I was so glad I did aswell because it was brilliant and fun and if I just saw that Pearl Harbor attack on video then I would of been missing some amazing cinema magic. Josh Hartnett and Ben Affleck were good as the American fighter pilots but the film would of been better if the romance was worked on a bit and they didn't make the British Air Force look so badly beaten and unheroic. So if the characters were worked on a lot more then this would of been a all round great film but as they didn't it only gets a very good.

Don't let the Sunsets ruin what history the film does have in it.,"Now to enjoy stuff like this, YOU HAVE  TO KNOW WHEN TO TAKE IT SERIOUSLY! The attack is incredible and has lots of fireworks and the Arizona was done in all its sickening detail. You see the 2 football-feild long ship go up like a 50 cent firecracker and you KNOW 1,117 men just went out into eternity (which is so much worse when you think that many weren't even saved!) The only event I can think of that was worse is what happened 14 months ago, 14 days before my 17th birthday in September, 2001.Now the film would be utterly beautiful if it could back up the FX with a good solid, based on history, PLOT. Unfortunately, Micheal was so mesmorized by the Sunsets that he forgot. The Battle over England was so realistic, I wish a whole film about 8th Air Force would come out that looked like that! Speaking of bombing raids, this film also covers the Doolittle Raid, and I can't find ANY inaccurracies in that part of the film, SO if you have a DVD of it you can just watch those parts (And they are worth the money in themselves).NOW, I love computer games and my favorite is World War 2 Fighters. I first saw this in a theater and seeing those P-40's take down enemy Zekes; well, it felt the same way as the game, (AND IF YOU'VE PLAYED WW2 FIGHTERS YOU KNOW THAT IS A GOOD THING!). So watch the first 5 minutes, fast foward 20 minutes, then another hour and 5 , and finally another hour to see the worthwhile stuff. I won't even start talking about the real plot. From reading others' comments, I think that's been covered.",10.0,Anonymous,History
A love story set against an historical event,"This is is not as historically accurate as Tora, Tora, Tora, it is a love story set in Pearl Harbor/Doolittle raid. Like all ""dramatizations"", there is poetic license to make the story more interesting. From a dramatic perspective it generates an emotional response. Is not that the purpose of art? The Last Supper by Da Vinci is not accurate to history, but it is not less art. Those who pick apart this story because of inaccuracies I am afraid are motivated by Michael Bay's politics. That is unfortunate.Remember, this was homage to the 60th Anniversary of Pearl Harbor and it was a tremendous effort and worth watching. To feel good about America and the spirit and dedication that made America great.BTW, to the reviewer that did not call the Doolittle raid a victory, needs to read the Two Ocean War by Samuel Eliot Morrison or ""Blue Skies and Blood"" by Edwin Hoyt or ""Incredible Victory"" by Walter Lord. The Doolittle raid made the victories at Coral Sea and Midway.What is ironic: Pearl Harbor was a sneak attack that was unprovoked and a catastrophe for the attacker in the end. About 4 months after this release America was again a victim of a sneak attack that killed about the same number of people as Pearl Harbor. A major difference with 9/11 is the 9/11 attack was televised real-time. The movie Pearl Harbor shows the emasculation that has taken place to the United States. Had Pearl Harbor been filmed real time, the Japanese race would be extinct today. The fact that Americans do not have the same resolve in 2001 is an interesting truth. Its rightness or wrongness will be judged in 2061 when they do movie about the WTC for its 60th anniversary of the attack.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Worse than you've heard - Shows a shameless lack of respect for war that borders on immoral,"Congress should pass a law prohibiting both Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer from making films - especially together.  With the likes of Armageddon and this film under their belts, who knows what horrors they plan to unleash upon us next?Pearl Harbor is the worse kind of insult to both good taste and intelligence.  The characters are 100% lifeless, and they speak mostly in the language of catch-phrases (""Not anxious to die, sir.  Just anxious to matter."") and middle school love letters (""You're so beautiful it hurts.""). As if to compensate, Hans Zimmer provides an oppressive score to tell the audience exactly what to feel at any given moment.  If the music actually spoke, it would say things like ""Now is the time to feel patriotic!"" and ""Why aren't you crying?  Can't you tell something sad just happened?""  Add to this visuals that, while impressive, are nothing out of the ordinary, and you're left with a movie with a plastic atmosphere.In of itself, this is all bad enough, but Pearl Harbor gets even worse.  In strictest terms, it is a war movie - but only because it takes place during a war.  The first half of the film is nothing more than bad romantic drama, and, once the raid on Pearl Harbor finally begins, the movie plays less like a period war piece than it does like a bad summer action film (which is precisely what it is).  Also, because the movie is rated PG-13, the violence is muted to the point of near-bloodlessness.  Now, in a true war classic such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, I can except such muted violence because it is indicative of the time in which it was made.  However, to minimize the violence to this kind of an extent in a modern film is unnecessary and therefore an insult to the memory of what truly happened, but Bay and Bruckheimer aren't interested in honoring the memory of those who died.  They are interested in making money, and so we get a movie custom-made to be The Biggest Movie of the Summer by playing on the United States' collective patriotic consciousness.  Hmmm, makes me wonder how well this will play in other countries.Of course, with all that's already wrong with Pearl Harbor, one cannot expect Bay and Bruckheimer to pay much attention to such small details as historical accuracy and setting.  According to Bay and Bruckheimer, Hawaii was, in 1941, a state occupied almost entirely by white people and Cuba Gooding, Jr.  And speaking of Cuba Gooding, Jr., while he plays a real historical figure, he is onscreen for a mere six or seven minutes and seems to be in the film only so that Disney can advertise his presence in its commercials.  Gooding, therefore, portrays not a character but a marketing tool - the final insult in a movie already overflowing with them. 1/10",1.0,Anonymous,History
Plodding film with impressive Pearl Harbor destruction segment,"This film is worth seeing only for the forty minutes when Pearl Harbor is being bombed. It would have been a disaster without those impressive CGI-enhanced scenes of destruction. The rest of the film is a plodding love triangle with mediocre actors and a script that's packed with clichés. Jon Voight plays a scarcely believable President Roosevelt. The film is useless as a history lesson beyond the most rudimentary details. For a reasonably accurate and engrossing look at Pearl Harbor, 'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is your best bet.

In Love and War???,"I had been waiting eagerly to see this movie and I went to see it on the second day it opened.

The romance is too unreal. Even ""Titanic"" is much better than this one! And I didn't think ""Titanic"" is good...It's a pity that Michael Bay as the director failed to deliver a movie that was supposed to be better than his previous work, ""Armageddon"". He doesn't know how to separate love and war, so that the scenes become plain and bland.Bringing back Ben Affleck doesn't help much. And I guess he brought Kate Beckinsale in just because she looks like Liv Tyler in a glance. Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s character is totally out of place. The only one who does a decent job here is Josh Hartnett. In fact, it would be much better to cast him as the main character.I hope Michael Bay can learn from this big budget flop and direct better movies in the future.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Don't be so hard on the poor film,"Now, this movie had high and low qualities. I'll start with the good. It was a beautiful film visually. The cinematography is astounding. Every shot is pleasing to the eye and uses advanced conventions of photography. The special effects are the next thing down the line. It contained some of the best digital editing I have ever seen. If you rent the DVD of this movie and watch the ""making of"" section, you'll see what I mean. The acting was decent too. Now, the problems of the movie are that the script and plot suck. If they had completely left out the love triangle it would have worked well. They could have even kept the love story in, but not the triangle. It contrasted the point of the film. No one wants to see war and the jealousy of love in the same movie, well, unless you're married and she wants to see a love story and he wants to see some blood. Although, people are too hard on this movie. They either absolutely hate it, or think it's all right. Now, the love triangle was extraneous, but the movie still had many strong points. I suggest everyone sees this movie and keep in mind that it does have some amazing visual effects. See it as objective as possible and you might just appreciate some of it.",7.0,Anonymous,History

Extraordinary Masterpiece,"Pearl Harbor is a wonderful masterpiece in the art of movie making. This movie truly touched my heart and is the best movie so far sinceTitanic(1997). This movie has you on the verge of tears almost throughout the entire length of the film. They did a wonderful job of recreating the atmosphere of Pearl Harbor back in 1941. The quick romances that actually occurred between the men and the nurses in 1941 was beautifully portrayed. This was an actual factor in the tragedy of Pearl Harbor as many lives were lost and loved ones never to be found again. The movie was very accurate especially in the scene where a cook, Petty Officer Dorie Miller (Cuba Gooding Jr.) got on the guns to fight back at the Japanese Zeros. In history the real Dorie Miller did just that and was awarded the Silver Star. The characters in this movie recreate the sense of bravery and sacrifice that men and women actually portrayed during and after the attack on Pearl Harbor. On December 7, 1941 such bravery and sacrifice was indeed displayed and that is good to see in this movie. This is definitely a must see.

The performances are not bad, but not great either.If you want to see the story of 7th December, 1941, watch Tora! Tora!

Then the main character played by Ben Affleck, who is a pilot, volunteers to fight in Britain for the RAF.....he is shot down and presumed dead.

"Sappy, yes, but worth a look.","For those of you scared of PEARL HARBOR because of the possible TITANIC and ARMAGEDDON syndrome - well, you have every right to be.The CGI effects in the movie are stunning and the Japanese are portrayed pretty fairly as a country that felt like they had no choice.For the most part, it does no harm to watch the movie.  Seeing Ben Affleck in another movie like this, rehashing the same character from Armageddon, gets a bit tedious.  Josh Harnett, as Affleck's bosom buddy, brings no real presence to the screen but dead pans his role well as a contrast.  Kate Beckinsale, however, as the love interest, presents a relatively interesting character but has most of her screen time during the full half of the movie that is a tedious bore.The real star of the movie is the FX and the flying/dog fight/bombing scenes.  I do not usually like straight up action in a movie that claims to be more, but that is the best quality of this film and saves if from a 2 or 3 rating to that of a 5 or so.If you have three hours to spare (I suggest renting the DVD Widescreen), then it will not hurt to sit down and take a look at this movie.  The first 90 minutes will frustrate and bore you, but the last half is at least worth watching.If you find yourself yearning for a long war movie that is time well spent, I would suggest DAS BOOT or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.**This movie is reviewed as a film and NOT as to the importance of the events portrayed.6/10 - Watchable",6.0,Anonymous,History

Fairly well done,"When PH came out, I thought I read somewhere about the differences between it and ""Tora! Tora! Tora!"" Funny, but the stories mesh fairly well. Both include the African-American cook who heroically climbs into an anti-aircraft gun to defend his shipmates (in PH he's a central character; in TTT he's just a few seconds of film). Both focus on the bomb that sank the Arizona. Both focus on what the U.S. might have known in advance of the attack.TTT has a more documentary feel, and as such, its information seems more reliable. PH has much greater visuals.And PH tries to graft a love story onto history. I thought James Cameron pulled it off well in Titanic. Here, the love story seems out of place. In Titanic, the DeCaprio-Winslet tryst was functional to the plot -- it led the viewer to all parts of the mighty ship. The PH love triangle does little more than add a little spice to what would otherwise be a heckuva film. Or maybe without the triangle, the movie becomes TTT.But what I think PH does better than TTT is in visualizing the heroism of the soldiers, sailors and nurses who were under attack. You can't walk away from Pearl Harbor without a deep, abiding respect for the men and women of World War II.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Historical mess,"Horrible film that has so many faults, it just isn't worth my time to list them all. By all means read the other reviews, as they give a good account of them. The Battle of Britain scenes had me shouting at the screen. Even if you put aside it is the wrong year! It was an insult, not least of all to the American volunteers who did serve in the war with Britain and were NOT part of the US military who at that point, did not consider Germany an enemy.Why an event so significant as Pearl Harbour, wanted or needed the implausible and repeatedly inaccurate story line is beyond me. It was and is an important story to tell - the right way. Combine a script that would make a high school history teacher cringe, with an implausible love story and some of the worst acting I have seen in a while and you have a recipe for a movie that should never have made it to the screen.Watch the twenty minutes of the actual raid.

The directing of the film was excellent. Ben Affleck did a wonderful job in his role. Michael Bay also did a wonderful job.Almost everything was great. The only bad thing in the movie was that the Love Story was a bit too dragged. The first half of the film was basically about the love story. But the 60 minute bombing scene that came after that covered that small negative up.Most of the story was based on a true events that occurred during the war. This film is wonderful.

I was dragged to see (during it's actual run time in the theaters) it by a naive girl. Being a history buff, who has studied the war in great detail (including the attack on Perl Harbor, and the Doolittle raid on Japan), I sat through the entire film with either the look of in-credulousness on my face, or in a fit of laughter (which would have appeared to be inappropriate for any other film dealing with these subjects. Having been born on Long Island, and visited the Mitchell Field area many times (just south of Roosevelt Field where Lindberg took off from) I began my laughing fits at the site of California hills and a modern garbage incinerator in the opening moments of the movie. The fits continued right through to the end of the film, where the 'fighter jocks' suddenly were able to fly B25's off of carrier decks, and had somehow gotten Browning machine guns installed in the nose (which wasn't implemented for another 2 years) and flew the planes like strafing fighters...

"Superb action scenes, too much focus on love story","Well, I was among the lucky ones who were able to see this 3-hour long epic before it hit movie theaters all around the world. I expected great action scenes and high-level acting from Ben Affleck and all the others. And this was what I got, only with slightly too much romance... I have to tell you folks that every dime spent on blowing up carriers and fighter planes was worth it. Finally a movie where flames are not computer generated! Watching the Zeros fly in low towards Pearl Harbor gives you goosebumps. Your flesh is crawling with excitement whenever an action scene is on. IT IS JUST IMPOSSIBLE TO MAKE IT MORE PERFECT. BRAVO MR. BAY!!! One ""flaw"" of the movie, though is its length. So, my fellow action-fans, do not expect 3 hours of full-throttle machine-gunning and stunning explosions. The romance part is stripping this experience from you quite often. But it's not a big deal and the ""corniness factor"" is as low as possible. Josh Hartnett first proved his talent for me in The Faculty. This work of his, however, shows way beyond that performance. He's now in one league with Ben Affleck and Matt Damon... John Voight as the president of the United States was also a remarkable choice, and so was Tom Sizemore and Alec Baldwin in the supporting roles. Cuba Gooding, Jr. had only a minor part to play, but did it with strikingly convincing power. As usual... All in all, a magnificent movie was put together for us by Michael Bay, with outstanding performances and breath-taking, highly realistic action scenes. The romance part could have been cut a little shorter, but it is just an uplifting feeling to watch these guys play...",,Anonymous,History
Worst movie ever? Its a close call,"Sitting through 2 and 1/2 hours of bad acting and paper thin storylines was almost worth it for the chance to watch crap blow up for a half hour. Than I realized it wasnt. I guess it was just the excitment of not having to watch Josh Hartnett mug and mumble through his scenes or watch Ben Afflek try desperatley to convince the camera that he's actually not Ben Afflek.Days of our Lives has nothing on Pearl Harbor! Its got the thinnest story, the most handsome fella's, the prettiest gal's and the least amount of talent you'll see anywhere. Theres not much to say about the script, mainly because theres not much of one to comment on. Its over dramatic, predictable and pointless. It couldve been written around any event in time but in order to draw some emotion from the crowd they opted to backdrop the bombing of Pearl Harbor behind this high octane emotional rollercoaster love triangle. Instead of making the audience feel what it was like to live through that time, Pearl Harbor actually has little to do with Pearl Harbor. Obviously they just wanted to blow millions of dollars for a special effects rendition of the infamous bombing, and wrote a quickie script around it.Now the acting. Even though it seems to defy the laws of the universe, they actually found an actor with less talent than Ben Affleck. Josh Hartnet. For a while I wondered why they didnt subtitle his lines. I found out later its because hes actually speaking English. Most of my time was spent trying to interperet his squints and facial scrunches. Ben Affleck as usual plays Ben Afflek playing Ben Afflek playing some good looking guy doing some stuff. at least this is how I imagine him aproaching each roleconsidering every line he's ever uttered is completley devoid of any emotion or thought what so ever. For example; in Boiler Room, his line was ""Im a millionaire, it sounds wierd to say it, but im a F*ing millionaire"" Even though Ben Afflek is in real life a millionaire, he still delivers the line with no emotional involment. The rest of the cast which consists af many Hollywood A-list cameos arent there for you to enjoy. There only purpose is to bring the attention back to Ben and Josh after a brief history lesson.Any highschool student couldve recounted the events of Pearl Harbor more acuratley than Joel Shumaker and his money hungry cronnies. And by the way, what kids play baseball games at 7:00am on Sunday morning? I guess Im old-fashioned, but you can give me my history straight.

Better than I expected,"I put off seeing this movie because our actions towards Japan and Japanese-Americans were some of our lowest moments in history. Fortunately, this movie decided not to come anywhere near those events.This movie had to be made, just like Titanic had to be made.  And just like Titanic, the Hollywood producers wouldn't have allowed them to be made due to their insane budgets unless the movie appealed to a large audience, and the best way to do that is to include a love story.Yes, the love stories were rushed and perhaps unnecessary, but that doesn't destroy the movie.  I was surprised because I was on the brink of crying a few times.The action sequences were the best.  This was a very toned down Michael Bay movie, if you can believe that, because although there were a lot of effects, they didn't seem so unrealistic or overdone.  It was just right.I believe this may be the best war movie I've ever seen because it captured the emotions of the event so well, sort of the way Titanic captured the emotions, but not nearly as good...although perhaps better than the other war movies I've seen, and I've seen them all.  It just killed me to see those Japanese planes keep bombing and bombing Pearl Harbor, and the U.S. military not being able to do anything about it.  I kept wishing for the attacks to stop.The one thing I wished they did a better job of was showing us more of who these Japanese pilots were.  I give this film a 10 because I went in expecting a 5 and was simply blown away (excuse the pun).  I think if Michael Bay keeps the effects toned down, do some lower budget films, and keep the camera a little more steady, people may start to take him more seriously and maybe appreciate the talent he has.",10.0,Anonymous,History

What puzzles me is that the makers of P. H. failed despite that they could have done so much better by simply allowing inspiration from movies like ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"".

Pearl Harbor is a great film.  It mixes sweeping romance with the tragedies of war.  All war films should aspire to this level.,"Pearl Harbor is the best film I have ever seen.  Michael Bay's direction is flawless, an almost guaranteed Best Director at the Academy Awards.  Hans Zimmer's music scores are so beautiful and sad, making the battle scenes more intense, and the mournful scenes, sadder.  Randall Wallace has written a screenplay better that his 1995 effort, BRAVEHEART. I've seen this film 8 times at the cinema so far, and it still makes me angry when people flat out say - 'it was crap'.  No one in their right mind could say this movie sucked.  Not liking a movie because of its running time really isn't a very valid reason.  A longer movie means it can fit more in it. I would say that Pearl Harbor is a combination between ARMAGEDDON and TITANIC.  This film is so watchable and entertaining, the love story really couldn't have been much better.  It was the most entertaining way to start the first 80 mintutes of the film. Ben Affleck has outdone himself, giving an even better and more mature performance as Rafe McCawley. Josh Hartnett is going to be such a huge star after this film, as well as Kate Beckinsale.  She put in a flawless performance.  How beautiful is she?

"If the Doolittle Raid, why not Hiroshima?","(This contains no spoilers about the love story. I'm assuming, though, that most viewers know some of the historical events).Mixed feelings about this movie.  A terrible and memorable time in US history.  Terrific special effects, beautiful photography, gripping and hair-raising attack and piloting scenes.  Could have been much tauter and more cerebral, had the film not bloated itself on the love story in its attempts to combine The Titanic with Saving Private Ryan.  The graft diminished it.  It didn't have the cleverness of Titanic, and Saving Private Ryan is a far better film; for one thing, it did not condescend to the audience by trying to sanitize the violence and grisly mayhem that is war--as Pearl Harbor does.  Compare the harrowing opening forty minutes of SPR to the forty minutes of PH's attack scene.  Impressive explosions, people scrambling around on sinking ships, just like the Titanic; but few if any severed hands, no faces blown open.  No blood in the water even.  That's because SPR's main point is that war sucks, and PH's main point, God bless it, is that America emerged victorious.  One of the best lines in PH is the one given to Yamamoto: ""A brilliant commander would have tried not to go to war in the first place.""  Straight out of Sun Tzu.The movie was too long.  You've got the two best friends, you've got love story, you've got the Japanese strategies, you've got the love story, you've got the tension in Washington, you've got the love story, you've got the attack, you've got the love story, and then you get the Doolittle Raid and the love story... if you've come this far why not make some reference, SOME reference, God help us, to how America ended the war with the Japanese?  But that wasn't heroic.  And I guess it wasn't Pearl Harbor, either.

What really galls about this turkey is its offensiveness: surely none of the poor souls who perished at Pearl Harbor behaved as stupidly as portrayed here!One scene sums up Jerry Bruckheimer, Randall Wallace, and Michael Bay's attitude in making this film. While military personnel and civilians are bombed and blasted, raked with gunfire, drowned and crushed in a sickeningly titillating way (whoever described this as war as pornography was spot on!), the filmmakers are more concerned with the plight of a small dog whose owner has just been shot. When the pooch is rescued, the obvious intent was for a heartwarming moment; but this was the moment at which this trash went from being extraordinarily dumb to being extraordinarily infuriating. Thousands of people dying, but we are expected to relate to a bloody dog!!!Who are these people? I agree that there is a place for mindless action movies and a comic book approach to violence. But when you impose such an approach on what should have been a human (not to mention, humane) drama, evoking the terror of war and remembering, respectfully, the memory of those who sacrificed everything in one of the great turning points of 20th century history, I'm afraid that you have lost the plot in a big, big way.The shame of it is that, given the budget and the resources at their disposal, Bruckheimer and co have missed a golden opportunity to present a really memorable, classic, and respectful motion picture.

Great improvement over Gone in 60 sec.,"Micheal Bay has suceeded again with his latest block buster, Pearl Harbor. That's right, the team that brought us Armageddon and The Rock has now brought us a new classic. As we all know unless you fell asleep during history class, Pearl Harbor is about the Japanese sneak attack that lead America to WW2. Micheal Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer have captured these events perfectly in this film. Not only do they make it historically accurate, but also portray the actual historical characters such as Gen. Yamamoto, FDR and James Doolittle and captures them as they really were. Not only was the actual bombing scene beautifully shot but also the Japanese planning the attack was also great. I know it's not as well done as Saving Private Ryan and cannot even compare to that, but it captures the attack as it truly happened: Unprovoked and completely without any warning whatsoever. I know that many critics have shot this movie down by saying that it was over cliched and over dramatized and in curtain parts of the movie they are right. However, those parts were few and far between. Also why should we listen to critics anyway? Their job is basically to be cynical about anything and insult people's work around every corner. Me personally, I don't base a movie on whether or not the critics liked it. I base it on my taste in movies and what normal everyday people say about it. Not on what some guy in a newspaper says.

"Excellent film, Excellent cast!","The film really was brilliant! 'Pearl Harbour' portrays the importance of romance in the 40s which helped people through the difficult war period. How everyone had a clear, very important role to play, not just the men, but the women too!  Kate Beckinsale was a great female lead, everything from the acting, to the 40s hairstyles, lipstick and nail polish.  The whole cast were excellent - very sexy men and their acting of course!  Ben Affleck was my favourite actor, I love most of his films and, he is gorgeous, but ... has a certain sexiness about him!!!  Faith Hill's 'There you'll be' really compliments the film and is a great track!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Great Film,"I think the film was great but the cast was even better.Ben Affleck, Kate Beckensale,Josh Hartnett,William Lee Scott,and Alec Baldwin. The movie(I think)gave me the motive to pay attention to the things people dont pay ANY attention to,like in school,I now Want to know all about the attack on Pearl Harbor.The movie May have been a little ""to"" long but I think the up-beat cast saved it.I myself am a fan of Kate Beckensale and William Lee Scott.So I think maybe that had something to do with me liking Alot!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Pearl Harbor Truly a lesson in hack filmmaking,"This is one of the worst films made in a long time, a true lesson in hack filmmaking. It's a  film that capitalizes on the realization that tugging at veteran's heartstrings and showing lots of young and perfect looking men and women will produce a blockbuster- but this movie is a hit only in money made, because it is a joke. The characters are so un-likeable that one can't help but cheer for Japan, and only wish they had finished the job to wipe out these useless and dullish characters. The direction is slow and dull, and even the action scene of the attack comes off as over-baked and tiresome. The sweeping musical score, which is indistingushable from a hundred other action/war flicks of recent times, only is there to try and make the viewer ""feel"" drama. Pearl Harbor fails on all accounts to an interesting film. Why not try a different approach? Why does perfect and hunky Ben Affleck have to be in love with a woman, why not make him a gay man? How about make Cuba Gooding Jr. into something other than his Jerry McGuire-sidekick role? Can Josh Hartness try to act and stop relying on his looks?Avoid if you can.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Simply the most moving film experience in memory,"I guess that's a pretty bold statement, but ""Pearl Harbor"" took me out of my seat and into the film--into the characters and situations--in a way that I've never felt before. And I've loved movies since before I can remember! I saw, back when ""Titanic"" or ""Braveheart"" came out, the reaction people had to them, and now, I've found my ""Titanic."" I know why they saw ""Braveheart"" a half dozen times. Watching Michael Bay's film, I was reduced to a child, bright-eyed and completely believing, and also forced to recognize my adulthood in the knowledge that people like my grandfather made great sacrifices in the second World War that I will never understand or appreciate. And I got to, for a short period of time, be someone I never was, who fought not just for his country, but for the love of an elegant, beautiful girl. I don't think I'll elaborate much more on any of this, as it could only cheapen the sentiment. I do suppose there will be many who didn't like the film, and mock those that did (there always are), and some of their complaints may even be valid, but there's no way anyone can tell me I didn't FEEL the joy, despair, love, and hope that I felt in that theater on May 25th, 2001.",,Anonymous,History
"Despite fallbacks, Pearl Harbor soars","Dramatic climaxes. Love triangle. BIG explosions. Despite many harsh reviews Pearl Harbor did not sink, as many would have liked to see it do. Yes, you will have to sit on your butt for three, long hours but it is worth the time. And must I remind everyone of how many times the majority of us sat through Titanic? Ignoring the clichés and striking similarities between the two movies 'Pearl' tops Titanic on all levels. Enough said. The love triangle becomes a little monotonous, although what was M. Bay drinking when he did the casting? The only reason Ben received the lead was because his name was Ben Affleck, his role/character dangerously like that of his in Armageddon. No stunning performance there. And who decided to use Kate B. as the heroine of the movie? As the story progresses you wonder why these two men are fighting over her in the first place and by the end of the movie end up hating her and her character. Josh Hartnett, who by next year, should be up for at least one Oscar nod, captures the ONLY intelligently good role in the movie. The boy is seeping with talent that Hollywood is now, disappointingly, only discovering. Finally, there's that BIG 40 minute explosion scene, which I must admit wasn't too bad, although realistically, would never have looked like that. Despite some fallbacks, you'll get your money's worth. Some action, some romance, and, yeah, OK a numb butt. Ignore the critics- Pearl Harbor soars.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Awesome movie that shows the raw brutality of Pearl Harbor attack,"If you think that this movie casts an ugly light on the Japanese, you obviously do not know your history. What happened at Pearl Harbor is well documented, and it would behoove you to read it before stating ignorant half truths and showing the entire world what a buffoon you are. If you hate the movie fine, but don't hate it for it's portrayal of the Japanese or anyone else. Let bygones be bygones, but the Japanese invasion on Pearl Harbor was just what the movie portrayed: an unprovoked attack that left thousands of Americans dead. After the attack came the Doolittle raid, yes, but more importantly, a very long and grueling war on all fronts. If you must protest the American response, protest the bomb...oops too late. In retaliation for the most ignorant and thoughtless attack on American soil, the US destroyed an entire city in a matter of seconds. I'm not going to say that the US did right by dropping the A bombs on Japan, but I will not watch someone spout their mouths saying that the Japanese did not commit such an atrocity as was shown in the movie. The attack was real, the pain and death was real. Sometime take a flight to Honolulu and pay a visit to the Arizona memorial. Yell through the water to the bones of those still trapped inside that they only died because they were in the USNavy during a war, and that the Japanese did not attack them and kill them in cold blood. Again, learn some history before spouting that garbage, please.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Shameful Crap,"Let me explain what I mean when I say that this movie is shameful crap.First, the crap part. It's pretty obvious in watching this that the screenplay is junk the director doesn't know how to direct actors at all, and as a result the acting is terrible too. It brings new meaning to the word ""trite."" There are a few scenes that look good on the screen, such as the part with the Japanese planes flying over the kids playing baseball and the like. Never mind that there probably weren't many kids playing baseball first thing in the morning on Sunday, but whatever, the image was at least striking. I'll give it that. It can't really make up for the junky love story, however.Now, why I use the word shameful. This isn't some fictional event, it was an actual event in relatively recent history (in the grand scheme of things) in which quite a few people actually died. Not only that, but it started in motion a chain of events that was very serious, resulted in a tremendous amount of sacrifice, and should be treated with at least some respect. It deserves better than a crap-o treatment by Michael Bay, the king of schlocky movies.I'm hoping that in a few years people will forget that this thing was even created.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Rewatching this doesn't make it better,"I'm a big historical drama guy, so I was of course excited to see Michael Bay's take on Pearl Harbor. Disappointment is putting it mildly. The first qualm with the movie is that it's not accurate. It doesn't even seem Michael Bay cared to learn about Pearl Harbor. He just wanted suspense and big explosions.The second problem is that the story is shallow. Throwing in a triangle romance into one of the most consequential events in American history is bound to fall flat, and it does. You may like the romance, I just never cared, and thought it was just something Michael Bay threw in there to satisfy those that were dragged to the theater against their will.The eventual attack scene on Pearl Harbor is Michael Bay's bread and butter and it didn't disappoint, but it wasn't good enough to make up for the rest of this lackluster production.",5.0,Anonymous,History

But for those who love to go and allow there brain to tune into something else for 3 hours then this is absolutely brilliant.I didn't feel like i was sitting there for 3 hours, probably because it was almost like watching two films.  One of war and one of love.  The love story was, yes, a bit iffy.  But not unenjoyable.  I laughed more times than I can count through some of the scenes.And the historical war scenes?

No words can describe this catastrophe.,"Michael Bay will most likely never win an Oscar for his movie-making career, which consists of awesome films like ""THE ROCK,"" BAD BOYS I & II, TransFormers and THE ISLAND and, as a executive producer, helped finance the ""too-awful-for-words""TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and THE HITCHER remakes. He's known for hating the critics, getting praise from Steven Spielberg himself and making ""popcorn"" movies.To explain the trend, he merely did ""Okay"" with Armageddon and then went downhill on this dumb excuse to sit through THREE HOURS OF FILM!!!! 3 hours!!! That's just enough to make everyone walk out of the theater unless it's an entertaining movie that can only tell that much in that time period.Bay has enlisted the help of Bruckheimer, who also is good at creating too many unnecessary sequels like BEVERLY HILLS COP II and PotC: At World's End, and BRAVEHEART screenwriter Randall Wallace to give us this mess of a film. I don''t even recommend it for the actual attack scene because it's so fake-looking with all the cheap computer graphics. I can't even get into the experience because I don't ever feel like the characters are in danger nor do I care if they die or live.This movie should be deleted from Bay's record of films( some of you would even suggest he not make movies anymore) and Bruckheimer should retire from this career.

"Disney's PC WHITEWASH of HISTORY, and Schmaltzy Romance","""Pearl Harbor"", the biggest, most expensive, most hyped, and most anticipated, of all the Summer season's films, has finally arrived. Like a bomb flung from a Japanese warplane it has crashed into theaters with a resounding noise. Yes, for what this film could have been it is, in fact, a Big Bomb; for what it is, overall, it can be considered a mediocre let down.The film has a running time of just over three hours, half of which is devoted to a schmaltzy love story with plot turns so predictable they were hackneyed generations ago. That includes the ""lost lover back from the dead"" routine, which was old even when it was done well, as in the classic ""Waterloo Bridge"" from 1941. We also received a noxious dose of an equally labored love triangle involving two lifetime friends. Beyond that, we get History so white-washed it would appear that the United States was to blame for World War Two.Some Disney apologists have claimed that there had to be a story wrapped around the history, ""or else we'd be left with just a documentary"". Not so. Out on DVD is 1970's excellent ""Tora, Tora, Tora"", a Japanese-American production on the attack, and it was factual and compelling without the need for a none too convincing romance. For those who do want romance, done well in the context of the attack and America's entrance into World War Two, I suggest they rent ""From Here to Eternity"" from 1954.Disney is telling us the actual attack sequence on the U.S.  Naval base at Pearl Harbor lasted over 40 minutes in this movie. By my watch it was 30, tops, only about half of which involved attacks on American warships. The rest was much less spectacular aerial heroics by the two heroes.Be it noted that in 1970, ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" did not have the benefit of digital special effects. In 2001, ""Pearl Harbor"" does - and they are absolutely spectacular and alone make the movie worth seeing, and eventually getting on DVD to be able to savor each frame of the attack. There are many poignant moments during the battle sequences, and the realism and verisimilitude is remarkable - except for the near total absence of blood and gore, an unacceptable compromise Disney made to get its PG-13 rating. ""Pearl Harbor"" bears no resemblance to the real horrors of the opening sequences of ""Saving Private Ryan"".Much has been made of liberal Disney, ever Politically Correct, white-washing History to not offend those in overseas markets - Japan and Germany. This absolutely true.We have here a timid, PC version of History so spineless, so gutless, so intellectually dishonest, one would think the United States was to blame for the war. The movie states that America cut off Japan's oil supply, thus all but forcing them into war, and into launching their infamous sneak attack on the U.S. Navy on December 7th, 1941. But at no time did ""Pearl Harbor"" ever mention why the U.S. cut off Japan's oil supply, which was due to years of Japanese aggression, war crimes, and atrocities in China, and an ever increasing Japanese totalitarian society dominated by militarists.To Disney, there was no need to ""offend"" the Japanese by mentioning their invasion of China, or the fact that Japan had allied itself, long before their sneak attack, as part of the despised Fascist Axis that included Hitler's Germany and Mussolini's Italy. No, not mentioned. Germany itself is barely referred to in a few brief grainy newsreels. If someone doesn't understand the reasons for World War Two - and which side represented Good and which Evil - they will not learn the answer from ""Pearl Harbor"".Historical events themselves are depicted in various ways ranging from complete distortion, to convenient omission, to fabrication, to absolute accuracy. Some of the more irritating examples follow.Jon Voight, doing a not very convincing interpretation of President Roosevelt, supposedly stood up on his own at a staff meeting to dramatize the need to strike back at Japan. Not so.Our two heroes, fighter pilots, after shooting down a host of Japanese planes at Pearl, are recruited into becoming B-25 bomber pilots for Col. Jimmy Doolittle's subsequent raid on Japan. This never would have happened; fighter pilots stayed fighter pilots. Doolittle, played by a self-satisfied and tough-talking Alec Baldwin, bore no similarity to the real Doolittle. His B-25's did not fly in formation when bombing Tokyo either. Although one of his planes was named ""The Ruptured Duck"" - accurate and a tribute to the great war film ""Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo"", which should be rented and seen by all.The film made various historical alterations such as eliminating from Roosevelt's classic Declaration of War speech before Congress his last emphatic words after resolving to achieve the final victory: ""So help us God"". Perhaps God is not PC.The absence of the U.S. aircraft carriers during the bombing - so fortuitous for America's fortunes - was not referred to.Despite growing evidence that Roosevelt knew beforehand about the coming Japanese attack and wanted it as the only way to get America into the war against Hitler, the film ignores that issue totally and presents FDR as surprised by it.American Admiral Kimmell, commanding at Pearl, was somewhat overly scapegoated in 1941 for the disaster; here, he is shown much too favorably and as a victim of Naval leaders too obtuse to perceive the coming Japanese sneak attack, which is itself a specious over-simplification.The attack began with Japanese midget submarines infiltrating the harbor and being engaged by a U.S. destroyer. Ignored in the film.Doolittle's raid on Japan, and other cities besides Tokyo, actually resulted not in the Japanese moving back, as the end of movie narration claimed, but launching their biggest naval attack of the war. It, unfortunately for them, ended in defeat at the Battle of Midway, which was also not mentioned despite it being the true Turning Point of the war.Curiously, despite such historical issues distorted or dismissed, the movie was careful enough to show, accurately, details such as the famous flag of Admiral Togo, who defeated the Russians in 1904, flying over the Japanese flagship carrier, the Akagi.The performances of the three stars were adequate in the face of the banal dialogue they were forced to say. Ben Affleck and John Hartnett as the friends, and rivals over the same girl, did as well as could be expected. The glamorous nurse of their interests was played by Kate Beckinsale, looking lovely despite too much makeup even for 1941 - and apparently fighting anorexia during the filming.Big stars Cuba Gooding Jr, and Ted Sizemore, also appear and do well, despite roles that are little more than cameos. Gooding, playing the hero navy steward, and first black man to receive the Navy Cross, made us wish we could have seen a little more of his life in a segregated Navy, and a little less of the romance, although another film just dealt with that topic. Dan Aykroyd as a fictionalized Navy cryptographer, and Mako as Admiral Yamamoto, do little more than look ever more serious and dour scene to scene.Director Michael Bay and producer Jerry Bruckheimer have done what they usually do with films - great action hanging together on a threadbare plot. For $140 million it is amazing they couldn't have found a better script. If they simply remade ""Tora, Tora, Tora"" word for word but with the new special effects it would have been better.So we have a banal romance mixed together with white-washed Politically Correct History, but enough actual history and fabulous digital battle scenes to make ""Pearl Harbor"" worth seeing. Although be warned: you will squirm for the first ninety minutes before the attack starts.",1.0,Anonymous,History

The British air squadron commander is so impressed with Affleck's character and delivers one of the cheesiest and stupidest line in movie history: ""God save the German Army if there are more like you where you came from"", or something like that. People,stop wandering why people generally and Americans in particular are so ignorant about the world, history or whatever if they are given such artistic examples. It is not the lack of realism that I mind so much (afterall it is a movie) it is the pretense of realism that it is annoying. Too bad about the actors.

YUK...ANOTHER OVERHYPED HOLLYWOOD FLIK.,"YUK!!! This movie sucks!  I can add it to my Hollywood over-hyped suck list along with ""Independence Day"" and ""Blair Witch Project.""  This movie bombed even without a Japanese zero in the sky.  The movie is way over-hyped and bogus.  It consists of a fictitious love story, which just happens to take place during a real historical event (Pearl Harbor).  When I saw ""Saving Private Ryan,"" the age of the people in the theater ranged from teenagers up to senior citizens.  Some of the senior citizens were WW2 veterans, and proudly wearing their VFW hats.  However, the age of the people in the theater for ""Pearl Harbor"" was more the teenage to college age crowd. Most of the young ladies in the theater only wanted to see the movie because of prince Ben (VOTE  GOREOOPS, I FORGOT TO VOTE MYSELF) Afflect, and didn't really seem to care about the actual historical event.   Has-been Alec (I'M LEAVING FOR CANADA.NOT..LEAVING FOR CANADA.NOT) Baldwin was another winner in this over-hyped flick.  Of course, Tom Hanks (a real actor) has raised public awareness and $ for WW2 veterans as a result of his film. However, Alec Baldwin is still unpacking, and Ben Afflect is sitting in the drunk tank.  If you want historical knowledge of the real attack on Pearl Harbor, then read a history book or watch the 1970 film ""Tora..Tora..Tora.""

Problem was not at the points or for the reasons intended by the filmmakers.First of all, if you're going to make a film about a major historical event, do some basic research. There so many ways this story could be well told while sticking to the basic facts, there's no need to insult your audience's intelligence with garbage. There are so many things wrong other reviewers have already documented that I won't bother going over them again here.If you're going to try to introduce a romantic sub plot (which this doesn't need), write a decent story/dialogue or don't bother, particularly if you're incapable of directing these kinds of scenes.Pearl Harbour was a pivotal event in world history, why not examine that aspect rather than following it up with a fictitious exercise in flag waving.

Michael Bay should not have directed this.,"Let me begin my comments on Pearl Harbor by saying this could have been a good movie if it weren't for Michael Bay. Now I have nothing against Michael Bay. I believe he is capable of directing fun, excitingly big stupid movies. But should a film detailing an infamous attack where thousands of Americans be big and stupid. No. Bay is just not the type of director that should be directing an epic picture of this scale. In my opinion Pearl Harbor could have been much more. There are scenes here that in a better directors hands could have been staged differently and perhaps more succesfully. A better director might have eliminated the cliche riddled plot, and axed the mundane storyline. He might have hired better actors or at least helped the ones he had into crafting a skilled performance. As I see it a movie detailing the attack on Pearl Harbor all the way up to the famous raid by General James Dolittle would be a very interesting movie indeed. But the problem lies with Bay and him alone. Its the way he directs. Scenes are too short that should be long. There isn't enough time to flesh out characters that are interesting, and with the fact that the three you have are about as interesting as a fly on a windowsill, thats a bad thing. Even the Japanese should be more insulted by this tripe since they are shown to be bloodthirsty war mongers who only wish to attack America so they can continue raiding China unabated. The only interesting character I found in the movie was a dog aboard one of the destroyers. This movie feels more like a three hour music video instead of an epic the size of The Longest Day, or The Godfather. If you should even be interested in the least of seeing this, be smart and do like I did; rent the DVD. That way you can at least skip to the battle scene (the only thing Bay seems able to do right) The only qualm I had with this is one bad special effects shot that shows planes that look the size of model air planes zooming by the sinking ships, and the fact that the overall feel of the scene made it feel like Independence Day, which dosen't really show any respect for an event of this magnitude.",,Anonymous,History

Hollywood trash,If I could rate this movie a 0 I would have. To this day i'm not sure why anyone put director Michael Bay in charge of such an important subject as Pearl Harbor. The director couldn't make up its mind whether it wanted to be a mainstream Hollywood romance film or a movie based on REAL historical events that happened and shaped a generation. Pearl Harbor is a muddled nonsensical monumental waste of money by a studio hack. The real events at pearl harbor only receive a big budget Hollywood CGI nod with the attention purely focused on the big name movie stars galvinating across the screen. Replace the planes with horses and the leading actress with a damsel in distress and you could have sworn the dialogue was lifted from a 1950's TV western. This is the worst homage to WW2 veterans that Hollywood could give them.,1.0,Anonymous,History
A Great View of WW2!,"I don't understand why so many people hate this movie. This is a very good movie. My only negative opinion here is that there is too much romance. But, there is plenty of action and drama to keep me entertained. I read some commentaries by Bay and Affleck about the criticism. They say that's what life was back then and my grandparents agreed. Haters really need to keep their mouths shut if they never lived in the 40's.This movie is about the attacks on Pearl Harbor which made the U.S enter the war. The story is told between two friends who witnessed everything in Hawaii.The acting is wonderful. The cast is an all-star cast. This is definitely Ben Affleck's best movie.Pearl Harbor is an emotional, tear-jerking movie. Hans Zimmer's score is good at helping that. There are many memorable quotes that will stick around forever. All in all, I loved this film. I rate this film 9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood at it's worst..,"Before I watched this title, I already knew that it had been nominated, and narrowly lost to seven Razzies, and I felt slightly sorry for that fact, as I knew the money, time and energy that went into making it.However, that was BEFORE I watched it. Post- Pearl Harbour, I'm shocked and mildly appalled that this dismal movie didn't win all of them. I have never sat through a film whereby ten minutes in, I was praying for the end. The only reason I didn't turn it off was the naive hope that it would pick up. It didn't.The story is an American love triangle that gets interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour in 1942, no I'm not going into more detail than that, as I purely cannot be bothered to waste my time on it. The worst and most sickening part of the movie for me, as an English girl, is the amount of victimisation that the Americans place upon themselves during this, and the blatant racism to the Japanese attack, weeping at how cruel, and how defenceless a military base was. I'm sorry Micheal Bay and crew, have you never heard of Hiroshima or Nagasaki?The movie makes me almost feel physically sick at the amount of Hollywood that is just sprayed all over every frame, to the drippy acting and stupid love triangle, to the monologue at the end about how amazing America is, to the over the top and costly special effects. By all means, add the CG, after all, it would be hard to conceive the film without them, but at least support it with some form of storyline.The only comfort for me is the knowledge that at least it was recognised by Hollywood and critics alike, that this movie is awful. I have nothing against America or the movie making system, but there is a way to make a film, without patronising everyone non- American and giving it a decent storyline.Do what I didn't, and save yourself the near 3 hours of sitting through this rubbish, and put on something decent to the war genre.",2.0,Anonymous,History

The real history in this movie - is it so important?,"Many people say, it is fictitious, not real history, but who can make a film nowadays about the Second World War, which is exactly the same, how it was then. But the most important thing here is, that if you like to watch real history, watch reality shows and documentary films, but not an artistic movie. This story about three main (created) characters makes this film interesting. It's entertainment, which is based on history.

Plagiarized and Trite,"I admit I did not read every other member comment on this film. Nevertheless, I wanted to add my own and I hope I don't repeat what has already been said. After viewing this film on TV recently, I was left with the feeling that I had seen it all before.Now I finally realized I have seen it before: Take part of the plot from ""Suzy"" (1936)man, presumed dead, reappears to find his woman married to another (who is a fighter pilot, by the way); add the bombing of Pearl Harbor from ""From Here To Eternity"" (1953); and then add the Doolittle bombing of Tokyo from ""Thirty Seconds Over Toyko"" (1944). Put it all together to make another film, and pretend that it's an original story.OK, yes, some of it is historical, but I'm always amazed that filmmakers feel compelled to do again what has already been done, and then not do it very well, despite spending multi-millions of dollars.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Spectacularly brilliant!,"Pearl Harbor is one of the most spectacular movies I have ever seen.  It is simply brilliant!  And I can't believe the critics said it had a weak love story.  It was such a good, refreshing love story - entirely original with strongly developed characters!  In fact I was surprised at how well developed the characters were.  I thought that it would basically just be an action movie, but was I pleasantly surprised.  The movie totally gripped me emotionally AND visually.  It's simply out of this world.  It was funny, it was sad, it was exciting, it was tragic!  This movie has everything!  Pearl Harbor deeply moved me.  Ben Affleck was awesome, Kate was endearing, and Josh - well, what can we say about him?  He is simply stunning - WOW!  I really wish him well in his future - his future in a movie career looks really bright.  The attack scene was excellent.  I've never seen anything like it in any movie.

"An Excellent, Historically Important Movie.","I was a six year old boy when Pearl Harbor was attacked. The memories of that day,and the war years that followed, are indelibly implanted in mind and soul.The movie not only has caused me to relive those times but aroused my desire to educate younger generations who,thank God, did not have first hand experience.My wife and I have now seen the movie twice and will probably see again.This is first time have gone to see the same movie twice in one week since was a teenager.My passion for history was fulfilled by the accurate portrayal of the events leading up to the attack as well as being right on in every other important event throughout the movie. The love story has been criticized by many as ""hokey"". I thought it to be very real,moving, and so appropriate for the time,when there was such a sense of urgency with matters of love,and everything else.The story of Pearl Harbor and Americas entry into the war needs to be told in away so succeeding generations won't forget. Everyone in America,indeed throughout the world, has had their lives effected by the events of December 7th,1941.Hats off to the cast for a job well done.

Awful movie -- Rent Tora! Tora! Tora! instead,"This is another movie that I borrowed from the local library. I didn't want to be responsible for a single cent on the bottom line of this travesty.Unless you're a fan of cliché cinema, you can watch the first half of the film on 10x fast forward and not miss a thing. It's essentially the same as Titanic before the ship starts sinking.In theory, the climactic attack sequences should be the crowning glory of the movie. The movie has the benefit of 30 years improvement in special effects technology over 1970s Tora! Tora! Tora!. And yet, I didn't find it as impressive -- At least partially because the digital effects artists got too clever. What was seen in Tora! Tora! Tora! was restricted to what could actually be done with the real airplanes used to shoot the scenes, or in model work. Pearl Harbor doesn't operate under this restriction, and thus the attacking planes do all kinds of absurd things that would never have happened in reality -- I guess because it looked cool. As a result of this, what should be the dramatic highlight of the film ends up coming off like a cartoon, or a cheesy video game. The earlier film, while not having the benefit of recent CGI technology, at least attempts to reproduce the events as they actually happened.If you're looking for a brainless action movie with pretty-boy actors, this will do -- just skip over the first half. If you're interested in history, and want to know what really happened at Pearl Harbor (and equally importantly, why), watch Tora! Tora! Tora! instead.",1.0,Anonymous,History
For the ladies...,"So this movie may not be exactly historically accurate and perhaps it is a little long, but I loved it. If you're not one to care about accuracy this is a great story. The fight scenes are pretty spectacular (an earlier user comment said that it didn't give any ""honor"" to the Japanese fighters...But I beg to differ, I thought Bruckheimer and Bay did a good job of providing the Japanese with lots of honor), and the story line keeps you interested.

Terrible!,"This is the worst historical drama I have ever seen.  Actually there are very few historically accurate facts in the movie.  It's essentially a trifling love-triangle romance with some action sequences.  The Pearl Harbor attack is just a backdrop.  The direction is horrible, the writing is horrible, and the acting is horrible.  There are some interesting special effects, especially when the torpedo strikes USS Arizona, but who cares? With a title like ""Pearl Harbor"", I assumed this was supposed to be a picture about the horror and the heroes, about the event.  Instead, it was a sappy love story between three fictional characters.  If anything the special effects and melodrama just distracted the audience from the fact that real people actually died.

Skip the first 90 minutes!,"Well, I had the ""pleasure"" to watch this movie in cinema, so I have unfortunately paid for it. The first 90 minutes almost nothing happens. I felt like I was watching a low-budged TV production made for people over the age of 70. The Characters just talk, laugh, the sun shines and everything is fine. The only plot is a boring love story between the 2 pilots Rafe and Danny and the nurse Evelyn. After a while you just wait for the Japanese. So far so boring. Then the the attack begins. What now happens on the screen is what you expect of Michael Bay. In great action scenes the hole armada blows up. This is when I thought: ""Hey! That movie isn't as bad as you thought.""

Pearl Harbor - a must-see movie epic!,"As the music fades, and the screen blackens, one can hardly help but sigh. The movie was good; it was darn good.  Everything about it.  The acting, directing, music, and the incredible CG were wonderfully combined to form this summer's blockbuster Pearl Harbor.  Upon reading reviews of this newly released film, it is hard not to notice the terrible blasts it has been receiving from seemingly heartless movie critics and viewers.  They complain and complain about it, when they fail to see what it truly is: a tale of ""the end of innocence... and the dawn of America's greatest glory.""  What better way to show this, than with a love story, which is what Pearl Harbor is above all.  It is a love story involving three characters, and how the unthinkable at Pearl Harbor shaped their lives, as well as the lives of Americans.  Its purpose was not to perfectly document the events that occurred on that fateful day in December 1941, but rather to show in a way that only Hollywood can, the sights, feelings, and agony that there must have been on that day; and to show younger generations an era in which men and women were so willing to put their country above themselves.  Pearl Harbor successfully captures the brutality of war, and the courage of the men and women who fought it.  It is an epic tale of love and war, and a time when heroes would rise and fall; but America would prevail.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Visually impressive, but otherwise crap","The good points of Pearl Harbour are fairly easy to summarise: 1) Damned impressive-looking and -sounding show. 2) Great recreation of Pearl Harbour itself.However, the counter-arguments are a little more numerous. 1) The portrayal of the Japanese. They're cardboard cutout 'baddies'! I mean, we should be allowed to understand and empathise with the Japanese point of view (that America was heading slowly and inevitably for war under pressure from Western Europe, and that if they didn't strike first, America's Pacific Fleet would be a serious threat when the time came), but this was just pathetic.2) The portrayal of the whole of Western Europe. For 2 years worth of fighting, we get a few stereotypes thrown in and an odd look from Affleck. And the 'turning point of WW2'? A small bombing raid on Tokyo, included in the film only because the filmmakers thought audiences so shallow that they couldn't cope with a film that ended at its tragic climax, Pearl Harbour.3) The sickeningly predictable 'love story.' There wasn't anything in this that couldn't be seen coming several hours ago. The plane hits the sea - of course he's alive, it's only 30 minutes into the film! The two best friends go off to war - of course, one of them's going to die, so our hero can get back together with the stock love interest and live happily ever after. Yawn.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Well Worth It's Rating . . .,"I have seen war movies of poor quality like Battle Of the Bulge etc. However, they were ten times better than this one. It's been a few years since I have seen this movie, but I have not forgotten much. Of course, there is great special effects in the battle sequences and the soundtrack is absolutely wonderful, especially the Japanese-themed music, but that is not enough to redeem this film from the bad points.DIRECTION: Not too impressed. The camera angles were not so bad and it would look like it is well-filmed, but there were times when the camera just shook way to much and was not in the right position (I will talk about that later). It looked like the scenes were filmed in one take. It looked as though the director was not doing much directing at all. It seemed liked he told the actor/actress to do or say something but not how to, which might be one reason for the horrible acting.CAST/ACTING: Also pretty bad. Why was Ben Affleck chosen for the main role? In my experience he showed one of the worst performances I have ever seen! He looked like a puppet being pulled by strings. He should have won his Razzie Award nomination for worst actor! As for Kate Beckinsale, she was not a bad choice, but mainly because of her good looks. Her acting was okay but would not win an Oscar.SCREEN WRITING: Quite bad. Actually the emotion and settings would make this script closer to average, but thanks to the unbearably simple dialogue and historical inaccuracy and pointless love triangle, it makes this screenplay much below average. I understand that romance was put to reveal an anti war-like message, but that is not powerful enough. It is just so weakly portrayed. And war was not just about leaving your loved ones, but also about children losing their father and ladies losing their boyfriend/husband. They insulted that truthful reality by making Americans look invincible in the second half. I say that if Randall Wallace included something more realistic, and the second half of the movie was edited out (when the Japanese are bombed) he might be able to redeem this film, but sadly he didn't. Another problem is that you don't even care about the characters because they don't seem important. Josh Hartnet's character was decent, but Ben Affleck's character was wooden. The movie is simple American propaganda. It makes them look like invincible heroes and Pearl Harbour their victory. 4 planes shot down expertly by 2 American pilots and them making evasive manoeuvres to clash the Japanese planes. That is not how the battle went. This is not a documentary, but to make a good script about history, you need to stay true to the facts. This is why we should not respect Hollywood films like this for their style.CINEMATOGRAPHY/CAMERAS: I did not last see it at my house so I don't know if the TV had wide-screen, but if it did cameras were not well-positioned. The angles were fine, but in the beginning when Capt. Rafe McCawley reports to his commander at the airfield the camera is aiming at him from his front-right and cutting almost half of his face. Who in the world could think of doing that. Also, earlier on when the kid at the field runs and follows his dad. The crane shot for only one second has the kid in view at the left then it just shows the field itself for a few seconds more. Seeing all this it probably was the TV, but regardless of that Michael Bay should have studied these scenes better and try to make the camera shoot at the right position.I won't say any more because all I wanted to list were the really bad points. So trust me, there are much better films worth 3 hours of your life which are a little bit less than 5.3 stars. Not to mention even better ones. So I have one thing to say . . . this movie is well worth it's rating, if not lower.",3.0,Anonymous,History

"Big, blundering brute of a film that flashes around as uncontrollably as an unmanned hosepipe on full power.","Isn't it annoying when the boundaries between the war genre and the action genre are blurred to the point that the piece eventually just resembles out-and-out exploitation? Pearl Harbor, or 'Pearl Harbour' to the Brits or further still 'Pearl Harbore' to anyone with any common sense - regardless of nationality, is a film that blurs these boundaries to the point of blindness. It ploughs through the rule book like a freight train slamming through a blockade made out of matchsticks. Pearl Harbor sees war and human misery as an excuse to get across the shock and awe of experiencing bombs dropping around you; gunshots going off mere feet away from you and death and destruction everywhere you turn; all in glorious, soft focus and drenched out cinematography. War films should primarily be war films that sometimes, or might not at all, contain a little bit of action – Pearl Harbor is an action film that sometimes, or might not even at all, contain a little bit of war.Pearl Harbor etches out just about everything the audience it is aimed at would want out of a film: romance; action; gunfights; comedy; retribution; attractive leads, all in a runtime of about two and a half plus hours; all under the facade of historical non-fiction and real life tragedy. In historical terms, you won't learn anything from Pearl Harbor that you wouldn't be able to pick up off the back of a themed, kiddie orientated cereal box: ""This semester: Second World War Trivia!"" The latter third of Pearl Harbor reminded me of an old; 1945 made; Spanish produced and propagandist driven piece entitled 'The Last Ones of the Philippines', as this 99 minute piece of drivel about brave, Spanish soldiers defiantly holding up against all the odds in a symbolist-driven location (that being the local church) as various acts of heroism and 'upstanding-ness' are played out.The notion being that war works; war can be a good thing if it means being able to get across what makes a nation, or a nation's attitudes and/or beliefs, 'great'. The catholic driven iconography of the church in said example echoes one such character's eventual demise much later on in Pearl Harbor as we realise he is killed trying to protect a friend whilst tied to a cross – a fitting iconographic intervention. Whereas the ideology of the poor, brave leads refusing to go down without a fight as they strike back with the Dolittle raids/hold up in the said location suggests a sense of victory/accomplishment even though the overall times for the nation are that of dark ones.I've read about it before, and I'm in agreement on the point that Bay doesn't want to end his film with the Pearl Harbor attack because it's a downer, when Bay's film-making ideology is all about anything but. Generic, Hollywood action films (Pearl Harbor is an action film, remember?), it seems, are supposed to have happy endings. Ending with the darkest hour in America's history (at least up to that point in 2001) is seen as not the way to go. But with hindsight, does United 93 go on for another hour after it ends; further documenting what America did in response to the events explored in that film? Of course not; it's an honourable and harrowing depiction of something that happened, not a glamorous; 'feel good'; action movie designed to excite.The film will eventually see Americans Rafe McCawley (Affleck) and Danny Walker (Hartnett) become pilots, but initially they mix and mingle with one another as young kids. They play on Danny's father's farm in a disused crop-duster, pretending to fly and shoot down enemy planes; essentially capturing Bay's overall attitudes to the war genre, one of which says it is just one big game in which gun fire and dogfights play a large part in 'having fun'. One day, they accidentally take up a real crop duster – much to father's displeasure, and he berates them in what is one, brief fleeting moment of realisation of how horrid war is; when he recounts what it was like in the trenches of World War One.From here, they follow up on their love of flying by becoming United States Army Air Corps First Lieutenants, all the time under the watchful eye of James Doolittle (Baldwin). This is in between getting involved with some of the nurses after they're all posted to Pearl Harbor, the nurses; of whom represent some of the loosest, dumbest, most flirtatious, most pouting ever seen on film. They are nothing but mere prizes, what with their bright red lipstick and on-screen vibrancy; they exist only to be 'won' by the male pilots and navy personnel - the one that causes the most trouble is Evelyn Johnson (Beckinsale). Along for the ride is Red Winkle (Bremner); an annoying, stammering character whose deformity is nothing but the butt of most jokes; one of which occurs seconds before the Japanese actually attack Pearl Harbor as he blurts ""The Japs are here(!)"" in what is a monumentally mistimed gag on Bay's behalf.Then there is the attack itself; while technically brilliant, displaying a good awareness of where the planes and boats are in relation to one another, it exists to titillate; to excite: it should be harrowing, but Bay turns it into the film's money shot – he turns it into the most exciting thing in the film when it ought to be saddest, with the item that is the saddest something else completely un-related to the Pearl Harbor attack. ""I think World War Two just started(!)"" spouts some idiot character as it all plays out. The film is a monumental misfire; a politically-driven load of clap-trap, with an ideology that reads something like: 'You do not mess with America!', one that sees the Japanese given five seconds of backlog and President Roosevelt, circa 1941, actually stand up and walk. Too bad there was no last stand in a church.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Much better romance storyline than Titanic,"This movie was the bomb!!  The romance plot was much better than Titanic. Love triangles always make for better storylines. The cinematography was amazing!! The entire movie looked so realistic. If you're into action/war films, the attack on Pearl Harbor scenes will definitely keep you on the edge of your seat. The movie also tugs at your heart. Not just with the romance story between Ben Affleck, Kate Beckinsale, and Josh Hartnett's characters, but also with the feeling that all those innocent men lost their lives that day. You will find yourself welling up with tears over that more than with the love storyline. As history goes, we all know what really happened. However, the biggest surprise comes with how the love triangle story plays out. You will be shocked at the ending (some might not be, but I was.) I gave this movie a 10+ and I fully recommend you go see this film while it's still in the theaters. It's one of those films you have to see in a theater.

Reasons why this film got criticized so much.,"Why is this film so widely criticized? Here are the reasons I gathered. --May contain Spoilers --1. Too typical ""Super Hero"" type American action movie for a movie that's supposed to be serious and realistic. Even the main characters are fictional characters, they shouldn't be almost invincible. Too many examples, here are some of them. Rake didn't die or seriously injured crashing his fighter into the English Channel. With Danny, in Pearl Harbor, sitting in the convertible car while rushing to the air field, was direct hit by gun fire from Zeros, yet both guys were unscratched. Even the 7.62mm gun from Zeros can penetrate that car, not to mention if they ever used the 20mm cannon. In the air field, while scores of armies and pilots were shot dead by Zero's strafing bullets, these two guys were completely unharmed so were some of their buddies. During the ""dog fight"", they were flying way too dangerously low to the ground and close to buildings. One shot showing the fighter going through a tight alley between two buildings diagonally, impossible! At the end of the dog fights, they must have been dead exhausted from all the running around and flying, yet they can still give blood, and later assist on rescue of the capsized ship. At the end of the Doolittle Raid, they're out of fuel and ditching their planes, while Rake's crash landing was sort of realistic, the way Danny's plane crashed and impacted on the ground would no doubt be killing all on board. From the remains of Danny's plane they're showing, there was no way that anyone in that plane can still be in one piece. Yet Gooz and Danny were still alive, aside from moderate injuries.2. Too much historical, factual and technical errors, so much that you can call the producers insincere for making such a high budget film, which the primary purpose is to depict an important historical event, i.e. it's title ""Pearl Harbor"". The Goof list is a long one here in IMDb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213149/goofs . The inconsistency of the positions of the battle ships during the battle scenes are completely unacceptable, since that's the most important aspect of the attack. It's an eye sore to see obviously modern Naval warships in the harbor, including 3 pack together side by side, being used as WWII warships that were blown up during the attack. If they're using CGI effects for recreating the battle ships, why not alter these to at least make them look more historically correct for WWII era type ships. Saving budget, no time, or just laziness? Same for the aircraft carriers, obviously are modern carriers, with the two rectangular protrusions in the front of fly deck, which are part of the steam catapult system for modern jet fighters! During the take off sequence of the Japanese planes from their carrier, a fly by showing an even more ridiculous sight -- an aircraft carrier having airplanes take off in the tail end of the ship (you can see the catapult in the front, while planes take off from the other end), completely in the wrong direction! No one, not even for WWII carriers, that you take off from the tail of the carrier, LOL! This is unforgivable mistake, but again it's so easy to correct with their CGI animation. I don't know if these lack of attentions to details are due to the fact that the director ""Michael Bay (himself were trying to) quit the movie project four times over various disputes"" (from IMDb Trivia of this film).3. This movie is no doubt trying to pack too much stuffs into one film. Romantic stories, jam packed with historical facts / events / speeches, which some of these are just brief add-ins, like all the Japanese planning scenes are no more than 5 minutes combined. Jam packed with tons super action heroes stuffs, and of course all the CGI / explosives special effects, which is the main selling point of this movie. Pearl Harbor not only, but also battle of Britain, Doolittle's Raid, and a bit of close quarter combat with Japs. Too much! Sometimes, trying to do too much can be a very bad thing. And this movie shows.It's OK to have some romance and hot chicks. It's OK to add a bit of fiction to a historical story. But it's not good if you're trying to do too much, with sacrifice to quality / details, and add in too much cheesy actions and dialogs. Especially, when you have a forerunner film like Tora Tora Tora to compare with, this film is simply inferior without compare.This film do worth 5 points though, for its stunning color and picture quality, beautiful ladies, and at least for the effort of filming such complex project and coordinating those dangerous stunts. And this movie did provide additional critical details, that Tora Tora Tora had missed, such as the wooden piece that makes the torpedo able to be used in shallow water, and the Japanese spy activities in the area.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Pearl Harbor was great!,"I enjoyed Pearl Harbor and recommend it to anyone interested in what really happened December 7, 1941.  The acting was very good.  This was ensemble acting.  The photography was beautiful and horrifying at the same time.  The movie tells a story not unlike September 11, 2001.  It is difficult to understand why ""critics"" failed to appreciate this movie as I loved it. Compared with other films of 2001, this was one of the more outstanding ones.",10.0,Anonymous,History

GREAT MOVIE OUT OF GREAT HISTORY!!!!!,"""A date in which we will live in infamy"". Spoken by Roosevelt, these words were the words of war for America in 1941. Today, these words bring back memories, of when America became strong. This movie, ""Pearl Harbor"" brought back those memories for the veterans of that day, and also gave the citizens of the US a glimpse of that tragic day. Special effects gave this movie it's realness in every way, and the intentness became real to every viewer. Telling the Pearl Harbor attack, the way many saw it, and the love story between soldiers and nurses, and the life of flying of two best friends, this movie became a memorial to many. Brought tears, almost no laughter, and pains for all veterans. This movie touched me deep, as the memory of Pearl Harbor does. The plot was rich with life, and history. As a teen, I'm not fascinated by history, but I do love Pearl Harbor. The movie told every view, from nurses, to soldiers, to citizens. Sadness reached me at the end, as did many. This 3-hour movie (it needed to be!!!) shows life briefly before and after, but with great context about Pearl Harbor attack. Showing views from Japan and US, it tied in history very well.  Ben Affleck and Josh Hartnett worked very well side-by-side, along with Kate Beckinsale. The duo made out to be great working together.  The romance story between them made in Hollywood, but Pearl Harbor made it history. I agree. This is a blockbuster, of history!!! Touched me deep, as I saw it yesterday, but forever will I remember this movie. THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!!",10.0,Anonymous,History
Not bad if you skip all the insipid romance,"The studio was saying, hey, Titanic had this historical bad thing happen, with a fictional romance tied up into a terrible tragedy.Well, yeah, except Titanic was a terrible accident, but Pearl Harbor was a massive deliberate attack, from one mighty nation against another, precipitating America's entry into a World War. Titanic was one tragic night.Titanic has a fictional romance plot, which is arguably silly, depending on your point of view, but it actually serves multiple purposes. It generates some emotional bond between the audience and some characters so you care more about some of these people who are going to die.The romance also lets us see and appreciate the mighty RMS Titanic, so it hits harder when she goes down. It's way more real when you live through the eyes of these characters having a wonderful adventure.This movie slathers a nearly incomprehensible love triangle over, well, the attack on Pearl Harbor.They could have had a romance thing, done tastefully, and, MINIMALLY. The world shattering events being depicted are (seemingly obviously) far bigger than these characters we are watching. And the romance plot is so lackadaisical. No wonder the lady couldn't choose- the Affleck and Hartnett characters are indistinguishable.And the runtime- this movie was called ""Pearl Harbor"", not ""Pearl Harbor and The Doolittle Raid"". The Doolittle Raid deserves its own feature, not crammed in as a coda to the PH attack.",1.0,Anonymous,History

Incredible.,"When I critique a movie, I look at 4 basic categories.  Character Development, did I understand the character's history and life, did I relate to the character, did I know everything I had to but not more than I needed to?  Plot.  Did I buy into the story?  Did it resolve everything it started? Did it follow logical sequencing?  Did it keep me interested?  How was the ending?  Set, Design, and Costume.  Explains itself.  And the most important category is the ever popular Entertainment Value.  For the first time in my life, a movie scores a perfect 10 in all 4 categories!  Pearl Harbor is quite possibly the best movie, I have ever saw.Character Development - Beautiful.  I felt like I was in their lives.  We new everything we had to know about each character.  One Problem.  How did Rafe go from struggling to read and write to writing and reading the eloquent letters to Evelyn?  Don't get it.  How ever the movie did a great job of giving us something at stake in every character's life.Set, Design, Costume - The battle of Pearl Harbor was one of the best war sequences of all time.  They did a great job with costumes and sets.  A lot had to do with filming on location in Pearl Harbor.Plot - Wonderful.  It flowed so well that you don't realize it is so long. You can't cut anything out.  Great Ending.  The battle of Pearl Harbor wasn't the climax.  Great Job.Entertainment Value - Once again, one of the best movies I ever saw.  I don't understand what the fuss is about.  This married, heterosexual male even cried at the end.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Brilliant and unforgettable - world's first impressionist action film!,"Michael Bay is known for applying his astonishingly fertile imagination to producing gripping, pulse-pounding cinematic action. PEARL HARBOR delivers all this and more because, unlike most of Bay's films, much of the movie has a mysterious, poetic quality. It actually has the unmistakable feel of a tale told from memory ... that sense of days gone by, and long-remembered. The director interviewed a large number of survivors of the Pearl Harbor attack before making the film and screened it for them before it was released. Unlike most American film critics, they found the movie to be powerful and very true to what they felt about their experiences. The key word here is ""felt"". While the film - other than the battle scenes - is not meant to be taken as a literal portrayal, it is remarkably true, it seems, to the inner, emotional experience. American film critics have always had trouble relating to abstraction - probably because the American film tradition itself is so deeply rooted in ""wrought iron"" realism. But the critics and viewers who have dumped on this fine work have really missed out on a significant and insightful creation. The core subject of PEARL HARBOR is the way events in the early 1940s plucked a generation of young people out of their peaceful lives and forced them - almost instantaneously - to enter adulthood. They were called upon to sacrifice - to become heroes - to die for a way of life they would ultimately have to deny to themselves. Bay's work here is brilliant and compelling. For once, he devotes his considerable genius for creating powerful images to a higher purpose - and, for the viewer who responds to this, the film lives on in the mind through these magnificent images. During the battle sequence, there is one particular shot of an American flag that serves perfectly as a metaphor for what happened on that fateful day. Though many of the details people have scoffed at are, in fact, authentic, this film is nowhere close to being a docudrama. PEARL HARBOR rather speaks the language of archetypes and leaves you with its powerful and memorable imagery. Most importantly, it is a great, moving, unforgettable monument to the inner experiences of the people who actually lived the epic drama of World War II.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Amazing spectacle, but what happened to the script?","As we all know, the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941 was a major event in history, so why not do a film version? I do applaud a film that takes on a very ambitious project, and this film is indeed that. However, I was hugely disappointed in this film, it had huge potential but it doesn't work.Well there are some good things. Visually and technically the film looks phenomenal, the attention to detail is wonderful. The sets are realistic looking, the costumes are fine and the cinematography is stunning. The music by Hans Zimmer is pretty darn good as well, it really gives power to the climatic scenes. The action and special effects are very well done, the actual attack which forms the film's middle act is utterly riveting.Sadly, everything else doesn't work. Shame really that one truly brilliant scene, a great score and wonderful visuals are literally gone to waste by a bloated plot, cardboard characterisations, questionable historical accuracy and an awful script.Pearl Harbor is very long at 3 hours. Don't get me wrong I have absolutely no problem with long lengths, what was the real problem was the pace. It was so slow, that the slower scenes were close to tedious and there were parts at the beginning where I was finding it hard to keep awake. The plot is also very bloated, a lot is crammed in including a love story and old-fashioned heroics, but for a long film I was expecting a lot of attention to plot. But Michael Bay seemed to be concentrating a lot on the visual aspect of the film and seemed to have forgotten about the story. Consequently these details were underdeveloped, and the film is full to the brim with historical inaccuracies. The actors are undeniably talented, but they are given very little to work with. I had real difficulty empathising with any of the characters here, for me they seemed rather cardboard and clichéd. Ben Affleck and Kate Beckinsale both give lifeless performances and their chemistry is non-existent. Jon Voight is wasted yet again as Roosevelt, somehow he felt more like Dr Strangelove, and out of the cameos Dan Aykroyd especially is completely out of place. Bay's direction is also uneven, there are parts like in the attack itself where it is great but others where it is sloppy. But the worst asset was the script. It was AWFUL! It gave the actors very little to work with, and some of the dialogue instead of moving turned out to be unintentionally cheesy.All in all, this film was disappointing. There are some good moments, but a vast majority of it doesn't work. 4/10 Bethany Cox",4.0,Anonymous,History

Michael Bay makes romantic movie and war breaks out!,"Director Michael Bay brings to screen the grand love of two lifelong friends Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) and the nurse (Kate Beckinsale) who comes between them.... Oh! And there's a war.Michael Bay is trying to teach us all about World War II by making us sit through an uncomfortably corny melodramatic romance. Ben Affleck is doing his best Hugh Grant impression. Kate Beckinsale is her lovely British self. And Josh Hartnett is doing the matinée idol. I'm not being sarcastic. More time is spent on the romances than on any of the historical background. For a better Pearl harbor movie, try 'Tora! Tora! Tora!'One thing Michael Bay does well is action. It doesn't start well with the shaky cam fighter aerial combat. It's way too shaky. However, he does know how to create explosive CGI loveliness. The big Pearl Habor attack is very impressive. The big explosions are fun and the big action is amazing. If only Bay would cut out the first half of the movie.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Best movie I have ever seen,"I saw a preview for Pearl Harbor several weeks back, and immediately I was interested.  I saw the movie opening night and was in awe.  It was one of those movies that after you watch it, you just sit back in your chair in awe.  I've read a few reviews in complete disappointment.  One said that the plot was too corny.  The movie was terrific.  Randall Wallace, writer of Braveheart, wrote this.  The directing was great too.  One of my favorite things about the movie is how powerful he makes scenes to the viewer.  There are a few parts that especially stand out in my mind.  One of the ships are sinking and there are men trapped inside.  Water is feeling up the ship.  On top, men are trying desperately to get the men out, but they can already tell its a lost effort.  They get a hole in to the ship just as it is moments away from being completely pulled under by the ocean.  One of the soldiers reaches his hands up through the hole.  He is reaching for life, reaching for help, reaching for hope, reaching for nothing... One of the soldiers grabs his hand and holds it until all movement stops.  At that point, the hands just stand still.  Another part is where hundreds of soldiers are in the water treading for their lives.  They stand defiantly against all hope and against Death whom seems to be standing more on their enemy's side then their own.  While they are stranded, Japanese continuously shoot at them while they lay helpless in the water.  The noteworthy part of this scene is where the American Flag falls into the water.  There it is waving in the water filled with bullet holes, Yet it still waves showing that it may be a hole in America and a big loss, but America will still pull through.  There are many amazing scenes just as the above two mentioned. The special effects were without doubt the best I have ever seen.  The plot set aside from Pearl Harbor, was enough to make me cry.  There was definitely adequate character depth.  In all, the movie was the best movie I have ever seen and I have seen A LOT of movies.  I urge you all to give it a chance and go see it.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Not Probably, the Worst Movie Ever Made","Where does one begin in trying to describe this joke of a movie. Do we start with the ridiculous ""southern"" accents of the two lead characters, accents that they did not have when the flashback scenes showed them as kids? How about the frosted hair of army pilot Affleck? Maybe the fact that 3/4 of the movie is shot in slow motion, for no apparent reason? Or Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Fred Sanford impersonation and celebratory dance after he shoots down a zeke, while countless other planes continue to fly over? Maybe we should deal with the numerous historical inaccuracies, such as the Japanese strafing a hospital, which never happened? How about Jon Voight's hilarious and over the top performance as FDR? This ""film"" should have been burned and the director shot. I want a congressional investigation into how this got made. One would have to massively edit this piece just to get it to horrible status. Not probably, the worst movie ever made.",1.0,Anonymous,History
Try laying back and enjoying a good film...,"I spoke my mind about it in an earlier note and enjoyed reading other comments, obviously some in favour some against.  Democratically speaking, everyone is undoubtably entitled to their opinion and it should be respected, but, one thing really struck me and made quite an impression on me... people love to hate...Point of fact moviegoers:  the film never supported that it was a documentary.  There were, no arguing there, boo boos {even a couple that were whoppers}.  But, if people want text book history {which is often criminally distorted and misquoted} they should turn to exactly that... history text books.The Next Titanic?  In all honesty other than great effects and a tear jerking, sinking Di Caprio I thought the film was absolute rubbish with nothing other than a very vague plot.  Was Pearl Harbour {English spelling folks, I'm not illiterate}a love story?  Oh, yes!  Remember that anachronistic, medievil word people seem to think that they can do without in this hitech, hipowered era?  Was the heroine unable to make up her mind?... Yeah, right, as if none of us has ever been in any dilemma of any sort in our lifetimes...  Although those who chose to shred this point of the film to pieces might do well to look a little deeper into the actual human dilemma presented.  By the way, some of us might also do well to ask any participant of any war what it is that war can do to people's minds and hearts... but why take into account the human factor, hey?... hitech era remember?Cliche?  Without a doubt.  I've been very happily married {to the same man I might add} for 15 years and life is full of cliches which touch us every time when they come from the heart... and our film heroes had plenty of heart.  Predictable ending?  I would say so.  But, my God my eyes were still riveted to the screen.  Why?  Cause our heroes carried the whole thing off superbly.  I still say there wasn't a dry eye in the cinema.Moviebuffs, why not just let your hair down and simply enjoy?  Why does everything have to be turned into an intellectual issue?  Which is more or less the case with the westernised world nowadays.  I said it before, I have an I.Q. of 180 and if you think MY habits and/or preferences leave something to be desired from that intellectual point of view, you wouldn't belieeeeve some of the ones Einstein had.So, if intellect is the issue here... perhaps you would do well to do a doublecheck... and just sit back and enjoy a damn good film with actors who oudid themselves and were also veeeery easy on the eyes... unless everything bores you, anyway...Way to go Ben...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Horrible,"This was a horrible movie.  Once you got to the actual attack the special effects were impressive and entertaining but getting to that event was excruciating.  The sappy love story seemed written by pre-teens, Barbie goes to war.  The characters were one dimensional cut outs and every war movie cliche had to be included.  Events were staged for effect.  For example, in one scene in a factory the floors were wetted down to get that nice sheen for the camera.  Why would factory floors be flooded on purpose.  It made no sense besides getting a nice shot.  History was condensed and twisted to fit into quick sketches.  Anyone watching this film to gather some sense as to why this attack happened would be very disappointed.  The Japanese were portrayed as just the sneaky villains.  It is a wonder they didn't have mustaches to twirl.  The dialogue was stilted, the subtitles were barely legible, the music was maudlin, it was a bad, bad movie.

the clichéd epic romance-story during real tragic history,"No it is not the overpolished shots, nor the melodic sound track, nor the brave hunks libe Ben and Josh, nor the lacrymal effects of the death of one of the hero, nor the classical love-story, nor the underlying jingoistic heroism after the humiliating coward attack that make this film disappointing : it is the waste of so much talent and money.The acting is fair and mostly credible whereas the story is so cliched. Ok yes you can feel a few emotions but it seems so  ""Bruckheimered"" that I find it hard to really identify myself during the emotional scenes. If you don't see what I mean just imagine the slow-motion camera on the hurt soldiers + hans Zimmer music and you will already  fancy the revenge of the sleeping giant (the US). Or you could imagine the third role good black guy (Cuba Gooding, Jr) who should also be entitled to be a true American hero by shooting one plane.Anyway  besides the clichés and once you forget the historical inaccuracies, you could have ""the epic romance story during tragic history"" style of film, and that's where the shoe pinches because the epic soufflé never rises and the romance is predictable, contrived and too melodramatic !Understand me, the movie is not that bad : you get more at watching it fully despite the 3 hours long than watching the trailer. It works as long as it aims at entertainig and has even some good points : the battle scenes are impressive (and even should I say it : nice),and the film is also a respectable tribute to the American heroes of WW2. Ben Aflleck is rather convincing, every shot of the film is like a Hawaian postcard. So bad the clichéd storytelling entangled all that.(6 out of 10)",,Anonymous,History
