Thoroughly entertaining,"I saw the stage play 27x in Chicago and 1x on Broadway. I was fully prepared to hate The movie. But, I thoroughly enjoyed it. It's not easy to take a stage production and make a good movie. Some reviewers say it started out slow but so did the musical. Jeez, you have to get the beginning of their story! Eastwood kept the same premise by letting each member tell their story...you know there's each person's perception and then there's the real story. You can watch this movie and tap your feet and clap with the music. There was no one behind me so I got up and danced in my seat a couple times!! There was applause a few times in the theater just like at a stage production. There were a few things Clint changed that I wish he had left alone. There were a few things he expounded upon that I enjoyed. I will be going back over and over and over again. This is a good time to be had by all. I'd like to slap some professional critics who panned it. They are way off base.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
A brilliant narration on the true cost of fame and fortune and how pain and loss can conceive everlasting music.,"There's a reason why the 1960s is widely known as the ""Golden Era"" of music, specifically, the birth of what is now called Rock n Roll. Comprising of four British teenagers from Liverpool, The Beatles produced their first album (Please Please Me) in 1963 and went on to be regarded as the greatest rock and roll band of all time. But just a year earlier, in 1962, four boys from New Jersey made heads turn and girls swoon with a unique 'sound' to their music. Jersey Boys is the phenomenal true story of a 'sound' that took four boys from New Jersey's mob controlled suburbs and made them into the icons they are today – legends whose music is still celebrated more than five decades on!Produced and directed by another living legend – Clint Eastwood – Jersey Boys is a Tony Award winning Broadway and West End musical adaptation of the same name. Scripted by Woody Allen's Oscar winning collaborate Marshall Brickman (Anne Hall and Manhattan), the story benefits from a deeply dramatized account of the stage production, thus making it a biopic rather than just a musical. This is why the audience has to wait a good hour before Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young) makes our feet tap to the film's first real track: Sherry. But before we get to hear Young's remarkable rendition of Valli's incredible falsetto pitch, Brickman's story takes us through New Jersey's underworld circa. Valli is a good Italian-American kid but his friend Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) is just the opposite. They are both connected to local mobster Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken). Taking Valli under his wing, Tommy puts together a small time band but only manages mediocre returns while also moonlighting as juvenile delinquents. This changes with the arrival of Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), a golden goose of a singer- song writer whose epiphany changes the band's name from The Four Lovers to The Four Seasons. Then, with the addition of bass guitarist and singer Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), Sherry, their first song as a band, becomes a hit and the group is instantly catapulted into nationwide fame.By the time we get to the band's all-time number one hit single, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, there's trouble brewing. Domestic heartbreak and tragedy, ego trips and quarrels, financial crises and mob intervention turns cracks into fissures. Reminding us that this is in fact a stage show adaptation, Eastwood creates individual perceptions by allowing each member of the band to narrate his story directly to the camera. While this might seem like a theatre-cinema blending technique (ala Moulin Rouge!), it adds wholesome dimensions as a biography made for the discerning cinema audience. Adding on to that dimension is the juxtaposition of organized crime with the evolution of Doo-wop into rock and pop. In fact, there is a brief reference to Frank Sinatra, who as legendary as himself, was known to have ties with Chicago's notorious mobster Al Capone. To this effect, the story also includes real life actor Joe Pesci (Joey Russo) as a talent scout who recommends Bob to the band. Synonymous with mobster roles in previous films, Walken himself might seem like a cliché, but instead is entrusted with the film's humour and he delivers. Characterization from the rest leaves more to be desired. Young as front man Valli and Piazza as Tommy are more theatrical than expected in a film. It's a different matter when we get to see them perform as musicians – simply astonishing!That there is no reference to era specific bands like The Beach Boys or the Bee Gees can be another letdown. Instead, Brickman's script remains parallel to the stage production with emphasis on an underdog rags-to-riches plot arc. Even so, as Eastwood's first musical adaptation, Jersey Boys has more hits than misses (excuse the pun). Like the Academy Award winning Walk The Line, a lot of focus has gone into the back story by dramatizing the true cost of fame and fortune. Above all, it is a brilliant narration on how pain and loss can conceive everlasting music. And judging from the need to make this film, it's no surprise that the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons will always remain evergreen.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"""Everybody remembers it how they need to.""","3 out of 4 stars.I was really excited for this movie. I saw the play in Chicago about 5 years ago and loved it. Clint Eastwood is one of my favorite directors and I thought ""Jersey Boys"" would be one of my favorite films of this year, but I was disappointed by Eastwood's adaptation of the hit Broadway play. Maybe I set my expectations too high. It's hard not to compare it to the play.The acting is top notch (particularly John Lloyd Young, who won a Tony for the play), the sets are authentic, and the music is great. However, I felt Eastwood decided to add more talking moments and put the music to the side. The music becomes more background noise and not the driving force of the film. The film becomes more of a standard music biopic than the musical on Broadway. I understand why they made some of the choices and some of them work very well, but I would have liked to have seen more musical moments.A lot of time is placed on the exposition and I thought it kind of slowed the film down. The actors break the fourth wall throughout the film, but I don't think Eastwood's style worked as well with it. Films that break the fourth wall and talk directly to the camera (like Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"" or Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas) have a particular energy that drives the film. Eastwood, though, has a slower and more patient style and I'm not sure if breaking the fourth wall always went well with the film. The actors are good enough to make it work though.The movie is at its best when the music comes to the forefront. Eastwood does a good job of showing the fun the band has creating music and the audiences' reaction to the music. It shows the power of their music. One of my favorite moments is when the band plays ""Cry for Me"" for the first time. It's music being created so naturally and shows why Frankie Valli & The Four Seasons are great. Other great song moments include ""My Eyes Adored You"" and the tear jerking rendition of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You.""Eastwood's ""Jersey Boys"" has its faults, but the sheer power of the music and the acting makes it a treat worth seeing.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
If you Love Music...you will Love Jersey Boys,"My wife and I were extremely and pleasantly surprised. I've never been into musicals...ever...my favorite up to this point was ""The Sound of Music,"" which inspired me to get into the film industry in the first place, yet, we found ourselves seat dancing and bopping in our seats. We really enjoyed the interpersonal approach of having the characters each expressing their takes and their understanding of each situation, which brought a lot of comedic character moments to the storyline and subplots.But the the thing that impressed us the most, was the decision to make the film NOT feel like a musical. No-one busted out in song at the wrong time...and the singing moments felt completely unforced. It was like watching a living biographical film. Great Directing job by Clint Eastwood.Lastly, we didn't realize how many great hits Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons had. We thoroughly loved this movie....and can't wait to buy the soundtrack.The theater was pack...and it was the biggest theater in the Tampa Bay area.",,Anonymous,Music
Musical biopic with excellent songs,"JERSEY BOYS is another winner from director Clint Eastwood and an adaptation of the popular stage musical about the life and times of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. It's a lengthy and often slow-moving biopic that takes a long time to get to the fame and fortune of the group in their heyday, yet there's something engrossing about it all the same. It helps immeasurably that Eastwood is an assured direction who brings a sheen of class and professionalism to all of his films, making this a delight to watch.Most of the cast members are taken straight from the musical, so their singing is quite wonderful. Their renditions of all the popular hits are quite amazing, particularly the power house climax which is incredibly moving and perfectly performed. The ending credits, in which the whole cast provide an encore in the classic musical tradition, could easily have been completely cheesy in the hands of a less experienced director but Eastwood makes it work, and then some.Acting stand-outs are John Lloyd Young as family man Frankie, whose turbulent private life is in contrast to his serene presence on the stage, and Vincent Piazza, delivering a variant on his edgy presence in BOARDWALK EMPIRE. I was delighted to see Christopher Walken cast in support as well. As musicals go, I'm not a massive fan of the genre, but JERSEY BOYS is good enough even for non-fans. Check it out.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Rag (doll) to Riches,"Greetings again from the darkness. Two upfront disclosures are in order. I have never seen the mega-smash Broadway show, and I've always been a huge fan of The Four Seasons' music. These are pertinent because they impact one's reaction to the film version.Director Clint Eastwood knew immediately he wanted to bring the Broadway show to the movies. In fact, his decision to cast 3 of the 4 main stage actors proved crucial in this successful transition. The rags-to-riches story of four guys from New Jersey is not only true, but it's believable because they scrap and battle just like we would expect. The mob ties are on full display, as is the struggle to maintain any semblance of normal family life while on the rocket ship to stardom.John Lloyd Young is spectacular as the great Frankie Valli. While I fully anticipated cringing during the songs, his voice never once faltered. He is clearly the main reason the Broadway show (he won a Tony award) and the movie work. Erich Bergen plays songwriter Bob Gaudio and Michael Lomenda plays bassist Nick Massi ... both are solid. The only crack was in the casting of Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito. Piazza is well known from ""Boardwalk Empire"", but he is just a bit too slick as the guy who scammed the other band members, digging a massive hole of debt - mostly to a mob loan shark named Norm Waxman (played by Donnie Kehr in an excellent performance).Other support work is provided by Mike Doyle as record producer and all-around flamboyant guy, Bob Crewe; Renee Marino starts strong as Mary (Frankie's future wife) but is given little to do as the story progresses; Joseph Russo captures the quirks of a young Joe Pesci, who introduces Gaudio to the band; and the always entertaining Christopher Walken slightly underplays local made guy Gyp DeCarlo who is instrumental in protecting Frankie in those early years. It should also be noted that the band's accountant is played by Barry Livingston, who you might remember as Ernie from ""My Three Son's"".Eastwood is now 84 years old and he wisely takes a pretty conventional route with the film version. In fact, the argument could be made that taming the language could have resulted in a PG-13 rating, making it more accessible to families. It doesn't have the edge that most R movies possess. This movie has not been popular with critics and it's probably because of this relatively safe approach to an entertaining and fun story. It's not cutting edge cinema, but if you enjoy the music, you will enjoy the movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Our Eyes Adored it....our hearts ached for more,"Great movie...great music...great actors...what more could you ask for. I knew Eastwood began his life as a musician, but I didn't think he would do such a great job with a pseudo-musical. Great job Mr. Eastwood!I've never seen the musical, but I gotta tell you, if you love 60's, 70's & 80's Frankie Valli songs, your eyes too will adore this movie... and your ears... and your heart... and the entire rest of your body.It was heartbreaking at times...and I got chills several times while finding out how they came-up with some of their songs...like the death of his daughter. But, it was also very insightful into the lives of kids with dreams and how committed one has to be to make it in the music industry.If I could give this movie a higher score I would. Our theater was packed-full and everyone clapped afterwards like we were watching a living bio-pic. I even saw a few people with tears in their eyes from being so deeply affected by the beautiful music and memories in this movie....so many great memories...that the songs take you back to.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Blew me away!,"So here's the thing: Saw Jersey Boys tonight. Now I've never been interested in the stage version (I think musicals should have original music) and I didn't really trust in Clint Eastwood directing a musical; in short - I was ready to hate it (I've been called snob and pretentious more than a few times). But let me tell you, I was dead wrong.It was AWESOME!!! The actors are stellar, the music is fantastic and the film completely engrossing. I had a big goofy smile plastered across my face from beginning to end. The audience clapped twice during the movie (it was that good). It would not be hyperbolic of me to say that this WILL get Oscar nominations.I will be seeing this movie again and again when it comes out June 20th. Do yourself a favour and do the same.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Saved by the Music,"""I remember thinking there was something off with this guy. This was 1959, people thought Liberace was just theatrical.""With films like Mystic River, Million Dollar Baby, Unforgiven, and Gran Torino you'd never guess Clint Eastwood would direct a musical biography like this one. It is unlike any other film directed by him in the past couple of decades. Jersey Boys tells the true story of the musical quartet formed by a group of kids growing up in the streets of New Jersey who influenced rock and roll during the 60's. Eastwood explores their trials and triumphs during these decades and balances the rather dull story with their great music. The film was adapted from the successful Broadway musical, but unfortunately it fails to capture some of that energy. My biggest issue with this film was the pacing which became tedious at times. It tried to cover so many years that it felt like some characters that were introduced early in the film were never really explored at all. At times the movie also feels like it's playing it safe by following most conventions of the musical biopic genre. It tries to be different by breaking the fourth wall, but it never works. However, I did enjoy this film because of the music. It was great. The film succeeds when we get to see how they come up with the songs and then hear them perform them, but it fails when it tries to explore their relationships outside of the group. Eastwood's film could've been so much better if the unnecessary subplots were cut out because the pacing becomes tedious at times.I wasn't familiar with the four lead actors in Jersey Boys, but they all gave strong performances. Their voices were phenomenal and the music was a pleasure to hear. John Lloyd Young played the same role he did in the Broadway musical as Frankie Valli, and he captures that unique voice in the film. Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito also delivers, but it's Christopher Walken once gain who steals each scene he's in. Walken plays the mobster, Gyp DeCarlo, who first discovers Frankie's angelical voice. It's a role Walken could perform in his sleep, but there is no one who can pull it off better than he can. The film could've used a bit more of his character and humor, especially when the story began to drag. Clint Eastwood is a director that I've learned to admire over the years, but this is one of his weakest films which lacked some of that spark from his other films. Jersey Boys simply plays it too safe and never delivers the punch.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Makes you love their Music All over Again,"Going into the movie I knew and liked the Four Season's music, but was unsure if I would like the movie (it would not have been my first or second pick to go see). However, I was able to see an early viewing of the film and took advantage of it. I must say I LOVED it. It had all of the songs I loved. The film has the right amount of humor when needed. I have not seen the Broadway show version. If you like their music it is worth going just for that as it is a mix of recordings from the Four Seasons and also recordings from the cast. While it is rated R for language, I did not find it excessive. Erich Bergen's performance stood out for me.I have never seen a Clint Eastwood film that he has been either a producer or director. I was wary about seeing the film, but must admit that I thoroughly enjoyed it. I would Recommend this film",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Nice movie.,"I'm not sold on this movie. I just found it to be a little lacklustre and a musical it is not. The Four Seasons had some really classic songs and their rise to fame has some interesting points but it seems like every other artist around the same time. Childhood friends create singing group, they struggle to make it, they finally make it, the group suffers from ego problems...and well you know the rest.I never really knew the story behind the Four Seasons but I definitely love their music. But I'm not sure I cared to see it played out in the theatres. Besides no actor can do their music justice. The musical performances were OK but they were missing that spark. It's nice to watch but certainly not a masterpiece. Clint should stick to grittier genres from now on.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Eastwood misfires with weak characterizations and clichéd dialog,"Jersey Boys is the latest film to come off the Clint Eastwood production line. Based on the Broadway musical the film is the story of four young men who would eventually go onto become The Four Seasons, one of the central doo-wop groups of the sixties. The film charts their rise from petty thievery in New Jersey to chart domination and so-on to the various fall outs that usually raise their head in such music biopics.I say music biopic, but Jersey Boys gets lost in a chasm between being a music biopic and a musical. It has strong elements of both yet doesn't know which it wants to be. And this is one of Jersey Boys' many, many flaws.The film contains the same four actors as the Broadway musical. Also, the screenplay was written by the same writers as the Broadway musical. You get the feeling they didn't know which they were going for, musical or biopic. I definitely didn't.The first half hour or so introduces us to the two key characters, Frankie Valli (John Loyd Young) and Tommy DiVito, (Vincent Piazza) both young musicians trying to make it out of the 'neighborhood' and a supposed life of petty crime.There are a few sequences around this time bizarrely involving a character that is supposed to be the young Joe Pesci, which is fair enough because apparently the Four Seasons did in fact know Pesci. What is not fair enough is the 'how am I funny?' reference shamelessly thrown in. As well as the fact that he's played as Pesci's persona in Goodfellas/Casino, not as a young Pesci himself. The whole thing is just peculiar.Eastwood uses a piece to camera story telling technique whereby each of the four protagonists takes turns speaking directly to the audience and talking them through the plot in the style of Ferris Buelar's Day Off and Alfie and surely deriving from the play too. In all fairness we probably need the explanations to catch exactly what is supposed to be going on. But they're handled so poorly it just takes us totally out of any sense of illusion we might have had. Specifically look out for such an example where bassist Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) attempts one of these monologues whilst he is supposed to be in the middle of a stage performance. Awful stuff.Of the characters that the story revolves around the only one that appears to matter, for the first third of the film anyway, is Tommy DiVito. It appears to be his story; and he is unbearable. Tommy is a boring stereotype of the typical Italian–American mob underling and his character is insufferable. In each scene we hear him before we see him, barking a threat or applying tacky charm. It's only ever one of the two. His testosterone and ego are so over the top that I found him hilarious. He is a ridiculous and unbelievable character. Frankie Valli, to my eye, is given nothing; his character is not explored in any way until about two-thirds into the film, when there is an attempt made to give him some sort of back story regarding a relationship with his daughter. It seems a sub plot squeezed in because it needed to be and because the film makers realized how little his character is explored. It's haphazardly handled and neatly tied up before you know what's happening. However even if this aspect of the film had been handled well and unraveled in a way so that the audience could appreciate would was happening it's still at too late a stage to care about the guy or even want to get to know him.The script seems disjointed and the dialogue weak. There's far too much time spent on the four protagonists attempts to 'make it' and again this all revolves around the Tommy DiVito character. The dialogue is filled with clichés to such a point that a lot of lines spoken by the characters sound as if they were the first thing that came into the writers head.The cinematography for me seemed dull and appeared to give the film a somewhat flat and cold feeling. It's strange, when you notice cinematography it's usually because it's good, rich and vibrant or even stark, and cool. But on this occasion I noticed the cinematography because it seemed so washed out and plain. The photography on the film seemed to be trying to imitate the lighting on a Broadway show. Leave one to one and the other to the other would be my thinking.It's meant to be a fairly light-hearted piece by what I can judge. That could be its only defense. That it's not meant to be taken too seriously. But even still, the weak characterizations and the clichéd dialogue is fairly unforgivable.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
It's music to my ears!,"""Four guys under a street lamp, when it was all still ahead of us, the first time we made that sound — our sound."" Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young)It's next to impossible to compare director Clint Eastwood's entertaining Jersey Boys with the popular juke-box stage hit without feeling that the live production is superior. It could be using some of the stage cast, including the excellent John Lloyd Young as Frankie, highlights the electricity of physical presence over the celluloid mimicry. Or maybe because it seemed like a fuller musical on stage, with complete songs and less family squabbling. Or maybe because Christopher Walken's mobster, Gyp DeCarlo, is underplayed.But more to the point, this film is a story of rags to riches with the speed bumps large and disorientations many despite the transcendence of the music (Sherry Baby and Walk Like a Man are only two of the memorable hits by this unusually gifted group). Eastwood spends considerable opening capital on the home life of the Jersey boys with the overdone Sopranos accent and run-ins with local cops to the exclusion of the actual development of their famous songs.With the emergence of the Four Seasons, the musical becomes vibrant. Eastwood deftly weaves the songs into the narrative without bringing attention to just the songs. Somehow after the death of Valli's beloved but troubled daughter, My Eyes Adored You fits the distancing that fame brought to the relationship and the sadness of the loss. As Frankie moves into performances without his original group in order to pay off mob debt for his partner, Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), the songs still evidence the greatness of the falsetto and the humanity of the singer.Eastwood builds the sentiment into the narrative arc, beginning roughly in the hood and ending sweetly at the Hall of Fame, where the reunion reminds us of their unique charm even though they are old but not out of tune. Jersey Boys may not be the fullest musical imaginable with its middlin' family life sequences, but when it breaks into song with tunes accurately fitting the times, the film becomes a testimony to Clint Eastwood's ability in any genre and the glorious sound of real humans trying to balance audience, mob, and songs.Maybe it's in the New Jersey water—someone ought to bottle it; otherwise never again will we enjoy the high-pitched romance of local boys making great music. A musical about that rarity has its challenge built into a narrative that must compete with the almost supernatural expression of music:""After silence, that which comes nearest to expressing the inexpressible is music."" Aldous Huxley",,Anonymous,Music
"Oh, What a Night.","Clint Eastwood and show-tunes. Who would have thought? Jersey Boys came and went in 2014. It's one of the lost films of the 2010's. Was it because it was so bad? It's not that bad. It's like a cross between Dreamgirls and A Bronx Tale. The music is fantastic, as you'd expect. The storyline, while corny and a bit disheveled in tone, is easy to follow and hits right home when it needs to. Hearing Frankie Valli's ""My Eye's Adored You"" at his daughter's funeral left me with a lump in my throat. That's a powerful moment that needed it's one-two punch for viewers, and thankfully, we get that. My biggest issue is it's acting. At times, the boys are way over the top. The climax in particular is a treasure trove of embarrassingly bad acting. It's not a masterpiece, but it's a nice little movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Eastwood Hangs 'Em High in 'Jersey Boys',"Clint Eastwood's movie version of the hit Broadway musical, ""The Jersey Boys,"" a biographical spin on the '60's pop group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, is pure, old-fashioned entertainment in the best sense. One of the most endearing elements of the film (and the most revealing in terms of the tone the director wished to achieve) is its curtain call, after the story has concluded and before the credits pick up steam, a Broadway-ish foot-stomping sashay across the stage by all the characters as though taking a richly earned bow. The last time a film made such an audacious end-credit presentation was in Michael Todd's storied ""Around the World in 80 Days"" back in 1956, and that's a fur piece, as they say. It's clear from the git-go that Eastwood means to have fun with the story and not wallow in its more melancholy moments, although he hardly ignores them. I loved the stage play and thought it brilliantly captured the dramatic tension while expressing what went wrong with the group via its off-stage antics. Truth to tell, if Eastwood had spent more time on those moments, as some critics complain he should have, the music would have become secondary, and that really would have been a fatal mistake. For the 1950s and '60's in which Valli and his group flourished were a transition from the simpler, more bubble-gummish times to that of gritty realism, and Eastwood gets us there, thank you. As written by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, the film has, on the surface, a ""Rashomon""-like approach in having each of the Seasons members sequentially telling different portions of the story from their perspective, each breaking the fourth wall at those points to address the audience. In ""Rashomon,"" the 1950 Akira Kurosawa film, four characters tell the story of a rape and murder from four different perspectives, each different; the crime never gets solved, and neither does the mystery. But in ""Jersey Boys,"" the technique clarifies rather than confuses, with the perceptions merely building on the other and enhancing an overall point of view. John Lloyd Young (an exact physical replica of the old movie tough guy Richard Conte if ever there were one) is just dandy in reprising his Tony-winning turn as Frankie (nee Castelluccio), capturing every nuance of Valli's high-pitched virtuosity in songs like ""Big Girls Don't Cry,"" ""Sherry,"" ""Walk Like a Man"" and ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You."" To those of a certain age, the sound is so accurate it will make you want to reach for your dashboard radio to turn the volume up. The Mob's role in the group's rise and fall is nicely depicted if a bit homogenized (thanks to the wonderfully egocentric mini-Godfather put-on by Christopher Walken as local gangster Gyp DeCarlo). Again, Eastwood makes the brave decision to play it this way, and he's right to do so; do we really need to be reminded of how horrible organized crime is? Erich Bergen is perfect as Bob Gaudio, who comes to the group as songwriter and singer in the nick of time thanks to the help of a mutual friend _ none other than the future movie star Joe Pesci (played to the hilt with disarming accuracy by Joseph Russo). Vincent Piazza's Cagney-ish Tommy DeVito, the flawed heart and soul of the group in its early days, is fun to watch and absolutely believable in every way, and Michael Lomenda has excellent moments as Nick Massi, a straight-shooter who finally gets fed up and has the nerve to tell off even Gyp as he speeds away (in a red Cadillac convertible). Mike Doyle's performance as the group's record producer, Bob Crewe, is over-the-top but effective, while Renee Marino as Frankie's sexy-stormy wife, Mary, is powerful and may elicit some supporting-actress nominations. This isn't a great movie, but it's a very, very good and enjoyable one. Eastwood obviously enjoys himself (right down to a tongue-in-cheek Alfred Hitchcock-like cameo via a clip from the old Western series, ""Rawhide,"" which helped make Eastwood a star). So do we.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Clap Out-Loud Good!,"It was not my call to see this movie but so glad I went along for the ride! It has at least a little something for everyone and a LOT for Frankie Valli fans. Granted, the narration is a little distracting at first, but you quickly get so into the story and the characters; the good times and the bad, that you adapt to it quickly. I thought I was tired of their music but I couldn't get enough of it. After several of the songs, the entire audience clapped as though we were at the performance portrayed in the movie. Eastwood knows what moves us, what makes us laugh and how to get us on our feet. He delivers it all big time. Seriously, what more do you want from a movie?",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Loved it.  This movie will leave you with a great feeling!,"Hardly an extra word spoken in this movie. Actors did portray the feeling of the 1960s. I know, I lived through them. You will see America in haircuts and fashions before America went long hair.This movie with leave you with a good feeling when you leave. I love how they dressed, Classy.This film will be especially poignant for Baby Boomers. They will be able to remember their 'teen days, before the long hair fashions appeared. Also, Baby Boomers will no doubt be amused as to how polite people are to one another oftentimes in this movie, which is another aspect of the 1950s. The 1950s were dominated by parents who taught their children to have respect.It is no surprise to me that women who are over 45 scored this movie the highest on IMDb of all other groups. This movie is a trip down lover's lane, holding hands, pony tails, poodle skirts, and Frankie Valle tunes about adoration, caring, walking like a man, and twist parties. This was the 50's as I knew it, too.And one of the codes of the 1950s is that boys should ""walk like a man"". And men should adore their women. They should give their date attention and respect. Another ""code"" is that debts should be repaid. And friends should be loyal even during rough times; keep a clean appearance. Be respectful to authority. To a reviewer, this may make the movie ordinary, bland, uneventful. But to a Baby Boomer, these culture traits of the 1950s will be fondly remembered especially compared to the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s.Now, what makes this film more interesting is the understanding that the Four Seasons had connections to the mob. This fact makes their story a surprise. Note that there is minimal violence in this movie. Sexuality is muted, just as it was in movies of the 1950s. So, this movie will not titillate for this reason; rather it is a musical bringing back memories and scribing a history of the success of the musical singing group, ""The Four Seasons.""This is not a movie for the modern man of 2014 who needs porn, burning cars, outrageous behavior, computer graphics, monsters, super heroes, toilet humor, and scenes with drug use to enjoy the movie. This movie has none of that.There are some mild stereotypes used which simply add humor to this show. The language accents of the ""Jersey Boys"" may be of the 1950s, but not now. (Maybe New Jersey has had its accent diluted by Mid Westerners moving in over the years.)These young men had beginnings as occasional thieves and burglars but at some point decided to capitalize on their talents so they went ""straight"". This story is not a ""Goodfellas"" story. They were never members of the mob. And they never did anything more serious than steal in their early years.This is an adaptation of a Broadway musical by the same name. The same actors are used for this film that appeared on Broadway. And they sing in person without lip syncing on the film set. The tunes are sentimental, rock n' roll, happy tunes. A time or two the lighting is actually ""stage set lighting"". This type of lighting is not meant to create realism, rather it is used to simplify the scene and place the actors ""on a stage"" front and center. And this set=up can then be used for an actor to sing! Well, yes, they sing! So, IF YOU LIKE THESE TUNES THAT ARE SUNG, YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE ALL THE MORE.The direction of the movie is nearly flawless. I have directed stage, and I am a pro photographer. Everything he has stage blocked in this movie flows well. The timing was ""on"" for actor's movement every word of the way. Eastwood is a good director.This movie has a ""good message"" about perseverance, being loyal to friends, honor, working hard towards success, becoming a more upstanding individual, and of course, enjoyment of romantic music. Now, how it does all this in a New Jersey ""1950's culture format"" is for yours to see.The audiences I have been with are mostly gray haired Baby Boomers. I have enjoyed it equally the two times I have seen it, even after reading all of the critical reviews made by IMDb members. I wondered where these critical reviews and negative comments could come from. So, I have sorted out the comments and it seems that there are groups of people who: (1) Want a more unusual, freaky movie; (2) They cannot enjoy the movie because to them the Broadway musical is superior, (3) They are not familiar with the 1950's and have no fond memories of it to re-live, (4) They just wholesale write that everything is bad about the movie despite the fact that other people love it.Do not have any high expectations before you go in. This is light entertainment which is funny in a clean manner. There is some disrespect thrown around. The dark side of the movie balances out the lighter parts. Eastwood did not want to make a ""fluff piece"". There are some serious moments of drama in the film. Do not be offended if the ""f word"" is used 3-4 times. This is the sole reason that it earned an ""R"" rating.This is a date movie. The tunes are all ""up""; good feeling music awaits you.Now don't think about it. Just do it! Go see it!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Sing Out Another Hit For Eastwood!,"In a theater packed with more people than I've seen attending a matinée in a long, long time, it would seem that each and every person in there enjoyed a toe-tapping, finger-snapping, head-bobbing, 'I-want-to-sing- along' experience during this dance down memory lane. And it wasn't only those who were there when all of this came down, but those too young to have been a part of that scene were having a great time. The casting and directing could not be more excellent than they are for this movie. And it isn't only the music, which is marvelous, but the look into the relationships of the people involved in this moment in time that is fascinating. A peek into their history, their character, the way their lives played out - this is a well put together film When a picture ends with people applauding, you know you've just seen a winner. When you walk out and hear folks saying, ""I'm sure going to have to buy this when it comes out."", you really can appreciate the fact that you weren't the only one in there having a fun time. There are only a few directors whose films you know you can always count on for quality – Eastwood has most certainly proved he's one.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"Having not seen the original Broadway version, I liked this film version of Jersey Boys","Okay, having not seen the original Broadway musical version of this, I had really wanted to watch this movie version of this group of men who rise to stardom despite a couple of them spending some time in bars previously. I didn't know how much of this story of The Four Seasons with lead singer Frankie Valli was true but it was quite intriguing seeing it depicted the way it was even with the abrupt time jump near the end. Maybe some scenes or lines could have been cut, but still, I was glad to see what was on screen and I was especially enamored of the songs the group made famous being done live on film even though none of the performances could touch the classic recordings of TFS. I felt Clint Eastwood did well enough with the direction and I especially liked the final number done for the end credits. My movie theatre-working friend was okay with it as well. So on that note, Jersey Boys gets a recommendation from me.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
See Jersey Boys,"I was born in 1964 so I wanted to see the costumes, hair, make up and set the most. My daughter is a musical theater kid, so the fact that it was based on the musical production I have yet to see was an added bonus. I did not expect too much, maybe a little drama from the clips I had seen. Probably sex, drugs, violence and swearing.Boy was I in for a surprise. I absolutely LOVED every minute of ""Jersey Boys"" I laughed and cried and was in awe with the sets, makeup, costumes, hair and the characters chosen. The music brought me back to my youth and so many memories from early life and my surroundings then. The sound was exceptional.And guess what NO explicit SEX, no drugs except alcohol. There was very little violence and only a few F bombs. How refreshing! Imagine that! So much talent I did not even realize all that is missing until I thought about it later. I only realized the movie runs a little long after it was over.The audience LOVED it. Not once (finally) did I feel a strong urge to shout ""SHUT UP"" to my co-movie goers because they were all too busy watching the movie and enjoying it. Young and older generations alike!Never before have I watched a movie that skipped over time so flawlessly that your imagination was all that was needed to fill the gaps. Brilliant.I am not a movie buff, I only go a hand full of times a year maybe. There was not one thing I did not like about this movie. Not one. I could see owning this and seeing it many times over!See Jersey Boys!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Dragged a bit early, then entertaining","I liked this more than the critics did, although that's not unusual. I thought it was very slow in the beginning as we met the characters... the background was necessary, but I felt it was a little overdone. Once the band formed, the story flowed for a while, although it was a little choppy. These guys were churning out hits, yet never seemed to make the money that Tommy was frivolously plowing through.The musical numbers are great, and done to perfection. And (unlike others) I didn't have a problem with characters breaking the fourth wall and talking to the camera directly. It wasn't overdone and it gave valid insight.All in, it was a decent watch... if anything, it ran a bit long. If you grew up in the era, or in NJ (I was both) then you'll probably like and appreciate it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Expected better from Clint! 4/10,"Review: You can tell that this movie is based on the musical, because it doesn't really go into much depth about the individual band members and I found the storyline pretty sketchy. Clint Eastwood would start an important part of the film, like when Frankie Valli met his wife and then in the next scene they are married without much explanation. That type of thing happens throughout the movie but it is stated that it is based on the musical so I can't really fault the director. I guess that he was trying to stay true to the musical, which is why he added the dance scene at the end with the whole cast but from a viewing point of view, I was left feeling pretty empty because I'm was sure that there is a deeper story to tell about there life's. Apart from that, it does show how they come up with some of there popular hits and it touches on how the group got together but it lacked emotion and intense drama. Watchable!Round-Up: As I haven't seen any of the main cast in any other movies, I can't really compare the performances with anything else that they have done, but they did do quite a good job in this movie. Christopher Walken was the only recognisable face throughout the movie and he put in his usual great performance as a mafia boss. He even took to the dance floor at the end, which was quite impressive for a 71 year old. I must admit, this movie really didn't feel like it was made by Clint Eastwood because of it's lack of in depth drama which I have got used to seeing from this veteran actor/director. On the whole, it's a watchable movie because you do see some of the trouble that Tommy DeVito caused the individual band members but it did drag after a while.Budget: $40million Worldwide Gross: $67millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their biopic's about the difficult route to fame for Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Singing?,"Did anybody else notice these actors could'nt sing, why not use the original records ? I don't mind singers who can't act but there's plenty of actors who can sing I haven't seen the show but even the soundtrack must be better than this Clint Eastwood has made his mark as a director but this is so shallow Compared to the likes of the Bronx Tale.

Great for music fanatics; good enjoyable film for others.,"A film based on the rock and roll musical band of the 60s- Jersey Boys has a great pace to it, with the iconic music of Frankie Valli and the era woven in appropriately and well. Where Eastwood falls short however, is in his creation of female characters. Characters that are initially extremely strong and seem to be a large part of Frankie's early life seem to disappear, reappearing only as plot devices. Other female characters that are supposedly to have a large impact on Valli's life (as told through the narration) debut and disappear as well, living out their time on the screen only as background characters that suddenly make impacts on the plot that are larger than the emotional investment that they solicit from the viewer. If you like musicals this is for you. If you have seen the play and know what to expect you will get more. Credit goes to Clint Eastwood for taking the play and adding cinematic elements to take the story to a higher level. The muted cinematography and editing are noteworthy.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Dangerously close to a History channel special...,"... and in the immortal stylings of Jerry Seinfeld, NOT THAT THAT IS A BAD THING, because the History channel, new to the film biz, has produced some very high quality product.But here is the critical flaw...If you already know how the story of The Four Seasons turned out, if you are of a ""certain age"" and remember the music, then you will reach deep within and find the patience to endure the overlong and tedious portions of this film. And there are many.How much of this is due to the script, and how much to Eastwood, is hard for this reviewer to say. Eastwood has evolved into one of the most technical directors in the biz. Which is another way of saying, if you have technical perfection, you may not have room for anything else.To see how this kind of film COULD HAVE BEEN DONE, please take a look at Tom Hanks's THAT THING YOU DO (1992) which tells a similar story. The big difference is that the audience is hooked early, and entertained throughout. Without the burden or knowing or caring whether the story happened in real life.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

When I heard ""My Eyes Adored You,"" I just sat there and quietly wept, thinking of the one I let get away...I wish I could say it to his face.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Silver star,"Its rather refreshing these days to see a movie that has not gone through a grading treatment where the screen gets blighted with orange and teal lighting.Director Clint Eastwood uses light hues which get more colourful as The Four Seasons get more successful and the songs get more bouncier.This is the screen adaptation of the successful stage musical, although I have not seen the musical to make a comparison.Eastwood has opted to use the stage cast rather than plump for known screen actors to play the members of the group and this means the actors can go straight into what should be now familiar characters and age appropriately.John Lloyd Young is mesmerising as Frankie Valli but the adaptation from stage to screen is not wholly successful. The early act was slow to get going and the film was rather long in the middle as it started to drag. The end song of 'What a night' was a hit in the mid 1970s with a different line up of the band. Still if you are a fan of the music of The Four Seasons then this will be an enjoyable film.If you dislike falsetto then give this film a wide berth.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
terrible,"WTF was Eastwood thinking. I don't know if there was any overdub or if John Lloyd Young actually sang on the sound track for the movie. I quite like The Four Seasons.

"wonderful music, excellent acting, not-so-endearing a story","Having been one of those baby-boomers who was in high school and college during the 60's, the songs of the Four Seasons which I always liked very much, were revived for me. (This, of course was true with the Broadway production which I saw three days after Christmas of 2013.) There was outstanding acting in each form of entertainment. You could not prevent yourself from hating Tommy DeVito who ran the group and who himself said that he didn't believe in democracy. It was definitely a stigma also that the group had Mafia connections, but the actors who portrayed the mob members acted their parts to a tea. In the movie and play all viewers, I dare say, were reminded of the fact that ""nobody knows what goes on behind the scenes."" It brought out not only, again, the Mafia connections, but also the familial difficulties of the group, and some of the domestic problems of some of the individuals. And yet, despite the rather unhappy story, it was a great production. It did have a rather touching ending. It was a great work for Warner Brothers, and a stellar accomplishment for producer Clint Eastwood.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"The stage musical brought to film, an interesting portrait of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons .","I first watched this movie in 2014 and now again almost 5 years later, I enjoyed it just as much the second time. I really love this movie and it brings back great memories.I grew up with the music of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, I was in high school and college in the 1960s when they released many of their greatest hits. But like most other fans really knew nothing about them. That many of them had criminal records was always kept a secret back then, the public probably would not have been so kind if that had been known.John Lloyd Young, a small man and good singing imitator of Valli plays him. Valli was a very small man, even at 30 he was 5'-5"" and 116 pounds, according to his mug shot for skipping out on a hotel bill in Ohio the prior year.Director Clint Eastwood was wise to have all the singing done by the actors, many of the original stage production, and recorded live with additional musicians off-camera. As a result and without lip-sync all the singing is fresh and realistic. Young has a very good voice for the Valli songs, but at a couple of places when original Valli songs are part of the soundtrack we can hear how really exceptional Valli's voice was in his prime.The story we see in the movie is pretty close to what happened in real life, although a few things have been questioned. Nevertheless it is a pretty interesting look at an important singing group from that period.It was also nice having Christopher Walken in the movie, playing mob figure Gyp DeCarlo who Valli says was almost like a father to him.",,Anonymous,Music
Jersey Boys was Entertaining....,"Saw The Jersey Boys last night with a group of 4 friends. We all appeared to enjoy the film and the acting and story was quite good. The only issue we had with this film directed by the great Clint Eastwood is that after Frankie Valli & The 4 Seasons had their string of hits during the early to mid 1960's...by the late 60's the British invasion ruled and their hits became less and for a few years disappeared until 1975 Frankie Valli and The 4 Seasons had a major come-back with ""Who Loves You"" and ""December 63 Oh What a Night""...but in the movie they go from mid to late 1960's to 1990 and skip their big comeback of 1975.

While watching, you get the flavor of the Broadway play production (we saw the original cast on Broadway)but also the nuances only a film can offer.Our only regret is that we, the audience, were never shown pictures or even a snippet of the original Four Seasons members performing. Thought sure we would have been given that during the credits....or somewhere.The only negative was that we chuckled at the way the guys were made to look ""older"" at the Hall of Fame performance.

Very disappointing,"If you loved the stage show, you might want to give this a miss. To put it mildly, it's a mess. The script is all over the place - starts off with a (too) long introductory section about Jersey, with all the stereotypes, the mob, cute Italian families etc. You just want it to get to the MUSIC!! Even when it does, there's not enough of it. (A couple of songs that should have been in full in the body of the film are tacked on at the end under the closing titles.) The subplots about Frankie's wife and daughter make little sense unless you've seen the stage version. We never find out that 'What a Night!' was Bob Gaudio's anthem to his loss of virginity; the songs rarely accord with the plot developments. On the plus side, the performances are all fine, but the actors are battling to inject some sense, and some real joyousness, into the ponderous screenplay. You certainly don't come out toe-tapping as you did with the stage show. I was so looking forward to this movie, but Clint Eastwood was the wrong person to direct it. You have to really love the music and he clearly didn't.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Frankie Vali would roll over in his grave if he were dead,"IMDb ratings are totally out of whack!! This movie deserves at best a 2, and John Lloyd Young who portrays Frankie Vali should be ashamed of himself for taking on this role.First lets start with the story. There just isn't enough there to make a major motion picture out of. Yeah, it's an interesting rise to fame for this GREAT group, but there is absolutely no drama, nothing to entertain or hook the viewer unless you are waiting to hear some of your favorite 4 Season tunes. But wait they even screw that up.....John Lloyd Young plays the role of Frankie Vali...ugh! Not only can this guy NOT act, he can't sing, and for sure he can't and doesn't sound anything like Frankie Vali. This guy tries to sing falsetto but in truth sounds like he's singing through his nose with a bad cold. Was Frankie Vali a complete and total nerd all his life? This so called actor makes him out to be the biggest bumbling nerd to ever grace this earth.Here's the bottom line on this movie, if you like the 4 Season's go buy there greatest hits CD, check out the Broadway play, but avoid this mindless, stupid movie. If you like Frankie Vali DO NOT WATCH John Lloyd Young ruin whatever image you had of Frankie. Finally, what the heck has happened to Clint Eastwood. He has been completely off the mark in his last 2 efforts. This movie was so bad it should kill the careers of Clint Eastwood and John Lloyd Young forever.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
"Kudos to Clint Eastwood and the ""Jersey Boys""","I've read some unfavorable reviews about the ""Jersey Boys"" movie, but I certainly don't agree with them! I thought it was excellent! These reviewers, (mostly ""professional"" paid reviewers), seem to have to justify their existence by ""nit-picking"" any movie. As far as the ""Jersey Boys"" is concerned, they felt it wasn't ""real"" enough. It was too ""sterile"" and ""dull"". Again, I don't agree. It is very well done, totally entertaining as well as informative!At any rate, the movie was an excellent cross between the stage version and motion pictures. The blend of Broadway and Hollywood works here. Those who liked the stage version could enjoy the movie and those who could not afford to attend a live stage show or just had no opportunity to could now enjoy it in film form. The stage version centers on the music more, while the film version adds fullness and close up drama and intensity to the story.The ""sterile"" and ""plain"" look of the sets that the professional critics didn't like gives a ""stage feel"" to the scenes. (Again, a good cross between stage and movies). The somewhat simple dialog is done for the same reason. The acting is simple, (again, the stage presence), and very good to great, (Christopher Walken). The fact that Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice, who wrote the stage musical, also wrote the movie version, and that Frankie Valli and Bob Gaudio were executive producers gives unquestionable credibility to the movie.Now to get to Clint Eastwood. When I first heard he directed it, I did a double take, ( like a lot of people did), only because I wasn't familiar with his musical abilities and attributes even in the directing role. After seeing the movie, I no longer have any doubts about his ability to direct a movie like this! The camera shots were excellent, capturing scenes and people to the fullest effect while maintaining the stage-movie connection. The intensity of the acting at times is powerful! The music was great!I believe ""Jersey Boys"" the movie is a must see for those who saw the stage version and a must see for those who didn't!

While the band members' history and friendship is covered, there is still not that much engagement with the characters. Eastwood just scratches the surface of the relationship between the band members and of their individual characters.Plus, the movie isn't entirely accurate and does take some poetic licence for dramatic purposes.Decent performance by John Lloyd Young as Franki Valli.

Fans of Broadway musicals or the Four Seasons may really enjoy this but as for me it was a bit of a struggle to finish,"""There were three ways out of the neighborhood. You join the army and maybe you get killed. You get mobbed up and you might get killed that way or you get famous. For us it was two out of three."" Tommy Devito (Piazza) is putting a band together and trying to make it big. Nothing really clicks until Frankie (Young) joins the group. His distinct singing gives the group a push but when songwriter Bob Gaudio shows up the group explodes. Things are turning out the way they all wanted until Tommy's demons catch up with all of them. This is the true story of the rise and fall of the Four Seasons. First thing I have to say about this movie is that I was a little disappointed. I am not a big Frankie Valli fan but I do love true stories and music. The big problem with this to me was the pacing. The first hour seems like back story and they struggle to get a record deal. Then 20 minutes of hit after hit come at you, then another hour of the group falling apart. I was mainly looking forward to the music and that part seemed to be glossed over. All that said though the actors were perfect. Every person in here (except Devito and Christopher Walken) has been in the stage production on and off Broadway and that really added to the movie. You really believe they are the real people and the movie does come off almost like a stage play. The biggest problem again though is that is seemed to drag on and I was losing interest a few times.

Captures the Spirit of the Broadway Play,"I was surprised to see how long this show has been on Broadway. Having seen the touring show, I have become a fan. I was suspicious of the movie version because my first response is nearly always, ""How will they screw this up?"" They didn't. Clint Eastwood managed to keep the rapid fire story of the four guys from New Jersey well paced an interesting throughout. It starts with the three things that happen to kids. One is to become famous, and that is pretty far out there. A doowop group manages to make a few bucks while breaking and entering and spending an occasional six months in prison. They have no spark, until Frankie Valli becomes a part of them. His falsetto elevates the rest of the group but they still are stuck in place. Enter Bob Gaudio, the true genius of the group. He, along with Bob Crewe, become the reason things begin to blossom. They take their stupid name ""The Four Lovers"" and turn it into ""The Four Seasons."" There are some cracks about this guy Vivaldi but since he's dead it doesn't matter. As things transpire we alternate between the successes of the group, culminating with their appearance on ""The Ed Sullivan Show."" Through all this we get to hear the music. The hit list is really nice and they do very good renditions of the songs. In order to get them seed money, Tommy DeVito hooks up with a loan shark from the mob and eventually drops the group into nearly seven hundred thousand dollars in debt. As big as they were, this was real money. How they deal with that and the tribulations of their day-to-day existences is what this is all about. The time zips by as we develop a real attraction for this charismatic quartet. I found it to be a wonderful film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
"A solid, thoughtful, if somewhat stiff adaptation of the rather more energetic Broadway musical.","Jukebox musicals – musicals constructed out of an existing catalogue of songs – don't typically boast the strongest of plots. Most of the time, story and character have to get out of the way for yet another toe- tapping number. To some extent, this applies to Broadway smash hit Jersey Boys, which has been playing to packed houses since 2005. But it's also easy to see why director Clint Eastwood was drawn to the material: there's a comparative depth of character to this rags-to- riches true story of four boys escaping their mob-ruled neighbourhood in Jersey through the music they made together. Eastwood mines this very well for his film adaptation, although he does lose a little of the musical's energy and spark along the way.Frankie (John Lloyd Young) is an apprentice hairdresser with the voice of an angel. Everyone thinks so, from local mob boss Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken) to two-bit hustler Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza). Tommy cobbles together a band, anointing Frankie as lead singer, with Nick (Michael Lomenda) as bass vocalist. Playing in dives and rundown bars, it looks like they're never going to hit it big and get out of Jersey. But the arrival on the scene of songwriter Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) changes everything. His music provides the re-christened Frankie Valli And The Four Seasons with a string of radio hits, but also upsets the dynamics within the group - which starts to slowly disintegrate even as its star rises.In Eastwood's hands, Jersey Boys can sometimes feel a little flat, like soda left out for too long on a hot day. You know something fizzy was once there, and the taste of it remains - but it's also faintly disappointing. That's largely because the film doesn't quite seem to know what to do with its most crowd-pleasing musical numbers. They sound great (and are mainly shot with live vocals), but some are left to play in the background, while others - like Sherry and Walk Like A Man - are filmed in so straightforward a fashion that they barely register before they're over. This curious lack of musicality - particularly odd given Eastwood's own passion for music - is particularly keenly felt in the final third of the film, when Jersey Boys becomes Jersey Boy, and the story's focus narrows squarely down to Frankie and his limply sketched-out relationship with wayward daughter Francine.But Eastwood does a decent job with character development, even though he's forced to grapple with some plainly paper-thin creations. (Why is mobster Gyp DeCarlo treated with such reverence when the only thing he can do to help with Tommy's growing debts is serve as a kooky mediator?) Tommy, in particular, is a fascinating character - he struts through the first half of the film with a confident nonchalance that belies his passion and belief in Frankie - something even his band-mates doubt, through all their years of working together. It's why the interplay amongst the characters works so well: Tommy grows anxious when Frankie and Bob cut a deal with each other, Bob snaps when Tommy gets the group in financial trouble, Nick drifts silently through it all until he can stand it no longer.As always, Eastwood is remarkably canny in selecting his cast. Three of the four Seasons - Lloyd Young, Bergen and Lomenda - all come with theatre chops, having performed in the stage version of the show at some point in their careers. In fact, Lloyd Young - with his distinctive high notes and vocal trills - originated his part on Broadway, and it shows. Frankie is easily the most opaque character - we're told his story; he never gets a chance to tell it to the camera like his compatriots do - but Lloyd Young shades a lot of sad nobility into this man who chooses to dig himself into a hole for a friend: a decision that, ultimately, costs him his family. The other standout is Piazza. Die-hard fans might have railed at Piazza's lack of stage experience, but his on screen charisma is what Tommy sorely needs - and no doubt what Eastwood saw in him.Put it all together, and Jersey Boys emerges as a solid if somewhat stiff adaptation of the musical. It misses a few beats, and loses a little bit of its emotional (and actual) rhythm along the way. But Eastwood keeps the character drama humming along well enough, and really makes it all work in the end: from a rousing performance of Frankie's first solo hit, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, in which he finally gets his long-awaited horn section; through to a reunion many years later that proves surprisingly emotional. By the time the credits roll, and the entire cast cuts loose in an utterly joyous rendition of December 1963 (Oh, What A Night), you'll find yourself willing to forgive anything - including the film's occasional pacing and musical sins.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Perhaps Eastwood's Best Yet!,"Take every one of the great reviews herein & multiply my feelings about it 10 fold! CLINT EASTWOOD has a smash on his hands. I could view this movie every day for a month. THIS may be his best movie yet & he's got many great ones under his belt! Hip-Hip-Hooray for Clint & The Jersey Boys. I also saw the play & this presentation is far superior to that great piece of work! Do not miss this movie. When it comes out on DVD, I'm gonna buy it so I can watch it as many times as I want to.Many people know the songs. Some know the 4 Seasons. Few know the story behind how they became famous. This portrayal hits the nail on the head in so many venues............the musical arena; the personal backgrounds; the upbringings; the run-ins with the law & perhaps least known until now...............the why of why they broke up. It's all here......nothing left out!DO NOT MISS THIS MOVIE!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A low-key but no less entertaining musical biopic...,"While not in the league of the Beatles or Elvis, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons are responsible for many of these songs you can hear in the background of period movies during the 60s segment. Their songs are like great furniture for their time, they accompany, sometimes even define it without truly transcending it. And maybe the low-key approach of Clint Eastwood was just right enough to restore their fame. But am I the only one who kept thinking of Martin Scorsese?Indeed, when you have a group of teenagers raised in an Italian-American neighborhood of New Jersey, with a street-smart leader-figure going by the name of Tommy DeVito (played by Vincent Piazza) and a young rookie whose lenghty name makes up for his short stature: Frankie Castelliucci (John Lloyd Young). When these opposite egos share a mutual a connection with a local mob boss named Gyp Decarlo (Christopher Walken), who else would you think of but Marty?!The film opens with some ""Mean Street"" vibes and use music as the same form of escapism as in ""Saturday Night Fever"", but Eastwood wouldn't care less of the 'ethnic' aspect. However, he doesn't really seem to make a specific connection between the music or its creative process with real life like for his jazz-themed ""Bird"" or his ode to country music ""The Honkytonk Man"", offering instead a rather generic biopic about four Italian-American singers who contributed to the Doo-Wop Golden Age.Nonetheless, the story that spans more than three decades is surprinsingly entertaining and maybe because we're not familiar with the real story , we eagerly watch the band members as characters without the burden of connecting it to reality. Naturally, the film ticks the boxes of the musical biopic tropes. The beginning in shady clubs. The troubles with the law. The first hit. The rise to stardom. And naturally, the first signs of tension, leading to the ego-driven conflicts, separation, come-back songs and reunion. Etc. All these elements seem familiar but like I said it before, Eastwood isn't a man who care on working of formulas, it's formulas working for him.The end-result isn't a major film to top his lists but it's still entertaining enough to make the two-hour length worthwhile. Now, it would be a stretch to call the film a character-study but it can be looked as a sort of study of four different personalities trying to find outside the very group the harmony they could achieve within their songs.Frankie is the golden goose for his falsetto voice was the band's trademark, one without which songs like ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Sherry"" and ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" would be impossible to imagine (three hits in a row that launched their career in the charts). Frankie is interestingly played as a man with an inferiority complex, forced to indulge to lousy flirting rhapsodies taught by Tommy to get his first wife (Renne Marino) while she could call the bluff and in the process, ask him to behave normally and tell him to replace the ""y"" by the ""I"", because it's his Italian heritage.Watching Frankie overcome his lack of self-esteem and putting Tommy in his place is one of the film's many satisfactions but Marino makes such a great impression in her early scenes that I regretted her immediate disappearance, I expected her to be the ""woman behind the great man"" or the 'Karen Hill' of the film.As De Vito, Plazza plays a cocky and arrogant character and yet it's impossible to resist the way it makes the story engaging, by getting the band in financial troubles with a certain Waxman (Donnie Kehr) and still maintain himself in total delusion of grandeur, you wait for the big balloon of his ego to deflate, I have a hunch that it's the kind of egomaniac Eastwood despise and once he fulfilled his purpose, he just vanished.There's also Michael Lomenda as Nick Massiani, as he identified himself as the Ringo of the Beatles which says it all, the death of the musician couldn't allow him to give his side of the story.The third force (or second positive one) of the group is Bob Gaudio, played by Erich Bergen, the inspired artist that got the lyrics and the melodies, and as he states without which nothing would be possible. He's the greatest friend to Frankie and together they form the Lennon-Mccartney pairing that drive the group and their complicity is the icing on the cake.The Eastwoodian touch shows its strengths from the get-go, most directors would care for having stars playing celebrities and let the miracle of playback accentuate the illusion, but like for ""Gran Torino"", ""15:17"" Eastwood would rather have characters with the musical and singing talent. He also avoids these usual clichés of the Billboards charts, the touring montages, the spinning headlines, keeping a very intimate view on the group as four boys handling their amounting stardom and resisting various pressures, external or from wthin.The film follows an episodic structure which is the safe choice for a tale of ups-and-downs.Another good thing: anticipating the come-back of Valli after the death of his daughter, I was wishing the song that would mark his come back would be one of these smash hits I not only know but love I wasn't disappointed when the first chords of ""Can't Take my Eyes Off You"" started, if only for knowing it originated from Bob and Frankie, I'm glad I saw the film. That and learning the little role played by a little guy who would play ""Tommy De Vito"" some day in the history of the groupThe film concludes with the film's biggest hit ""Oh What a Night"" and a little choreography that is Eastwood's way to tell you that he's made a fun, unpretentious little film about four brats of the neighborhood who didn't make it as big as Sinatra but given their initial drawbacks, they did great.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Devoid of any real life or spark,"Much like his most recent and most forgettable films J. Edgar and Hereafter, Clint Eastwood's big screen version of the Broadway smash hit musical Jersey Boys is a frustratingly hollow big screen event that squanders a ripe storyline to become a meandering movie devoid of any real pulse, purpose or cinematic flair.The story of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons is clearly interesting enough to set Broadway alight and there are enough elements in the story of these entertainers to fill countless movie tales yet Eastwood's plodding direction seems to reign in all possible emotional arcs present. Joyous occasions feel like non-events, tragedy's appear as by-lines and even the songs of the group don't seem overwhelming eventual despite their obvious pop driven power. Eastwood has shown over recent decades a finely tuned directional mind, from the plains of the west in Unforgiven, the suburban streets of old school America in The Changeling or the battlefields of Japan in Flags of Our Fathers, his films have come to life but he can't breathe life into this rise and fall tale especially with his largely unexperienced cast delivering charisma free turns.Without pretending to be a knowledgeable source on anything Frank Valli or the Four Seasons I would assume that the group possessed as healthy dose of charisma that for the most part in Eastwood's tale appears totally non-existent. Other than Boardwalk Empire's Vincent Piazza as the bands troubled leader Tommy DeVito all other acting members fail to make an impact, which more than likely stems from there history of stage performers not movie actors. John Lloyd Young as Frank Valli in particular can grate and despite his good singing work doesn't do much else to make us like him. When the best member of the cast is a dancing Christopher Walken in the closing credits you know you're in trouble but blame must largely fall to Eastwood for his direction of his actors and miss-telling of much of this story.After Jersey Boys concluded I felt that I knew the group no better than when I started out, where successful musical tales like Walk the Line and Ray succeeded at shining a light on the genius and the drive these performers had and did so by bringing them totally to life, Jersey Boys feels like a mere splattering of events that never fully develop into anything more than mild curiosity for the audience.2 oversized safe's out of 5For more movie reviews and opinions check out -www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Just About Decent!,"Clint Eastwood, The Greatest Star-Actor/Director of all-time, has given us some remarkable films to follow. But with 'Jersey Boys', he offers a rather standard musical biopic, that's just about decent!'Jersey Boys' is the story of four young men from the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey, who came together to form the iconic 1960s rock group The Four Seasons.The musical moments in 'Jersey Boys' are powerful, no seconds thoughts on that. But, the Writing, is lackluster. After an energetic first-hour, the film loses pace & overstays its welcome by at least 20-minutes. The Screenplay by Marshall Brickman & Rick Elic aims high, but loses air mid-way. Eastwood's Direction is atmospheric. But he's done better. Cinematography & Art Design are excellent. Editing is anything but sharp.The Performances range from good to average. I was particularly impressed by Christopher Walken's winning turn as late Angelo DeCarlo. He's rugged & dominating. Of the boys, John Lloyd Young stands out.On the whole, 'Jersey Boys' is ambitious, but flawed too.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
A fantastic cast telling an interesting story,"So where exactly did Freddie Mercury and Queen begin? Is it something you've always wanted to know??? How about Ozzie Osborne and Black Sabbath does that fill your need to know meter a little more? Well then how about Franki Valley and the Four Seasons have you ever wanted to know where they came from, how they got their starring light, how they went from troubled teens to number one after number one chart selling success story? If you watch Jersey Boys it's pretty much what you're going to get. Directed by a now 82 year old Clint Eastwood he's done as much as he possibly could with the film but I can't help thinking how different it could have been if someone else was behind the camera. So the story is exactly as I have said above its about 3 small time hoods who get their jollies by going to singing lounges and belting out a tune or two to a very appreciative audience. Eventually Franki Valley is discovered and a fourth member who not only sings but also writes some amazing tunes comes on board as well. It's exactly what you would expect with no surprises I'm sorry to say. It's what you already know or even what you think you may know and nothing more. It was tired, run down and ordinary, the acting was great the music was fantastic and if anyone wasn't toe tapping along or singing under their breathe, I'd have to call them out as a liar. They were it's only saving graces though, if it didn't have the music to go with the film it would be one of the biggest biopic failures ever created. For me Christopher Walken stole the show, he played the gangster who could get you whatever you wanted whenever it was needed. I love this man and for me he never does wrong. I can't help thinking though how different the film may have been if Mr Walken was to have taken the reins. I'm not going to write much more about this one because as I have stated fairly well I believe it is what it is and nothing more. Watch it for the music watch it for Christopher don't watch it expecting to get anything new in style, although I did like how the colours were dulled down to reflect an older era.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Fun....loved it a love,"23 June 2014 Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester Tonight - The Jersey Boys. Directed by Clint Eastwood this is the story of four boys from the wrong side of the tracks who from a band and make it big. Frankie Valli, played admirably by John Lloyd Young has the iconic voice which leads the famous Four Seasons and this is the story of the rise and fall and rise again of the kid from New Jersey. Accompanied by such iconic songs as Walk Like a Man, Sherry and Big Girls Don't Cry, this film was fun to watch, and kept my toes tapping throughout. Probably not the best dialogue in the world but with a soundtrack like that who really cares. I wasn't alive during this era but my Mum said it took her back and it certainly made you want to get up and have a good old boogie. The final scenes were great and now I want to see the stage show......will definitely be buying the soundtrack.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Very, very entertaining.","Saw it on opening nite 6/20/14. If you ever liked the 4 Seasons, you must see this, preferably on the big screen. The music started even before the film and the person next to me said, ""I already like it."" I agreed. Then, we were treated to a docudrama that revealed lots about the group's personal and professional history, none of which I knew before. Okay, everybody knows about the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, etc. But this is the first time anyone did a bio-drama on these guys...and it's fascinating. Lots of humor...and some sad drama...and lots of really unique music and vocals...adds up to a very good piece of entertainment. Eastwood did an excellent job here in my opinion. I was smiling all through the film. Don't leave until after the full-cast finale.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Movie about a band,"Jersey Boys is a story about this four guys. This is definitely a Clint Eastwood movie that has a ok script.

I just didn't find it that interesting as a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Disappointing,"Now for a dissenting opinion. I was not the biggest fan of the Four Seasons, but I certainly enjoyed many of their songs in my youth. I looked forward to seeing this movie and reliving some of the past.Unfortunately, perhaps my expectations were unrealistic. The script was OK, not great, but OK. The acting was terrible. The singing was unbelievably bad. The actor who played Frankie Valli, frankly, (no pun intended) could not carry a tune. The make up, and I never notice makeup, was amateurish. The cinematography was poor quality. I have seen better video on youtube.com.I enjoyed the story and some of the music and dancing, but it was not much better than some made for TV movies. All in all this was definitely a low budget film. I found myself frequently looking at my watch to see when it would end.I would not recommend this movie to anyone.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Oh, What a Wonderful Film!","I am a huge fan of the stage version of Jersey Boys, having seen 16+ times. Clint Eastwood, Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice have done a phenomenal job bringing this from stage to screen. What I enjoyed most is that it still has that ""live theater"" feel but masterfully weaves in the cinematic touches needed to make it ""sing"" on screen. I've always said that the what these guys went through and their ability to come out on top is amazing; this movie really drives that home. I highly recommend this to anyone who's a fan of the music, a fan of mob stories and/or fans of documentaries. There is some strong ""Jersey"" language so it's not for the young kids but it is certainly for everyone else!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
You can take your eyes off of this mediocre musical homage,"If you like Frankie Valli and vintage automobiles you might like this movie. That is if you can get past the bad acting, stilted drama, low torque script, and Italian American stereotyping right down to the Martin Scorsese-Nick Pallegi inspired voice over narration that unlike its successful use in GoodFellas just falls flat and undermines whatever drama is to be found in this film as it switches from character to character.Somewhere deep down there may have been an interesting story here that a better creative team could have tapped into. Perhaps in the collaboration with Bob Gaudio, the impact of the Beatles, the evolution from doo-wop to disco...but inasmuch as any of these conflicts is touched upon its lost in sappy nostalgia.Its easy to understand why the cast is so bad. First of all it is probably daunting to find a lead who can sing like Valli and capture that personal edge that he still has as performer. Vincent Piazza is all Italian American one-note clichés, Christopher Walken is wasted in a phoned-in performance that is at its best in the song and dance number at the end of the film. The best of the lot is Michael Lomenda who is the only leading cast member to show any kind of real human emotion.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Surely the Play Must Have Been Better...,"Due to the wild popularity of the Broadway play it is obviously easy to get excited about this film. On the other hand the trailer made it pretty clear that it didn't look like a very good movie. As music movies go this ain't one of the greats that's for sure. What's good about the film? The backstory. Clearly NObody has a clue what a fascinating life these four men had and how hard and long they worked to get where they eventually did in their careers. And of course the music is great IF you're into Franki Valli and the Four Seasons. But other than that there isn't much else here. There is almost NO behind the scenes of the music business. The ""biz talk"" is all cheesy insubstantial meaningless Hollywood gibberish. And if you're looking for meaningful stories or behind the scenes facts about the songs themselves or the working relationship of the guys in the group, you won't find it here. This may just be the WORST Clint Eastwood directed film ever perhaps the old man's lost his touch. Who knows. But this isn't an Eastwood classic. Not even the acting is very good. It's a 5 or 6 out of 10 at best as a movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Such an impressive movie, makes me want to see it on stage","It's a timeless story of neighborhood kids making good, and it's been a long time since Eastwood has done something so glamorous.I did not know much about the Broadway musical before hearing about the movie, so I did not know it was about the true story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons who I vaguely herd of but am absolutely familiar with their songs (and Valli's unique chops), and this is the kind of musical that I really like. After all it's all about Rock N' Roll.I really like the dude who played Frankie Valli, especially when he preformed the songs. Not knowing any thing about the real Valli, the actor put on a good show when he sang(or lip-sang). He wasn't the only good actor in the film, in fact it was a great ensemble cast that also includes the great Christopher Walken.It was also a great period piece with the costumes and the Art Direction being done well.It's very funny and very dramatical at the same time, and perfectly New Jersey.

"Jersey Boys works as a drama, but as a musical it fails.","A slight misfire from Clint Eastwood who has directed some excellent films. Don't get me wrong, this was incredibly watchable...just uninspired. Based on the life of Frankie Valli, it is the story on how the rock band 'The Four Seasons' formed. Whilst dabbling in the rise and fall of band member Tommy DeVito, but primarily focused on Frankie. As with most biopics, it is the typical tale of how fame and fortune can corrupt the mind and alter your motives. In this case, this is conveyed through Tommy DeVito who founded the band. But as their popularity increases, his aspirations in life change which may not be for the betterment of the group. The dramatic traits that are embedded into the narrative just work well. The members were emotionally involving and incredibly acted. Considering the majority of the cast were newcomers, it worked in Eastwood's favour. Plus, John Lloyd Young is a revelation. An absurdly talented actor. Eastwood's direction was solid once again as he incorporates some fresh ideas, including letting the characters look at the camera and directly address the audience. I do wish certain aspects of Valli's life were explored more deeply, particularly the death of his daughter. Should've made more of an impact, but instead seemed to have been brushed away as soon as it happens. Then we come to the musical aspect, which just doesn't work. It's not electrifying. It's not uplifting. It's just there. The only time it works is at the end where they are singing in the street. That is what a musical is about! If you are using real songs from a real band, make it the main attraction! Get me standing up and singing the lyrics from the top of my lungs...sadly, it's not executed in that way. So the drama isn't powerful, and the musicality isn't exciting. Watchable, but not very memorable.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Valli of tears,"I had really wanted to see the original stage musical instead but welcomed the chance to see the film version although I did have my reservations, particularly over the choice of Clint Eastwood as director and the use of unknowns in the lead singing parts. I'm afraid both my qualms proved valid and I ended up not enjoying the movie as much as I expected to.The story of the Four Seasons background rise to fame wasn't that well-known beforehand I guess, but even though it has its intrigues and tragedies, it doesn't feel strong enough on which to hang a narrative, not helped, as I said, by the rather character-less actors who get to play the individual group members. Yes, there's a bit of scandal, criminality, infidelity and even death occurring along the way, but these seem to slow down the action somewhat an never really engage the viewer's attention. I also felt that too few songs were used - where were ""Let's Hang On"", ""I've Got You Under My Skin"", ""C'mon Marianne"" and others?Octogenarian Eastwood, better known as a jazz-lover struggles to impart the youthfulness and zest of the heady days of the early 60's, plus he gives little sense of the changing times socially and culturally. Indeed the direction is painfully flat at times and frequently goes on for way too long without a musical interlude. The actors fail to transcend their leaden boots and even over-the-top cameos by the likes of Christopher Walken fail to add a spark.As for the music, the songs are great, the singing and staging of same, less so. The decision to run Valli's solo hit ""My Eyes Adored You"" is reluctantly forced into the plot, even though it was actually recorded several years after the main time-frame essayed here.I do wish I had nicer things to say about the film, but the simple truth is it just doesn't fly at all. I'll still go to the theatre to see the stage-show if it ever hits my town, but I'm afraid this rather routine Hollywood bio-pic seems to me to rather fail it's subject.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The Musical turned into a movie.,"I have to stay I love the music by the four seasons. In fact, I love all the things from the sixties. On top of that, I appreciate Clint Eastwood and I think he's a great director. I also saw the musical in London twice and I thought it was spectacular. So how could I write a review when it's obvious that my expectations were sky high?Unfortunately, as it happens in these cases, I must admit that I was expecting a better movie. Clint Eastwood should have directed this without sticking to the musical so much. What works for a stage act doesn't have to work for a movie and vice versa. One thing I disliked for instance is having the actors directly look at the camera between or during scenes to comment on what was happening. That looked really weird to me. I want the story telling to do that, not a guy giving a speech!On a positive note, I think the actors were very well casted. The guy who interprets Frankie Valli has a wonderful voice (if that voice is his), Christopher Walken is just as good as usual, and makes every scene feel that little bit better. The rest of the crew was spot on as well.But who cares about all this anyway? This movie is all about music. And it is so enjoyable! So, if you can't make it to the theater for the musical, then at least go to the cinema just to appreciate some of the best sounds from the sixties!",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Vidiot Reviews...,"Jersey BoysThe best part of a Doo-Wop group is there are no instruments to lug around.However, the voices in this musical-drama do have baggage.Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young), a gifted vocalist from New Jersey, teams with Tommy (Vincent Piazza) Bob (Erich Bergen) and Nick (Michael Lomenda) to start a singing group.Relegated to back-up singing, the boys struggle to get their single Sherry heard. When the song is heard, it sets off a chain-reaction of number one hits.Regrettably, when Tommy's debt to a Jersey gangster (Christopher Walken) is called in, Frankie must make a tough choice.While the hits are here, the versions in Clint Eastwood's adaptation of the Broadway Musical about The Four Seasons are as lifeless and boring as the script.Besides, why pay $20 to see actors imitating an old Doo-Wop group, when you can see the actual Doo-Wop group at the casino for $15?Red Lightvidiotreviews.blogspot.ca",4.0,Anonymous,Music
A Melodious treat,"Jersey Boys is a musical drama film directed by Clint Eastwood, based on the 2004 Tony Award-winning jukebox musical of the same name.

Due to increasing popularity, they become victims of several mafia threats, gambling debts and family disasters.The best part of the film is it's director the Legend Clint Eastwood who has made this film with utmost dedication and rather than focusing only the rise and fall of the group focuses on the major part of their journey from start till end as few people including me knew nothing about Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons history. The only little drawback i felt was the length of the film along with it's pace which gets really slow in between and the viewers might get disconnected from the film for a while.Acting in the film is good and almost all of them were impressive with Christopher Walken being the most impressive of them all.Screenplay of the film is slow yet decent and music is melodious, BGM of the film is effective and cinematography also impresses.

"Nothing new to see, but good watch","Frankly, I didn't know anything about The Four Seasons. I've heard the name, some songs, but show tunes bands aint for me. For a guy growing up with hevy metal and grunge, hearing Frankie Vialli's falsetto was like hearing cats... make love (IMDB doesnt like profanity). But there's something in here. I've seen dozens of music biographies, and there's nothing new here. Nevertheless, Clint Eastwood has done something genious. Jersey Boys is based on a musical, and 3/4 of the group consists of the Broadway actors who have played the roles for several years. That brings autenticity, and it removes famous actors. In fact, the only one I recognised was Christopher Walken. The story is very alike to the rise and fall of The Beatles, more or less. The big difference was that these 4 from Jersey came pretty close to be small time criminals (shown in the most hillarious robbery I've seen). In the end, quality from Clint, even if the music is far from my taste.",7.0,Anonymous,Music

The direction from Clint Eastwood is inspired, has a slight feel of a scorcese film, mainly due to the forth wall been broken by characters talking directly to camera, but I assume this is due to the way the stage production worked. Strong acting by all but Christopher Walken is a scene stealer, all his scenes are the most memorable. Overall a film worth seeing whether your a fan of frankie valli or not as there is probably songs in there you love not knowing they were performed by the four seasons.

Good Mix of Drama and Music,"This film follows the rise of the Four Seasons musical group, focusing especially on the experiences of lead singer Frankie Valli.It is important to note that the band is composed of Italians from the East Coast USA (or Italian-Americans, if you prefer). Despite the fact that it's about musicians, don't expect them to buck the trend of Italian-American stereotypes here. Yes, this is also a movie about the mafia - a mafia musical, if you will.Frankie's life story is good material for the backbone of the film as he goes from local crook to devoted family man to dissolute singer, usually under the noxious influence of his friend and lifelong albatross Tommy DeVito.The film showcases a lot of crime, run-ins with the police, cavorting with the mob, infidelity, and even an untimely death or two. All of this is standard fare for mafia movies and not surprising in this mafia-musical alloy.The music is excellent because the Four Seasons really have a surprisingly broad repertoire of hits to draw from (although I was familiar with many of their songs, I didn't know the band by name, nor did I realise that so many songs in different genres belonged to the same group). The musical parts are tastefully woven into the drama and the closing Bollywood-style dance number was appreciated.Nothing you haven't seen before here here. And since we're talking about an expansive swath of the biographies of four people in around 2 hours, don't expect any particular stage of their lives or event to be covered deeply. Nevertheless, it's a fairly entertaining movie, particularly if you're into the Four Seasons, music history, or just good music.Honourable Mentions: That Thing You Do (1996). Another movie about the rise and fall of a band, this time fictional. Since it deals with a much narrower time frame in the protagonists' lives, it's more organized and tidy. Worth watching if you liked this one.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Good Story/Average Singing,"The film was entertaining, but the lead actor's singing could not compete, in any way, with Frankie Valli's voice. instead of singing close to Franki Valli's inimitable falsetto, his voice sounded, at times, nasal, thin, and hoarse. Every time he sang, I kept wishing that the film had used Frankie Valli's voice instead.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
From the streetlight to the spotlight.,"I know who's the director, but not the actors. Maybe that's the reason the film did not do as expected at the box office. But still theirs performances are not forgettable. Every one of them was amazing, they are the real singers and so the jobs done easily. I mean the filmmaking who understood the story and its characters and delivered accordingly. You might have seen many similar biopics and this is almost the same, but still there's lots to inspire from what you see.Since this music genre is different compared to the todays trend in the music industry, this film quite clearly brings back the 50s, 60s eras for us. So that's how this story appeals to its viewers. It was about the four member music band and their journey through the success and struggles for decades. What inspires is that, they are nothing like we see in todays musicians like drugs and sex stuffs. But the story had its share in those things, which might have been a huge for that time.The family, friends and music, the films very beautifully defines the differences. Between professional and personal life, how they lose grips is what obviously we see regularly in all the musician's biopics, but I'm talking about 50 years ago society and lifestyle. The things are different and how they managed or did they is the film to reveal. I really liked it and I wanted to rate higher, but I was bored a bit because it was a very long film. The pace was okay, so I managed and I think it is worth a watch, but only for the selected audience.7/10",7.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the biggest disappointments of the year,"The Good: I love Jersey Boys, it's one of my all time favourite stage musicals. And when I heard the cast was mainly Broadway stars, I was excited. And these guys did really well bringing their characters to life. The musical renditions are well performed too, Sherry was a highlight and some of the songs fit really well into the story.The Bad: The biggest problem with the film is when you compare it to it's source material. The stage show is really fun, very funny and exciting. The film however tries to keep it grounded, and in doing so the film was really boring! A lot of that comes from the directing: Clint Eastwood was the wrong choice to direct, it needed someone who could bring the energy of the stage show to the screen and he failed to do that. A lot of the songs, although well performed, seem to stop the movie just to have a musical number that has no semblance to the plot. Lastly, of all the actors in the film that do well, Christopher Walken does not. None of his lines sound natural and he sticks out like a sore thumb, easily one of the worst casting choices in the film.The Verdict: Despite some good acting, good music and staying true to the plot of the stage show, it couldn't keep me awake for me to enjoy. Not what I expect from the best musical in recent history.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Don't believe the hype,"I'm perfectly willing to admit that I may be wrong. I've never seen Frankie Valli live. but it seems to me that the movie totally missed the essence of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. I always felt that, whatever flaws were in their singing voices was more than made up for by the absolute joy and feeling in their performances. In the movie, the was a noticeable lack of any feeling in the music. Add that to a choppy story lacking any sense of timing, and Jersey Boys is a pretty mediocre movie.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Life's Soundtrack,"I knew going in that Clint Eastwood was not going to do this movie as a standard musical. (The French might like the movie better this way, though the final credits do run over a musical street scene in which even Chris Walken's Godfather-type character dances in the chorus.)At more than two hours, this movie still has to turn many of the events in the character's lives into highlighted moments. For example, the tragedy of Frankie Valli's daughter, Francine, is obviously a movie all by itself, but this movie only has time to suggest rather than explore it.It is surprising that the movie does try to be more than just the ""Frankie Valli Story,"" giving some attention to the other members of the group. One of the ways we get more of them than we might have is the technique of having them talk to the camera. It makes the viewer conscious of the play for a moment, but then the story--and the music--draws us back in, and we know something more than we might have otherwise.There are other ways the movie makes us realize that it is a little bit the Tommy-Bob-and-Nick story, too. For example, we find out what it was like for Nick to room with Tommy for what he describes as a ten-year jail sentence, and I never thought I would find out Bob's story behind the song ""December, 1963 (What a Lady, What a Night)"" (but I never thought I needed to know).There are delightful characters along the way such as record producer and sometime co-songwriter Bob Crewe. Walken is good as the mob boss who made sure that Valli didn't get in too much trouble. Also, while the band members do not seem to age much during the 1960s and early 1970s, the make up on their appearances in 1990 are pretty spectacular. (That is, they don't seem fake.)Most of all, this movie uses lots of the Four Seasons' music, reminding me that even though I was never a big fan at the time, they were nevertheless the soundtrack to more of my own life than I had realized. I can remember like it was a minute ago, driving along the Kancamagus Highway in New Hampshire in 1962 between my father at the wheel and older brother riding shotgun and ""Sherry"" beaming into our car radio from WBZ in Boston.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An Excellent homage to the 4 Four Seasons,"I'll say it right off, if you're looking for the energy of the Stage show you will not find here. The closest they came was the Cast Call at the end, it may very well have been the best part of the movie.That considered, it is otherwise a totally enjoyable movie. The cast was excellent, as were the direction and editing. The period was captured well' It is a period piece about an iconic vocal group of the 60's-70's. Taken as such it was done well and presented a top vocal group in a rapidly evolving era in music. A group that evolved in a different direction from the prevalent psychedelic direction of the time.I didn't think we would see much of a crowd there and I was correct, and those who were there lived through the period. This was not a young crowd and I doubt there will much interest from the younger age groups.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"If you like musicals, and The Four Seasons, you'll probably really enjoy it.","'JERSEY BOYS': Four Stars (Out of Five)Film adaptation of the popular (Tony Award-winning) jukebox musical (of the same name); based on the history of the 1960s pop group The Four Seasons. Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice wrote the screenplay (and the musical book it's based on) and Clint Eastwood directed the movie. John Lloyd Young reprises his role, from the musical, as Frankie Valli (and does all of his own singing). He's joined by actors Vincent Piazza, Erich Bergen and Michael Lomenda as the rest of The Four Seasons (Christopher Walken also plays a big role in the movie). I found it to be a little too long and clichéd at times but entertaining enough (especially with the great music).The story begins with the four young singers starting out as a 'boy band' in the 1950s and follows their many years of touring, recording, breakup and reunion (decades later). It focuses on the different singers struggling with family relationships, friendship drama and mafia trouble (due to large debt accrued by one member). It pays special attention to the bond between Frankie Valli (Young) and Tommy DeVito (Piazza). Different band members narrate different parts of the story (by talking directly to the camera).I've never seen the musical, and didn't really know anything about it's story (prior to seeing the film), but I've heard it's much better than this movie. As a film the story is definitely pretty cheesy and clichéd at times. It's still really entertaining though. It's hard to see why Eastwood wanted to direct it and his presence, at the helm, is hard to detect (while watching it). Still the music is beautiful and watching it come to life is pretty moving. The performances are decent enough and Walken does shine throughout. It's too long, and would be much better cut to less than 2 hours, but if you like musicals, and The Four Seasons, you'll probably really enjoy it.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiVvdUZDgQc",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Enjoyed the live play much better,"We've seen Jersey Boys in NYC 6 times (we live in PA). The movie was disappointing to us because it seemed the characters weren't developed as well. We couldn't get into their characters/personalities as much. Their little cute/funny lines fell flat because of this. What happened at the place in Detroit was a surprise from Gaudio to Frankie in the play...even made me cry. It was not the same in the movie. Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed the movie, and I imagine people who never saw the stage play might absolutely love it. It is kind of like reading a book before seeing a movie. Most people like the book better, but some the other way around. I'm very happy that someday when the stage play is done, there will be a movie to watch forever.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Oh what a night; Eastwood does it again,"When I saw ""Jersey Boys"" on stage I thought it would make a great film, a gift for Martin Scorsese; think ""Goodfellas"" as a musical minus the killings. Now it's finally, and somewhat inevitably, reached the screen but under the guidance of Clint Eastwood, who also knows a thing or two about this sort of milieu; think a New Jersey ""Mystic River"" as a musical minus the killings, and I can safely say he has done it proud. Of course, Scorsese and Eastwood are two very different kinds of director. Scorsese, now in his seventies, is still the fly-boy, a super kinetic director of in-your-face entertainments. Eastwood, now in his eighties, has always been something of a classicist, a film-maker in the Howard Hawks mold whose films don't necessarily draw attention to themselves. I think this is why he is the most underrated of all the great American directors and it may be one reason why the critics have given ""Jersey Boys"" a rather lukewarm reception. Even I had my doubts that Eastwood still had it in him, that he could pull the rabbit out of the hat one more time. I needn't have worried, ""Jersey Boys"" is terrific; a full-blooded, thoroughly old fashioned biopic that totally transcends the term 'jukebox musical'.It is, of course, the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, or rather The Four Seasons, the band that included Valli, and who rose to inclusion in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame despite their connections to the Mob. In some respects it's a gangster musical along the lines of ""Love Me or Leave Me"" but with a rock n'roll slant. It's not perfect; there is still a soap-opera feel to some of the more emotional moments but luckily these are dealt with reasonably quickly. For the most part it zips along buoyed by a handful of highly credible performances.John Lloyd Young recreates his Tony award winning performance as Valli. He's great in the musical scenes but his lack of experience as a serious actor tells as the drama progresses, (for here was a band that didn't just have to worry about breaking up but maybe even staying alive). On the other hand, Vincent Piazza, Michael Lomenda and Erich Bergen are all excellent as fellow band members, (Piazza, in particular, is superb), and Christopher Walken, as always, raises the bar with what is basically a glorified cameo as an old-time Jersey gangster. And then there are those songs, which are still some of the best in the pop canon and which, thanks to this marvelous show, have now been given a new lease of life. Oh, what a night!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Should have been better,"we saw the London stage production of Jersey Boys and it was one of the best stage show I've seen in 30 years of theatre going. I also love music from the 50's and 60's including the 4 Seasons songs. And I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood who produced and directed this, so all the boxes are ticked to really enjoy the film and give it a 9 or 10.......and I wish I could. The simple reason(s) I can't is the awful singing of John Lloyd Young who plays Frankie Valli. Now the focal point of the story is FV's amazing voice that was the ticket out of new jersey for this group , but in this film at times he sounds like he has been sucking helium from a balloon! now this is bad enough but considering that when this became apparent they could simply have had the actors dubbed by the original songs this is criminal. Add in some other problems like the makeup as the actors age being awful and you have a deeply disappointing film. Mr Eastwood needs to take the blame for this major gaffe.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
The Music Uplifts the Story,"""The Jersey Boys"" brings us all back to the early 1960s, young Francis Castelluccio, a hairdresser's apprentice with a unique high falsetto singing voice, takes on the name Frankie Valli. Together with a couple of petty criminals named Tommy DeVito and Nick Massi, they would sing in small gigs around town, going nowhere, except in jail when caught. When they meet a hot singer-songwriter named Bob Gaudio, they called themselves the Four Seasons and started a hot streak of Number One hits on the radio. However, their connections to the mob and loan sharks lead to strains within the group and their families.It is the timeless music of the Four Seasons that keep this rather heavy-handed biopic afloat. It was hard to imagine that this film gets its origins from a successful original Broadway musical. Director Clint Eastwood takes things a little too seriously. It actually lacked excitement, humor and joy until they break into those unforgettable hit songs such as ""Sherry"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"".It was strange that they play ""My Eyes Adored You"" (a solo Number One hit for Valli in 1975) before we see Valli perform his first solo hit, the Number 2 song ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You."" It was also odd to hear that the producers at that time considered the very catchy ""Can't"" to be an experimental song that was unlikely to be a hit.The four lead actors were unknown to me. They were supposed to have sung these songs themselves which is very impressive. The actor who played Frankie Valli is John Lloyd Young, who actually won a Tony for this same role in Broadway. His singing voice is unmistakably similar in quality to Valli's, and his singing scenes were glorious. However, he did look a bit old to play a 16-year old at the start. Also, in the non-singing parts, his theatrical style of acting was too dour and mannered for the big screen.Doing better were the other three guys in the group. I liked the way Eastwood made them relate the story to the audience while they were still in the scene, like breaking the fourth wall. Vincent Piazza did not originate from the stage version, but he really shone as the rouge Tommy. Michael Lomenda had his musical and serio-comic moments as the deep-voiced Nick. However, the most potent screen charisma was from Erich Bergen as the clean-cut Bob.I was surprised that the local Film Classification Board rated this film as PG when there are a lot of profanity, suggestions of drug abuse and scenes of sexual nature. These will be a bit awkward for parents who bring their kids in to watch. However, it is the music that will remain to be the most memorable aspect of this film. Their final performance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990 was electric (despite the bad aging make-up). I wanted to stand up and cheer. I positively loved the scene at the end credits set to the tune of ""Oh What a Night"", which looked like an actual stage curtain call. These final moments certainly buoyed up the whole film and left a good lasting impression and last song syndrome.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Outstanding movie,"Growing up during the time of the Four Seasons and enjoying their music, even today, could of been an influence in my rating. Having said that, I have seen it twice and may go again. The audience response, each time, was exceptional with applause. Everyone I talked to had favorite comments and many said they were also coming back to see it again. The music was great, the acting was superb, the actors were all great in their characters they were playing. Direction by Clint Eastwood was perfect and it ended up being one of those rare ""feel good movies"". It was a movie that had many funny scenes and even a few that brought tears to your eyes.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"My eyes adored for this musical, so walk like a man and see how fun Jersey Boys is.","I'll tell you a high school story from only a few years ago (okay, more like eight, but why count?); In an American history class in the eleventh grade, I had a teacher who wanted put as little pressure on his students as possible, even though he had everyone stand in military fashion, being a Vietnam veteran himself. So almost every morning before the bell would ring, he always had his favorite group playing on his stereo. This is where I was first introduced to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.Sure, I heard ""Walk Like a Man"" play in my dad's car every now and then, but my teacher really liked these guys. He always had a new song playing to gives us something to snap to and even told us a little about the band. There's not a memory that flashes by with that class without a Four Seasons song playing in the background. I too fell into the music of this group. They may not be a timeless band, but their sound is so unique that it's impossible not to identify them. Clint Eastwood decided to take a stab not just at the biopic genre, but also the musical genre with his latest, Jersey Boys.Like most musical movies these days, this is based off of the popular Broadway musical of the same name, yet I have not had the privilege to see it yet. But I can guess that it follows it well. Fittingly enough, our story starts in the early fifties where Tommy DeVito (played by Vincent Piazza) speaks to the audience about how growing up on the wrong side of the tracks in New Jersey is tough and only the roughest can survive. Rough is being kind to this young man as Tommy has a bad habit of getting himself sent to jail many times. He also has some musical talent as he, a friend Nick Massi and young Frankie Valli (played by John Lloyd Young) like to perform as a trio.They all have dreams to take their voice to bigger places and manages to get a forth guy, Bob Gaudio so that they can get work. It starts with them being backup singers, but eventual hits like ""Sherry"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"", and ""Walk Like a Man"" make them one of the biggest groups of all time. Besides giving plenty of chances for the group to serenade us with many of their hits, we get insights on the band members lives from Frankie Valli's daughter running away to Tommy's further troubles with debts and mobs.The Broadway show's gimmick was that you were watching four actors become the Four Seasons and enjoy their songs while the historical stuff is more of a side event. Making a movie out of this isn't difficult, but changes had to be made to make the material more interesting. With Clint Eastwood in the director's chair, the historical stuff has been expanded upon, taking more focus then the songs themselves.It's a big gamble, considering that the men playing the Four Seasons are the same actors from the stage show. The good news is that all of these guys are good film actors. This is something I would like to see from more big budgeted affairs, but because they're using really good unknowns, I only saw a young Frankie Valli and a young Tommy DeVito, rather then impersonators. In fact, the only big name is this movie is Christopher Walken as a mobster, but he even settles into his role fine, without giving in to his unusual mannerisms. The songs themselves are a lot of fun to listen to and are staged really well. Some of them are being sung in a recording room, some of them are simply heard on the radio, and my favorite moment was watching them perform on a recreated Ed Sullivan show that just seems too genuine to be a film production.If I had any problem here, it's with the expanded behind the scenes material with the Four Seasons. While its not really bad, it can come off as really formulaic and almost made-for-TV like in quality. I think it's simply because I enjoyed the songs and recreations so much that the rest of the bands troubles just aren't as interesting. They could have cut some of it out. In fact, I usually fault musicals for having one too many songs, but I think Jersey Boys didn't have enough. There are a lot of songs here, but couldn't there have been a scene of Frankie Valli singing, ""Grease"" or something.I'll give this eight Broadway Jersey Boys posters out of ten. In the end, if your going to see this movie, chances are you seeing this for the performances of the songs and not for the story behind the band. I can see this being a problem for people who want something meatier, but I had fun. Just simply tell yourself to have one of those ""Oh, What a Night"" nights and enjoy the Four Seasons.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Melodramatic, gloomy and moody, Jersey Boys disappoints","Jersey Boys tells the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons as they shot from neighborhood kids to super stars with perfect voices. This a been there, done that affair that rarely catches your attention. Outside some very well acted scenes with Christopher Walken and classic Eastwood framing, Jersey Boys is nothing more than a failed musical adaptation for the big screen. To start, the actors all come from the stage and carry that style of acting to the big screen. Everything is bright and bold in their performances, and the film's cinematography paints a rather dull and dreary sense of reality. The cinematography, while fitting for a thriller of some sorts, its wildly out of place here. That heavy white lighting, foggy filters, that dreadful sensibility we saw in Hereafter and J. Edgar are all carried over into Jersey Boys? It doesn't fit, not in the very least. As far as this being a Clint Eastwood directed picture, it is surprising considering this is just plain and simple, not a good film. Eastwood can definitely direct, we've seen proof of this as he has delivered some instant classics our way...however, Jersey Boys is one of his lesser films. Quite frankly, if this is one of his lesser films, that's okay because this film is far from a train wreck. There are things to like here, some humor sprinkled about and some decent drama keep this from being a total wash up but overall, is this the film everyone wanted it to be? Not by a long shot. The film feels long and under cooked and never really goes to where Dreamgirls or Rent took us. Jersey Boys is not a great film, it is barely even decent but if you are a fan of the Broadway musical, you may let it slide.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
lifeless drama,"It's 1951 Belleville, New Jersey. Tommy DeVito is a hustler. Frankie Valli is the sweet front man with the angelic voice. Along with Tommy's brother Nicky, they are the Variety Trio. They try to steal a safe and get caught. The DeVitos take the fall for Frankie. Everybody takes it easy on Frankie as the DeVitos go in and out of prison. Connected guy Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken) loves Frankie's singing and watches out for him. Frankie marries brassy girl Mary Delgado. The actor Joe Pesci introduces singer songwriter Bob Gaudio to the group. With Nick Massi, the group is eventually named ""The Four Seasons"" as they climb the charts.The biggest problem is the lack of charisma from the leads. They don't have the special personality to break out of the screen. Honestly, it's too easy for them to fade into the background. I'd rather not have the singing ability and have somebody with stronger screen presences. The most memorable part of the movie is stealing the safe. There is a general lifelessness about the movie. Some people may overlook everything for the music or the play. The split between Frankie and Tommy is probably the most compelling part of the plot. The movie should have zero in on that relationship like a laser beam.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

If you never saw the stage play, you probably will enjoy it more. If you have seen the play, save your money and wait for the DVD. On stage, it was exciting to hear the songs. Watching the movie, you keep hoping to hear the real Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons voices on the soundtrack. Tries real hard, but just doesn't transfer well to the screen.

the voice ruins it for me,"First let me say I really do not want to trash anyone or anything. That being said, I have to say the voice used for Frankie, whom ever it is, is keeping me from enjoying this movie. I had been debating with myself as to whether I wanted to continue watching.I was born and raised in the 50's and 60's, and this is nowhere near Frankie Valli's voice. What a completely wrong choice for this in my opinion. I am also an ex vocalist/entertainer myself, and had been for over 40 years, and the sound track contains a very high, unusually shrill vocal portraying Frankie, and although Frankie did have an unusually high voice for the time, he had a pleasing, not ear shattering voice, nor was it shrill.I also found too much concentration on the ""hoodlum"" aspect, and not enough on the music and the music experience itself. I know this is most likely not going to be considered a positive review, but it is not meant in any way to be mean spirited, nor in any other way, except as an opinion.Enough said, and I am sorry. <3",1.0,Anonymous,Music
"Boy from the streets of Newark, NJ hits the big time!","Though I was born and raised in NYC, I am a Jersey Girl, having spent almost half of my life in the ""Garden State."" Clint Eastwood's new film, JERSEY BOYS closely follows the stage play of the same name, including the device of having lead characters face the camera uttering asides to the audience to move the plot along with personal observations revealing some unsaid impressions. Unfortunately the movie is filled with the clichés that foster the stereotypes of a strong NJ Mafia/mob-controlled existence; a large Italian populace speaking with strong Joisey accents, girlfriends treated like chattel - mothers like worshipful angels; teenagers pulling off minor felonies, rotating in and out of jail as if it were a cakewalk none the worse for their ""time"" in prison.In the midst of this milieu which is filmed with a real nostalgic 1950's feel - we meet a ""saintly"" young man from Newark, NJ, Frankie Valli (born Francesco Stephen Castelluccio) whose voice charms all those who know him, bringing out their protective instincts to ""save"" this young man from the recklessness of the city's ""evil streets"", in order to preserve his vocal chords for posterity. The law enforcement community is complicit in being prescient ( though not judicious) in allowing potential talent to trump criminal mischief. John Lloyd Young does an adequate job as Frankie Valli, but I was not drawn to this actor who lacked charisma, OR his wondrous voice with its high falsetto screech which began to feel mannered and much too predictable.JERSEY BOYS deals with the personal interactions of 4 young men who group together, eventually becoming The Four Seasons to ""make it"" in the music business and by the looks of it - their rise to success came pretty smoothly, so any drama in this biopic is ancillary to familiar songs and performances that are the movie's highlights. Yes there is the humdrum boredom of traveling to gigs and back, sacrificing one's family in the process of building a career to ultimately achieve fame and fortune as well as the unmitigated bully - the founder of the group Tommy DeVito - a roguish Vincent Piazza - who is the ""satan"" to the celestial young Valli - being both his benefactor and his tormentor.Eastwood cast many unknown actors - none of which stood out for me, except for an easy- going natural performance by Christopher Walken; his demeanor on the screen had presence - lots of it - and I looked forward to watching an old pro use barely perceptible facial reflexes, and the flourish of a hand to convey a wide range of attitudes. To appear in a scene with Walken lamentably made the other actors look like pallid amateurs - like placing a Leonardo Da Vinci next to a Thomas Kincade painting.JERSEY BOYS is basically about time - time gone by - a visual clue being a short clip of the virile Clint Eastwood in a scene from a much earlier western playing on the boxy TV in a hotel room. Eastwood can be a great director (Million Dollar Baby, Mystic River, Gran Torino etc.) and has worked with period pieces in the past, but they were infused with a beautiful insight into the darkness and lightness of being. This musical, on the other hand is slight, and weightless, BUT still worthwhile, bringing to an audience - particularly whose who lived in the 1960's and '70's - joy and entertainment through a sentimental journey evoking memories that have floated deep into the past. Like a Proust madeleine - the songs Sherry, Can't Take My Eyes Off You, Walk Like A Man, Big Girls Don't Cry transported me to my youth dancing cheek to cheek with my first love the tall and handsome Richie, when the world was full of possibilities and everything was imaginable and credible.(Note: Frankie Valli is one of the Executive Producers of the movie.)",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"An acceptable movie, but it needed a lot of work to be done.","The last scene of ""Jersey Boys"" is a curtain call of sorts. Set to The Four Seasons' memorable ode to deflowering, ""December, 1963,"" the scene explodes with bright, noisy colors and jubilant voices. It hops from character to character, visually name-checking the entire cast as they sing and dance. The camera-work, editing and lighting foster a genuine sense of excitement. In this finale, ""Jersey Boys"" feels like the Broadway musical upon which it is based, showcasing the energy and joy that continues to leap off the stage every night in venues from Las Vegas to London.If only director Clint Eastwood had directed more scenes like this. He ensured his cast would be up to the task by importing several veterans from the stage. Three of the Four Seasons cast in ""Jersey Boys"" are from various incarnations of the show, including Tony-winner John Lloyd Young, whose Frankie Valli is vocally spot-on and a force to behold. Christopher Walken, no slouch to musicals, is also on hand, doing a bit of a soft-shoe in the aforementioned finale. His performance definitely is very worthy out of all the actors involved. Even ""Boardwalk Empire"" vet Vincent Piazza, as group member Tommy DeVito, holds his own with the more musically seasoned members of The Four Seasons.The singing talent is there, but Eastwood and writers Marshall Brickman (""Annie Hall"") and Rick Elise opt for a more realistic depiction of events. They transform ""Jersey Boys"" from jukebox musical to movie biopic, exchanging one much-maligned genre for another. In the process, the focus is shifted; the drama is played up and the music seems shoehorned in where convenient.This imbalance is forgivable in scenes where the band deals with talent scout Joe Pesci (yes, that Joe Pesci, here in the guise of actor Joey Russo) or interact with one another. The problems arise in the mob-related material, which is seemingly endless. These plot elements are necessary to tell the full story, but the lazy way they are depicted stops the movie cold. We've already seen ""GoodFellas,"" ""Mean Streets"" and any number of mob-related tales, so Eastwood's take on them feels lifeless. As the catalyst for most of these scenes, Piazza wrings his derivative character for all that he's worth. But Walken, as mob boss Gyp DeCarlo, is given little to do besides commit scene-stealing grand larceny in a weepy moment opposite Young's Valli.""Jersey Boys"" keeps the show's conceit of having each of the Four Seasons tell various aspects of the story. Tommy, Frankie, Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen) break the fourth wall at various points to talk to us directly. Since Tommy is both the band's heart and its downfall, he figures into everyone's narrative. Songwriter Gaudio becomes the band's primary songwriter because Tommy acted on a tip from Joe Pesci. Frankie sharpens and perfects his famous falsetto with Tommy's help. And Nick rooms with Tommy for 10 years and sees the worst sides of him.Whether they're singing or fighting, ""Jersey Boys"" is at its best when it focuses on the band members' chemistry. The actors know their characters' voices well enough to effortlessly plow through as many Four Seasons songs as the original musical contains. They sound spectacular, and there's enough of each song to satiate fans and newbies alike. But Eastwood shoots so many of these numbers in a matter-of-fact, almost documentary style, static way that the two times he really cuts loose are the film's best moments. The second time is the curtain call finale; the first is Young's hauntingly emotional rendering of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You."" If you know the song, you'll know what the big mid-number reveal is. Eastwood presents it with stunning gusto, and the reaction Valli gets at the end is as close to a stand-up-and-cheer moment as ""Jersey Boys"" gets.Though no longer playing to the back of the house, Young, Bergen and Lomenda still have a tendency to go big in front of the camera. It's most noticeable opposite Piazza's Tommy, who despite his stereotype-ridden role gives the best performance in ""Jersey Boys."" Yet the vocal talent trumps any minor performance issues incurred. The filmmakers made the right decisions for the leads. This movie will sell many soundtracks.The elephant in the room is Eastwood himself. He is the wrong director for this material, and this opinion comes from someone who loved ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Space Cowboys"" and even those orangutan movies. He is the wrong choice, but not for the reason you think. Eastwood is adept at handling music in films, from ""Bird"" to his country music homage to Garbo's ""Camille,"" ""Honkytonk Man"" (which I also like without shame). But, for once, I have to agree with those who say his style is too laid back. A movie as grungy, profane and blue-collar as ""Jersey Boys"" needs to feel more alive. When the music's not playing, ""Jersey Boys"" starts to lull you into mild lethargy. I wonder what fellow Jersey Boy Brian De Palma could have done with this.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
fun if conventional bio-pic,"Jersey Boys isn't quite as 'not that impressive' as the critics said (I don't want to say 'bad'). Still, this tale of how Frankie Valli (not his real name) and Tommy De Vito formed the Four Seasons is still fairly clichéd, especially the character of De Vito as a total one dimensional Sopranos bit player (no relation to the Goodfellas character, though more interestingly Joe Pesci IS a character in the movie as a supporting role). And yet there is nothing wrong with the actor, Vincent Piazza (also seen on Boardwalk Empire) and on the contrary gives it his all and commits to the character, as is everyone else in their respective roles.Actually Valli (and John Lloyd Young's mostly restrained for a musical bio-pic performance, with enough to really carry the movie for long stretches) is a fairly complex character. I keep saying character as its a movie person after all. But Frankie ultimately has to juggle a lot of allegiances and responsibility and problems (with himself as well) and heartache. It's a good biopic-musical with standard direction from Clint. I don't know what he did for the movie to make it stand out from another director except that he has a consistent knack for setting up the camera and getting out of the way... which at times makes it a little too conventionally shot, but it's fine, I was never bored and the songs and performers keep things enjoyable.I can't compare it to the musical but another comment is that the actors all have a generally theatrical quality (aside from Walken, who is a very welcome presence here and actually pulls off an interesting mob character not just a walk on, I think they're from the actual musical), which has its ups and downs. Also must be noted while the fourth-wall-talking is nothing new it works, maybe in part as it comes from a script by Annie Hall writer Marshall Brickman. Guess if you're going to do that again, get the guy who is one of the best at fourth-wall-smart-talk.Again, not great, but not any boring disaster as I maybe slightly expected, and its old fashioned quality (take out the cursing and it could have fit in the 1950s) is fine too... I keep using the word 'fine'. maybe that's all Eastwood aims to be, but I can't help but see him sneaking in some artistic flourishes (there's one shot that ascends an exterior building of a record company and we hear and see all sorts of music going on floor to floor, and its a great 'moment out of time').",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Quality movie from a quality Director,"A very entertaining American success story brought to life under the gentle and skilled hand of Eastwood.The movie follows the Four Seasons from their teens up through their sixties and the work they had to do to reach the top of their profession while giving some insights on the hard knocks in the recording industry.Things I would add, none.Things I would subtract from the movie, none.My 15 year old daughter spent the rest of the day playing 4 Seasons songs on her I-pod and learned to sing a few. ""Why don't they make songs like this anymore""?Why only 8 stars, just to leave a little room for the next movie of the decade.I strongly recommend this movie for the entire family, and would be sure to choose a theater with a good sound system.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Very disappointed!,"OK, here's the deal. Went to the Broadway stage production of Jersey Boys. It was incredible. In fact, I went a second time because it was so well done. A very tight, professional and incredible performance. And this was in Albuquerque, NM! The movie doesn't even come close to measuring up. Save your $10 and see something worthwhile. The movie was very poorly done. Off key singing, dance steps out of sync, a horn section that is just annoying, and the acting was less than desirable. A very big disappointment seeing how the movie had the opportunity to get it right by doing take after take after take, while the stage production has only one shot at getting it right. Clint Eastwood swung and missed on this one.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome,"The movie gave a more personal perspective compare to the play. Did not have the high energy. The acting was great and the story even better. The second half of the movie kept you on the edge of your seat. Christopher Walkin played a superb, cool headed role. Consideration for an academy role for supporting actor. As in most of the super groups, you have one pompous bone head. In this case it was Tommy Divito. Valli and Gaudio showed class and loyalty. Bob Gaudio was a very talented artist with the group and his other assignments. If you had seen the play, need to see the movie to get the indept story behind the ups and downs of the group.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Nostalgia,"I have a feeling that the appeal of this film to Clint Eastwood wasn't narrative but the evocation of the time of his youth, the music, the people, and the setting. Through movies like Gran Torino and Space Cowboys, it was obvious that Eastwood was looking at the contemporary world with contempt, and Jersey Boys allowed him time to simply disappear into that past he yearned for, at least for a time. That desire to evoke the era seems to have been the only thing that really ignited his imagination because the end product ends up being another example of a musical biopic gone wrong, of a Broadway production's narrative falling apart once it hits another medium.That being said, I found the first half of Jersey Boys to be really quite fun. The tale of how Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young), Bobby Gaudio (Erich Bergen), Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda), and Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) came together in their youths to form the Four Seasons is a loose but rollickingly good time. Frankie and Tommy, in particular, are borderline hoods with only a handful of choices of how to get out of their neighborhood in Jersey, and they want to pursue fame, especially with Frankie's unique voice. After playing a series of little clubs to limited success, Tommy brings in Bobby to write their music, and it's the key they need to unlock success. From Frankie's courtship of Mary (Renee Marino) to the effort to follow up on their demo tapes in New York to their discovery by Bob Crewe (Mike Doyle) and their opening tours, the movie has a light and fun feel that is really enjoyable to watch.The problem really is the second half where things have to turn serious.The characters are sketched well enough in the first half to support a lot of dramatic stuff to follow, including the pretty much totally cliched way the band decides to fall apart, but it can't support stuff coming out of left field and entering the narrative three-quarters of the way through. Tommy has been accumulating huge personal debts to the mob, the wing headed by Gyp (Christopher Walken) with the enforcer Norm (Donnie Kehr) looking to collect no matter what. The film has to literally stop and do a flashback to give the full picture of what's going on (although there were hints of it earlier like the Four Lovers, as they were called at the time, being unable to perform at a bowling alley because Tommy had built up bad debt to the chagrin of the alley's owner). And, the flashback happens during their appearance at the Ed Sullivan Show, so instead of giving us this buildup to a high emotional moment that has to balance with a sudden threat to not only Tommy but the whole band, we have to take a break for a few minutes to watch them play at the Ohio State Fair where they get thrown in jail by local police for Tommy's running out on a hotel bill from a year earlier.So much of the final half hinges on Frankie feeling it necessary to take on Tommy's debts for the sake of the band, and I didn't really understand why, especially since the band immediately falls apart. Nick leaves completely to go back home to his wife. Tommy gets shuttled off to Las Vegas by the mob to keep an eye on him. That leaves Frankie and Bobby, and Bobby doesn't want to perform anymore, he just wants to write. So, it becomes Frankie alone on the road to help pay Tommy's debts. It's such a huge decision, and Frankie honestly doesn't get enough time to really justify it in any way. It just happens. He's on the road for years paying off another man's debts, and it keeps him even further apart from his family.And that's the emotional core of the second half, Frankie trying to connect with his family through it all, and it's incredibly underwritten. If it were about his relationship with Mary, it might have worked since we had several scenes of them together throughout the film, but it's actually about Frankie's relationship with his eldest daughter Francine (Freya Tingley). She just appears as a child in one scene during one of Frankie's few trips back home, and she barely says anything at all, the focus is on Mary. She's a non-entity until Mary calls him saying that Francine had disappeared from the house, and Frankie goes home to try and help. He gets a scene where he finds her in the city and imparts some brief, thin advice on how to make it in the music business since that's her dream (which hadn't come up before that conversation, pretty much that line of dialogue), and that becomes the emotional hook of the film except...we never see her again because she dies. Really, she has one late scene with Frankie that's odd at best, and then the whole rise to independent fame through the release of ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" is dependent on it emotionally. The second half of this film really falls flat on its face.The first half is fun with all of the rise in power and music, and the second is a complete drag with plot turns and emotional hooks that are all underdeveloped by the time they actually have to come to fruition. Maybe this is a problem with adapting a larger stage play to a slightly more than two-hour long runtime in film, but based on my limited experience with Broadway musicals, I have a feeling that these issues are ingrained in the original material as well.Eastwood did his thing and filmed quickly and efficiently the script he was given. He gave his actors, most of whom originated the roles on Broadway, space to create, and they do well in them. The problems are really at the script level and the need to follow the entire life of Frankie Valli from humble beginnings to his appearance at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. If the emotional hook is really supposed to be Francine's death, then we don't need to see the beginning of the Four Seasons. If the point is supposed to be the history of the Four Seasons, then I'm not sure we need Francine's death. It's a script that simply takes on too much to do anything really effective with it. Still, the first half is actually quite fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent film,"Performances were solid, of course the music was great. Pacing was a bit all over the place. The whole breaking the fourth wall bit was a little awkward, especially for a period piece.

"In Spite of All the Odds, A Solid Film","When I think of New Jersey -- I think Clint Eastwood.When I think of Italians -- I think Clint Eastwood.And when I think of rock and roll -- I think Clint Eastwood.Even with all the obvious handicaps, I was amazed at what an effective movie this was. I was expecting the actors to lip-synch to the actual Four Seasons classics, but instead they do all their own singing (and dancing.) The results aren't always spectacular, but they're always entertaining.I loved the way the movie didn't shy away from the darker side of the Four Seasons' story. (""I just buried a child, Jimmy. I don't want to sing another love song."") I was also pleasantly surprised that one of the key men behind the Four Seasons' musical success was openly gay and was treated with respect by both the screenplay and the other characters. Maybe the biggest surprise for me was how effectively Vincent Piazza adds humor and warmth to the tough as nails Italian gangster type he played so brilliantly for five years on HBO's BOARDWALK EMPIRE.My hand to God, this movie was the best rock and roll musical ever produced by Clint Eastwood -- especially the big song and dance number over the closing credits!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
One of the best biopics made,"Musical biopics that is. And having Clint Eastwood behind the camera is showing. He's not afraid of showing some downsides to the fame the Jersey Boys (you could also use their stage name of course). He's also very open to giving the support guys their moment. It's refreshing to see that there is more to a group than just two guys. And that the other ""characters"" actually have an opinion themselves.The movie is also able to make you sentimental and maybe make you shed a tear or two. There are songs here, that I knew, but had no clue who sang them. A really good orchestrated story with a lot of good music and a sort of sing a long thrown in for good measure. Drama and comedy mix good together and even if there is some heightening here and there, this is really good",9.0,Anonymous,Music
High 6/10,"A Broadway film adaptation about the real-life rock band The Four Seasons. The film is alright. It tells their story and mostly Frankie Valli's life. There is nothing special or similar to other artists' story films like Ray, Bohemian Rhapsody, and Get On Up. It's a neat movie if you are wondering who made the ""I Love You Baby"" song. Nothing much to say about Jersey Boys. The story lacks a bit to flesh out the other characters besides Valli, and the ending was a bit off.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Great soundtrack,"I've never seen the theatre production of Jersey Boys, so saw the movie with an open mind. The first thing to say is that the movie has a great soundtrack. It's hardly surprising bearing in mind some of the songs that the Four Seasons recorded.The movie itself follows the (long) rise to fame of the band and the hurdles they faced. Being from an Italian background the band have to decide whether they want to take their music seriously or fall into a life of petty crime. Vincent Piazza (Tommy) and John Lloyd Young (Frankie Valli)take the lead roles and are engaging throughout. Personally I found the movie a little slow at times and probably would have preferred it if 20 minutes or so would have been edited out. Having said that even when it's slow you know there's always going to be a good tune around the corner.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome film!,"I saw the live stage production a few years ago, and loved it! I was afraid that the film would pale in comparison. Boy was I wrong!

Even though I was too young to see them when they first started, this movie made you feel like you were in the presence of greatness. You also get some info that you didn't know about this group.

Somewhat Disappointing,"Well, I was not TOO excited for this film to begin with (so that may be half the trouble) but even though I wasn't excited, I went and saw it anyway. I must say...the first thirty minutes of the film I was SOOOOOO bored. Then, it began to pick up and and started to gain some momentum and I started getting excited and then......it ended?

Especially the guys who played Frankie Valli and Tommy Devito. And Christopher Walken was a nice bonus as always.Overall though, I felt the film lacked enough energy to really get me over excited about it. Eastwood did a fair job but something was missing.

No Longer A Broadway Musical,"The familiar Jersey Boys plot is there, but it's mostly devoid of the fun musical numbers that drive the Broadway story forward. The formation of the Four Seasons and the situations the group faced is still interesting, but the film lacks the song acts that make the Broadway version seem like a nostalgic Frankie Valli concert. Most of the excitement of the Broadway show, is singing and tapping your toes along with the music. That element is mostly eliminated and the first act of the film drags without any real strong song selections performed. Fans of the Broadway show may be disappointed for that reason. If you go in knowing what to expect and that it's much more serious, you won't be too let down. Think of the film version as a drama with some background music and song performances here and there.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Oh What a Night!,My wife and I have really enjoyed the story. We knew some of the music and she knew parts of the story. After seeing the theater version we were excited to learn of the movie and more so knowing Eastwood was involved.My wife has her attraction to the story for many obvious reasons but I was impressed with how it portrayed the hard work and commitment. One variation of an American Dream story with all of the good and bad surrounding it.The other thing I appreciated was some reliance on art and innuendo to portray the idol portions.We have seen it twice in a movie grille format and last night the audience applauded enthusiastically. The first time on release night everyone was a little more reserved but many clapped.I have never reviewed a movie and only see 1 or 2 a year so let's just say I was impressed.,10.0,Anonymous,Music
It just glosses over the events with a Hollywood sheen that wears thin fast.,"'Jersey Boys (2014)' never really gives you an insight into the minds of the men behind the music. It never gives you a sense of their passion for the craft or how their songs are a product of their environment. It never even conveys an appropriate sense of impact or escalation to the events that lead to the group's eventual downfall. Instead, it uses its time to gloss by the big hits and early beginnings in a boringly check-list fashion, with only a surface level of depth and a Hollywood sheen that wears thin fast. It doesn't help that, even though there are some undoubtable classics in their repertoire, the group's high-pitched lead vocal eventually becomes whiny and annoying when listening to it for two-hours as opposed to three-minutes on a record. The odd fourth-wall breaking asides switch perspectives too often to feel like anything more than expositional crutches, that are surely a by-product of lazy writing, too. The feature as a whole feels like it lacks a proper structure, never coming to a head with a true final act and finishing in almost the exact way that it started. It actually feels more like a TV-special than a bona fide feature. A poor effort from Eastwood. 4/10",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Think Walk The Line instead of Mamma Mia and you'll get the musical you had in mind,"Jersey Boys is getting a really unfair bad rap. Perhaps it's due to being in a similar vein to Goodfellas, maybe it's because the trailers claim it's a musical, or maybe it's because it's directed by the legendary Clint Eastwood. Albeit it's not like we have high standards for Eastwood these days anyway. I'm coming at it here with a different hindsight. My girlfriend is a huge Jersey Boys fan so I knew a lot about it beforehand. I ended up seeing the West End show a week after the film which was much stronger on the stage given its minimalistic design, high energy and smirking personality. The film's closest cousins are music biopics like Walk The Line and Ray with songs performed in front of audiences in the film. If you walk in expecting musical numbers like the blissful one in the epilogue then you'll be disappointed, but the show was never like that in the first place.Granted, the film isn't a perfect translation of the show. It may lift exact lines but its darker atmosphere takes itself far too seriously for some of the one-liners to earn a chuckle. It still has a sense of humour, but it's not as fun as the show. It's in the nature of a subject like this that harnesses the clichés, and in many cases quite well though it can be on the cusp of cheese. However, that's an idea addressed within the film as you may claim that the original music is on the cusp of cheese but there's a lot more heart to it than expected. It's a story best for the camaraderie between the band during their rise to fame. There's a slow start before Bob Gaudio is introduced, but from then to the peak of the Four Seasons, it's magic. It's fascinating to do a breaking the fourth wall type narration way to approach the story, which the show does as well, but a bad idea to neglect Frankie Valli's portion of the narration.It's a real shame that its star is the weakest part of the ensemble. John Lloyd Young originated the role of Valli on Broadway and won a Tony for it so you'd think he'd know the character well. Unfortunately he doesn't bring anything to the table here. He's void of charisma, shy of the camera and launches to his theatrical sensibilities for dramatic moments that come off comical. He's a hell of a showman though and his best moments are the musical performances, but that's just due to the voice. He's balanced by Vincent Piazza, the only actor with on-camera experience and he makes everyone else blend into the background. He may not have the sense of humour for Tommy but he has the attitude. Erich Bergen is the only actor who immediately feels like he belongs on screen but he hasn't many moments to shine. He could've easily filled in Michael C. Hall's shoes in Six Feet Under for instance. Michael Lomenda is also good, but needs to grow a little, peaks in his last scene.Then there's the music. I didn't know much about Valli's music, but it's guaranteed that you know them when you hear them. Sherry, Big Girls Don't Cry, Walk Like A Man, Can't Take My Eyes Off Of You, Rag Doll, What A Night, Who Loves You and more. Terrific iconic songs with a touch of innocence that the film and show put into a tender subtext. I haven't been able to get them out of my head. The film certainly has a good soundtrack selection, though it does omit some great tracks like Beggin' which would have fit just fine. I am still a little confused about why Valli took Tommy's debt and the film is dragged down by a brief misguided and melodramatic subplot with Valli's family but the rise is just such fun. Jersey Boys is decent Eastwood, especially in comparison to his post-Changeling work, and at least above average. Doesn't live up to the show though but that's a pretty tall order.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Well-done but where's the color?,Story of the rise (and fall) of the 60s group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.I saw the play this was based on and hated it. The songs were great but the dramatics were obvious and (frankly) quite boring. The movie doesn't change the play at all--it's almost a word by word copy. However I did like the movie a lot. For some reason the cornball dramatics actually worked better on screen than on stage. Usually it's the opposite. Also (with one exception) all the acting was great--especially John Lloyd Young as Valli (which he won a Tony Award for back in 2006). However there are two glaring problems here. One is Christopher Walken. He plays a gangster here who helps the boys. He's TERRIBLE! He looks bad and he gives a lousy performance. The other is the color--or lack of it! For whatever reason director Clint Eastwood shot the film in muted color. Bad decision. This is a MUSICAL--not some gritty drama. The bad color really weakens the film and makes the actors look like ghosts. And what's with all the swearing? The play had next to no swearing at all. However when they're on stage singing all is forgiven. I give a 7. Stronger color might have boosted my rating.,7.0,Anonymous,Music
As Close to the Broadway Play as Possible!,"I had my trepidation's along with Frankie Valli about movie adaptations from the Broadway stage productions but Jersey Boys does not disappoint. From the Get go Jersey boys has an energy and a fast pace avoiding drawn out Chatty scenes as seen through the eyes of Tommy DeVito (played by Vincent Piazza),the street smart full of himself tough Jersey youth. Enter our main star Frankie Valli,(John Lloyd Young), a young green 16 year old hair dresser, dripping behind his young virgin ears and into the life of Petty theft, Mob bosses and Nightclubs.Our third character of the group is Tommy's best friend and sidekick, lanky and soft spoken Nick Massi. This a journey into the world of Rock and roll working small seedy venues throughout New Jersey, Brill Building and finally meeting with flowery record producer Bob Crewe who gave those three a foot in the door. The final piece of the puzzle was a creative unassuming clean-cut songwriter Bob Gaudio played by Erich Bergen. Guadio's lyrics seemed to click as the Four Seasons recordings take off to the young masses. Fame and fortune comes swiftly to the boys but unbeknownst to the group Tommy gets involved with mob ties and money trouble as the story unfolds. Another beautiful aspect of our tale is the observance of our lead singer Frankie as we watch him develop from a young boy from Bellville,New Jersey to a top notch performer/celebrity. Frankie's ongoing problems during his career was like all singers/musicians was juggling family and work.Another bright spot in this movie is new-comer Renee Marino who acts like a seasoned veteran actor. Battling alcoholism and fallout with troubled daughter Francine shows the hardships and reality of having a famous parent.Despite all the to molt, the story has a nice flow. Christopher Walken adds some comic relief as the local Mafia Don and surprise cameos by Barry Livingston and Billy Gardell give this story some texture. How does this movie end?

Eastwood Goes Scorsese,"Jersey Boys is a movie that, if it didn't exist, the film world would not be any different. BUT, that's not to say it isn't good. It works and is good, but doesn't have quite enough to propel it into ""amazing"" territory.This film feels very much like a Martin Scorsese movie. The fast pace, the narration, the angry wife, it all feels like Goodfellas or The Wolf Of Wallstreet. I mean, Joe Pesci is even in this! (As a character, not the actual actor. And with a great reference to Goodfellas, I must say) While I would say Eastwood does this style well, I think it would have been more interesting to see Scorsese direct it. I think this film would have been amazing with Scorsese behind the wheel, but it just gets the job done with Eastwood. I think that sums up the movie well. Gets the job done, but doesn't blow you away.The performances were interesting. I thought John Lloyd Young did a good job as Frankie. I think the scenes where he shined were when he was on stage or just being Frankie in his day to day stuff, but when a more emotionally intense scene came along, I felt like sometimes he fell a little short. Over all he did well, especially with the singing. I thought the other guys in the Four Seasons did a good job too, especially Vincent Piazza. They were all believable and felt real. I don't know enough about the actual guys, so I can't say if they were portrayed properly.The sets and costumes and what not were quite good. They all were enjoyable to look at and rarely did you feel like you were seeing a modern film, aside from a scene or two where they're in a car and the backdrop looks pretty cheesy. (Which I feel like might have been on purpose as an homage to older films.) The whole film has a realistic vibe to it that may have to do with Eastwood being in his 80's meaning he was around for all of this stuff. I think his age helps the film for sure.In the end, I enjoyed the movie, enjoyed the music, and had a good time. Would I HIGHLY recommend this film? No. But I don't think it will disappoint.

"Nothing special, and loaded with cliche","Jersey Boys is a typical biopic about a group of musicians. I couldn't even count the number of cliches and tropes that are littered throughout the movie. It includes the normal ups-and-downs you see between the members of the band as they gain fame and grow apart. I was hoping for something different because I thought they might use the songs for more narrative purposes. I mean, the songs that The Four Seasons became famous for have great lyrics that could speak to normal life experiences. Perhaps I was just hoping for a ""Mamma Mia"" style of jukebox musical (even though I hate that movie) that tells a different story than just using the songs so literally, as the recordings that made the group famous.The actors in Jersey Boys were good singers, and they did a decent job of delivering the songs similar to the original recordings. No matter how I felt about the story being told, I enjoyed whenever they broke into song. It had me singing along, and definitely made me want to listen to a Four Seasons record sometime soon. The other thing I really enjoyed was when the characters would break the fourth wall and speak to the audience. I'm not sure why I always get a kick out of that in films, but there's something enjoyable for me when various characters narrate details to the viewers. In the long run, the plot was underwhelming to me, and I could get as much or more musical satisfaction from just listening to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons on the radio, so I doubt I'll ever watch Jersey Boys again.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Beached,"This film is mildly recommended.Oh, everyone's heard of Jersey Boys, the highly acclaimed Broadway smash musical. It's been running for years, nine and counting. Now, that show has spawned a new film adaptation, directed by Clint Eastwood, in hopes of duplicating that same success. The production was the typically jukebox musical with vignettes of dramatic scenes interspersed between the musical concert moments. While the show bristled with high energy and expert staging, the movie takes a more realistic and serious tone, as well it should, with the different media approach. But where on stage, the live performances captured the real essence of book and song, the movie version is a pale(rider) imitation.Now, one shouldn't compare two distinct art forms. So, with that said, I will concentrate only on the film version and see if the film can stand on its own merits. It does, a bit wobbly, but quite satisfactorily.￼Jersey Boys dramatizes the beginnings and end of the popular 1960's singing group, The Four Seasons, spanning a ten year career. The film concentrates on the rise and fall of this singing group and their on-again / off-again relationships, particularly the back-story of its lead vocalist Frankie Valli (well played by John Lloyd Young). Song after song, the story unfolds in a Rashomon format, with each member of the group reminiscing, contradicting, and giving their own personal point of view of the action on screen.Eastwood misdirects the film by placing the melodramatics front and center and pushing the music to the back. He takes a straightforward approach to the material, having the actors speak directly to the audience with their asides which becomes a bit jarring. Still the musical numbers always entertain, even if they are never match the originals. In fact, some harmonies have a dissonant quality and shrill harmonies. Some of the orchestrations are mostly overwrought, especially the horn section in the live performance of Can't Get My Eyes Off of You.￼ The screenplay by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice sanitizes the actual facts of this docudrama, but connect the dots in an artful manner. It celebrates the music but its narrative, with its all too prevalent gangsters from Jer-see and their Italian stereotypes, is far too predictable and slightly offensive. Wise guys and not-so-wise guys make up most of the characters involved in this tale, none of which is more obviously than mobster Gyp DeCarlo played by an all too recognizable Christopher Walken.￼Jersey Boys starts off very slow. Their first hit song, Sherry, doesn't even surface until 40 minutes into the film. At that point, the film starts gain some momentum. As the group begins its slew of pop hits (Big Girls Don't Cry, Walk Like a Man), Jersey Boys showcases those ditties and others.The cast works hard and achieves much success due to their talents. Beside Lloyd, the other actors who make up the remaining members of the singing quartet are Vincent Piazza, Michael Lomenda, and Erich Bergen, all contributing fine support. Mike Doyle and newcomer Renee Marino make their characters memorable in their underwritten roles.But this film version of Jersey Boys lacks vital energy and excitement. Eastwood has always been a serious filmmaker and, in this case, he makes this film musical too serious for its own good. It's as if he sucked all the the life out of the original source and was determined to make a drama with music rather than a full scale musical. (The end credits show what fun the film could have been with some fancy choreography and staging added to the film.) To this director, the story remains sacrosanct and too often his decision (and that of the screenwriters as well) regulates the songs as mere background to a sketchy biography, whereas the reverse would have been more effective.

Not quite what I expected,"As a biographical drama, Jersey Boys is well written and well acted. But as a biographical musical it leaves much to be desired. It would be more pleasing to the ear if the vocal and instrumental soundtracks had been more nearly true to original quality of the Four Seasons.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Great adaptation,"For fans of the broadway show, like myself, it's good to know that you can keep the story at the heart of it with the music as a garnish. For the show, the music is more to the max. I think this movie was exactly what it needed to be. Especially with Eastwood's raw directing style it compliments the actors and everything so well.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Was even better than I thought!,"I wanted to see the stage play from the first time I saw it advertised. I never got to, but when I saw the movie trailer, I was not going to let this opportunity pass! I've always been a fan of Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons, but never knew much about them. Everyone in my party LOVED this movie! Not just getting to see where these guys came from, but the cast makes this movie worth seeing. It's definitely true that a story is only as good as the storyteller. These guys made you believe they were FV&FS. Their vocals and harmony are spot on, their acting goes beyond the word. They BECOME the four seasons. I've never seen such raw emotion as is displayed by John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli... Erich Bergen absolutely shines as singer/songwriter Bob Gaudio. I loved that they sang all of their own music live in each set rather than lip syncing, too. Whether you're a fan of the music or not, this movie is not to be missed. If you're a fan, it's a must. You'll fall in love with their music all over again, as well as become a fan of these four men portraying them in the movie!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Beautifully done, but drags at times","The Four Seasons, a musical sensation that lasted throughout the years as one of the greatest bands of the 20th century. With uptown beats, a blend of instruments, and a high pitched Frankie Valli; this group led the charts for many years. So what is the entertaining world's current trend in recognizing their achievements? Simple, they make plays and movies about the group, in particular about the origins and underlying story of the singing sensations. That's right, my movie review is on Jersey Boys, the latest work of director Clint Eastwood.Like most movies about singing legends, the underlying tone is dark, often the glamorous lifestyle of fame a mere cover for some tormenting background. If you didn't get this from the movie trailer, or the title, I'm here to tell you that Jersey Boys is a tale of dark and dreary times. Right from the start we are thrown smack dab in the middle of a depressing neighborhood, filled with citizens whose dreams seem dead, with the exception of a few, as Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) introduces us to his life. In a curse filled, angry tone, one already gets a feeling the movie will have a more somber tone than any of the films I've seen in the past few weeks. Over the course of two hours, the tale grows darker, every ounce of happiness offset by seedy greed and selfish desires of one or two characters. While realistic, it became slow at points and bored me to wanting to take a nap. Now maybe it was the double feature after a day of work, but the truth is this movie dragged at points for me, especially in the beginning where I was waiting for them to actually sing something. Luckily the film picks up pace when the first song leaves Frankie's golden throat, but after the brief span of nostalgic tunes, it hits a low point again. Yes, it sets up a tale that has lots of character development, but shorten the movie by a half an hour and you will still make your point.Putting story aside, the recreated world of the 60's was well executed, as various trends and commodities returned from the shelves of time. Various couples in the audience lit up with delight at being dragged back in time, commenting on how much fun establishments like that used to be. Regardless, the setting is well done, both costumes and makeup blending in with the artificial towns that changes, as the seasons grow older. While I am no expert in how the seasons looked, I felt the cast did a nice job of recreating them, styling hair and casting actors who looked and played the part. While the characters can be real sleaze balls, I think the fantastic four did a great job filling the epic shoes, and blending Jersey edge with Italian loyalty. Frankie (John Lloyd Young) in particular was my favorite character, a wide variety of emotion and qualities that made me most interested in his story. Of course seeing as the tale was more focused on him, I can't tell how much was glamorized to make him look good, but still I rather enjoyed his character. As for the other actors, well I applaud their talent as well, each playing an integral role in ""moving"" the story along and providing a different angle on things.Let's talk about the part I enjoyed the most about Jersey Boys. No I'm not talking that it ending, I'm talking about the music. The one shred of light in this story is getting to hear the gang sing some of their big time hits. Is it live singing or well-rehearsed dub overs? I don't know, but regardless I was moving my knees and bobbing to the rhythm as the Four Seasons played their melodies. The elaborate stage shows with their bright lights brightened the mood and temporarily eliminated the cloud of dismay I was feeling. Getting not one, but four songs as well, made me feel as if I wasn't being gypped, and the fact they played the entire son, or at least most of it, was another plus that Eastwood did right. Of course, the only thing that I wished could have been different, was that these songs were not so clustered together, to help relieve some of the latter dramatic tension and depression, but Eastwood cant' change history any more than we can.Jersey Boys has the magic of bringing a world to life, however depressing that world may be. With a great cast, beautiful setting, and music that continues to span the test of time, Eastwood deserves applause for what he has done. Yet, it is slow, and not really a movie I can say deserves flocking to the theater to see, when it can be appreciated from the comforts of home, and cheaper as well. It may win an Oscar though, so if given the chance to see it take it, but hold your money for some of the other films coming in the next couple of weeks.I give Jersey Boys:Drama/Biography/Musical: 7.5 Overall: 7.0",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Clint's worst,"Clint Eastwood is a Hall of Fame fimmaker. His batting average is great but ""Jersey Boys"" is not. It's unwatchable. It has one unlikable character after another. The performances are obnoxious. I've been watching a lot of Clint lately so i decided to give this movie another shot. I shouldn't have bothered. ""Jersey Boys"" is the pits. It's probably the most annoying movie I have ever seen. Clint really dropped the ball with this one.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
Must See!,"Today it was released today and i went to go see it and i must say this movie was incredible. the best feel good movie and has a few laughs. The Four Seasons are a great group and it partly makes to movie good. the other parts are the acting and they all killed it. set in the 50s and made it almost perfect.directed by the legendary Clint Eastwood. it'll be very disappointing if he doesn't be nominated for a Oscar. from start to finish this movie is just great. never boring, never pointless and never corny. just perfect. And we can't forget Christopher Walken, he is in and out of the movies and also makes the movie great. brought tears to my eyes from how good it was and i just had to do a review on this! must see!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
For having no expectations...a colossal all around disappointment,"I have never seen the stage play of Jersey Boys though I have always wanted to. I still would like to because I know how different the film version of stage plays can be. It seems to be that the producers and directors of unsuccessful stage to movie adaptations seem to forget that that stage plays are so successful for a reason and completely butchering them will make people not like the movie. I don't know if that's the case with Jersey Boys but the film was dreadfully slow, the music was not well used AT ALL, the performances were okay at best but I felt like they really lacked power behind them. Despite the singing supposedly being done live on set, several of the performances looked horribly dubbed. I could swear that audio was off their lip movement and that just breaks the entire feel of the film. The film makers do nothing to capture the ""gritty"" streets of New Jersey and you just don't really get that epic feeling of following an absolute icon of Rock and Roll through various decades. I simply felt as though there was more to be told that I wasn't seeing. I would have rather they focused more on Frankie Valli, although I understand the film is about the four of them. The performances weren't terrible, but rather felt underdeveloped and missing something. Maybe the translation to big screen doesn't work for this story.Now if I understand correctly, this cast comes heavily from the Broadway adaptation of Jersey Boys. That, to me, is a smart movie under normal circumstances. Still I felt like this cast was struggling to find their place and never quite comfortable on screen in their roles. John Lloyd Young plays Frankie Valli and certainly has the right look and the right voice (if that was his real voice) but I didn't feel like the script gave him enough to really shine. Yes, we understood him as a person but I felt like I wanted more and instead he gives a so-so performance. Vincent Piazza was probably the best in this cast as Tommy DeVito and certainly gets the best story arc and the best scenes because his character is so confrontational and abrasive (in a good way.) The relationship between him and Frankie certainly drives the story and is one of the few reasons this gets even a five from me. Erich Bergen was wasted in the movie and I found his performance stiff and irritating. He was supposed to be this passionate song writer but he seemed so wooden and his emotions were not strong enough to carry the film. He was very disappointing. Even his line delivery felt like he was nervous or something similar. Michael Lomenda had one really good scene and it was a very ironic one. Finally, near the end of the film, tired of feeling back seat to Frankie and Tommy...he erupts into a tirade. This was very true to form because for most of the film I forgot Lomenda existed in his role. He was completely underdeveloped and if it wasn't a film about the ""Four Seasons"" I would say he was unnecessary and barely a supporting character. Christopher Walken was decent in his small role and certainly added some class and experience to the cast. This was the only role though that I can remember Walken doing where he looked bored and very laid back. Maybe that was just the character. I certainly would never say anything bad about Walken.I use to be the world's biggest Clint Eastwood fan. I ate up everything I did and I still reluctantly say the man is a brilliant actor in his day and director in his day. Then he embarrassed all his fans during his ridiculous ""Political Chair"" rant and even before then his career choices have slipped significantly. Invictus was okay, Hereafter was awful, J. Edgar was full of potential and fell completely flat and now Jersey Boys. Its like he's lost his vision creatively. Or his ego gets in the way and he tries to make a story based on truth or other works and completely changes it and it ruins the story. Jersey Boys lacked passion, lacked direction, lacked heavy talent...it just felt like it was missing so many pieces to the puzzle. I would absolutely love to see the stage play to see if I'm correct in assuming they changed the premise enough to ruin why it is so successful on stage. Rock of Ages did the same thing last year by butchering what is an amazing stage play (the best thing I have ever seen) into a so-so movie because some egotistical director thought they could do better. The ending of the film where they aged the actors to play elderly versions of themselves looked ridiculous. The actors looked like high school kids pretending to be old men. This was a huge pass for me and its unfortunate because I absolutely adore stage plays, classic music and life stories like this one. The Jersey Boys film hits all the wrong notes. 5/10",5.0,Anonymous,Music
It's just okay.,"Clint Eastwood almost (but not quite) directs a Scorsese-ish gangster film while also almost (but not quite) directing a musical. The resulting movie, Jersey Girls, is sort of just fine. If I remember it for anything, though, it'll probably be the gimmicky little one-off amusing moments, like Clint Eastwood having a cameo of sorts through old film (or TV) footage, and Joe Pesci technically being a character in the film. Also, one character sounded exactly like George Costanza, and it was distracting. Similarly, another actor distracted me because he looked so much like Steve Buscemi, but Buscemi doesn't have any relatives who are actors from what I can tell (I tried to check).But yeah, Jersey Boys, it's just okay as far as biopics go. I watched it the same day as Juror #2, and it made me appreciate the fact that that film didn't have the washed-out/desaturated look Eastwood loved using in the 2000s and some of the 2010s. It's on full display in Jersey Boys.Worst aspect of Jersey Boys was the corny ""eureka"" moments that sometimes plague music biopics. Even if The Four Seasons did get that name from happening to look at a hotel sign, just leave it out, because it feels so goofy now, when movies do that. Truth can be too preposterous (like with The Iron Claw leaving out one tragedy of many, because audiences wouldn't believe so much bad luck could impact just one family).",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Nearly Flawless,"Very rarely have I seen such an excellent merge from stage show to movie. Great casting, costuming, lighting, the settings were all very evocative and the music was done brilliantly. Seeing the movie left me with just as much excitement as watching the live show. I can't praise this movie enough. Some might argue that there are over-the-top moments, especially in regards to Vincent Piazza's Tommy DeVito or John Lloyd Young's interpretation of a young Valli. But that is the point! They were young, hormonal men involved with the mob. Their story was larger than life, and their characters are SUPPOSED to be dramatic and temperamental. The cast did a brilliant job portraying this.The movie's only downside - it runs a little long for viewers who aren't already Jersey Boys fans. That being said - I brought my boyfriend to see the movie, and he is NOT a fan of musicals. He actually enjoyed and liked Jersey Boys.Get out there and see it while it's still in theaters!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Borrowing From What Is Being Borrowed (read on),"HAVING BEEN A JUNIOR in High School when SHERRY debuted in the Autumn of 1962 and having seen both JERSEY BOYS as well as seeing a recent concert by Frankie Valli, one would think that we'd know everything that was coming in this picture. Wrong, we did not.PRODUCER AND DIRECTOR, Mr. Clint Eastwood, took the successful Stage Play and had it adapted into something which was at once the same, yet very different. Using the medium of film to expand the 'stage' on which the story is presented, enabled the development of the story to take a more realistic course than the stage musical could possibly have done.THE STORY IS framed with anecdotal stories from the ""old neighborhood""; revealing the boys to have been involved with a lot of illegal; activity and indeed, were familiar with organized crime figures. The latter was represented by the character of Gyp De Carlo (Christopher Walken).THE BOYS OWN brushes with the law are represented by a botched burglary; which young Frankie (John Lloyd Young) manages to get cut loose from due to in Court testimony of his mentor, Tommy De Vito (Vincent Piazza). Tommy De Vito does do time for the crime and we learn that jail seems to be a way of life here.THE SCENARIO HAS plenty of domestic situations, backstage show biz stuff, outstanding drama and relevant humor. The direction that the story takes always moves the action along; without ever lapsing into any superfluous or irrelevant scenes or situations.ALTHOUGH THAT WE have a prime example of the filming of a legitimate stage play and the dramatic license involved; as well as the application of movie techniques, the production team did not stop there.IN A SORT OF reversal of the filming process and use of camera techniques, the screenplay opted to, in turn borrow stage methods in providing both narrative and exposition. For example, the characters turn and directly address us, through talking to the camera's eye.THE MOVIE DOES diverge from the norm on several other points. First, there are no opening credits. All cast members, film crew, producer/director personnel and technicians receive their billing at movies conclusion.AND, MUCH IN the manner of the Broadway Stage's having the players in the cast to take a bow and receive their appreciation from the audience, the cast is brought out once more for our approval. This is accomplished with a ensemble production number, with all doing a dance to Four Seasons' standards.THESE TECHNIQUES REMIND us very much of those employed by that 24 year old, boy genius, Orson Wells, used in his CITIZEN KANE (RKO, 1941). We suppose that this makes Mr. Eastwood the preeminent Director in the business.WITH THIS NOTION we do heartily concur. If you haven't yet seen it, do so soon. Tell 'em we sent you.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Wasted Opportunity - Needed a Different Director,"Clint Eastwood is a great director - ""Unforgiven,"" ""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Bridges of Madison County,"" but he's the wrong director for this musical. Usually, his films are lean and mean. As is, this film is lifeless, flat, and cliched. Only during the singing, dancing end credits does it show any life.
Who would have done a better job? Martin Scorsese. He's directed mob movies. He's directed a musical ""New York, New York"" in addition to music documentaries.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Good movie; entertaining.,"This movie is not great but it is certainly good. As a discography of the work of the Four Seasons, the movie is fabulous. But as a biopic about four guys from New Jersey, the movie comes close to hitting the target but somehow misses the mark. Unlike the music, which is substantive, the portrayals of the musicians themselves at times come off as corny and contrived, with lots of cheesy acting, which is too bad for the movie since their personal stories seem actually quite interesting. Although they had personal issues, the Four Seasons were first and foremost creative artists who developed a style of music that the public liked. However, instead of going with the upbeat music, the movie plays up the bickering and quarreling within the group, which seems petty and undramatic when compared to the success they achieved as musicians. The story of the Four Seasons is their music, thus, for that reason alone the movie is worth watching.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

So much more than a musical tribute,"I went because I thought I would enjoy the music and I really knew nothing about the story of The Four Seasons. This movie is so much more than just a musical tribute. It's the story of friendship, brotherhood (and therefore sisterhood), parenting and doing the best we know how, love, heartache, disappointment and each of us making our own way in our own way. It brought tears to my eyes several times and not necessarily for the screen story but for what story crossed into my own family and relationships. I absolutely wanted to applaud but no one in my theatre did so (all seniors). I'd like to see this taken seriously by the Academy. Thank you Clint Eastwood.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Give Me a Break With The Anti F Word People,"This is another fantastic film Mr Eastwood has put together. He continues to make well crafted films one after the other. Jersey Boys is no exception. Although I have heard the name Frankie Valli before, I had no idea who he was. You do not need to be familiar with the band to enjoy the film. Although I suspect you will recognize many of the songs. If not all of them. It's more than just a music film though. It has a touch of Goodfellas sprinkled in it. It's nice to see Christopher Walken play a gangster again. That alone was worth the price of admission. No on to the F word haters. The picture is rated R. This is how the characters speak. Get over it. I use the F word on a regular basis. So does everyone I have ever known. If you don't like it don't watch R rated pictures.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
I Loved the 4 Seasons -- the Movie is a Disaster,"Before I go into why I disliked this film, let me say that I was, and still am, a big fan of the 4 Seasons. I collected everything they did together up until 1970. This film does no justice to who they were, where they came from or how they sounded. The dude playing Valli is actually embarrassing to listen to. He sounds more like Jerry Lewis than Frankie Valli. The others are mere caricatures, and out of their league as far as acting is concerned.The songs are NOTHING like they ought to sound, and so grating to listen to that the whole mess should have been dubbed. Historically speaking, I have to ask, was there anyone during this fiasco of a production that had ever heard of continuity? For instance, near the beginning when the setting is the VERY early 1950s, a girl complains she wants to go to the movies to see The Blob, which didn't come out until 1958. And that's just the beginning. ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" is presented as being introduced in 1970 when it actually was a monster hit in 1967. And when I heard Valli singing ""My Eyes Adored You"" to his little girl, I want to scream. It was way out of sync with the timeline, and in fact came out AFTER Can't Take My Eyes Off You.Eastwood's directing on this turkey is wooden, as though he phoned his direction in while he stayed in bed. In short, if you truly loved the music of The Four Seasons, avoid this mish-mash of a movie.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Eastwood ""hits"" again !","I watched this biopic and was completely blown away ! There is nothing wrong with this movie. Nothing at all ! It is just... perfect. This tantalizing movie tells the story of The Four Seasons with an incredibly believable and accurate script, great photography and a superb cast.Goes to show that 'old cowboys' not only 'never die' but also never lose their skills. It was about time that someone did a bio on Frankie Valli and his group. Only a director with a passion for music is able to pull this off. I enjoyed every minute of it and would most definitely recommend it ! This is one not to miss ! I can't rate it 10/10 because that would mean 'perfection', which doesn't exist.

Unreal Reel - Spend the Money - See it,"Back in the 50s when singers started using the falsetto voice, I just didn't get it and just didn't like it. But being inundated with tons using it, I started to accept it. The Four Seasons were the best group with the sound and their own harmony was second to none. Plus, their original songs were outstanding. Saw them in concert, liked them even more. Don't get into stage musicals that much, but really enjoy the musical movies. So, the wife and I decided to go see Jersey Boys. Bottom line: if you want to be entertained to the max for the inexpensive cost of a movie ticket - then go see this movie. The best time I've had in the movies in years - and we see a lot of movies.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
LOVED the music and the back story,"""Jersey Boys,"" from 2014, is based on the smash hit Broadway show and directed by Clint Eastwood. He might seem an odd choice, but he's a man who loves music and is an excellent director. The only time I haven't liked one of his films was ""Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil"" - pretty awful.""Jersey Boys"" tells the story of the Four Seasons, from their felonious beginnings to their attempts to break through into the music scene, their name changes, the success, and the burdens that came with it.This doesn't feel like a musical, which is one of the things I liked. The music was fabulous, and rather than have a character break into song, we see them performing. I love movies like this or an old- timer's concert because one forgets how many hits they had. I remember seeing Tom Jones in person and how each song was so familiar. The movie is a treasure trove of great music.John Lloyd Young repeats his Broadway star-making role as Frankie Valli. He is the only performer in history to win every single award given in the theater: Tony, Drama Desk, Outer Critics Circle and Theatre World Awards.He clearly understands Valli's talent, ambition, angst, and heartbreak. One of his scenes, over the song ""My Eyes Adored You"" will leave you in tears. What a talent.But everyone here is top notch: Christopher Walken as Gyp DeCarlo is wonderful as a mobster who adores Frankie's voice; Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio, Mike Doyle as Bob Crewe, Vincent Piazza as Tommy Devito, Michael Lomenda as Nick Massi - all fantastic.The end is sensational.

"Good songs, performances, script, and direction","A thoroughly enjoyable film. Eastwood's direction is perfect. It's a musical trip down memory lane for anyone cognizant in the '50s. The performances are all solid. At times, John Lloyd Young's voice (Frankie Valli) is a pitch screechy, but it actually seemed to warm up through the movie. Maybe that was the point.I liked the story being told from the different characters' points of view directly to the camera, and the curtain call ending was a really delightful touch. Eastwood clearly captured the feeling of a Broadway musical, while opening up to the real world throughout. And I positively loved Frankie's last speech about the most memorable moment in his life.

Why the bad reviews for such a good movie?,"Oh what movie. See what I did there. One of The Four Seasons best songs and a nice play on words with it. But yes, this is a good movie. I don't know why it rated so low on IMDb. So here we go to the review.Synopsis: Jersey Boys is a musical biography of the Four Seasons-the rise, the tough times and personal clashes, and the ultimate triumph of a group of friends whose music became symbolic of a generation. Far from a mere tribute concert (though it does include numbers from the popular Four Seasons songbook), Jersey Boys gets to the heart of the relationships at the center of the group-with a special focus on frontman Frankie Valli, the small kid with the big falsetto. In addition to following the quartet's coming of age as performers, the core of the show is how an allegiance to a code of honor learned in the streets of their native New Jersey got them through a multitude of challenges: gambling debts, Mafia threats and family disasters. Jersey Boys is a glimpse at the people behind a sound that has managed to endure for over four decades in the hearts of the public. Starring: John Lloyd Young, Vincent Piazza, Michael Lomenda, Erich Bergen Director: Clint EastwoodClint Eastwood proves yet again why he should never stop making movies. He is a brilliant, brilliant film maker. Just look at the history of this man. He has proved time and again that he is the man who should be asked in the top five directors first to direct a movie. This being his first musical was not a bad venture.One great thing that Clint did was cast people who acted in the musical to begin with. That did nothing but help this movie. The guys who were playing the roles of the Four Seasons played them before, so they knew the material. They already had it in their heads how it should go.I found out throughout the years that most people didn't know that the four guys were connected to the mob in more ways than one. At first, I didn't believe it. Then I looked into the matter. And if it wasn't for the mob, a lot of the musicians out of Jersey wouldn't have gotten any farther than they had. I'm glad that they left that part in. It really is an intricate part to the story.The last thing I need to talk about is the soundtrack. I mentioned it earlier, but these guys singing sounded almost like the real singers. The soundtrack is not the best part, but it is very close to it. Just for the fact of the soundtrack is enough to watch this movie.I strongly encourage everyone to watch this movie. Just give it a try, it will surprise you.Rating: 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Oh, What a Night","I cannot honestly sit here and say I'm a big fan of musicals, but then again I really wouldn't call this a true musical. With a nice gripping story, and some amazing music, Clint Eastwood brings us the popular Broadway show to the silver screen. This is my review of Jersey Boys.Jersey Boys is a huge Broadway musical that has been around for nearly a decade now, and in the big screen version the writers of that musical comes into write this film(Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice). While I cannot comment on the Broadway musical, I can honestly say the writing in this movie was top notch. Great story that mostly moves by great, amazing music at just the right times. The back story is very interesting. As a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Season(not a huge fan by any means) I must say, I was a little shocked to find out some of the informative information this movie brings to us. This is really an all over fantastic effort from Brickman and Elice. The film does have faults, as there are times in the film where the pace falls off, but it never really bothered me to a point where I lost interest.The film is directed by the legendary Clint Eastwood. Eastwood of course has a great track record as an actor, but his recent efforts directing haven't been great(minus Gran Torino). In my opinion he gets back on track with this film. With an amazing lineup of actors, Eastwood really pulls this film off perfectly. Leading the pack and playing Frankie Valli is John Lloyd Young. While I've never heard of him before this film, I honestly can say his acting was great in this film. He works perfectly as well with the rest of the cast like Vincent Piazza(Tommy Devito), Erich Bergen(Bob Gaudio), and Michael Lomenda(Nick Massi). These actors are fabulous in this film, all working great together. It is a joy to see them recreate this amazing story of their rise to fame, and of course the problems that come with fame. Eastwood, for the most part brings us a flawless film, minus some pacing issues that I mentioned above. The film has a fairly long runtime of two hour and fifteen minutes, and you wonder if the film would have fared a little better if some of the scenes were cut down. Either way Eastwood brings us amazing scenes of the fifties and sixties America, and an around all great film.Overall, if you are a fan of musicals or just a fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Season, then this is the movie for you. Some in the younger audience may not enjoy the film as they don't typically enjoy this type of older music, so to them it would be best to stay away from this film. For younger people like me who enjoy this music, and really anyone who enjoys this kind of music, then this is a film for you that also brings a nice story.8/10",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Wrong Seasoning,"Why oh why can't Hollywood make a decent musical anymore? So many shows have so much potential, then it seems poor choices are made and we have a celluloid record of 'How NOT to make a musical'. The Summer graveyard slot is a good indication of a studio's distrust of their movie (See an equally miss judged 'Rock Of Ages' a few years back, re-tailored to Cruise and ruined by that.. It WAS FUN however). Here we have a prime awards candidate rushed into a JUNE slot. So what's happened to JERSEY BOYS.. It's basically forgotten the fact that it IS a musical. Eastwood has re-told it as a serious Bi-pic with music.. that music is still great but you get none of the buzz of the show.. IF the character can break the fourth wall to address the audience ( which they do) then WHY can't they sing to the audience as well.. and then let us all in on the party..As it stands it's a traditional old school bio pic that we watch and don't get involved in.. Until... The last production number.. played over the credits.. It's the one time the movie lets us in. Great design and good performances are wasted. Such a shame.. file with 'Mama Mia', 'Rock Of Ages' and 'Sweeney Todd' as missed opportunities. and a lost record of good shows on film.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Oh What a Night!,"Jersey Boys is a film adaptation of the hit Broadway musical that showed the rise and decline of the 60's rock group, the Four Seasons. I was familiar with many of their songs, but I did not realize how hard it was to keep the group together. On the outside, this film is a by-the-books biography of the group. But if you look deeper, there is a deep thread of characterization with each main character, and that is quite lovely to see. On the whole, the film was very enjoyable thanks to the production design and toe-tapping musical numbers.Clint Eastwood's film is about the rise and fall of the New Jersey-bred men who joined together to form a musical group based around Frankie Valli's uncommon voice. We see the troubles that arise and the hits that come before they become less popular as we head into the 1970's.This film does not have a recognizable cast at all outside of one name, and that is a good thing. We don't have stardom to stand in the way of actual talent. The man who played Valli, was John Lloyd Young, who actually won a Tony for his portrayal as Frankie in the Broadway show. The only star on this cast is Christopher Walken as a mob leader, and he does quite a good job as a mentor to the kids.Overall, Jersey Boys isn't the atrocious musical I was expecting it to be. It's not perfect in any sense as the story suffers from some issues. But it was an enjoyable film that taught me some about the group while singing along to their greatest hits. The film receives high marks for the production design and the costumes, which are usually top-notch in Eastwood movies anyhow. A fan of the play will certainly become a fan of the movie.My Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Musically delightful, everything else meh","Quickie Review:From director Clint Eastwood, comes the cinematic adaption of the Broadway musical, Jersey Boys. The story is based on the real lives of the rock and roll hall of famers, The Four Seasons. The film is about the band's rise to fame and the speed bumps that they face along the way. With a talented director and some of the cast from the actual Broadway musical who know the material better than anyone else, this had the potential to be a great musical. The music is very catchy and wonderfully performed, also the era in which it is set is well realized. While the musical aspect is great, the rest of the movie falls apart due to a poorly structured and executed storytelling.Full Review:Despite not knowing much about The Four Seasons, I usually quite enjoy life stories of famous past artists and their struggles along the way. So considering this was a popular and successful musical, being directed by a legend in Hollywood, Clint Eastwood, I was quite intrigued. In the beginning I saw some promise, but as the movie went on I felt my interest wane.This is after all a musical, so the one thing that has to be great is the music, and thankfully it is. As I mentioned the songs are indeed catchy. I never listened to The Four Seasons, and I don't carry that genre of music on my phone to listen to on the road. And yet I really enjoyed all the songs to the point I want to check out more of the band's discography. So the credit goes to the actors for their amazing voices (and of course The Four Seasons for actually making the songs originally). On the other hand the acting style of the cast felt out of place. Some of them come directly from Broadway, and that is clearly seen in their performance, because everything is very exaggerated. That style is perfect and very much needed for on-stage, but on-screen the acting needs to be more subtle. So there are points where it feels like the cast is over-acting, which can get distracting.The main problem with the movie is the structure of the story. There are events and situations that occur very abruptly. The reason for this is because there is no coherence in the time-line of the movie. You don't know whether 5 months or 5 years have passed between scenes, there are no visual cues. So for example, there might be some argument that may break out as a result of tension building up over 10 years. But because you don't see that build up at all, much less know that 10 years passed in just 3 scenes, the eventual fight breaking out feels like it came out of nowhere. This completely took me out of the movie several times because to me the reactions of the characters made no sense without the much needed proper context. There are times where a character breaks the fourth wall and speaks directly to the audience. This would've been useful for filling in those gaps, but instead is used to state some obvious things that are happening or about to happen.In the end, I can't say that I enjoyed the movie. The unorganized flow of the story can get the motives of the characters confusing. This completely removes any emotional effect of some critical scenes. As a result you have little care for what's going on. Ultimately this is a slow and boring movie with some good music. I would only recommend this to fans of The Four Seasons, with caution though. At least Jersey Boys got me exposed to some good oldies music **off to Spotify**.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Excellent movie AND Christopher Walkin is in it!,"Excellent movie. They do a great job of showing teens/young adults in New Jersey in the 50s. They movie shows the ups and downs of Frankie Valli and his band. Well done movie, it makes you want to download his songs and listen. I think the best part of the movie are the songs. The actors are all so talented and it comes through loud and clear. The actors/singers they selected do a great job of sounding like Frankie Valli and the rest of the band. At the same time, they show the tragedies of Frankie Valli's and his family's tragic life. And it shows some of the tragedy the rest of the band goes through. Finally all I have to say is: Christopher Walkin!! He is one of the greatest actors from the 80s-2020s. He is one of those actors who literally moves the needle positively of any movie he is in!",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Will You Like This Movie? It Depends...,"First of all, I think you definitely have to be a fan of late 50's (early rock 'n' roll) music to enjoy this movie, as it's centered around the story of Frankie Valli of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons. But if you're a fan of this era (e.g., you grew up listening to this music) you likely will also have high expectations - especially for the music.The movie can roughly be divided into two major parts. The first part deals with the rise of Frankie Valli (and ultimately, The Four Seasons). I thought this first part moved rather slowly; there's a lot of ""detail"" (but not nearly as much detail as what actually took place in terms of members of the group, etc.). If I had to base my review only on the first part of the movie, I'd probably have given it a much lower rating (i.e., a '6').By the second half of the movie, Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons have ""made it"" and are a big success. But as is often the case, trouble has been brewing all along, and the second half of the movie, which is much better, deals with the how the group handles the inevitable problems behind the scenes. The second half of the movie is very good, and resulted in my ultimate rating of an '8'.As for the music, all the classic songs are there. But, if you're a fan of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons, then like me, you may be disappointed in the ""quality"" of the music - John Lloyd Young's (Frankie Valli) voice isn't on par with the original (but then, whose is? ;-) and the group as a whole doesn't begin to match the sound of the ""real thing"". I do give the actors credit for re-performing the songs themselves (as opposed to lip-syncing the originals), but still, it's less- than-satisfying.To be fair, in the end of the movie, they do use a few songs (as originally performed by Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons) as part of the soundtrack.Once again, you probably need to be a fan of Frankie Valli and The Four Seasons to fully appreciate and enjoy this movie. And that also means you probably were a contemporary. The younger generation is probably not going to identify with this era, and hence will have less of an appreciation for the story.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Amadeus Meets Goodfellas: Street Punks of Jersey Create the Defining Pop Sound Prior to the Beatles,"In 1959, the music died: Buddy Holly, the Big Bopper and Ritchie Valens died in the most infamous plane crash in the history of Rock 'N' Roll, and Elvis Presley was drafted into the army. In music a number of one-hit wonders entered and left the pop-culture music stage until a bunch of street hoodlums formed a singing group which would become the defining sound of the early 1960's prior to the Beatles. They went under a host of different names, until they settled on the Four Seasons and eventually Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli and Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio lead a tremendous cast of superb actors in this thoroughly enjoyable and intricate behind-the-scenes exposé of one of the biggest pop music phenomena prior to the Beatles. Some of the story techniques are similar to Amadeus and Goodfellas in which voice overs of the different characters tell the story at different times. The very beginning of the story is somewhat confusing. Eventually we learn that Valli's older friend Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) is a kind of Jersey equivalent of Santino ""Sonny"" Corleone of ""The Godfather"". He gets into trouble in the streets, convincing Valli and a few other friends to hijack a safe from a local business. Eventually he decides to form a singing group and he asks Frankie and Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) to join.For a time they are a trio with different drummers. Their sound isn't bad but their songs are a bit ""derivative"" of other songs already on the radio. Then they solicit the help of Bob Gaudio, a song-writer who had one hit under his belt as co-writer of ""Short Shorts"". They become studio back-up singers under Bob Crewe but they can't land a recording of one of their own songs. Crewe claims their songs still aren't unique enough, until Gaudio presents the group with ""Sherry"" which becomes the group's first hit single which will define most of the group's sound during the early 1960's with Valli's falsetto the trademark voice occasionally punctuated with the bass voice of Massi.Simultaneously, a sub-plot is developing in which Tommy has gotten in with loan sharks and the meter keeps running high. Eventually, it's time to pay the piper and the group is left holding the tab. The group disbands leaving just Valli and Gaudio. Gaudio writes a song which would become a kind of farewell anthem of the sound of the early 1960's but in a way looks forward to some of the music of the 1970's. Unlike the sound of ""Sargent Pepper"" of the Beatles, the song becomes an unlikely hit. Initially the records producers and executives felt the song would bomb because it wasn't Rock but wasn't really Pop/Easy Listening either. It's not Rock per se but a pop sound which would become part of the pop sound of music which appealed to a slightly older audience apart from the sound of Rock which was taking over the teenage Baby Boom audience. It would become Frankie Valli's biggest hit up until that time.With the rise of the Beatles, The Who, Jefferson Airplane, and the Rolling Stones, the Four Seasons became somewhat eclipsed. Music enthusiasts sometimes forget the Four Seasons were the Beatles of their day, producing a string of hits some of which have withstood more or less: ""Sherry"", ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Ragdoll"". I would certainly not crown the Four Seasons as the best group of the 1960's but they certainly had something to say in music. And Frankie Valli became the most popular falsetto singer of the late 20th century until Michael Jackson.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Solid Entertainment,"I don't often attend live stage shows, but being a big fan of the 4 Seasons music, did catch the live production a couple years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I was a bit disappointed the first time I saw the movie, it seemed that Eastwood tried to stay too faithful to the stage production, although I must admit I don't have a clue as to the process of adapting from stage to film. After 3 months I tried it again last night, catching it on HBO and enjoyed it much more. Maybe I wasn't comparing it to the stage show. In any case, it was enjoyable, a great ensemble cast and at the heart of it was the terrific music. The Seasons had an incredible run of hits from the early to late 60's and it turned out that their evolution was an engrossing story.My complaints-the story does drag in a few places, thought about .15 minutes or more could have easily been trimmed. The scene where they were riding in a convertible with the camera on the hood shooting at them in the car looked incredibly campy, obviously done in a studio. Also thought that the method of having each of the original 4 Seasons introduce a portion of the story may have worked well on a stage, but was unneeded for the film adaptation.One interesting thing-their biggest hit, 1975's ""December 1963 (Oh What a Night)"" was used in the overture and in the grand finale, bringing out the cast in the stage and film production. This song, which also coincided with the beginning of disco dominating the Top 40 charts, is done by a different group of 4 Seasons, with only Valli left from the original group and this may be one of the only songs that Frankie didn't sing the lead. with Gerry Polci doing the vocals and Valli singing the bridge. Their comeback with this hit isn't mentioned, but the song is used.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
I Felt And Saw,"As I hear these songs of the Four Seasons this time around, it isn't the same. The songs feel heavier and most heartfelt and grab a hold of me like a chain grasping a my heart. I feel my heart is twice the size I remember when hearing these songs as a child in the 60's on the AM radio. I could feel the work involved of the scenario The Four Seasons had to face as entertainers as the price for being known. A clearer understanding of the sacrifices.And for the first time I can ever remember, I rejoiced over a musical Broadway cast enjoying the glee of fine actors playing together in a selfless homage.Hail music history as it feels itself here in ""The Jersey Boys""",8.0,Anonymous,Music
a Musical only,"""Jersey Boys"" is the play and that is it not a great movie piece (bad job Clint, Frankie and Bob), should have shown it with some character and not a play / musical. I have been in bands that did Four Seasons (I sang Frankie) and know them well - The lead is cast wrong Bad Actor and (The man is a good singer / not great- good but as Frankie rolls from full voice to falsetto he does not),most parts are cast wrong.Just listening to the breath breaks ( Walk like a man) and the facial expressions / bad acting of the lead character was hard to watch...Dialogue is horrible, Script needs work (when Frankie daughter dies this man does not get that feeling of intense hurt) in places and the story should have been darker as life is - anyone who knows about success in the entertainment biz, knows you pay your dues. ArtCan I direct and produce ""The Beatles"" movie series, please: Why not actually get some casting to find great lookalikes ( there are many tribute bands out there).

"Well told, and performed with Great Music","In the mid-1950s a young singing group escapes from a life of petty crime with their first big hit: Sherry. We see the beginning of an iconic singing group to their breakup when Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young) sets out on his own with Bob Gaudio (Eric Bergen) doing the song writing. The group settles on the name of The Four Seasons (taken from a motel sign) and is much better than what they were using: The Four Lovers. See?The Four Seasons: John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli, Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito, Michael Lomenda as Nick DeVito and Eric Bergen as Bob Gaudio. Other hits: Walk Like a Man, Big Girls Don't Cry, Can't Take My Eyes off of You.The music is terrific as was the acting all around. John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli got better singing as the movie progressed. In the beginning I had my doubts mostly because Frankie Valli's voice is hard to imitate. Not convinced? Listen to the real Frankie Valli when the credits run and you will see. However, when in the group setting on stage Young does a credible job .Clint Eastwood does a masterful job of telling this story. He uses, at times, a technique whereby an actor turns to the audience to give us additional insight that doesn't have to be explained otherwise. Reminded me of a Walter Cronkite TV show YOU ARE THERE back in the day that used the same technique. (showing your age, are we?). In one scene we see a TV show with a young Clint Eastwood in Rawhide. Alfred Hitchcock used to put himself into his movies sometimes as an extra. We used to keep an eye to see who saw him first.Bob Gaudio is credited with writing all the songs sung by The Four Seasons; and later for Valli when he went out on his own. Bob Crew (Mike Doyle) also had a hand in song-writing at times.No matter what the movie is about if Christopher Walken is in it I am there. I simply cannot get enough of his acting as I couldn't for Patrick McGoohan, and Jack Palance. Anyway he was very good as Gyp DeCarlo, a local mob boss.The pacing is good and the movie never drags. Yes, there are many clichés in here but keep in mind the times and those clichés were in vogue. See?I would like to have seen real photos of the Four Seasons performing when the credits ran, but that didn't happen. What did happen was a dance by all the cast on some Jersey street as one of Frankie Valli's songs played. Very good. Kudos for the entire movie. (9/10)Violence: Not really. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Some f-bombs in the beginning then they forgot about it.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Dull and lifeless film of what should have been a great story,"Biopics, especially musical biopics, often tell the blood sweat and tears story of singers/songwriters rising from deprived childhoods or troubled backgrounds (queue 'X-factor' style soulful music) before finding fortune and fame through their musical talent. Sometimes that high can be followed by the low of drink, drugs and early death. But it is a characteristic of the genre that the journey can be fundamentally dull for the viewer unless presented with a bit of vim and style.A great example of that was ""Beyond the Sea"" with Kevin Spacey, telling the life story of Bobby Darrin. It had all the pot-boiling ingredients mentioned above, but was delivered with such cinematic verve and style that you were totally carried along with it. Similarly the recent cinematic version of Les Miserables was filled with so many compelling performances and great set-pieces that it was, and remains, one of the most emotionally-charged films for me of recent years.Unfortunately neither is the case with Clint Eastwood's cinematic version of Jersey Boys, the Broadway and West End smash hit telling the story of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. (By the way, is it just me that's confused that the ""and"" in their name should be ""of"" since there were only four of them in total??).I'm a great fan of the multi-talented Eastwood, both as an iconic actor, director and composer. But in my eyes this story was told in such a linear, corseted and boring manner that it might as well have been filmed on the stage in the style of the recent Keira Knightley version of Anna Karenina. The songs themselves are (obviously) great, but they only occasionally enliven a film that is basically dull, dull, dull.John Lloyd Young plays Valli, skirting a criminal record (excuse the pun) together with his fellow Boyz from the 'Hood but blessed with the voice of an angel. He is taken under the guiding protection of the Godfather of the neighbourhood, played with glee by the wonderful Christopher Walken: Walken's scenes are some of the highlights of the film.Erich Bergen who plays the brilliant songwriter Bob Gaudio is very good, with Lloyd Young and the other members of the band, Vincent Piazza and Michael Lomenda, being perfectly adequate. However, none of them really set the screen on fire with their chemistry. However a standout for me was Joseph Russo playing bowling pin setter and pubescent pre-actor Joe Pesci (yes, that Joe Pesci) who (good trivia fact) was the one who was instrumental (excuse the pun again) in putting the successful line-up of the band together: he plays an almost but not quite recognisable Pesci, all bug-eyed wildness and excitement.The 'breaking of the 4th wall', with the actors talking directly to the audience, works well in the theatre but really doesn't work well in this film. The dialogue they spout is so bland and obvious that there is no additional insight given.I also find it rather curious that there wasn't more effort to tidy up the film's language a bit to meet a 12 certificate (it is showing with a UK 15 certificate). There is nothing in the sex and violence area to really merit a 15 and whilst the language is no worse that you *would* hear these days in a junior school playground, a bit of judicious ""flip"" editing would have been all that would have been required to have made it much more accessible as a rounded family film and/or appeal to a broader 'grey-dollar' audience, which was the main demographic of the audience I shared this with.Above all, the biggest disappointment for me in the film was the staging of the musical numbers. If you go to see this show at the theatre - which I have - you see the 7 or 8 piece orchestra in the pit and think to yourself 'they make a really good sound, given there are so few of them'. But my expectations of a cinema score are much higher, and with Jersey Boys, from the get-go with the opening titles, the orchestration of the music is highly underwhelming. It sounds like they have brought the same 8 session players into the recording studio and said ""same again lads"". The music sounds weak, tinny and under-powered. (Compare that with the full orchestral might of the opening titles of Les Mis where you immediately thought ""My God – this is going to be good"". ) Nowhere is this more evident for me than in the staging of the classic ""Can't Take My Eyes off You"" – surely one of the greatest of Gaudio's masterpieces of songwriting (co-penned with Bob Crewe) ever put on paper. Granted, it is supposed to be set in a club with a club style of band, but the music just sounds awful – brash and cheap. By all means show the club band, but play us the LSO backing track! Unconvincing 'old men' makeup and a similarly unconvincing and joyless 'megamix' dance scene rounded off what was a rather dull, unconvincing and disappointing film for me.(If you found this review useful, please see my archive of other reviews at bob-the-movie-man.com and sign up to ""Follow the Fad""!)",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Decent picture,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Jersey Boys"" (2014) is very fine motion picture. It's a biopic that tells a story of band named ""The Four Seasons"". The music is very good here, and the actors did a great job of playing it and singing it.""Jersey Boys"" is a solid film of the great Clint Eastwood, far from his best, but a decent one - the man simply can't make a bad picture. If you know this band (i knew couple of song, with ""Can't Take My Eyes Of You"" in the first place), you will be surprised of seeing how this band came together, and what background did they come from.Overall, this is a very fine picture, solidly directed, very well acted by almost unknown for actors.

One hell of a fabulous movie!,"I saw the show on Broadway. It blew me away. I just saw the movie. It blew me away. No,I'm not trying to compare movie to stage performance. The film is an ADAPTATION of said show but nonetheless an Eastwood masterpiece. If anyone asks why I loved this film it's because it explores, in detail, those parts of the play that are more or less skimmed over. Add to it wonderful acting and that 4 Seasons sound and WOW, it's one hell of a fabulous movie. Oh by the way,just to digress one bit from concentrating on the movie, I've been going to Broadway shows for at least 50 years and ""Jersey Boys"" ranks among the top five I ever saw. And the film adaptation is going to make a lot of noise come Oscar time in Feb.'15.I met Bob Gaudio years ago, before his genius blossomed when composing those 4 Season hits. A quiet guy, quite reserved and very very tall.Tall enough to earn many millions and a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Frankie and two pals were hoods from Belleville,NJ. Nothing but petty burglars and scammers who spent time behind bars. After deciding to go straight, it was that falsetto voice of Frankie's combined with the instrumentation and harmony of his two pals that brought them into night clubs. But something was missing. Fresh new materiel and in came Bob Gaudio from Bergenfield, NJ. And those four made pop music history. Just go on You Tube, type in ""4 Seasons"" and listen for yourself.The picture did drag a bit in spots but the overall rating simply has to be a ten. Do not miss this film.

Great Adaptation of the Broadway Musical,"My mother grew up listening to Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons so my interest in this band, and story, started at a young age. My mother also went to the Jersey Shore and danced at the American Bandstand in which the Four Seasons often played. This movie illustrates the difficulties of dealing with four young men trying to make money. There are some interesting connections with Joe Pesci and others that helped them along the way.When traveling for Wojdylo Social Media, I saw the Jersey Boys musical several years ago. It was fantastic. I would strongly suggest watching the musical before watching the movie. That said, if you don't want to fork over $200 for a floor seat at a Broadway Musical in NYC or for the traveling show you can get this movie for $2 or less on Redbox or even watch it somewhere online.If you have any interest in the Four Seasons or Frankie Valli this is a must see. I recently saw Frankie Valli and the ""new"" Four Seasons in concert. Shockingly, he still has an amazing voice and the concert was absolutely great.

Jersey Boys,"As someone who isn't exactly the biggest fan of The Four Seasons, and once was sucked into seeing the Jersey Boys play out in Vegas and thought it was average, I was unsurprisingly left unmoved by JERSEY BOYS. It's not necessarily that it was bad, but the amount of indifference I have towards this film is immaculate. I can't say that the writing was positive because there were too many situations in which I should have been sad but I was laughing way too hard. There was a bizarre glossy Clintestian glare on the camera through the span of the story that did not serve any purpose besides reminding us the movie was directed by Clint Eastwood. The performances were fine, but fine was where it stopped. I feel as though an Oscar performance could have been given in a few of these roles, but a few of the characters just played it way to safe and did not try hard enough to make it special. And that exactly is the problem with the rest of JERSEY BOYS, it doesn't take enough risks to make it special. Again, its not that I didn't like the film, but I thought it was far too on the average side than it should have been. GRADE: C+",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Geeky Randy's summary,"Adaptation of Tony Award-winning musical that tells the story of the Four Seasons. John Lloyd Young plays Frankie Valli (as he did on Broadway) and you can definitely see the similarities when the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction is reenacted. It's kind of tricky to get into the music right away but when they break into ""Sherry"", you can't help but be mesmerized. Bergen, Lomenda and Piazza are all excellent as well, and Christopher Walken make a fun addition to the cast and let's not forget Joey Russo as Joey Pesci. The closing credits, while an homage to the musical, just ends up being corny. Be prepared to have the songs of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons stuck in your head for several days. SOPRANOS fans will recognize some faces; fitting, considering that Valli actually had a recurring role on the show.***½ (out of four)",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Great music,"The music was great and fairly accurately recreated. Casting was spot on and although you felt you were watching a movie about a musical it still worked.Too much profanity which was at times completely unnecessary, but overall a good movie.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Won me over,"It took me a while to get into it, but the final hour or so won me over.'Jersey Boys' is, in my eyes, very good. I only knew of the film's title and vaguely what the group did beforehand; I knew so little that I assumed their name was 'Jersey Boys', rather than 'The Four Seasons'. I did recognise a few of the songs, though only ones at the end. Even with that so, it was interesting to see the story develop.John Lloyd Young, Erich Bergen, Michael Lomenda and Vincent Piazza are all enjoyable in their respective roles, with the standouts being Young and Piazza. The support cast, which notably includes Christopher Walken, all give more than satisfactory showings.Kinda surprised me, this one. As alluded to, I wasn't really feeling it across the opening chunk of the 134 minute run time and yet by the end I felt happy at what I had just watched. Recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Is This a Movie or a Broadway Musical?,"Some films are better left as Broadway productions, and Jersey Boys unfortunately falls under that category. The film introduces us to four men, all ambitious in their own way, who eventually form a group of miraculous proportions. Thanks to the lead singer, Frankie Valli's uniquely feminine and unforgettably soothing voice, the band begins to soar to unimaginable heights, triumphantly selling record after record. This is the story of how they went from doing the mob's bidding to becoming iconic stars.However, it's an overlong biopic about musicians without the fascinating tours through their personal lives, which is what the best of musical biographies contain. Pictures like Ray and Walk the Line succeeded because they progressed with a balanced focus on both the musical career, as well as the troubles that stirred behind the scenes. Jersey Boys has very little of the latter. Sadly, the most entertaining moments are the introductory segments with the mob and the very last act where the power of their friendship is truly tested. As a matter of fact, the movie was too concentrated on their numerous stage performances and recording sessions to the point where it often got uninteresting. The over-2-hour-long duration certainly doesn't benefit the issue.Make no mistake; I had absolutely no problem with the music itself if that's the first idea that pops into one's mind upon reading my criticism. The music is indeed pleasant—occasionally mellow along with a fair share of upbeat tracks like the closing ""I Love You Baby"" piece. Nevertheless, you can't let fanaticism for particular music cloud your judgment on the overall quality of a film or whatnot. This is a movie at the end of the day—not a musical show nor a play. Its plot—its narrative—undeniably suffers the further into the picture we get. The music is nice, but the story is ultimately uneventful and intermittently soporific.When it comes to the performances on the other hand, I was rather impressed with the showcase of their acting, considering that three of the four (excluding Vincent Piazza) aren't actual actors but the real Jersey Boys in the Broadway musical. Contrary to negative critical reception to their debuts, I found them to be fairly authentic the majority of the time. On a related note, John Lloyd Young does not look sixteen years old in the earlier scenes of the film. All of them seemingly appeared to be in their 20's, not in their teen's! Moreover, Clint Eastwood still struggles with convincing aging make-up because his older-aged characters always look too similar to their younger counterparts. When you grow into your elderly years, there's more that changes about your physical appearance than just the gray hair and some wrinkles.In terms of the cinematography, I felt a little mixed on it, but that has come to be a usual response with Eastwood's works. It appeared somewhat choppy and uninspired at times (lack of effort put into beautifying the period piece that it's supposed to be and looking the part) and other times classy/elegant in a bluish and stylishly gray hue (a more fitting look for the era). If you love the music with a passion and/or if you're a serious fan of the Broadway production, Jersey Boys is worth a look. Otherwise, its dull narrative and absent energy certainly won't appease the general moviegoer.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

The hits just keep coming,"If you are a fan of the music of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons you will love this movie. If you are unfamiliar with their music, take a chance on this movie, and you may learn to love it too. If you do not like their music, well there is a chance you will like this movie anyway. I fall into the first category.Adapted from the Broadway play, the movie traces the growth of 4 young teens from the gangster streets of New Jersey, to the rise to the top of the pop music world, the breakup of the group due to financial strains and internal bickering, the rise of Frankie Valli as a solo star, and their reunion at the induction in the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame. Throughout the film their music and the wonderful performances (both dramatic and musical) by the 4 actors will bring a smile to your face.While the beginning is a little slow as director Clint Eastwood develops the background of their youthful interactions with the wrong side of the law, the pace picks up one the hits start coming. And come they do.The film probably could have done without some of the vulgar language even if still trying to maintain the realism of the story. The R-rating may be a little harsh compared to other movies and it probably did hurt the film at the box office.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Lackluster and listless,"While the cast members were very earnest and capable, I couldn't help but wonder-- why wasn't Justin Timberlake in this movie? Or someone like him? The film desperately needed some sparkle, some pizazz, some magic, all of which are antithetical to Eastwoood's choice of style for this film: Grim, gray, neo-realism...for a MUSICAL(?!)... It boggles the mind.In recent years, Broadway musicals that made the successful transition to the big screen include Dreamgirls and Chicago, both of which were heavily style-driven. Jersey Boys seems fettered by its status as a true story, docudrama, which upstages its primary appeal as a heart-stopping, eye-popping musical. For that experience, one might be better off catching a live touring production than this strained, listless, lackluster biopic movie-of-the-week.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Magic by Clint,"Just watched the 'Jersey Boys' by Clint Eastwood. I don't really know how he manages to shoot such brilliant movies in such different genres. He must be a genius. I swear I don't enjoy the music that guys from Four Seasons sing (I'm more a rock'n'roll girl), but I enjoyed every minute of this film. I am not going to spoil the fun for you and tell the plot, but It is a classical biography of a musical group. There always is a misunderstanding between group members, there always are love-related and family related problems. But still there is something magical about this movie: it catches you attention after 5 minutes of watching. I am not a big fan of Clint acting talents, but I have to admit, his every movie is a masterpiece. Thank you. Please, don't stop.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
An entertaining and fun biopic about the Four seasons,"Jersey Boys is quite possibly my favorite musical off all time. I saw it on Broadway and adored every second of it. It does help that I'm a big fan of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons as well. So I was surprised to hear that Clint Eastwood of all people was directing a musical, albeit with a mob themed element. Thankfully, the movie is very good, if flawed in some cases.One thing that you have to compliment Eastwood on is how he mainly used actors from the stage. Sure, actors like Christopher Walken and Boardwalk Empire's Vincent Piazza do have roles in it. But the majority of the main cast are actors from the musical. As a result, the performances are great as they are all familiar with their roles. Piazza and Walken do chew a lot of scenery but not to a point where it becomes annoying or over the top. John Lloyd Young who won a Tony award for playing Frankie Valli on stage continues to shine as Valli. He has the voice, charisma and looks of the singer so his performance is incredibly believable and awesome to watch. The production design is also great. Eastwood is always very good at making the audience feel like they're in a different time period. The music is of course amazing and the story is just as entertaining as it was on stage.My two biggest gripes with the film are the following. The movie is far too long. Eastwood tries to adapt every scene from the play but it doesn't necessarily work. Some scenes, particularly the ones involving Valli and his daughter drag on for far too long. At 2 hours and 15 minutes, there could've been some things they cut down.Also, the movie less feels like a musical and more like a biopic about the Four Seasons. With the exception of the final scene, there's no big song or dance number which could disappoint people. The music is still brilliant though. I just wish it felt more like a musical rather than a biopic like Ray or Beyond the Sea were.Overall, Eastwood does a good job of bringing the play from the stage to the screen. It is over long but it is saved by its music, story and acting.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

Bravo! Eastwood!,"First of all, this is not a musical. It is a movie about a band. The distinction is important in that you wouldn't want to scare away people who don't like musicals. I am one of them and also not a fan of Four Seasons. I watched it because of Eastwood's track record and wasn't disappointed. A magnificently directed movie with great acting and, yes, delightful music. Watching them perform in the context of the story made me appreciate the music. I even enjoyed ""oh, what a night"" which I hated back in the Disco era. The choices Eastwood made were great including the audience asides made by some of the actors. I don't know how accurate the screenplay was but it made for a very entertaining and touching story. It also shed light on the true genius of the band, Bob Gaudio, who wrote most of their hits. The only poor choice was the makeup crew as the actors never aged over the years until they reunited in 1990. Then, they all looked like a can of talcum powder blew up in their faces. Picky, picky, I know, but it was a great film.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Fun and lively,"Seems some people are disappointed in this film directed by Clint Eastwood. I'm not, it's just great. I love that the film is narrated by all 4 band members. It's gives a really funky perspective and reminds me that there is more than one side to every story. The acting isn't Oscar nominated but that's not what this film is about, it isn't a great exhibition of acting, it's story telling done to music, Jersey style. The characters are very stereotypical and for all I know are how the 4 Seasons behaved, I don't care. The music is wonderful, the cinematography is fab and the story moves at pace. If you need a film to watch with a drink and a couple of friends then this will have you toe tapping and singing. I'm going to say that if you are dissing it, you were expecting Dirty Harry :)",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Don't over criticize, this is a cool movie","As far as I'm concerned, Clint Eastwood is a music lover and rendering this biopic of the Four Seasons makes one more in his resume.Adapted from a Broadway musical, Jersey Boys tells the story how Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons rose to success after being so patient. Yes, there were some pitfalls (especially Tommy's shady deals which almost cost the band's career) but at the end, it brought the group to introduce the ""Jersey Sound"" with Frankie Valli's unique voice.At the end, the result is a piece of pop music history worth to watch.Even if critics panned this movie, the people decide.

clint eastwood goes musical,Review: I normally don't like musicals because I find the singing and dancing takes away from the movie for me. This is one of the few exemptions due to being balanced out by a great production team. The direction and screenplay are both really good. The costume and set are really good and truly feel like you are back during the formation of the four seasons in the 1950's to their peak of fame in the 1960's. The camera crew does an incredible job using methods like pan shots. The casting and acting is incredible also. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars.,10.0,Anonymous,Music

Detailed but not uplifting,"Often the point of a movie version of a beloved musical is to give more story and detail than the stage version. Clint Eastwood surely gives more emphasis to the story. For fans of the musical it's fascinating to watch the characters of each singer brought to life in a less rushed manner than on stage where the story is more quickly handled that it's secondary to the music. In the movie the mob connection and role of each singer is clearly shown. The period detail is good and the actors and singers are all terrific having been picked from various stage productions.Unfortunately this shift in focus is what brings a damper to the overall feel compared to the musical. The story of the struggle to succeed is interesting but the break up of the group and the family troubles of Frankie Valli are depressing. The biggest fault was what Clint did to ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" by linking Frankie Valli's daughter's death to the song and having the performance in a ballroom. In the musical it was a grand happy build up and the feel good climax of the whole show. In the movie it felt so anti climactic.Overall it's a wonderful thing to have the great songs of Jersey Boys captured on screen for immortality. So despite the faults it's still worth watching for sure.",8.0,Anonymous,Music

great even for non four seasons fans,"i have never really heard of the four seasons, or their songs really ; the only one i could identify was ""i love you baby "" and i didn't know it was them. but to be fair i do end up liking most movies with music as the backdrop. so, you need to take my review with a slight pinch of salt. let me offset that by saying that i saw that on a plane; and i think i ended up abandoning my last 10-15 movies on a plane in the first half hour or so ( its so easy to switch if you;re not enjoying yourself). so it is a very well made movie, and holds you right till the end. i am impressed by clint eastwood pulling off this different genre. the acting is good all round, and vincent piazza is just great ! the music is a bonus indeed ! there is a lesson hidden in the movie, or maybe i saw one. its how success takes its price, and you end up thinking if its really worth it. really, what do you get out of being successful , an ego massage with millions worshipping you ; but you lose everything else. anybody would i guess !",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Eastwood applies his usual polished touch to this re-creation of one of the great pop bands,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningFrankie Casstalucio (John Lloyd Young) is a young man in New Jersey, who ekes out a living as a hair-dresser, but who possesses an incredible, falsetto voice that reduces grown men (such as local mobster Gyp DeCarlo (Christopher Walken)) to tears. Stuck with two bit hustler friends, headed by local loudmouth Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza), he has the option to follow their example and head in and out of prison all the time, or really make something of his life. Which, thankfully, he did, and the film charts his triumphs, tragedies and adventures as part of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.Of all the iconic bands, that were part of the 'golden age' of music, Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons were easily the most 'marmite' of the lot of them (you loved them or hated them.) Either Valli's shrieking, ear-piercing falsetto voice is music to your ears, or the sort of thing they should use at Guantanamo Bay. Personally, given it was all music well before my time, they must have been something special to really stand out and have so many songs that I loved. And it seems others think the same way, since the hit Broadway musical this is based on has been such an astronomical success, and still enjoys tours nationally to this day (not to mention the up-coming tour Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons themselves will be doing this summer, even in their eighties, probably on the back of all that.). And so, Clint Eastwood, no less, has seen fit to adapt it into this film presentation.Adapting it from a musical is a risky strategy, though. As a result, the pace of the story-telling rubs off on the screen, and some of the character's (most notably Piazza's Tommy DeVito) come off somewhat larger than life, which affects the tone of the drama. That's not to say it's any less affecting, when it wants to be, and that the young cast don't do a great job of re-creating the young men in their prime. Eastwood has shown typical shrewdness by casting a group of unknowns, so that the legend of Valli and his cohorts aren't over shadowed by the presence of any modern day hunks.For those that prefer the story captured on screen rather than stage, Eastwood, who maybe had an affection for the band nobody ever knew about, has applied his usual deft touch and delivered something that gets it just right. ****",9.0,Anonymous,Music
Eastwood Lights Up New Jersey's Greatest Musicians.,"This has got to be one of the best musical biopics ever made. I'm talking up there with Ray, De- Lovely, La Bamba and the Buddy Holly Story. Not really sure which is the best of the ones before Jersey Boys, I will say all are equal and Jersey Boys is equal to them. If I had to pick a favourite, it would probably have to be the Buddy Holly Story because I love Buddy Holly the most. Since I love Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons so much, it may be my second favourite.Clint Eastwood is one of the coolest movie star ever as well as one of the best directors ever. Unforgiven is easily my favourite movie he has directed, Jersey Boys is my second favourite. I did notice mostly negative reviews on different sites and by different critics just before writing this. They picked at too much melodrama and subplots, as well as this being somewhat below Eastwood's filmmaking standards. The movies would not have been as good if it was directed by anybody else. Perhaps Martin Scorsese or Ron Howard would have been the only other worthy candidates for this. I guess you have to be a huge fan of the Four Seasons and love musicals in general to love this.Jersey Boys brilliantly documents the early days of lowlife street thugs from New Jersey with ties to the mafia that become musical sensations, to their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990. Yes, this is a true story about Frankie Valli & the Four Seasons, but this is adapted directly from the Broadway play of the same name. I hear the play is one of the best out there, and the original Frankie Valli from the play actually plays Valli in the movie. As an actor, he plays him very well, and his singing matches Valli perfectly. Frankie Valli has a very high voice that most people can't quite reach, and those that can don't sound much like him. John Lloyd Young can hit the notes and sing like him perfectly. I thought that there actually were portions where he was lip-syncing, but I was fooled. All the other actors are played with heart and strong believability. Their musicianship is as dead-on as Young's alone. We get a good look into their roots and single lives too. As most would think, too many subplots is bad, but just enough is down so that they are not rushed, yet not so little that they are pointless.The general look of the film keeps the audience intrigued and feeling warm. It bears a strong resemblance to Goodfellas. In Goodfellas, Martin Scorsese creates the perfect look of 1950's New Jersey (or maybe it was New York) and Clint Eastwood emulates the look. But it isn't a precise copy. Since Jersey Boys is a musical, Eastwood made everything look nicer and more artsy by adding more colours, nicer costumes and better filming. As the movie progresses past the 50s, Eastwood keeps the sharp look coming.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Everything You Could Ask,"Remarkable direction from Clint Eastwood, who can apparently do anything! The stage play is beautifully adapted to film, with many of the original actors reprising their roles in this biopic. The story of the rise and fall and rise of The Four Seasons is filled with great dramatic scenes with all the group's greatest hits woven beautifully into the film. The last act is a blast, when the whole cast sings ""Oh, What a Night"" dancing in the street. This is everything you could ask for in a musical film.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
A Cry for Creativity,"It isn't that the music in the (20 years and counting) run of musical anthologies is that great, although the ABBA collection in ""Mamma Mia"" which started it all comes close, and it isn't even the nostalgia; it's the lack of inspiration in song writing that's able to make it past the gauntlet of suits who think music is rehashing a sound that semi-worked....once. You need go no further than the pitti-pat music in the otherwise excellent previews that accompanied this movie. This is a cry not for Frankie Valli, but for music with a spark of something, anything, but the same ol' same ol'. Nowhere is musical creative cowardice more evident than Broadway with it's assembly-line approach to boiler-plating the musical, substituting Novocaine for its claim-to-fame lifeblood. ""Frozen"" has been very popular, but only because most of the audiences haven't been numbed by the Broadway rut. Why else this major resurrection of 50 year old pop music? This is of course is a back-handed complement for this well done Eastwood production, which only makes me long all the more for some modern Euterpian creativity, especially from Broadway and Hollywood. Certainly these characters weren't heroes, mostly just Jersey punks, except maybe for Bob Gaudio, the song writer...as irony would have it",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Really Enjoyable,"A real treat. What makes Clint Eastwood such a great filmmaker is that even when he has no real personal involvement in a project he's still able to create a solid, beautifully crafted entertainment--he proves that when the time comes, he can let go of the serious themes that are so crucial to his oeuvre and simply enjoy the moment. Adapted from the jukebox musical by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elise (who wrote the musical's book), Eastwood, retaining the conceit of having the performers address the audience, opens up the play's sparse staging to capture an essence of Jersey in the Fifties (with an affectionate nod to Scorsese); he easily highlights the humor in the development of the Four Seasons from hoodlums with talent to a polished professional quartet and masterfully paces the film as it transitions to more melodramatic, yet equally compelling, conflicts. You can tell Eastwood really likes this material. Although some may find the characterizations cheesy, they're performed with eagerness and sincerity, with particular notice to be paid to Vincent Piazza as Tommy DeVito, whose id proves to be the group's undoing. As it was onstage, the songs are the thing (although, as Frankie Valli, John Lloyd Young's falsetto seems a little rough) and their significance in popular music cannot be overstated; indeed, a case could be made for writer/producer Bob Gaudio being one of the most important musicians of the twentieth century.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
"Juicy, Schmaltzy Biopic with a Fake NJ Accent","""Jersey Boys"" is a sudsy, juicy, schmaltzy music biopic with a fake New Jersey accent. I'm from New Jersey and nobody here talks like that. The movie is fun and heartwarming but I liked it and didn't love it.John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli is the heart and soul of the movie. Early in the film the film focuses on Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza). DeVito is more of a small time hood than a musician and this part of the film plays like a goofy Mafia movie. Tommy wants to give a new band member one left shoe, telling him that he will be able to give him a right shoe later. Tommy gets these shoes by pilfering from transported goods.There is a scene of Italian-American parents eating spaghetti and that feels clichéd. I grew up among New Jersey Italians and this aspect of the movie, to me, felt more as if it were inspired by Clint Eastwood watching films about Italians from New Jersey rather than his actually attempting to depict real people.I wish there had been more focus on ethnicity in the movie. How did it feel to four Italian guys from New Jersey with Mafia ties and criminal records to become number one musicians? There is a scene where a producer tells them, ""Come back when you are black"" and slams the door in their faces. In another scene, Frankie's soon-to-be wife advises him on spelling his last name in a way that will lead to success. Yes, he should shorten his name, but he should be sure to end it in a vowel, because Italian last names must end in a vowel, unlike WASP last names. In still another scene she ridicules him as a WOP from NJ who never finished high school. There are hints of what it meant to be Italian in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, but the movie doesn't flesh out this aspect of the story.The movie really came alive for me through Frankie's relationship with his daughter Francine, and his taking the reins after Tommy DeVito's shenanigans cause too much trouble for the group. John Lloyd Young as Frankie Valli is poignant. He is physically small, as is Frankie Valli in real life, and he plays Valli as a relatively quiet guy, while Tommy is played as more flamboyant. It's rewarding to watch Valli come into his own.Christopher Walken is simply wonderful as Gyp DeCarlo, a member of the Genovese crime family whom Valli identifies as a father figure. In real life, Gyp DeCarlo was a loanshark and murderer. The film romanticizes him.For a movie that depicts the rise of a pop group, ""Jersey Boys"" doesn't pay as much attention as it might to music. The early part of the movie focuses more on petty crime, and later it's more about the dynamics of the band member's petty squabbles with each other and the women in their lives.I wish more attention had been paid to doo-wap and other social and musical influences. The Four Seasons era, from the 1950s to the 1970s, is one of the most creatively fertile times in American pop music. None of that is addressed in any serious way. And I wish there had been more start-to-finish musical numbers, rather than song snips.All in all, though, I really liked this movie. It's the kind of movie that makes you want to go home and google this or that strand of the story to see if the film is true to life. Apparently, yes, ""Jersey Boys"" is a very accurate bio-pic.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
For the Most Part - Jersey Boys Sings!,"Director Clint Eastwood employs the technique of characters talking directly to the camera at times during ""Jersey Boys"" - The story of musical group Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons, based on the Broadway Show ""Jersey Boys"". I don't know if the same technique is employed in the Broadway show. The acting performances by all four main players are good – John Lloyd Young as Valli, Vincent Piazza as Tommy Devito, Michael Lomenda a Nick Massi, and Erich Bergen as Bob Gaudio. Christopher Walken also does well is his supporting role as Mob Boss Gyp DeCarlo. The first half of the Movie is really good. The second half dips a little, and then turns dark understandably. Usually when the technique of talking to the camera is employed, it is one character. In ""Jersey Boys"" the 3 other members of the group to Valli narrate at different points, with only Young talking during a Final Sequence at the end. It becomes Valli's story alone during most of the last 3rd of the movie, while it seemed to be the story of all of them prior, though mostly Devito and Valli, which makes using the multiple narrators slightly odd. Overall – an entertaining movie – 3 1/4 out of 4 Stars.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
