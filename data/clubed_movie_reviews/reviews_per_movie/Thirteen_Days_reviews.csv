In a word - WOW!,"In 1962, the world stood on the brink of World War III for ""Thirteen Days,"" a 2000 film starring Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, Steven Culp and Dylan Baker, with direction by Roger Donaldson. The story concerns the ""Cuban Missile Crisis,"" when the U.S. discovered that the Soviets had placed missiles aimed at the U.S. in Cuba.As someone who remembers the situation well, watching this was a profound experience in more ways than one. A good deal of dialogue was taken from actual Presidential transcripts, which made watching it even more impressive. Looking at it from today's eyes, ""Thirteen Days"" is a knockout.Donaldson focuses the film right where it should be - in the White House and in conference rooms, giving us only the subplot of Kenny O'Donnell's family life. For those posters who commented that O'Donnell was perhaps not a real person, yes, he was. It's impossible for me to believe that with a film that goes into so much detail and strove to be so factual, someone thought there was a made-up character. Try Google next time. Ken O'Donnell headed up Kennedy's presidential campaign and was appointed his Special Assistant when Kennedy won the White House. He was the most powerful of the President's advisers.Several things become clear about the goings-on at the White House in 1962: None of the military leaders thought the Kennedy administration belonged in the White House; if it had been up to the military leaders, the situation would have caused World War III; JFK turned himself into a pretzel in order to pursue a diplomatic solution to the potential conflict. Though discouraged almost at every turn, JFK still would not allow the shooting to begin, pushing instead for an embargo against Cuba.There is plenty of tension and excitement in this film. One of the best scenes is Commander Eckerd (Christopher Lawford) and his team low-flying over Cuba taking photos, and a U-2 pilot trying to avoid missiles chasing him. But most of the tension and excitement takes place in the meetings as the President and RFK struggle for answers and play for time. The mix is therefore ideal: drama, some aerial excitement, and a little humor as Adlai Stevenson gets the better of the Russians in an OAS meeting.There's also a look at the reaction of the country - also very accurate. Yes, people piled into church, cleared the grocery shelves of everything, and stocked fallout shelters. We all watched the President on television. In fact, as he talked, my mother thought he was about to declare war. It was a terrifying time.Kenny O'Donnell's role in all of this may have been somewhat exaggerated to make it a palatable role for Kevin Costner. Costner does okay in the part. Boston accents are very difficult to do without them sounding put on. It's very difficult to do accents in general and make them organic to the character. A few have succeeded: Anne Bancroft in ""The Miracle Worker,"" Paul Newman in ""Somebody Up There Likes Me,"" little Natalie Wood in ""Tomorrow is Forever,"" Travolta in ""Saturday Night Fever,"" and of course there are others. Jane Seymour and Joan Collins can easily pull off being Americans. All British actors can do a southern accent, since the southern accent started off as a British accent. Costner lays it on too thick and it's a distraction. But he certainly isn't bad in the role.The casting people merely wanted to suggest JFK and RFK. In Steven Culp, they found a young actor with similar features to RFK. He does an effective job, given that it's tough going to portray such a famous person. The most successful in the film is Bruce Greenwood as JFK, who tries to keep the accent from overpowering the dialogue. In the President's television speech, I'm sure he imitated JFK's every single inflection and pause, and it's perfect. His JFK is a listener, very dependent on his brother's advice, and one who takes the burdens of the country on his shoulders like a cross. One of the posters here mentioned something to the effect that ""we are led to believe that JFK leaned heavily on his advisors"" as if this is a negative. Of course he did. Of course any President does or should. The final decisions belonged to him, and he had to be sure of all of the ramifications. Only an idiot doesn't hear every single opinion of value before he decides to launch World War III.The camaraderie between RFK, JFK, and O'Donnell is as unmistakable as their arguments and frustrations.Thirteen months after the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK would be dead and O'Donnell would be riding behind him in the Secret Service Car. After a particularly tough meeting with the Joint Chiefs of Staff, O'Donnell insists that JFK sit for a minute, and JFK finally does. Worn out and not sleeping well, he laments about being President. ""I just thought there would be more good days."" In the end, we - and he - would have settled for just MORE days.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Historic movie about Cuban Missile Crisis with intrigue , tension and good performances","The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis seen through the eyes of President assistant Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner who hands perfectly the role )as trusted confidante and with significance importance of Robert Kennedy ( Steven Culp who bears remarkable resemblance )and of course President John F . Kennedy ( a solid Bruce Greenwood ) . This interesting film widely develops the Cuban Missile Crisis that was a confrontation between the Soviet Union, Cuba and the United States in October 1962, during the Cold War. The picture is packed with suspense , drama , historical deeds and is quite entertaining . It's correctly based on facts and the few sacrifices of accuracy are realized in the sense of of dramatic license . The motion picture is very well directed by Roger Donaldson who formerly worked with Costner in another suspenseful movie and also plenty of political intrigue titled ¨No way out (87) ¨ .Adding more details over the widely depicted on the movie the events happened of the following manner : In September 1962, the Cuban and Soviet governments began to surreptitiously build bases in Cuba for a number of medium- and intermediate-range ballistic nuclear missiles (MRBMs and IRBMs) with the ability to strike most of the continental United States. This action was subsequent to the 1958 deployment of Thor IRBMs in the UK and Jupiter IRBMs to Italy and Turkey in 1961; more than 100 U.S.-built missiles having the capability to strike Moscow with nuclear warheads. On October 14, 1962, a United States U-2 photo-reconnaissance plane captured photographic proof of Soviet missile bases under construction in Cuba.The ensuing crisis ranks with the Berlin Blockade as one of the major confrontations of the Cold War and is generally regarded as the moment in which the Cold War came closest to turning into a nuclear conflict .The US President ( Bruce Greenwood) , Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp ),State Secretary Robert McNamara ( Dylan Baker ) and his military staff ( Bill Smitrovich , Ed Lauter , James Karen , Len Cariou) and general Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway ) considered attacking Cuba via air and sea and settled on a ""quarantine"" of Cuba. The U.S. announced that it would not permit offensive weapons to be delivered to Cuba and demanded that the Soviets dismantle the missile bases already under construction or completed in Cuba and remove all offensive weapons. The Kennedy administration held a slim hope that the Kremlin would agree to their demands, and expected a military confrontation. On the Soviet end, Nikita Khrushchev wrote Kennedy that his quarantine of ""navigation in international waters and air space to constitute an act of aggression propelling humankind into the abyss of a world nuclear-missile war."" Fidel Castro encouraged Khrushchev to launch a preemptive first-strike nuclear attack on the U.S. The Soviets publicly balked at the U.S. demands, but in secret back-channel communications initiated a proposal to resolve the crisis. The confrontation ended on October 28, 1962 when President John F. Kennedy and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant reached an agreement with Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to dismantle the offensive weapons and return them to the Soviet Union, subject to United Nations verification, in exchange for an agreement by the United States to never invade Cuba. The Soviets removed the missile systems and their support equipment, loading them onto eight Soviet ships from November 5–9. A month later, on December 5 and 6, the Soviet IL-28 bombers were loaded onto three Soviet ships and shipped back to Russia. The quarantine was formally ended previously on November 20, 1962. As a secret part of the agreement, all US-built Thor and Jupiter IRBMs deployed in Europe were deactivated by September 1963.The Cuban Missile Crisis spurred the creation of the Hotline Agreement and the Moscow-Washington hot line, a direct communications link between Moscow and Washington .",7.0,Anonymous,History
"Thirteen Days was a wonderfully acted, wonderfully told story about the 13 days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, a time when the world almost came to an end.","Shown through the eyes of presidential aide Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), we see the inner workings of President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his closest advisors as they try and find the best way to end a potentially devastating showdown with the U.S.S.R. In October of 1962, the U.S., during a regular mission photographing Cuba, spotted a missile buildup by the Russians. The missiles were powerful enough to kill 80 million Americans with only 5 minutes of warning time. President Kennedy had to decide quickly what action to take. With his trusted aide Kenny O'Donnell and his brother Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy (Steven Culp), and others such as Robert McNamara, Adlai Stevenson, McGeorge Bundy, Dean Acheson, Dean Rusk, and many more, Kennedy needed to figure out the best course of action. If he allowed the Russians to aim these missiles at the U.S., the United States would be placed in a potentially deadly situation. If Kennedy allowed the military to attack the missiles and destroy them, what would Russia do as a response? If he waited too long, would Russia simply attack the U.S.? If he backed down and agreed to take down U.S. missiles in Turkey, would the U.S. then look weak to the rest of the world? For such a young President, Kennedy had a lot of tough decisions to make, in a short amount of time, with the world hanging in the balance.I wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis as it occurred, so seeing Thirteen Days was like having a history lesson at the same time as having great entertainment. Even though I knew that we didn't end up in World War III, there were a lot of things I didn't know. I won't go into any of the specifics, but I never fully understood how close we came to destroying the planet. The tensions of the time were brought out successfully by director Roger Donaldson. You could see and feel the sweat on all the major players as each minute ticked by. Bruce Greenwood did a tremendous job as the young President Kennedy, showing how Kennedy was strong enough to stand by his morals and values, even as his most trusted advisors were urging him to go to war. At the same time, Greenwood was able to portray Kennedy as someone who needed help and was able to turn to his brother for guidance. Kevin Costner did a good job as Kennedy's presidential aide. I especially liked his boston accent.  Costner was a strong personality that worked well with Greenwood and Steven Culp. I believed that the three of them were friends for 15 years and that they trusted each other with their own lives. Other acting standouts to me were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson.Even running at almost two and a half hours, I was always at the edge of my seat, wondering what was going to happen next. Like I said before, I wasn't even born yet, nor was it something I ever learned about in school, so I had no idea what was going to happen. It was nice being able to get deep inside the mind of these important people during this crucial time. Of course, I have no idea if what was said during these meetings was actually said in real life, but I'd like to believe that at least the outcomes of the meetings were true. I'm a big fan of these kinds of dramatic films based on real life events. While being entertaining, they also have the ability to teach you about history. Reading about these situations in books isn't nearly as enjoyable as being able to watch them on screen. I think screenwriter David Self did a great job of bringing these real life events to life on the big screen. He made it historical but didn't bore you with too much talk or information. Along with Donaldson, he gave you what you needed to know, and let the actors bring you into the action.So overall, I thought Thirteen Days was a great film. Well acted, well directed, well written, nice musical score and very entertaining throughout. And if you happen to learn something along the way like I did, then even better.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Thrilling Examination Of A Tense Moment In History,"The fact of JFK's assassination, and especially the highly mysterious circumstances surrounding it, has resulted in a very distinct historical niche being carved around him.  However, the majority of written examinations have concerned his assassination.  The man's presidency, short though it was, was fraught with fascinating events and, both in literature and in film, they remain frustratingly under-examined.  Which is why ""Thirteen Days"" is such a treat.What the film essentially does is offer us a clearly partly-fictionalised but fairly true to the events account of the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.  It's a fascinating close-up on a fascinating man, who might have been a truly great president if he had gotten a proper chance.  Of course, the filmic portrayal of JFK may be just a tad overly sympathetic, and the treatment of the military a tad overly harsh, and the importance of Kenny O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner, is probably exaggerated, but these are minor quibbles.  What this film really does is show us just how complicated and multi-faceted was the problem of Russian nuclear missiles being installed in Cuba.  Not only did the president have to face the dim and distant threat of a faceless Russian bureaucracy, he had to deal with the multiple and conflicting options constantly being advanced to him, the dangers posed by certain special interests in military and intelligence and the popular opinion of the American people.  The repercussions of any number of different courses of action were almost unthinkable.  Tilting the hand seemingly in the American favour in one place, say in Cuba, would destabilise another danger zone, such as Berlin. Despite the fact that we all know how the events played out in the end, it can't be denied that this film keeps adding to the tension constantly, occasionally letting off a little and then piling on a whole lot more.  It's a wonderful portrayal.At its core, however, the film is an intelligent study of the ultimately paralysing effects of power, and the stark horror of mutual destruction as made possible by the harnessing of atomic power.  The discovery of nuclear fission reactions has forever changed the face of warfare, because there now exists an ultimate solution so terrible it is almost beyond contemplation. In the comparatively safer times in which we now live, it is easy to forget how possible, perhaps even likely, the threat of nuclear war.  America was then, and remains now, the most powerful nation on the planet, and yet a single wrong move could have ended all that, and at the cost of millions of innocent lives.  Bearing the weight of decisions which could cost so much must have been a horrible burden to Kennedy, and, if nothing else, we should thank our lucky stars that he didn't buckle under the multifarious pressures placed on him.  This film is a tribute to reason over hotheadedness, and peace over war.  We should not forget the lessons that time has to impart, and if this represents a way to remember, then everyone ought to watch it.",,Anonymous,History
Gripping but simplistic account,"I'm showing the film now to my history seniors so felt obliged to comment on it. Whilst the film is undeniably gripping as a political thriller, it takes considerable liberties with historical facts, thereby compromising its value as an educational resource on this critical period in Cold War history.One of the most glaring inaccuracies in the film is the exaggerated role of Kenneth O'Donnell, played by Kevin Costner. O'Donnell, who was a special assistant to President Kennedy, is portrayed as an influential figure in the crisis, often present in high-level meetings and even influencing the President's decisions. In reality, O'Donnell was not a key player in the crisis management and was largely uninvolved in the ExComm meetings, which were attended by experts in foreign policy and military strategy. The film's focus on O'Donnell seems to be a deliberate attempt to create a relatable character for the audience, but it distorts the historical record and minimises the roles of pivotal figures like Secretary of Defence Robert McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk.Another point of contention is the film's portrayal of President Kennedy, played by Bruce Greenwood. While the film does capture Kennedy's calm and rational demeanor, it fails to delve into the complexities of his decision-making process. The President is shown as almost unilaterally steering the United States away from military action, whereas, in reality, he was under immense pressure from his military advisors to authorize an airstrike against Soviet missile sites in Cuba. The film simplifies the intricate discussions and debates that took place among the ExComm members, reducing them to a binary choice between war and peace.Furthermore, the Soviet perspective is conspicuously absent from the narrative. The film does not delve into the motivations of Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev or explore the geopolitical considerations that led the Soviet Union to place missiles in Cuba. This omission perpetuates a one-sided view of the crisis and fails to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay of factors that averted a nuclear catastrophe.The film also glosses over the role of backchannel communications between the United States and the Soviet Union, which were crucial in resolving the crisis. The secret correspondence between Attorney General Robert Kennedy and Soviet Ambassador Anatoly Dobrynin played a significant role in reaching a peaceful resolution, yet this is scarcely mentioned in the film.So whilst ""Thirteen Days"" succeeds as a suspenseful dramatisation of a critical moment in history, it falls short as an accurate representation of the events it depicts. The film takes liberties with historical facts, exaggerates the roles of certain individuals, and omits key aspects of the crisis, thereby providing a skewed understanding of the Cuban Missile Crisis. As such, it should be viewed as a piece of historical fiction rather than a reliable educational resource.My site- Tracesofevil com.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Factual??,"I served aboard the USS Joseph P. Kennedy which was depicted in the film. The Kennedy was the ship that boarded the Marcula in the waters off the Bahamas. The Kennedy, now part of Battleship cove in Fall River, Ma., actually played herself in the film. The actual boarding was not as quite dramatic as depicted in the movie.The boarding party for instance did not wear dress white uniforms and the Marcula was more of a ""rust bucket"" than depicted in the movie. Although the 5 inch guns were aimed at the vessel, I don't recall a shot being fired.As far as the movie is concerned I though it gave a rather accurate accounting of the circumstances that surrounded this time in history with a few embellishment's that are purely thrown in as theatrical license.",8.0,Anonymous,History
An old Fashioned Nail Biter,"Thirteen Days brings back the good old fashioned (and I mean good) nailbiter film here and even if you know history (thus knowing the outcome), there is still some good stuff here.  Things that might've not been known to the average American back then now are revealed in thrilling tension that is only slightly eased by Kevin Costner who doesn't need to really be there (and has a stronger JFK accent that JFK does in this movie).  The look at the Cuban missle crisis here is the heart of the movie and it works pretty good.  Not great but good, and if your looking for a historical thriller, this is the one for the season.

Almost the end of civilization as we know it.,"I watched this movie today with a number of students from my International Politics class, and from the standpoint of a politics professor, this film was absolutely extraordinary. This is a movie about the development of foreign policy in a crisis; it spells out with brilliant detail the decision-making process of JFK's inner circle, the tension between the Executive Office of the President and the Departments of State and Defense, and the attempts by the Military Industrial Complex (namely the Joint Chiefs) to undermine the diplomatic approaches favored by the president. It highlights the conflict between military standard operating procedures (""rules of engagement"") and the better judgment/common sense of right-thinking human beings. It hints at conspiracies to (later) depose and otherwise get rid of both Kennedy and Khruschev from within for what turned out to be a very unpopular resolution with the hardliners on both sides. I especially like that the movie acknowledged the humanity of the individual decision-makers without getting too Capra-esquire or preachy.I can see why this film hasn't been a great commercial success. It is not your standard big studio fare. It's quite cerebral, and although it has some exciting pre-conflict scenes, it's not a ""war film"". (It reminds me a bit of ""Three Kings"" in that regard- both films were, in my opinion, mis-marketed. They both seemed to target the younger male action crowd, when both movies are really made for a more intellectual audience.) I liked how the Soviets were not cartoonishly vilified, as is common in a lot of Cold War era films. They were shown to be somewhat calculating and strategic, but not irrational or more importantly, inhuman. In fact, one of the most fascinating parts of the film is the revelation that both sides lack information as to the other side's true intentions. It was this uncertainty that back in October 1962, could have led to the end of civilization as we know it.The acting was solid (Steven Culp was very, very good as Robert Kennedy- so good, in fact, that I'm afraid he'll have a hard time getting cast in the future. There was audible gasp in the audience when he came on the screen and WAS Bobby). Coaster's accent was actually annoying (as an earlier reviewer noted), but it's forgivable in light of the moving, somewhat understated performance he turns in. It is the directing that takes the cake, however. From the moment the chain of events was set in motion, the tension does NOT let up. It actually feels like you are back in 1962 living through the events of those two weeks- honestly, there was nary a moment to relax until the resolution was wrought. I recommend this film especially strongly to high school and college age students who are too young to have any Cold War memory, as well as to those who lived through the era and may have forgotten what it felt like to come this close.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"See ""The Missiles of October"" instead","I had assumed that this film was going to be just another Kennedy hagiography. But really, JFK came off as less decisive, and somewhat unsure of himself. In fact, it made it look like Kenny O'Donnell saved the world. Costner and the rest of the no-name cast did OK. About Costner's Boston accent; at least he tried. Not everyone can be Meryl Streep. I'm a Southerner, so if he murdered the accent, I cannot tell. But it would seem silly for a movie about all these Bostonians to have characters that all sound like they're from Nebraska or California. It'd be a little like those films with Arnold Schwarzenegger playing an (native-born) American. The action scenes with the planes and ships were well-done. But overall, I'd say this movie is not as good as ""The Missiles of October"". Grade: C-",6.0,Anonymous,History
Very well done.,"Poor Kevin Costner. I get the feeling that he just can't win no matter what he does. He gets slammed for being in films and not using an appropriate accent. Need we look any further than 'Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves'? When he does use an accurate accent, as he does in 'Thirteen Days,' he gets slammed for trying to elevate his game to a playing field dominated by more well liked method actors. I've heard an argument before that he should just stick to making westerns since, allegedly, they're the only films that he does well. Many would immediately argue that 'Wyatt Earp' cancels out 'Dances With Wolves.' I argue instead that people are just too hard on Kevin Costner and 'Thirteen Days' is a very good example of why he deserves a bit of a break.'Thirteen Days' was the fastest two and a half hours that I've sat through in a long time. The film was absolutely engrossing and very tense. Everyone knows what happens (or should be able to infer it since we'd all be dead right now if things hadn't worked out so well) but the writing and direction deserve great credit. They were able to transfer the tension from the historical situation and bring it to the screen with electricity. I think it works brilliantly well for two main reasons: 1. The viewer may know what is going to happen, but the characters don't. They are stressed, terrified and at the breaking point. One wrong move and the whole world is obliterated. If that isn't good drama, I don't know what is. 2. The film makers very wisely resisted the impulse to try and show things from the Soviet point of view. The strength of the film is the peril of the situation and the terror of not knowing what the other guy is trying to do. By filming from solely an American perspective and keeping both the characters and audience in the dark, this character driven movie excels.A second brilliant strategy employed by the film makers was in the casting. With the exception of Costner, there are no real stars. Instead there are more reliable, hard-working and chameleon-like character actors. Len Cariou, Dylan Baker, Stephen Culp, and Bruce Greenwood are just a small sampling. Greenwood plays JFK and excellently plays a man desperate for peace but surrounded by calls for swift military action. He sees the bigger picture where others don't, but may not be able to navigate the smaller picture without help. Dylan Baker is a doppelganger and his performance as McNamara is spot on.Highly recommended.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Above average portrayals-Lopsided Film,"I'll be the first to admit, I love history and international politics. That's the primary factor that drew me to THIRTEEN DAYS. Yes, since Kevin Costner was in it, I figured JFK would be lionized (and he was). No poolside parties in this picture. The situation is extreme.The most glaring distraction away from this motion picture, is Costner's Harvard-inspired, jackhammer-to-the-skull accent. The fact that it fades in and out does not help.The portrayals by virtually a whole troupe of players is exceptional, with Steven Culp as RFK, the standout. Michael Fairman was excellent as Adlai Stevenson (uncredited role no less!). THIRTEEN DAYS explores the certain factions within the US government, and tactics used to address the crisis. There is little or no action sequences to speak of, yet through a well written script, there is a great deal of tension.What would have made THIRTEEN DAYS more interesting, would have been the exploration of the reasoning and motivations for the Soviets to place missiles in Cuba. Was it over Berlin? Was it over our missiles aimed directly at them from Turkey? I'm sure Premier Khruschev didn't provide Cuba with this kind of heavy duty equipment on a whim. With access to people near Khruschev (of those times) easier during these times, this would have balanced the film out. His son became a US citizen not too long ago.Why not present both sides? The only people who present only one side (as the Soviet government did many times in its past), is indicative of those who have something to hide. Why not show both sides playing global chess? It would have made for a more resoundingly fair minded film.THIRTEEN DAYS is recommendable and good in spots, it just should have been better.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Good view on possibly the most tense thirteen days of the 20th century.,"Basically this movie is a great history lesson. If you want to know more about the cold war and the Cuba missile crisis in particular this is a perfect medium for you to start with. The movie is quite detailed and accurate even though of course some moments and characters have been 'over-dramatized' for the good of the movie and its flow and emotions.Even though you already know from start till finish how this movie is going to end, it still is a tense movie to watch. The story is build up well and makes the movie really interesting and compelling to follow. It perfectly captures the tension of the whole crisis and really makes you realize how close the world actually came to a WW III. It makes us aware of the fact that those 13 days in history should always be remembered and used as a lesson for the entire world now and forever. It's too bad that the movie becomes a bit too moralistic at times, especially toward the ending.Bruce Greenwood doesn't really look like JFK but he's a good actor, so he becomes believable enough in his role trough his acting skills. Steven Culp really does look like Robert Kennedy and on top of that he also is a great actor. I wasn't always happy with Kevin Costner performance but overall he did an acceptable job. There are some weaker moments which involves his character but I more blame those moments to the at times too moralistic written script.A bit of a disappointing aspect of the whole movie is its style. Roger Donaldson at times tries to be over-artistic and mixes the movie with black & white and color images. Perhaps he tried to copy Oliver Stone's style? Who knows. The cinematography was also disappointingly standard but thankfully the good editing saved this a little. Also the musical score by Trevor Jones is surprisingly solid.Overall it's a very good political movie that has some great tense and important moments in it and also works great as a history lesson.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",8.0,Anonymous,History
Kevin Costner does Simple Jack,"Although he doesn't appear it, Kevin Costner was at the time of this filming -- and perhaps even today -- mentally disabled, and he does an amazing turn as a mentally disabled Kenneth O'Donnell, personal assistant to the Kennedy's in various roles, a capable man who in actual history was more of a ""fly on the wall,"" during these issues. Costner's interpretation of O'Donnell with a strange speech impediment was an artistic choice I scratched my head over, but Kevin Costner did all those salacious things a person has to do to achieve his station (it was nice knowing you, Meritocracy). Anytime there is a story of unbelievable circumstances, you usually have someone with which the audience can identify (think Lois Lane in Superman), so I think the unskilled screenwriter made Simple Jack Costner that character. Watching his performance, I wondered if they were casting this, and Costner was jumping up and down, saying, ""I want to play Kennedy! I want that role! Listen -- listen ... I been wathing The Simpsons. The mayor of Springfield is patterned after Jack Kennedy! CHOW-DAH! Say it, Frenchie! CHOWWWW_DAH! See, I can do it!"" But he can't. It's not just the accent; if Costner is trying to play angry or threatening, he makes you erupt into laughter. Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp? That's where it gets impressive. Greenwood doesn't forget John Kennedy's physical pain from war injuries, and both know the limits of their accent performance. There is an old saying in acting: ""If you're doing an accent, you're acting the accent,"" not the character, but Greenwood and Culp probably ran around talking like that, recording themselves and correcting, because the performance bears that out.The choices of the screenwriter are horrible, With steadicam, we could have just been in the rooms where this took place. We didn't need O'Donnell, but O'Donnell's son was an investor in the film or the production company, I forgot which. The photography of this film holds to the standard of a made-for-TV movie, but the inclusion of polished-up, actual historical footage is noteworthy while blending seemlessly into the overall film.This is a film -- look, if you have a Sunday afternoon to kill, and you love history, this is your movie. It's a movie your dad would watch on AMC or something and say, ""Yeah, that movie was alright."" It gives you American good guys and Russkie bad guys. That made me wish there was a version from the Soviet perspective I could show you guys. That would be funny as hell.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Pure Propaganda...Bad Direction,"There are two major aspects of this movie that I reviled: 1.) It is pure propaganda, just for the sake of creating ""good guys and bad guys"". I am surprised that Hollywood, in the year 2000, produced such a re-visitation of a 1950's way of thinking. The movie did not, for one second, admit that the U.S. had medium range nuclear missiles in W. Germany, aimed at Russia and had a similar strike time reaction-window as that which had the U.S. government tearing their hair out and running around like sissies. How do we think the Russians must have felt?! Now, today, the U.S. missiles are in Poland... 500 miles closer to Russia!! This movie is so one-sided that I would have thought it was manufactured by the Department of Defense or the U.S. Marines. It is abyssymal and inexcuseable. The second facet of Thirteen Days that I found unacceptable (and made it unwatchable, for me)was Kevin Costner's crazy, warped, overdone accent. Now, I was born and raised in Boston. I spent the first 50 years of my life there, beginning in 1957. I have never hear anyone speak like Costner did in this picture. It is as though he was trying to do ""President Kennedy times two"". If I were the person playing JFK in the picture, I would have turned to Kostner at one point and said, ""Why are you talking like that? Are you trying to mock me?"" Evidentally, Kostner figured he was the star of the movie and did everything he could to attract attention to himself. honestly, his ""accent"" is the biggest direction gaffe I have ever seen in a movie. It was just insane.",2.0,Anonymous,History
Taut Thriller,"This is an outstanding re-telling of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The weakest part of the movie of course is Kevin Costner who wisely cast himself in the part of presidential assistant Kenny O'Donnell rather than take on the JFK role. In order to give Costner a lot to do they make Kenny O'Donnell out to be a sort of behind-the-scenes king-maker rather than the office gofer that he probably really was. But it was a clever device to get the audience into the inner workings of the Kennedy White House without making JFK or RFK the lead character. The scenes that work best are when O'Donnell is the fly-on-the-wall sitting in at Cabinet meetings and meetings with the Joint Chiefs and letting the real decision-makers and advisers talk.Much of the real JFK Cabinet discussions were recorded or transcribed for history and so I'm sure that much of the dialog for those scenes is what the principals really said. The movie is a tremendous look at crisis management and decision-making under extreme pressure.The military leaders are made out to be the semi-villains in this movie, pushing JFK to attack Cuba and launch WWIII and at some points seeming to even disobey or skirt his orders. When watching the movie I kept remembering that JFK was the youngest man ever elected president and that he was only 45 yrs old when this happened. Most of his Cabinet and all of the Joint Chiefs were much older than him and that tension comes across as the older men seem to barely be able to hold back their condescending attitudes towards the young president.With the exception of Costner, the acting in this movie is first rate and Bruce Greenwood as JFK was certainly deserving of Oscar consideration. It is always hard for an actor to play a historical figure like JFK who is more legend now than man. Greenwood wisely does not try to mimic JFK's accent but he does get inside the character and you can see JFK thinking his way through the crisis with nothing less than future of the entire human race riding on his decisions. Steven Culp was outstanding as well as RFK, perfectly mimicking RFK's mannerisms and way of speaking but again, getting inside the character so we can really see the man rather than just an impersonation. The success of the entire movie depending on Greenwood and Culp nailing their parts and they did so terrifically.Viewers might be interested in finding a copy of ""Missiles of October"" which was a TV-movie in the 1970s and done much like a stage play. William Devane played JFK and Martin Sheen RFK. The movie also gave much screen time to the Kruschev character.",,Anonymous,History
Amazing Story,"It's amazing to see just how close we were to a nuclear war. Whilst poetic license will clearly have been taken with the script, it's quite clear that the world was clearly on the brink of nuclear war during the Cuba missile crisis. Had events taken a slightly different course many of the people on this site wouldn't have been born and those that were would have lived in a very different world.Like most films based on real events this film has got to make up for the fact that most viewers will know the ultimate outcome. The good thing with this film is that most viewers will not know the detail, so quite a few of the scenes do retain an element of surprise. All the leads put in a sound performance, but it's the story itself that makes this a good film. 8/10.",7.0,Anonymous,History
"""Powerful"" doesn't even begin to describe it.","""Thirteen Days"" is a powerful and gripping movie. Actually, I'm not sure if 'powerful' is a strong enough word to describe it. I was immediately sucked in and, in fact, the only time reality came back to me during the entire movie was when my friend, who'd fallen asleep,  suddenly jumped up wide awake at the roar of the jets... When the movie let out, everyone was yawning and stretching and in some way or another, complaining.Not me, I was pumped up and ready to go talk about it to someone, I didn't care who, for hours and hours. Who cares if it was 'thirteen days long' or if Kevin Costner's accent was a little annoying? Admit it, the movie was about as good as movie's get. The acting was perfect (I believe Bruce Greenwood should at least get a Best Actor nomination, possibly Culp, too, for Supporting Actor), and the script... man, did somebody put some time into that script! Not only was it historically accurate (to the best of my knowledge anyway) but it was heart-warming and witty and was full of those ""great lines"" that people will memorize and repeat over and over for many years to come. My favorite part, however, is just a shot of Kevin Costner coming home. He gets out of his car, and instead of going inside his house, he turns and looks at his street, his neighborhood, his world... I hate saying more than I should, but if you've seen the movie you know what I'm talking about. The emotion that is shown in that scene... it gives me chills just thinking about it.This film is intelligent, and beautiful, and 'powerful.'

When statesmen were statesmen,"Considering that the Cuban missile crisis has already been pretty picked over dramatically (there was also a good early TV-movie, ""The Missiles of October""), and that the movie is mostly talking heads, this docudrama manages to whip up quite a lot of nail-biting tension in its two and a half hours. Its prime pleasure is seeing '60s icons humanized: JFK, RFK, Adlai Stevenson, and even Dean Rusk are presented as smart, responsible, thoughtful men who must agonize over the veracity of the information they're being confronted with and struggling to come up with a suitable response. (Today's neocon bunch undoubtedly would have escalated to full war in a heartbeat, and we probably wouldn't be here.) They lose their tempers, they despair, they disagree, but they're genuine statesmen, and colossuses compared to what politicians have become. As are the media: Walter Cronkite, in actual footage, shows a class and dignity unknown on today's airwaves or Web pages. Costner has been criticized for his faux-Boston accent, but I found it true enough, and anyway, many of his best moments are silent: He does a lot of acting with his eyes. It actually helps that Bruce Greenwood doesn't look much like JFK: It helps viewers concentrate on the man rather than the icon. I suppose the dramatization is a bit sanctimonious: The script is unambiguously on the side of religion and ""traditional family values,"" and Roger Donaldson keeps inserting footage of nuclear explosions, as if we couldn't remember what all the fuss is about. But it's a handsome and stirring account of crafty, wise political diplomacy, the likes of which we may not again see in our lifetimes.",7.0,Anonymous,History
The Godfather of political thrillers.   Magnificent!,"This is The Godfather of political thrillers.   Magnificent!  Until the final frames - when JFK addresses the White House staff - I expected another critical problem to emerge.  These `wrinkles' kept me perched on the edge of my seat.  I was naïve and 11 at the time.  This is a movie not to be missed.The President's Special Assistant (Kenny O'Donnell aka Kevin Costner) tells the story.  He connects you intimately to the Kennedy White House, the early 60s military machinery  balanced against faith and family.  Every emotion kicks into gear over the course of the film.  At the end of the day, you're thankful the man in the oval office was a smart fellow.  We need smart people in that office.There's a thing called `heart' sprinkled liberally throughout.  Performances are thoroughly believable, as though this is unfolding here and now. Greenwood and Culp are plausible Kennedy brothers after all their predecessors, a tough job given the liberal supply of Kennedy film.  Your heart pours out for the insiders who knew how close the world came to the brink.  Then please, join me in becoming a little cynical about the government's `world safety' report veracity going forward.  Thirteen Days shows you why the government, the press, and the people need to be in constant check and balance to be effective.A football metaphor weaves effectively through the film, though the teams are cliquish at best.  Ex-Harvard quarterback Kenny O'Donnell now serves as a linebacker for the Kennedy team.   He's an insider; close  a (near-family) friend.   In a crisis, loyalty and teamwork to America's quarterback (JFK) is the prescription for sanity.  War zealots surround and abound.  Someone needs the cooler head  to be the wiser man  in a world where warfare is being redefined with weapons of annihilation.Minutia:  There's always something for a fanatic like me.  I spotted a bowl of Post's fruity Pebbles cereal at the O'Donnell breakfast table in the closing minutes.  I don't think these had been invented yet.  The thing is: If I have to dig `that deep' to find flaws with the film's presentation quality, it's a pretty darned good.  I am sure there are historical flaws, but this is close enough for government work.I'm still naïve, but no longer 11 years old.  Movies have to be well made / well told to satisfy.  An entertainment adventure you will enjoy no matter your age, gender, race, religion or political persuasions.  It rates 9 out of 10 possible points.

""" I  can  wait  till  hell  freezes  over  for  your  answer""","In the 1960's few realized how close the world came to Nuclear Winter. Even today, with all the resources at hand, fewer care who prevented the Third World War. One thing is certain, America was enormously fortunate to have had as President of the United States, John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) during those nearly fatal ""13 Days."" As the thinking man's president, Mr. Kennedy was lucky to have in his cabinet men of intellect and reason. His main confident was his younger brother, Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp) who proved invaluable as Attorney General. When the world learned of the Nuclear threat ninety miles away, Kennedy came to rely heavily on his political adviser Kenny O'Donald (Kevin Costner) who displayed cautious insight and prudent judgment in critical moments which could have proved disastrous had the Joint Chiefs of Staff gotten their way. Further, Kennedy was definitely fortunate to have selected as his ambassador to the United Nations, Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman) who stood toe to toe with Russian's Valerian Zorin (Oleg Vidov) and did not back down. The film is dramatic and terrifyingly accurate with dated Black and White footage and actual verbal scripts from hidden recordings from the oval office. What we know today is; had the Administration followed the prodding of the military, they would have initiated the Third World War as the Russian military in Cuba, actually had short range Atomic warheads at their disposal.

"Gripping, Intelligent, Moving Political Thriller","""Thirteen Days"" is a gripping, intelligent, moving political thriller of the kind which is all too rarely made in the US any more.You may be thinking, ""Do I want to watch this? How can I get involved in the plot? After all, we all know how the Cuban missile crisis ended -- neither Kennedy nor Krushchev dropped the bomb."" That's what I thought. I thought a movie whose suspense hinges on whether or not the bomb will be dropped would bore me, given that I know how events turned out.The movie is well made, though, and I was gripped by it from the first scene. I really was on the edge of my seat.So, yes, even though these are historical events, the film is highly suspenseful.It has more to offer than suspense, though, something very important in these waning days of George Bush Jr.'s second administration.The film depicts the most powerful men in the world struggling NOT to flex their power.They have the bomb -- and they don't want to drop it. They have evidence that America's arch enemy, the Soviet Union, has weapons of mass destruction a few miles off America's shores, in Cuba -- and they don't want to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro.They could bomb the missile sites in Cuba, but they don't want to, because they know that that would turn world opinion against the US.They stayed up late at night worrying about any American fighting men whose lives their actions might imperil. They stayed up late at night worrying about any innocent civilians in Cuba who might be collateral damage.You get the picture. These men are depicted as the opposites of George Bush, Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, et al, who wanted to use America's power to destroy, world opinion, and casualties, be damned.Every scene in this movie is an education in how power can be used to restrain itself.Too, there is a behind the scenes look at how advisers, the joint chiefs of staff, and cabinet secretaries jockey for position and work, by hook or by crook, to advance their point of view. There are a couple of really interesting screaming matches.There are similar hints at what was going on in the Kremlin at this same time. There are spies and counter spies, and analysts trying to figure out who is in charge in Russia by, for example, analyzing letters the White House is receiving -- did Krushchev write these letters? Or has there been a coup? The film is full of eye candy. There is archival film footage of aircraft carriers, submarines, missiles, rockets, planes ... if you are an ordnance nut, this is the film for you. There are, of course, recreations of all those hot fashions, the skinny ties and pastel dresses, men and women wore in those days.The cast is great. Bruce Greenwood and Steven Kulp look a bit like JFK and RFK, but don't have their charisma. (Who does?) Dylan Baker is especially good as Robert McNamara. Kevin Costner is Kevin Costner, which, for those of us who like Kevin Costner, is a good thing. His accent is a bit wobbly, but I forgot about it after a while, I was so involved with the movie.At the end of the movie, one of the very powerful men whose work we have been following breaks down in tears. I did, as well, appreciating how much this movie stimulated me to think, and moved me, as well.Strongly recommended.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Focus is Off,"In this dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, President Kennedy must deal with Soviet aggression as tension mounts. Although the historical event has built-in suspense, the filmmakers manage to sap the excitement to some extent by rambling on too long and lingering too much on uninteresting details. The main problem is that the focus is not on Kennedy, but on O'Donnell, the cabinet member played by Costner whose importance in the crisis is exaggerated in this account. To make matters worse, Costner sports a laughable and horribly distracting Boston accent. Culp is also a bit too mannered as RFK. Greenwood, on the other hand, gives a finely understated performance as Kennedy.",6.0,Anonymous,History
Can't understand the hype,"Frankly, I regard ""13 days"" more like a high-end television movie than a serious docudrama. It is a very American product; viewers unaccustomed to the clichés of standard Hollywood filmography are going to have a hard time swallowing the extremes of overdramatization saturating every single scene of the film. Everything is boosted up to keep the spectator on the edge indefinitely, which may appear as a merit to the American public but easily relapses in cheapness and bad taste to those used to a more thoughtful approach.The way the story and the characters are developed is also standard Hollywood fare, with the black-and-white presentation of Kennedy as a national hero soundly rooted in the values of family, motherland and hard work, who regards his office as the highest duty and finally overcomes the warmongering ambitions of the generals.Looks like being cynical, or simply realistic, is not allowed in American mainstream productions.Even worst, the director makes no attempt to convey a picture of the political situation underlying the crisis, or to offer (even for a moment) the viewpoint of the Soviets and the Cubans. On the contrary, the first half an hour suggests the idea that the United States were the victim of an unprovoked, unilateral aggression. This is junk history. The reasons why the Soviets deployed the missiles in Cuba were 1) to retaliate for the US deployment of about one hundred nuclear missiles in Turkey and 2) to protect Cuba, after the CIA-orchestrated landing at the Bay of Pigs and while the US were practicing invasion forces as a show of strength on islands in the Caribbean. This was perfectly known to the Kennedy administration, and certainly must have played a large part in the conversations on how to deal with the crisis.As a blockbuster ""13 days"" may have its merits, but as a serious historical movie it has a long way to go.",4.0,Anonymous,History
A great topic to keep in the back of everyone's mind,"The film effectively illustrates how close we came to a nuclear war, and how each and every action can escalate into something we all do not want to happen. I find it interesting that even today, the USA is still staring down nations trying to develop their nuclear capabilities and one can only hope we never experience something similar to what happened over 40 years ago. Now, in terms of the acting, I respect Costner's choice to try for the accent, but didn't anyone on set notice it was not working. The accent was so strong sometimes and non-existent at other times, it really took me away from the movie. It was very distracting and I felt the movie could have much smoother without it, and nobody would have ever complained.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Response to Jakemac08 comments on the Movie,"I'm not sure how much you know about the Cuban Missile Crisis jake, but Kenny O'Donnell was JFK's special assistant, appointed in 1960. He helped with his presidential campaign, and in 1957 he was appointed as Assistant Counsel, Select Committee to Investigate Improper Activities in Labor-Management Relations in the Senate. Which ended in 1959, and in turn in 1960 O'Donnell was the organizer and director of John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign schedule. The following year he became Kennedy's special assistant. SO Kevin Costner's role as Kenny O'Donnell is clearly a true role, and you are quite incorrect in trying to tell people it was made up. i agree Hollywood added its personal touches, which makes it a blockbuster film, however the depiction of actual events and problems are quite accurate. the movie is excellent for educating about the Cuban Missile Crisis, with few, if any, incorrect historical facts.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great movie changed my perception of Kennedy! Missing some insights though,"The Bay of Pigs invasion by Kennedy caused, or at least strongly influenced the Cuban missile crises.

pulse pounding presidential pic,"It is truly amazing the amount of tension Roger Donaldson manages to wring out of this 40 year old story of the Cuban Missile Crisis, even though we already know the ending. In the theaters this film was my choice for picture of the year for 2000 and on several top ten lists. Now on video, even at second viewer it remains awesome in its power to capture the moment when the world almost ended. Long time Aussie transplant, Donaldson re-teams with the leading man in his 1987 hit No Way Out, Kevin Costner,  who also serves as co-producer, to deliver one of the best build political true to life thrillers of all time. The film won several second tier nominations and picked up awards for editing and its peace content (from the Political Film society no less) plus an award for the man who is the real star of the film, Costner's broad as a baked bean ""Baaaaaw-stin"" accent aside. Canadian Bruce Greenwood is riveting, powerful and fascinating as the man of the hour, John F. Kennedy, a president with the fate of the world on his hands and a cabinet full of warhawks anxious to pull the trigger on their rack full of A-bombs once the Soviets started planting nukes in Cuba. Greenwood eerily channels JFK onto the screen both sounding and looking astonishingly like the 1962 Kennedy and Steven Culp as RFK is an equally impressive mimic.  At first it is almost impossible to focus on the action whenever Greenwood is on the screen, the impersonation is that uncanny. Many people, including Entertainment Weekly, championed Greenwood for lead and/or supporting Oscar nods and were surprised when he was left out.  But the success of the film is more a casting stunt. David Self's script skillfully converts anecdotes into actions and converts the sprawling events of 13 of the most documented days in world history into a comprehensible two and a half hour narrative flow. Donaldson and editor Conrad Buff (who picked up a Golden Satellite Award for his work here) work all the angles: mixing film stocks, jump and dissolve cuts, rapid fire editing during high tension scenes and a cute trick of fading from black and white to color during a scene which along with the photo-realism images of Greenwood and Culp often leave the viewer wondering if they're watching a movie or a newsreel (real tape of Kennedy speaking is mixed in so skillfully you can't always tell whether it's Greenwood or Kennedy speaking).  Donaldson does not take the potential of thermal nuclear annihilation lightly and neither does his film. With frequent legitimate shots of blossoming mushroom clouds (they blew up an awful lot of nukes in those days), Donaldson constantly reminds us what the stakes were when the cold war heated up to a near inferno and our two nations stood eyeball to eyeball hoping someone would have sense enough to blink.",10.0,Anonymous,History
If You Like Cold War Era History / Intrigue - YOU SHALL WATCH THIS MOVIE !!,"I understand that many people might consider the topic of the Cold War to be a snoozer. Ok, to each their own. But it is incumbent that I drive home a little factoid to those of you who fall into this category: Wherever you call home on this Earth, it is likely that you would not be alive today had the historical happenings presented in this movie not unfolded the way they did. And that might be a good reason to watch this movie.....perhaps! Just sayin...This movie is based on a true story. This movie covers a topic and a situation that affords little room for BS. It involves a close call where the bulk of the species, including humans, was almost vaporized or incinerated into extinction. I guess what I'm trying to say is that this movie is more important than Batman.This movie is packed with international intrigue, geo-political foreign affairs, the notion of Mutually Assured Destruction, and the complete structure of the word ""brinksmanship"" is on full display in this movie. In fact, the word Brinksmanship is defined by the Cuban Missile Crisis and is documented in this movie.I would highly recommend this unusually well put together movie to anyone who enjoys history and suspense. Further, this movie, and Robert F Kennedy's book 13 Days, should be on a mandatory watch list / reading list for ALL those pursuing a career in International Affairs, Political Science or National Defense, and for those who look to serve in the military of their respective nation. This movie is Suspense personified. Nobody, and I mean nobody, has had a bad day at work like JFK and his staff had for 13 days that October. That's but one takeaway I got having watched this movie, and having read RFKs book. What a stressful job that must have been! No, none of us knows what stress on the job even is when compared to this. Heart Surgeon- No. ER Nurse-no. Policemen-No. Combat Soldier-No. None.I so enjoyed this movie that I've watched it something like 70 or 80 times ! And that was after seeing it at the movie theater twice !In this genres, there is no better movie. This is not my opinion, this is a fact. The Hunt for Red October, a good movie in of itself, is a 5 cent joke compared to Thirteen Days. Thirteen Days actually happened. It was entirely unnecessary to introduce a spurious claim of authenticity in digital type at the beginning of this movie to sell you it's theme and content. YOU...are alive today because of the historical account given by this movie.Lastly, this movie, although primarily cast with B actors, is nonetheless unusually well cast. Costner is the only big name actor in this movie. Yet, the acting is A+++. They didn't miss a beat putting this movie together.I am dumbfounded that this movie is merely a so-called ""sleeper"", never to receive the acclaim it deserves. It covers a topic that should make the most hard-hearted amongst us fill their own shoes with yellow liquid. Where are people's heads at? What do they value?

Historical thriller diluted by melodrama,"If only this film had been made by someone else. It suffers from an excess of 'Costerism'. Here we have the President of the mighty U.S. of A. being told what to do by his assistant? I wonder what the real Kenny thought of being promoted to be the C-in-C's boss? This silliness detracts from the real drama being played out by the Kennedy duo, trying to stop the unpredictable Ruskies and prevent the mad generals from staging their own version of Dr. Strangelove. I rather doubt the accuracy of their portrayal too; they are a little too red-faced, blustering and over-the-top to be in a straight drama.

Some flaws but Entertaining,"This movie about the Kennedy Administration during the Cuban Missile Crisis is flawed, but is still entertaining. First there is Kevin Costner's role as Special assistant Kenny O'Donnell. Costner gets way too much screen time. He got much more than the President and other important figures. Then there is costner's accent. Some people think that his Boston accent for the part is terrible. What I found more interesting was that sometimes Costner spoke with an accent, and sometimes he didn't seem to have one at all!Vice-President Lyndon Johnson was made out to be just a dumb hick. Even Johnson's detractors will admit that he certainly wasn't dumb. The Adlai Stevenson (United Nations Representative)character wasn't anything the real person either. They made him out to be way too much of a wimp.Another flaw was that on more than one occasion you could actually see the voice boom boxes (or whatever they are called)that record what the actors are saying, at the top of the picture. Seldom do you actually see this in a movie. So there was some bad editing. I saw this movie in the theatre and wonder if it was edited out of the videotapes and DVDs.Still, the movie was entertaining. It was for the most part historically accurrate. There wasn't any of the Oliver Stone made up crap in this movie. You really got the feel of the pressure that everyone was under.Besides Costner, the acting was very good.

Gripping Story of 13 Days on the brink of Nuclear War,"Thirteen Days provides us with an eyewitness account of the Cuban Missile Crisis; the two-week period in 1962 when the US and the USSR came perilously close to the brink of nuclear war.  Overall, Thirteen Days is entertaining with a strong screenplay and dynamic cast.  Days will not appeal to everyone, as most of the action is through dialog, and the movie is lengthy, so an interest in history is a prerequisite. The film provides insight on the conversations that are historic and others that may have occurred between JFK, his advisors and the members of the cabinet.Bruce Geenwood is excellent as JFK.  His accent is perfect.  Steven Culp portrays a very believable Bobby Kennedy.  Kevin Costner is adequate as Kenny O'Donnell The inclusion of Adlai Stevenson's oratory to the UN is excellent, ""I am prepared to wait for the answer until Hell freezes over"".The story is faithful to history by Hollywood standards.  John Kennedy is portrayed as indecisive and uncertain.  The military cabinet is depicted as sinister and suspecting Kennedy of being weak.  Kennedy was often weak and indecisive. JFK was a popular President, but he was not a strong leader. The military leaders had good reason to suspect Kennedy of indecision and cowardice.  After all, JFK supported the Bay of Pigs invasion, sending 1500 US trained Cuban Exiles to invade Cuba - until it failed.  JFK  would not commit military forces to support the invasion or extract the men when the invasion failed and many men perished or were taken prisoner.The screenplay does make reference to the disdain the military establishment had for Joe Kennedy (JFK's father and former ambassador to England).  Joe Kennedy favored appeasing Hitler in the late 1930s and later was an unwitting participant in the Russian occupation of Europe.  Plus, the military regime would have also known the truth behind the PT-109 legend where JFK botched up, lost his boat and several crew members.Thirteen Days ignores the US (Kennedy's) culpability in the Cuban Missile Crisis.  The US supported a military invasion of Cuba in March 1961.  When this failed, several attempts were made on Castro's life.  Castro and his Soviet allies had good reason to suspect the US was preparing to overthrow Castro, and therefore place weapons in Cuba.  My Country's behavior was less than exemplary in the Kennedy - Johnson era. I believe a smattering of the dynamics of North American politics might help younger viewers understand the tension and policies of the era.The film accurately shows the disdain that JFK and RFK harbored for Adlai Stevenson.  Although, the film makers do not mention that JFK set up Adlai to lie to the United Nations about the bombing of Cuba preceding the Bay of Pigs.  The Kennedy Administration was promulgating the lie the U.S. was not involved.  Adlai was not given an accurate briefing until well after his presentation to the U.N.  He was furious.  There was animosity between the Kennedy's and Stevenson from that point onward until JFK's death.What didn't work:  I don't care for the black/white segments and the amount of time wasted on O'Donnell's family.  Costner is a great actor, but accents are not in his forte'.All in all, Thirteen Days is a great movie and well worth the price of admission.  It reminded me of WHY we had the ""Tuck and Duck"" drills for Nuclear war in the '60s.7/10",2.0,Anonymous,History
"Kenneth O'Donnell was real, Costner did fine, well done","I was 12 when this all took place. It's an EXCELLENT retelling of the story, very gripping and edge of your seat.I remember watching Kennedy's speech on TV, then going to a Boy Scout meeting and wondering when the bombs were going to start falling.I am stunned by the number of people adding comments who seem to think Kenny O'Donnell was just a character made up for the movie. Do an online search, people. I am still a registered Democrat. The characterization of Adlai Stevenson was terrific. The UN scene, which was on TV was, in fact, even more dramatic in real life.It would be really nice if we had some Dems around today who actually would have some spine and realize that we are NOT the bad guys. Read JFK's inaugural address, you can find it online, too. Here's a brief quote. ""Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty. This much we pledge -- and more.""That speech is why I am still a Democrat, and I have hopes, however faint, that somehow our leaders today will have the courage to WORK TOGETHER for the benefit of future generations instead of worrying about whose party is ahead in the polls today. We Americans are the good guys and our enemies are much more dangerous than the Soviet Union ever was. Please watch this movie and stop whining about whether Kevin Costner is a good or bad actor, and instead think about the importance of having leaders who care about the survival and success of liberty, at home and around the world.

"Good script, acting, poor direction...","This film has an excellent, suspenseful, nuanced script, and two great actors (Bruce Greenwood and the other fellow playing Bobbie K.) that suck us into the tense 14 days (where'd they get '13' from?) that made up the Cuban missle crisis. Unfortunately, this film suffers from two huge weaknessess. The director is unsure of himself, beginning the film with a very awkward (and obviously CGI) shot of a jet flying over Cuba that could've been handled in a briefing room discussion with the President (thus giving us the same information, but sparing us the gaudy CGI effects; B-grade acting of the pilot and overall 'shoe-horned in' feel of the whole scene. If this story was part of 'West Wing', the latter would've been filmed, and the results would've been far classier).   Overall, the movie looks cheaply lit, and we are subjected to useless detours in Black & White that have NO pattern and serve NO purpose. All the scenes with Kevin Costner's family are useless and were probably added in by Costner as a way of 'fleshing out' his character. Speaking of Costner, he is the other thing that nearly ruins this otherwise fine film. The simple fact is this: Kevin Costner is not a good actor, and he never has been. His role in 13 Days is BY FAR the worst (or best?) example of this. His Boston accent is atrocious, and one can only sit back and admire an actor like Bruce Greenwood for not bursting out laughing every time Costner opens his mouth.   In all honesty, I don't know how this guy still gets work, let alone the starring role in a fair-sized budgeted film like this. I think he deserves to be on the same has-been list as John Travolta (no more $20 M for him!) and Sly Stallone. No one likes Kevin's acting, but he just keeps on trucking like everyone does.

Superb movie,"Having lived through the Cuban missile crisis and seen my teachers being called back into service I found this movie to be extremely realistic. It's amazing the similarity of the actors to the real people, particularly Bobby Kennedy and McNamara. The underlying tension and the restrained acting reminded me of the movie Seven Days in May. The Portrayal of John F. Kennedy was remarkable in so far as one doesn't even notice that his physical appearance is off. His mannerisms and acting portrayed John F. Kennedy so well that he blends into the character perfectly. The tension exhibited by the actors in this movie reflects accurately the tension the nation felt during those awful days when we had to practice atomic bomb drills in school. Kevin Costner's portrayal of Kenny O'Donnell seemed right on the mark, as did the actor who portrayed Adli Stevenson. Those scenes which took place the United Nations were particularly moving sadly, they have not been repeated in present times. If only Colin Powell could have made such an impact with the UN perhaps the war in Iraq would have been unnecessary.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Boring,"The movie plot was developed too slowly, and I lost brain cells from trying to figure out what they were talking about sometimes. The acting was really bad and the fake accents made it even worse. At times it can become too dramatic. One particular scene that was a waste of time was the scene where Kevin Costner shows up at his son's game. It says nothing about the movie and really portrays drama at its highest level. Other than that, the good thing about this movie is that it did a good job in teaching us how one simple mistake can lead to a catastrophe. It also shows us how things were carried out of the white house in the time of the missile crisis. Even though I didn't really enjoy this movie I think people should watch this if they're into politics.",6.0,Anonymous,History
great tense political drama,"It's October, 1962, the Cuban missile crisis. Photos from the U-2 spy plane show possible nuclear missiles on Cuban soil. This sets off high level panic that almost ends with WWIII. The movie centers on the Special Assistant to the President, Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner). The push from the military is for a full invasion of Cuba. However, the Kennedy brothers and Kenny push back.This is more like a brilliant stage play done with so much intensity that the audience is right there in the room. There are flashes of newsreels, CGI, and other footage to fill out the movie with the outside world. It is very much a political thriller inside the President's inner circle. It is tense despite the well known ending and event highlights. The use of Costner as a side character pushed out to be the lead is brilliant. It allows the best (but lesser known) actors in some of the most iconic roles around. Surprisingly, there are also flashes of humor. The acting is amazing. This is one of the best movies about those thirteen days.",9.0,Anonymous,History
American History takes it on the chin again!,"So now we know that JFK simply could not have handled the Cuban Missile Crises without the sage advice of Kenny O'Donnell!?  Bull! O'Donnell was more Court Jester than senior adviser.  He was a friend that JFK was comfortable with, who aided and abetted Kennedy's womanizing, and who was most probably not nearly so involved in the crises as this film would have us believe.  And where the hell was LBJ?  Lyndon was, after all, the Vice-President; and a loud, boorish, aggressive one at that.  He was a Hawk on the Missile crises.  To reduce the character to a couple of throw away lines is just plain silly.  Then there is poor, misunderstood Bobby, tired of being called ruthless.  Even Old Joe Kennedy said Bobby was ""the most like me, hard as nails"".  The military has been held up to disdain and ridicule in Hollywood for quite some time now, so that aspect should come as no surprise.  It is a shame that so many American kids will get a distorted picture of historic events from films like this and Pearl Harbor.  It is, unfortunately, just one more symptom of the continued dumbing down of the country.The more you know about the actual events surrounding the Cuban Missile Crises, the sillier this film will be for you.",6.0,Anonymous,History
A really good portrayal of real events,"I was only a toddler during the crisis, but over the years I have read over 30 books about the JFK assassination and some of those talk about the Cuban Missile Crisis at length.The US was within hours of a nuclear war with the USSR and Kennedy's intelligence and calmness saved the day. The war hawks in the administration along with those with the same sentiment on Khrushchev's side kept ratcheting up their desire to go to war.After JFK was murdered, Khruschev mentioned that the chance of the Cold War ending died with JFK.I have loved this movie since its first release and enjoy watching it still today. A good history lesson for people that want to know more about Kennedy's presidency.As far as Costner's accent, to me it didn't hinder the movie at all. The story is the thing and the acting overall was top notch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
US and USSR were equally guilty in the Cold War,"Watching ""Thirteen Days"", I was never sure how accurate it was (it did seem kind of lop-sided). The movie does create a sense of tension, knowing that the world came closer than ever to nuclear annihilation. Around the fortieth anniversary of the Cuban Missile Crisis, I asked my Russian teacher (who was born and raised in Russia when it was the Soviet Union) what children there were taught. She said that they were taught how to care for a person injured in a nuclear blast. Basically the same thing as ""duck and cover"". The important thing to understand is that the United States and Soviet Union were equally guilty in the Cold War.Anyway, I do recommend this movie, understanding that I can't verify the accuracy. My favorite movies centering on the Cuban Missile Crisis are ""Matinee"" and ""Blast from the Past"".

The stress is real.,"Roger Donaldson is the director of Thirteen Days, main characters are Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood). I really liked this movie because it really showed the pressure and stress John F. Kennedy was under in such little time he had to come up with a good non-risky plan, to save the United States. The movie also showed how this event affected citizens, and it showed the fear everyone had. This was a good movie but it is not a movie that I would personally watch outside of school, but overall I did like the movie and I would recommend it to people to watch.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Movie Summary,"13 Days was a historical movie about what went on behind the curtains of the Cuban Missile Crisis. For the most part 13 Days was a historically accurate movie with the exception of two things. The most obvious exception was the fact that Kevin Kostner's character was not a real character. That fact spoiled the movie a little but we can not look at his character as an actual character but more as the narrator of the movie, and an actor that was there to highlight the key points of the movie. The other thing that stood out to me was that John F Kennedy's character seemed too aggressive. Not living in the time of Kennedy and relying on clips of speeches he just does not seem to be an offensive type of man. The movie was interesting and historically accurate with everything from the U2 planes being shot down to some of the speeches being given. The movie was a fun and eye-opening film that shows how close we really were to having a nuclear holocaust. Of course Hollywood has to throw in its happy ending and the closing scene was a bit tacky but otherwise it was a fun movie.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Costner's character ruins it,"Costner's character is completely unbelieveable. The character comes off as showing almost no respect for the presidency, instead the president appears to be practically a puppet in his hands. It reeks of vanity from Costner's side.While there were three major sides involved - USA, Soviet Union and Cuba - even though Thirteen Days is 2.5 hours long the Soviet and the Cuban side of the story is never shown, the movie focuses exclusively on the US. What motivated the Soviet and Cuban leadership? How did they react during the crisis? Surely it would have been interesting to get a glimpse of that.In the end Thirteen Days is part documentary - with the usual liberties taken with regard to the truth - and part propaganda. Quite silly considering that the cold war has been over for a long time now.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Very good at what it sets out to do and well worth seeing,"October 1962. An American spy plane picks up signs of nuclear missiles inside Cuba with the ability to strike the US. With the missiles not yet able to be used, President Kennedy and his staff are forced to decide a course of action against the Russians, all the time with the knowledge that being too weak or too strong in their actions could tip the standoff into catastrophe. As the decision is taken to use the US Navy to blockade Cuba all movement is read as messages between the two nations and the world holds its breath as the crisis deepens.Drawn from The Kennedy Tapes, this film looks back at the two-week Cuban Missile Crisis from the perspective of those involved in the White House. Some viewers have bemoaned this and claimed that it is nothing more than a one-sided love story to the Kennedy's and ignores the views of others outside of the administration. While there is an element of truth in this opinion, the film didn't really go that far for me and rather the enclosed view acts to increase the tension within the story. By experiencing it only from one sided it is possible to forget that you know the outcome as you get caught up in the blind judgements and the high-stakes game being played. Very few viewers (if any) will be unaware of the eventual outcome but it is to the film's credit that it still grips throughout.True, the film does rather worship the Kennedy brothers and there is nary a bad thing about them here but I forgave it of this because it was not really a character study so much as a summary of an intense political period in recent history. With this in mind the weakest parts of the film are moments away from the crisis itself; specifically I referring to the scenes involving O'Donnell's family  mostly they are unnecessary and stick out like a sore thumb. Costner plays his part well and leads the film with strength even if his character isn't the main one. Greenwood is good as Kennedy even if the material does push him to playing JFK like he was the messiah. Culp is almost as good and the three men work well together  although again there are perhaps a couple too many scenes of them being ""close"" and they weren't all needed. Support is strong across the rest of the cast, with key roles in the story picked up by Baker, Fairman, Smitrovich, Mason and others.Overall then an engaging and enjoyable real-life thriller. Although it focuses on the US side of things, it is better for it as it is tense and convincing in how it depicts the pressure on those involved. Not as factual as a detailed documentary or as character-driven as a film looking at JFK in detail but very good at what it sets out to do and well worth seeing.",,Anonymous,History
A good history lesson for those who missed it.,"""Thirteen Days"" is a journeyman docudrama which tells of the October 1962 Cuban missile crisis when, according to many, the world was as close to the brink of a nuclear holocaust as it's ever been. The film's flaws may also be its virtues as being fraught with over acting; meaningless family and other scenes designed to push emotional buttons; almost complete neglect of Johnson, Jackie, etc.; and unnecessary action sequence spice may all suffice to encourage viewing by younger audiences of which many may have never heard of the crisis.

Interesting from a historical perspective..,"Having read all the glowing reviews so far, I am going to offer the opposite....I found the movie very interesting from a historical perspective.  But i felt some of extra drama that was heaped on was a bit distracting. Examples:  Costner's character overdoing it when worried about his family - not that he wouldn't have been mind you - it just seem contrived and I found myself wishing they would get back to the real story.I found the first 1.5 hrs pretty riveting but found it just dragged on after that - partly i guess because we know how it ends.When it was done I found myself thinking I would have much rather watched a good documentary on the subject on the History Channel.6/10",6.0,Anonymous,History
Steven Culp's performece - Wow!,"Very good political thriller by Roger Donaldson. One of the highlights was Steven Culp's portrayal of Bobby Kennedy. It was so good, they should have at least given him an Oscar nomination!",8.0,Anonymous,History
Has even more relevance today,"Abraham Lincoln said in 1858 that ""a house divided upon itself cannot stand"". This prophecy almost came true during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 as President John F. Kennedy fought to avert war in Cuba against the determined opposition of his own military and Intelligence advisors. Dramatized in Roger Donaldson's powerful Thirteen Days, the entire world teetered on the brink of nuclear Armageddon for thirteen anxiety-filled days as the internal and external pressures mounted on both the President and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev to keep the world from nuclear immolation.Thirteen Days stars Kevin Costner as Presidential Aide Kenneth O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK, Steven Culp as Bobby, and Dylan Baker as Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and is based on the book ""The Kennedy Tapes: Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis"", edited by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow. When a U-2 flyover discovered two dozen SS-4 nuclear missiles in Cuba pointing to the United States, American leaders had a very short window of time before the missiles became operational to find a way to remove them. Kennedy, who until this time had tried to placate both the right and the left, was faced with severely limited options.Though different courses of action were discussed, the administration never questioned the underlying assumptions of the Cold War or the premise that the weapons were offensive rather than defensive and the film does not mention or discuss previous U.S. attempts to destabilize Cuba. With the CIA and the Pentagon calling for air strikes followed by a ground invasion, Kennedy knew that he could not afford to look weak or back down in face of the presumed Soviet threat. On the other hand, he was profoundly aware that an invasion would be met with Russian retaliation and probable nuclear war. His ultimate decision to order a naval blockade and a quarantine of Russian ships headed toward Cuba carrying offensive weapons was opposed by virtually Kennedy's entire national security apparatus.The film shows the bluster of Joint Chiefs Chairman, Maxwell Taylor (Bill Smitrovich), Air Force Chief of Staff, Curtis LeMay (Kevin Conway), Chief of Naval Operations, George Anderson (Madison Mason) and other military leaders clamoring for an aggressive response. After a meeting with the Joint Chiefs, Kennedy said to O'Donnell, ""These brass hats have one advantage in their favor. If we listen to them, and do what they want us to do, none of us will be alive later to tell them that they were wrong."" The conflict with the military and the CIA over how to handle Cuba would continue to dog Mr. Kennedy throughout his presidency and his overtures for rapprochement with Castro may have been a determining factor in his assassination.The film describes in detail the confusing Soviet response to JFK's quarantine demands and the meeting between Bobby and Soviet Ambassador Andrei Dobrynin (Elya Baskin) is the dramatic high point of the film. Also vital is the crucial role played by UN Ambassador Adlai Stevenson (Michael Fairman) in first proposing a diplomatic solution and in his strong defense of the U.S. position at the U.N. in confrontation with Soviet Ambassador Valerian Zorin (Oleg Vidov), much to the surprise of the Kennedy brothers who had decided he was ""weak"".Thirteen Days unfolds through the eyes of Ken O'Donnell (Costner) and centers on his role in providing counsel and encouragement to Kennedy, though his role is vastly overstated. Costner is adequate in the role though he is a wooden actor and his attempt at a New England accent becomes increasingly irritating. Both Greenwood and Culp have the Kennedy's manner of speech and body language down pat but give very little hint of the Kennedy charm, wit, strength, charisma, or overriding self-confidence. Regardless of its flaws however, the film is an absolutely fascinating portrayal of a pivotal time in history and an important reminder of the tenuous thread that holds our civilization together and how quickly it can be shattered.As John Kennedy reminded us in his speech at American University on June 10, 1963 quoted in the film, a speech that challenged Americans and Russians to rethink their attitudes toward each other, ""We all inhabit this small planet"", he said, ""We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's future. And we are all mortal."" It was a speech that has even more relevance today and the need to eliminate nuclear weapons is more urgent than ever.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Wise Words from C.P.A,This movie wasn't something I enjoyed mainly because there was something plain about the way it was presented. There was a very calm atmosphere that felt wouldn't have truly been present in real life. Especially with those things going down. Though in some moments I felt it wasn't truly the acting of the people but the work done by the camera and mics. Some parts that were up close sounded far away along. While others sounded off to where exactly they lied in the panel being shown. Though there were some great actors in this movie. So it wasn't all bad when it came to that. But sadly I don't think we could see their talent to its full potential in this movie. And lastly I believe this movie could be enjoyed by someone interested in the history of the U. S.

Effective drama revisits our flirtation with WWIII,"The Cuban Missile Crisis is the one event in our recent history that forced Americans to think about their own mortality, and the possibility that not all wars happen somewhere else. The decisions being made during those days in October, 1962 would have a profound effect on the lives of millions of people throughout the world. For the most part, THIRTEEN DAYS does an effective job of recreating the desperation felt by both the leaders and the citizens during this time of crisis.The events leading up to the stare-down between the US and the USSR have been well documented, so there is little new ground covered in this movie. The payoff for the audience is to watch the actors in their roles as world leaders, and to hopefully get a sense of the conflict not only among the different factions of the government, but also within the mind of each individual. Most of the performances are first rate. Bruce Greenwood, as President Kennedy, is impassioned without being hammy, no small accomplishment given the emotional nature of the situation.(One aside--was it just me or did Bruce Greenwood bear an uncanny resemblance to Dan Patrick of ESPN and Sportcenter fame? For me this was a bit disconcerting, since ""presidential"" is not one if the adjectives I would use to describe the entertaining Mr. Patrick.) Presidential Advisor Kenny O'Donnell is played with some restraint by Kevin Costner, who allowed the other members of the cast to carry their share of the load. His accent is somewhat overpowering and forced at the beginning of the movie, but either he toned it down later, or I became used to it. Either way, it stopped being a distraction. The best performance is turned in by Steven Culp, who was totally believable as Robert Kennedy. We see Robert as a tough, intelligent man thrust into an almost no win situation--he is expected to be the voice of reason and a guiding light while surrounded by dissenting opinions as to what is ""right"". Steven Culp shows him as a man who accepts this responsibility because his country needs him to, even if he sometimes doubts his worthiness for the role.",7.0,Anonymous,History

President Kennedy is portrayed as almost Kenny O'Donnell - the character Costner portrays - puppy dog.While I'm not taking anything away from the importance to advisers in any field, you can sum this picture up by saying; thank goodness for President Costner, er Kenny O'Donnell....",,Anonymous,History

It's Good,"Having an interest in this period of time I was excited to learn about Thirteen Days. Indeed, I had never heard of it before and seeing the cast I have to say that I was a little surprised. However, now having seen it, I'm glad I stumbled across this film. While it's not amazing it is certainly very well made and represents the graveness of the situation brilliantly.The most impressive thing was how reasonably Donaldson handled showing the Cuban missile crisis and the US politics surrounding it. I think that it would be rather easy to let things get completely out of hand and thus the movie would end being mostly a mess. Either you make it action oriented or focus completely on politics. Donaldson did the latter and made it work. While most of the movie is people sitting in rooms talking - as one can imagine - there are also small action sequences sprinkled in which add some excitement, keeping the film always flowing. Perhaps it was thanks to the rather excellent cast or the great writing but the talking never gets boring. In fact, I wouldn't have minded seeing more of it.Now, having said what I said in the last paragraph one might imagine me giving Thirteen Days a higher rating. This brings me to my biggest flaw in the film. There is just something unexplainable missing. I can't figure out what it is but I just felt like there was always something missing. Had it not been for that, I think that this could easily be one of the best political movies out there. There are no flaws and everything that this film does, it does very well. I just felt like I was wanting something more for almost the entire runtime.Thirteen Days is definitely a good film and if you are interested in the Cold War or how Kennedy and co handled it, I would highly recommend seeing it. However, I feel that everyone else might be left somewhat bored and wanting for more. Perhaps that is what I was missing. This film is as political as it gets and maybe I just wanted it to be a bit more. With that being said, I enjoyed it and certainly learned some things.",7.0,Anonymous,History
JFK as God,"Blossoming mushroom clouds drenched in sunset-orange open Thirteen Days of panic and the imminent possibility of nuclear war. Following almost every movement of Costner as Kenny O'Donnell, JFK's special political advisor, the film retells how Krushchev, or others in the Russian administration of the time, and the US Chief of Staffs took the world close to nuclear war. And how JFK and others stopped them.With a punchy script, inspired by supposedly primary source material, Donaldson deftly weaves a narrative of political intrigue that shows America's military commanders content, even eager, to take the US into war if it means an initial strike on the 'commie b*****ds'. It is left to the triumvirate of the two Kennedies and O'Donnell, a close relationship the film explores well, to keep cool heads and so avoid nuclear catastrophe. But it is for JFK to realise and stress that any offensive strike would be futile and go on to create a so-called 'new political language' to solve this horrific situation. A language not borne out of a desire for annihilatory attack but of measured military action. In this case a flexing of naval muscle through a 'blockade' of Cuba.The film reveres JFK as an almost untouchable hero (as the final scenes of the film make abundantly clear), yet at the centre of the film is a celebration of the common American man that is Costner's character. It shows a political process undermined by a scheming Pentagon but restored through the temperate attitude and solid values of a good Christian (albeit we assume Catholic) family man who sees public office as the highest achievement. And it is he, the man the audience can identify with rather than sit in awe off, who provides the advice, pep talks and emotional sustenance to keep JFK wise, alert and sane. O'Donnell is even portrayed as closer to JFK than Jackie Onassis, notably absent from the majority of the film. This exalted position shown by Costner's vetoing and then reinstating of various of Jackie's friends for a birthday party at the start of the film, and a humorous interchange where, like husband and wife, JFK and O'Donnell bicker over morning toast. Costner seems more like JFK's wife and first lady than political advisor. And together with Teddy it is these three modern non-military men who 'win' the battle within the White House and without against the Soviets. It is their fight that lets common sense and good American values prevail.But it is these American values that although are entirely honourable, in the end add up to a sickly sweet portrayal suggesting an almost divine miracle inspired by the Kennedy administration. It is an absorbing and well-crafted political drama for the highest stakes yet in the end it reverts to a self-centred belief that the 'best man won'. The achievements of the three, Teddy to the side and Costner in the wings helping the gifted JFK, cannot be denied, but neither can the so dramatic, glorious and one-sided depiction that is Thirteen Days. But that is what winning is about. And it is thanks to them, and thanks to God, that the sun will rise another day.",6.0,Anonymous,History

"""Hey google, what's a bad accent""","I give this movie a 6 out of 10. While I do think the movie writers did a good job of being historically accurate, the level of cheesiness made the film feel fake. For example, all of the accents were butchered that I couldn't tell if they were from New Jersey, Boston, or New York. Besides this attack on my ears I found it hard to distinguish the different scenes. This was so severe that I can describe all of the scenes with a couple of phrases: carpeted room with a bunch of middle aged men, the camera pans across Cuba, and a scared father violently drinks his ""cup of joe"".

"Lots of Talk, But Intense","I've never really known a lot about the Cold War, besides it being mentioned, and when I did learn about it in my history class, it wasn't taught in very much detail. Watching this movie helped me to understand what was happening during it a little bit more. This movie is mainly focused on the Cuban Missile Crisis, so just a part of the Cold War, but it still helped me understand it better and be able to visualize what was going on. This was a great movie. It was well acted, and I liked the scenes with President Kennedy and Kenny O'Donnell. It was interesting to see how they interacted and to see what they were like under such great pressure.
Again, the movie is about the Cuban Missile Crisis. It follows the president of the United States and members of Congress and shows what they went through to solve the missile crisis.
Like I said, I did not know much about the Cold War and I did not know anything about the Cuban Missile Crisis before I watched this movie. Even while I was watching the movie, I didn't quite understand everything that was going on, but I still really enjoyed it. I just really like history even when it's confusing. This movie was a lot of talk and not a lot of action, but it had the action feel to it because of the intense situation that everyone in the movie was working to try and resolve.
This movie was directed by Roger Donaldson. I haven't seen any of his other movies. The main actors in this movie are Kevin Costner, Bruce Greenwood, and Steven Culp. I'm not familiar with Greenwood and Culp, but I have seen other movies with Kevin Costner in them. I think he is fun to watch in movies and is a good actor. My favorite scene in this movie was when the airplanes were flown over Cuba and they took pictures of the missiles. It was a really quick scene, but it was intense and interesting to watch.
I feel like a lot of people don't like movies that are mostly talk and they probably find them boring, but I like movies like that that are history related. They really interest me, even when I don't understand them, which is probably weird, but I do. I really liked this movie. It was interesting to me to see how everyone in congress working on the Cuban Missile Crisis interacted and the different opinions on how things should be done. I would watch this movie outside of school and I would recommend it to people who are interested in that kind of history and like boring movies like me.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A real life Tom Clancy novel,"`13 Days' is the story of how the White House dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Usually when I write about a film I try to avoid revealing much about the movie.  I will deviate from this rule a little for this movie because I hope that all of you are somewhat aware of how the story unfolds. `13 Days' stars Kevin Costner as Kenneth O'Donnell, special assistant to President Kennedy during the crisis.  It is the story of how O'Donnell, JFK, RFK, and others made crucial decisions as missile crisis unfolded. All the actors do an excellent job (although Costner's `Bawstan' accent is distracting at first, I laughed whenever he said `Cuber' which was often) and the pacing and production values are top notch. The plot unfolds on many levels and the tension mounts creating a real life Tom Clancy novel.  The two air combat scenes are fantastic. The film succeeds wonderfully as a piece of entertainment.  It is not too simple and only rarely is melodramatic. In its portrayal of actual events the film is somewhat less successful.  I am no Kennedy fan to say the least and cult that has developed around the whole Kennedy family perplexes me.  I was sure this movie would be nothing more than the next step on the road to JFK's deification.  I was surprised to find it fairly even handed in its treatment of the issues involved.  It presents effectively how serious the actions of the Soviet Union were, the worldwide climate at the time and the lack faith in Kenendy after the Bay of Pigs.  It also shows what a political animal Kennedy was and makes a joke of how in debt he was to Daley (echoes of current events). Like all historical films this one simplifies a great deal and there are many actions attributed incorrectly to Costner's character to make the film work.  Also this movie is another in the long line of films that portray top generals as war hungry dogs that must be kept on a tight leash.  I get sick of military leaders being portrayed as trigger-happy cowboys and the scenes where Costner tells individual pilots to lie to their leaders are just silly.  The film however highlights the importance of a civilian controlled military and it celebrates the soldiers who risked their lives during the crisis.  There are problems with accuracy but this is not work of fiction like `Hurricane' or `The Cradle Will Rock.' This film also raises the issue of faith.  The movie is full of religious images and at one point Costner even prays for peace (showing there are no atheist in foxholes or life rafts).  It seems odd when in the end all the credit is given to `men of goodwill.' Having said all this I believe this is a valuable film.  Any movie that celebrates national service both in the military and in public office cannot be all bad.  Also in the era of revisionist history it is encouraging to see a film that highlights the serious nature of the communist threat at that time.  It has become fashionable to argue that communist world domination was never a possibility. It is also refreshing to see a President willing to draw a line in the sand when the nation is threatened.  While I had some problems with this film it is highly entertaining and any movie that is thrilling while dealing in serious way with such events is quite an achievement in today's Hollywood.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Fast-paced and well-acted,"Fast-paced and well-acted, Thirteen Days is an intriguing, suspenseful political drama. With a few glaring exceptions (such as Kenny O'Donnell's role in the Cuban missile crisis), this movie is historically accurate in its portrayal of the panic that struck the nation during the missile crisis, which turned out to be, arguably, John F. Kennedy's greatest political victory. What fascinated me about Thirteen Days was the top-notch portrayal of John F. Kennedy and Robert Kennedy. I was also impressed with the screenplay, especially the fast-paced, realistic dialogue (though much of the real-life language was cleaned up). Another success of the film were the beats of each scene that lent the film overall authenticity (O'Donnell's playful exchange with Jackie about the candy, for example). Although the lack of physical action may bore some viewers, Thirteen Days is a well-crafted, suspenseful dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis, and certainly worth a watch.http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/",,Anonymous,History
Quick decisions at the end of the world,"Do you have any idea how close the United States was to nuclear war? Watch Thirteen Days, and you'll get a better idea. Thirteen Days is the story of how the Kennedy brothers avoided war and created enemies during the Cuban missile crisis. While the entire U.S. military -- and most of President Kennedy's staff -- wanted the United States to strike Cuba and enter into war with Russia, President Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and Kenny O'Donnell, their political advisor, decided to wait. It is a chilling two and a half hours of drama, showing that tense dialogue -- not special effects -- are really the way to make an audience squirm. Perhaps the most tense moment of the film is when the United States starts a blockade, preparing to search all Russian ships that are heading toward Cuba. Without live television feeds, satellite imagery, or even direct contact with the American ships, the President and his Chiefs of Staff have to sit around and wait to hear what happens. It was chilling.Although the storyline is magnificent, the acting leaves something to be desired. Kevin Costner, as O'Donnell, has what is probably the most horrendous Boston accent since Rob Morrow in Last Dance. it is silly, it is ridiculous, and it takes all your focus away from what he's actually saying. Sometimes, the accent sounds like a bizarre hybrid between Bostonian and southern. The only explanation I could come up with was that maybe Costner still thought he was in JFK. Or wished he was. Bruce Greenwood as President John Kennedy also suffers from a less-than-par Boston accent. But what is worse, he captures very little of the Kennedy mystique. He seems too old, too straight-laced, to play the free-wheeling president that changed everyone's perceptions of the White House. More Ronald Reagan than Jack Kennedy, Greenwood seemed not worth all the hype that was surrounding his performance. Almost making up for both these poor performances is Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy. Perhaps benefitting from previous practice (he played Bobby in 1996's Norma Jean and Marilyn), Culp is absolutely perfect as the attorney general, from the Boston accent right down to the floppy hair. He had the charisma, the looks, and even the brazen, mildly obnoxious personality right down to a T. Thirteen Days, which glides through two hours and fifteen minutes effortlessly, unfortunately runs out of steam right at the end. It's almost as if the writers and directors can't explain how we survived this ordeal. Maybe that's the problem. Perhaps Thirteen Days suffers most from a storyline that is, at its heart, still too scary, too unfathomable, for us to fully express.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Actors and Production Looked the Part,"Thirteen days was not only historically accurate (by Hollywood standards) but also looked like the real thing. Actors were chosen who actually closely resembled their real-life counterparts, and the props and sets were spot-on. The producers even traveled to the Philippines to shoot obsolete jets of the early 60s, redressed to look like US Navy. One minor portrayal that really suprised was the actress playing Jackie Kennedy. Looked like Jackie, and amazingly she was able to speak in Mrs. Kennedy's sultry voice. Highly worth watching. It's as close as we can now get to actually being there.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping and fascinating,"A fascinating and very exciting dramatization of the events in the crisis that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Truth and drama are splendidly mixed and filmed with harsh straightforwardness. Artistic freedom is sure to have been taken, but it's hard to know where and to what degree - at any rate, the political advisor Kenny O'Donnell sure is one major hero in this film and I have heard some voices stating that he never played that pivotal a role. It doesn't really matter though. The Cuba crisis remains a great example of how potentially lethal (and global) conflicts can be resolved with the pen rather than the sword, and someone is sure to be a great hero. It is also interesting to note that the president of the USA is not always so in control of the might at his disposal. After all, he's only human.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent Depiction of Cuban Missle Crisis,"In October 1962, the United States and the Soviet Union were on the verge of war over Soviet missile installations in Cuba. Based on President John F. Kennedy's tapes and a script by David Self, Roger Donaldson's outstanding film, ""Thirteen Days,"" effectively recreates that tense Cold War period. Told from the perspective of JFK's White House, including the president; his brother Robert, the Attorney General; and the Special Assistant to the President, Kenny O'Donnell; the film is largely dialog driven. Evidently based on actual conversations, cabinet meetings, and confrontations between the administration and the military, the proceedings have the ring of truth. Kevin Costner, who also co-produced, heads the cast as O'Donnell; his effective low-key performance communicates the stress of his unique job situation and the toll it takes on his family and private life. In one particularly effective scene, Costner stands outside a church, where a line of parishioners are waiting for confession; a sign says that confession is available throughout the night, and, after a pause, Costner joins the line.Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp play John and Robert Kennedy, respectively; both actors bear a passing resemblance to the Kennedy brothers, and, with Boston accents, they quickly submerge themselves into their parts, and the leads are well supported by a cast of pros, who portray a who's who of Kennedy administration officials familiar to any Baby Boomer who lived through the Camelot era; among them, Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara, Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson, and Len Cariou as Dean Acheson are worth mentioning.Although the film's ending is already part of history, ""Thirteen Days"" remains engrossing, often tense, suspenseful, and fast paced. An excellent score by Trevor Jones punctuates the action, and the footage shifts from color to black and white in a seemingly arbitrary manner; however, whatever the intention, the shifts neither add nor detract from the movie. Stock footage depicts civil defense preparations, and shots of nuclear explosions foretell what could occur if the negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviets had failed. Donaldson avoids claustrophobia by cutting from the White House to action in the skies over Cuba and events at sea as the U.S. blockade of Cuba takes effect. An excellent film that is well made and well performed, ""Thirteen Days"" is more than a history lesson; it is a warning as well. The film would make a good double bill with Costner's earlier Kennedy movie, ""JFK.""",9.0,Anonymous,History
Showed me why I was glad to be a child at the time of the crisis.,"An interesting story line (presumably largely based on history) but came across as a bit too much of another vehicle for Kevin Costner to be the man behind the throne (cf JFK).There were some interesting concepts of just how much of the 'buck stops here' with the person of the US President and the way he did/does/can control the military machine. However it quickly became a 'good JFK' and 'bad military' cliche.In my cinema the last reel was projected with the framing wrong, so we saw the bottom 20% of the frame at the TOP of the projected image and hence the top edge of the image was central screen. Suffice it to say that just about EVERY shot on that reel has a boom microphone bouncing around above the characters. At first I thought we were meant to be watching documentary footage with the news-crews filming the protaganists, but then I realised we were just watching unprofessional cinematography.I give it 5/10 - they tried and tried hard, but didn't really succeed.",7.0,Anonymous,History
A must-see for a master-class in American anti-diplomacy,"There's little debate that no post-WWII conflict came closer to a true nuclear engagement than the Cuban missile crisis - and rarely does a film work so hard and succeed so thoroughly in telling such an historical tale with substantial historical accuracy as ""Thirteen Days.""Starring Bruce Greenwood as a phenomenally on-point John Kennedy, ""Days"" tells a gripping chronological tale of both official and unofficial diplomacy that turned the crisis from one of war to unmistakable American success. Aside from a pointlessly overblown and annoying part for Kevin Costner as Kenny O'Donnel, ""Days"" is a wonderfully constructed piece that otherwise strives for historical accuracy from the American discovery of the Soviet-backed missiles in Cuba, to the masterful lecture by Adlai Stevenson in the UN, to the ""unofficial"" diplomatic offer to retire antiquated Jupiter missiles from Europe in concert with a pledge not to invade the island nation.""Days"" wavers a bit with the needless interposition of nuclear test footage and the infamous ""drop and cover"" civil defense drills of the era, presumably as a way to punctuate a necessarily introspective and narrative view of the diplomatic back-channels and administration in- fighting undertaken to overcome the crisis. And the principals work too hard to master their New England accents, of which Costner's is easily the worst.From an historical perspective, those involved during the crisis insist O'Donnell's role is drastically overblown, and clearly Costner's participation seems contrived and self-important. Fortunately, the deft direction Roger Donaldson keeps the viewer engaged with the broader epic and the ultimate focus on Kennedy's wisdom and leadership in it's resolution, guided by the book of the same title written by Ernest May.""Days"" isn't your typical action-adventure thriller, with heroic stars rolling down mountains and firing machine guns at virtual bad guys, but considering it's very real undertones and the reality it depicts, it surely merits the attention of anyone who lived through the crisis, or those now enjoying the fruits of its resolution.",8.0,Anonymous,History

13 Reasons Not To See Any Movie With Kevin Costner,"Only Kevin Costner would have hubris enough to insert his mug alongside modern day legends JFK and RFK on a DVD case. Open up the case, and Costner is a one man wrecking crew that completely weakens an otherwise powerful film. I don't know if his Kenny ODonnell character is real or fiction, but he manages to make that point irrelevant. From his Forrest Gump type omnipresence to his truly not to be believed Mayor Quimby/JFK accent, Costner does more damage to the Kennedy brothers legacy than an unexpurgated Marilyn Monroe documentary. Is any reasonable person expected to believe that ODonnell's wisdom was the final word in the drama of the Cuban Missle crisis? No, but Costner in his advanced stage of megalomania overlooks this slight detail, in order to make a film in which HE appears to save the world. Again, its a darn shame. Great subject matter naturally, and it scores big on historic drama. If only he had had the courage and humility to simply produce this movie, and left himself as a minor character, or better still, out of shot altogether, this would probably go down as one of the better movies of its time. But his idiotic totally inappropriate appearances rob this film of any sense of realism, and consequently relevance. The tragedy of the failing Hollywood system is well represented in this film and its defining use of error in motion at all levels.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Hollywood Story,"It's a sad day in history when people watch a movie and think they're seeing history. Completely forgetting that Hollywood are not about to give them facts if said facts make them uncomfortable and not wanting to come back for more.It's a sad day when people can't do their own research - especially today when the resources of the World Wide Web stand at everyone's disposal.But in the gung-ho mindset of the US, it's perhaps not surprising. Hollywood is more liberal than a lot of people think, but that doesn't mean they're about to tell the truth if said truth should in any way interfere with their box office.There is a clear agenda here - and considering the real story of this historical event, there is a thin line one must tread, as going too far in making the actual facts all too explicit could easily alienate the charged audience. Hollywood knows cinema at their level can't be scandalous - and yet to tell the true story of this 'Cuban missile crisis' at such a level of exposure would have caused a scandal.In 1961 the United States committed an act of aggression against the Soviet Union. The US deployed fifteen intermediate range nuclear missiles closer to the Turkish border, directly threatening cities in the Soviet Union.Soviet strategists tried to achieve equality by placing missiles in Cuba. The crisis was finally resolved when Khrushchev, after waving the big stick, started dangling the carrot: if the US backed their missiles in Turkey, he'd remove the weapons in Cuba. He even let the US look the heroes - and in this concession won disfavour with his own back home who didn't see as he should have done that.But hawks were on both sides of this conflict, as the movie shows. What it does not show however is the actual truth of the story. In typical Hollywood fashion things are made up and the US have to look good by the final credits. When in fact if the mad brass in the Pentagon hadn't been pushing so hard all along, the entire affair would have been avoided and that generation would have been spared one major scare.This cannot come forth in a Hollywood movie. Of course it can't. And many of the reviewers who have colleagues at their offices who know the full score don't even know it because it's kept conveniently from public sight as much as possible - it finds its way to the back page of newspapers and history books lots of those 'god fearing' people in the US don't want their poor children to read.And yet the facts stand for themselves. One need only wander over to Wikipedia to read the 'real' story without the Hollywood trimmings and falsehoods. A great crisis was brought on the world because of a bunch of mad generals in Washington - and the worst of it is they probably never regretted it, probably never woke up and realised what they'd attempted to perpetrate.The movie does give adequate insight into the kinds of political power struggles that go on in any government and how hard it can be for a public leader to control military idiots like this. At times the actors' portrayals go a bit too far over the top: the grimaces and dirty looks are just too evil (or are they).But at the end of the day it's like this: if you've heard about this crisis as we have and you want to find out what really happened, don't rely on this movie. As is said in so many words: 'we need to get the truth here'. And it doesn't matter that Jack Nicholson's character in another movie about the military bellows out: 'you can't handle the truth'. People can not only handle it - they demand it.",,Anonymous,History

"Great, intense and accurate","I'm a bit partial on this since the Cold War is a favorite subject of mine. However, despite knowing the details and also the obvious fact world didn't end in the 1960s because of a global nuclear conflict, the movie kept a tight grip. It was not boring at all even if it's about politics and talk. In fact, I bet it works as a nice primer on the subject and it might even spark interest if shown to those who mostly learn of the subject from school books.What I love about this movie is that as far as I know it's very, very accurate (if you don't count some little details seen and that kind of nitpicking). Still, it's as intense as JFK (that I bet most people agree invents a lot of stuff to make it interesting) and has similarly very interesting characters and scenes.For example, I found it fascinating how the film showed people machinating and filtering facts behind the scenes (something that doesn't really come through when reading about it), this time for the *good* of mankind. A sane person will want to forget about some little aggressions - like bullet holes in a fighter jet - when any justified retaliation or accusation could escalate into millions of people dying in an instant. Maybe that exact thing didn't really happen but it is entirely believable and I thought gives some ideas how the personality and gut instinct of the guys in charge is what makes everything tick - not the official actions and reports.Now that I mentioned JFK: apart from Costner, the two films have something else in common: using black and white footage mixed with color footage - and I have to say in Thirteen Days it didn't really work. The b/w scenes (that fade in and out of color) add nothing. I think the purpose was to underline significant historical details but considering how accurate the movie is that's overkill. Thus they only managed to annoy me a bit. Still a very minor flaw and the only one.The acting was top notch, although I have to reiterate that for me, the whole mood, intensity and factual accuracy takes the cake. Overall, very, very good.P.S. For more ""guys in a room and deciding of the fates of millions of people"" goodness, check out the made-for-TV movie Conspiracy.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Oh. Is that all...? TERRIFIC FILM.,"Reminded throughout ""who KNEW it could be so hard ..? I don't know how I managed to miss this terrific movie until now. But here we are again, superpowers jockeying for position to claim peace. Back then the 2 superpowers, The United States and the Soviet Union where in at least one we know cooler heads prevail and quite possibly both. But so many near-misses
too many excuses to dump diplomacy that could have landed in mutual destruction and cost us the planet. As JFK so rightly and humbly put it ""I think we both won ...""
Rarely is a history lesson as entertaining as it is factual. I've learned that apart from the necessary embellishments this stuck pretty close to true. President of the United States, his Attorney General and his Chief Advisor are jobs where the wishy-washy need not apply nor the hotheads yearning for war to ignite. These 3 men may have argued each other's logic but never in question their shared deeply principled commitment to exhaust all options before going to war. Each took a turn at carrying out another's scenario to its natural conclusion where again they'd arrive on the unthinkable. There were others who used the unthinkable as a resort without stating the reality that it's our collective last resort. These men epitomize the great America where bullheadedness aims for peace and we the people admire (and therefore elect) a brilliance in intellect, character and tone necessary to keep it and us intact. Yes in October of 2020 hoping for something of substance to return in a principled government that respects the wisdom of shared power; that when an executive branch fails to recognize its limitations, the legislature and judiciary find the courage to defend our Constitution or otherwise own the weakness of acquiescence in the damage of a nation.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Bobby(movie) even though everyone says he is a fine man but no reels on the reality. This movie also shows how JFK & RFK wanted peace more than anything and how some of the generals or high officials disliked their NEED FOR PEACE as WEAKNESS. I say it takes a lot of courage to stand up to what you believe and fight for peace rather than go into war and ruin others life when the main guys who initiated this remains hidden in a thick fortress of shield. It takes a lot of courage and good soul to think about the farewell of millions of countrymen over power and show offs of STRENGTH.

The Cold War had reach its climax and a rash act by the Russian hierarchy shoved the gravest danger in the face of John F. Kennedy, still wet behind the ears. This film really captures some of the intricacies of that historical moment. While Kevin Costner's character is a bit much, we get to see the tension that existed in the global community and behind the closed doors of the White House. As the two powers parry and thrust, we realize the consequences. There is so much posturing in politics, but when the price is destruction, or at best, invasion, the stress meter goes all the way to the right. I have to say that the portrayals of the politicians of the time was nicely done (as was the military). We tend to oversimplify things in our smugness as Americans, but imagine having to make the decisions these men made. It is an ultimate chess match which has the face- saving piece hanging over it.

"Excellent, solid historical drama","There does not seem to be any reason to see this movie more than twice, but it is worth seeing once.Clocking in at 2 1/2 hours, its not that its boring, its just that it gets a little redundant.  Okay, Costner is frightened, I got that already, the 26th time.  I don't need him getting on line for confession or telling his wife to get ready for the unthinkable to realize that this was an extremely serious time in history.  Show me someone else having anxiety, he can't have cornered the market on that particular emotion.Possibly more time would have been better spent showing Joe Sixpack and his family and their reaction.  99% of the movie takes place inside the White House, it might have been nice to open it up a little.But its all still really fascinating.  The politics and the politicians, the assuming you know what the enemy is doing, the power struggles, the second-guessing..its all right here.All the casting is fantastic.  Bruce Greenwood is not doing a party imitation and even gets in some subtle references to Kennedy's chronic bad back, without making a big deal of it.  Costner's accent was overdone at times but he is, for better or worse, the soul of the movie and you see a lot of it through his eyes.  All the supporting actors are great, but I enjoyed Christopher Lawford's couple of scenes the most.  I had assumed when I saw his name in the credits he would be playing his father Peter, who he resembles, but he does not.He's also in on the only laugh supplied by the movie - a pushy White House receptionist gets off a funny line, which is much appreciated.8/10.

Brinksmanship American style,"Once again we have the American President as American Hero  the sound stages of  Hollywood must be littered with reproductions of the Oval Office. This time however we have a story based on a real event, the `Cuban missile crisis' of October 1962, when the Soviet Union commenced installing medium range nuclear missiles on sites in Cuba. President John F Kennedy imposed a naval blockade of Cuba and prepared U S forces to invade, but the Soviet Union backed down and agreed to remove the missiles in return for the U S secretly removing some obsolete missiles from Turkey some months later.For those of us around at the time, they were exciting times, and Kennedy received high praise for his cool handling of the crisis. While not quite hagiography, this film puts the Kennedy brothers in a favourable light, Jack not giving in to military pressure for a pre-emptive strike and Bobby doing a fine piece of negotiation with the Soviet ambassador. Most of the other civilians involved come out well   Stevenson the U S ambassador to the United Nations who suggests the Turkey deal, Mcnamara, the Defense secretary, Rusk the secretary of State and Mc George Bundy, the national security adviser -  all play positive roles in ending the crisis. Only the CIA's McClone offered negative spook paranoia. On the other hand, the portrayal of the military top brass, in particular the Air Force chief of staff, Curtis LeMay (a fine performance by Kevin Conway) , made one thankful that their political masters were strong enough to control them. Otherwise there would indeed have been a nuclear armageddon.The story is told through a minor character, Kenny O'Donnell, the president's `special adviser,' in reality his appointments secretary, played by Kevin Costner (also one of the producers). O'Donnell certainly did have access to the president, having an adjacent office, but I suspect most of his role is fictional  he is more like an external projection of some of the thoughts going through Jack Kennedy's own mind as he grapples with the crisis. He is shown as having a crucial role, yet at the same time its not really his story and it would have been just as absorbing without him. The real interest is in the relationship between Jack and Bobby, and their struggle to marry geopolitical and domestic political priorities without triggering a nuclear holocaust. Bruce Greenwood doesn't closely resemble Jack Kennedy, but gives an earnest, if not particularly warm portrait. Stephen Culp as Bobby not only looks like him, but conveys exactly that almost desperate boyish enthusiasm and ambition Bobby Kennedy exuded.We see a bit of the military hardware in action  (there was a lot of sabre-rattling during the crisis but apparently only one death as a result) but the real focus is the discussions in the Oval office and the Cabinet room. It was a closerun thing  more than once Jack Kennedy nearly caved into pressure from the military for instant action.This is a worthy effort from Roger Donaldson, who once made warm cuddly New Zealand movies (eg `Smash Palace' 1981). It holds the viewers's attention for all of its 140 or so minutes, but it would be nice to know a little more about what was going on in the Kremlin. After all their records are now accessible. The ultimate irony of course is that the reviled Fidel Castro is 38 years later still in power in Cuba, having outlasted both the Soviet Union and 8 American Presidents. A Hollywood feature on Fidel, however, is not a likely prospect.",,Anonymous,History

"Honest cinematography, story and acting.","When I heard that Mr Costner was making a film about the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis - I was terrified, more terrified than if a Nuclear ICBM was 80 miles from my home. I was expecting Costner to assume the lead role of President John Kennedy - I was wrong. Mr Costner handed that role to Bruce Greenwood (a fine choice for his voice alone,) and became Kenny O'Donnell - special aide to the president (a little similar to his role in JFK.) This film unlike many other Hollywood adaptations (Cough 'U-571' Cough) was fairly historically accurate and presented at a steady, unrushed pace. I misjudged this film before seeing it.The reels of celluloid arrived at cinemas gradually, sticking around for merely a week or so. This film had a target audience - those with an interest in historical events and their consequences, no those who went to see Hanks in 'Apollo 13' hoping for action but instead getting three hours of grey suits, grey expressions and grey acting. This film too is predominately grey (the colour of 1960s politics,) and if you don't like it - tough. This film is a drama to be shown in History classes globally for content - not to be converted into mugs and fluffy pyjamas with matching trading cards. This review may appear to poke fun at America - this is not the case, it highlighted how the UNITED States were and can still be, if only they settled for reality instead of enforcing artificiality upon the world - a world which in October 1962 we almost lost.Watch this film, try to enjoy it, remember it is not - nor never was it intended to be a huge Box-Office smash - just a truthful preservation of the facts which all too many are keen to forget.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Excellent political thriller that goes to amazing efforts to stay true to reality.,"One of the most important things about movies that deal with true historical events is that they take as few liberties as possible with the facts, and Thirteen Days stays amazingly close to what really happened. The 1960s are re-created with almost the same skill and precision as we saw in the great Apollo 13, and the tension created by the Cuban Missile Crisis, the event upon which the movie is based, is very successfully captured in the film. This is one of the best parts of the movie, because that tension is something that the government at the time tried very hard to keep the public from finding out about.The film is basically a behind the scenes look at how the government under the Kennedy administration operated with the Russians and with the press in handling the problem of offensive missiles seen in Cuba, within firing range of the U.S. The conflict is much more significant than just getting the Russians to remove the missiles, because the U.S military is doing everything possible to get authorization to fire upon Cuba and go to war. This is understandable to a certain degree, because the military spends so much time training for something like this so of course they're going to want to move on it, but it also makes the chief of staff in the film come off as a hot-headed redneck who just wants to blast the Cubans out of the water.John F. Kennedy was brilliantly portrayed by Bruce Greenwood, which is surprising because of his less than enviable iconography (yeah, he was that jerk in Rules of Engagement and that jerk in Double Jeopardy and, if my memory serves me, he was also that jerk in Disturbing Behavior). Kevin Costner stumbles over every line in the film, delivering one of the most badly mangled fake accents in film history. I personally think that Costner is a very good actor (I even liked Waterworld), but he was entirely the wrong person for the part of Kenny O'Donnell - his horrific accent overshadowed every other element of his performance.But as a political and historical thriller, Thirteen Days scores big. The Cuban Missile Crisis and the reactions of the government and the press and the public are re-created with stunning detail, and the results are outstanding. Even younger generations who were not born when the crisis happened can enjoy it because of its brisk pace and well-written script. Thirteen Days manages to avoid being a boring semi-documentary, yet retains its historical accuracy and achieves maximum effect.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Great Kevin Costner Role,"Oh well I am a history buff, and watch all sorts of shows on the history channel.  I find historical movies interesting, and this one kept my attention.  I do not know how much of the film is factual, especially the fighting with the generals at the NSC, but the film documents who's who, and at what time events happened.  The factual spin makes this film work.  I like how Kevin Costner plays the old fashion type dad to bring reality to his character.  Bruce Greenwood played a realistic JFK. This movie, in my opinion, was one of Costner's best.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Well done Kennedy propaganda,"Indeed, this movie is very well done and builds up an enormous tension. But: I consider the concentration on the White House as a failure. Today, we have lots of information what really happened in the Kremlin and in Havana these days. That's lacking. Although, we owe a lot of thankfulness to the Kennedy brothers to stand firmly, from the European point of view it's an entertaining lot of Kennedy propaganda. Very good performances especially by Bruce Greenwood and Robert Culp. And a splendid score by Trevor Jones.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Good TV drama with well-directed dramatic tension and some fine performances ... and Kevin Cosner,"A good movie, with some excellent performances. Bruce Greenwood is utterly believable as President Kennedy and was a bit of inspired casting, and Steven Culp makes an excellent Bobby Kennedy. The latter's performance deserves special mention, I feel, as Culp is otherwise a relative unknown, someone who has a long list of walk on parts in numerous TV series from The Cosby Show to Grey's Anatomy, yet is not exactly a familiar name or face.As a drama it is enjoyable to follow and achieves real dramatic tension during critical moments, which is a tricky act to pull off in any story when one already knows the end (if not, Google 'Cuban Missile Crisis'!)I was not left with an impression of having watched a high end movie, it left more of an impression of a high quality TV drama-documentary. In short I liked it! It kept my attention all the way through, and I'm someone who easily loses interest if I feel the quality of a movie is becoming suspect, or it is simply boringly told.Kevin Costner ... his performance is good, I suppose, but ... what is it about the man? Towards the end of the movie I get the feeling he's trying to steal the show. He simply a presidential adviser, but as the political tensions escalate I feel Cosner is forgetting that the movie is not about him, but about Kennedy, nucleur missiles and a key moment in world diplomatic history. He should stayed in the background and trusted the abilities of Greenwood, etc. to carry the drama to its conclusion.Or maybe this criticism should really be directed at the writers or director. However, maybe I'm overdoing the criticism. Costner's a big name. If he'd been an unknown in his first movie I'd be praising he to the heavens.All-in-all a movie I'd recommend to a friend as a memorable drama which will leave a good impression and even educate one a little bit.",7.0,Anonymous,History
Days that Shook the World,"In 1961, an inexperienced President Kennedy backed an illegal (and ultimately unsuccessful) attempt to depose Castro.  A year later, Castro struck a deal with Krushchev to deploy Russian nuclear weapons in Cuba.  It seems that Krushchev was determined to push the theory of MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) to its limits: the theory said that both superpowers had to behave sensibly, as neither would survive a war: Krushchev, however, took an outrageous gamble for strategic advantage, on the assumption that the U.S. would still be unable to survive a war, and so would have to concede anyway.  For Kennedy, it was a tough call: he resolved not to tolerate the missiles, but through his actions had to appear both resolute enough to make it clear to the Russians that it was they had to back down, but also conciliatory, avoiding provocations that could have forced his enemy's hand the wrong way.  This balancing act was rendered all the harder by the presence of more gung-ho (or simply pessimistic) elements within the U.S. government, and the need to prepare for war, in case diplomacy failed. After two tense weeks, the missiles were withdrawn and although Kennedy's golden image has since tarnished, his handling of the crisis is still widely praised.'Thirteen Days' is a dramatic reconstruction of these events.  The story is told entirely from the American side, and takes the standard, patriotic liberal, pro-Kennedy line, so we get a lot of square-shouldered men striving manfully to do their best for their country; and a surprisingly aged Kevin Costner is unsurprisingly annoying in the central role of Kennedy's political adviser (Kennedy was a notorious philanderer, which may be why the drama focuses on another character, who can drearily be shown to love his family without invoking ridicule in the audience).  For all these flaws, it's still a gripping, blow-by-blow account of the military and diplomatic moves that constituted arguably the gravest moments humanity has faced.  The world, and Castro, survive to this day; Kennedy, of course, did not, and whether you believe Oswald or the C.I.A. did for him, opposition to his Cuban policy was undoubtedly (and ironically) a central motive in his assassination.  'Thirteen Days' convinces one how unjust that fate was.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Too long,"This movie may have only been 2 hours and 25 minutes but it felt like forever. But it wasn't terrible I'm sure there were many people that enjoyed this movie, just not me. There wasn't really any exciting parts of the movie, instead of being on the edge of my chair wondering what's going to happen next I was asleep wondering when it would end. Even though I didn't exactly enjoy the movie it was still well made other than the poor accent that Kevin Costner had. I wish the movie was more exciting or had something to reel you in because the Cuban Missile Crisis is really interesting. I understand that it is a historical film but it needs some spice/flavor.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Cuban Missile Crisis,"Thirteen Days is a film about the Cuban Missile Crisis, the issues on Soviet point of view as well as a U.S. stand point, and the problems it would cause world wide. John F. Kennedy played by Bruce Greenwood along with Robert Kennedy played by Steven Culp, work to find a solution so as not to start a nuclear war in the United States much less a third World War. Kevin Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell special assistant to the president and acts as the only fictional character in the movie that during the crisis didn't exist and basically narrates the story for its viewers. Although he is a fictional character he clearly sets up the historical facts in the right way to show the significance and importance of the Cuban Missile Crisis.While JFK struggles with the news about nuclear weapons so close to home, other political figures of the government have to also come to an agreement on what should happen with the issue. Some can be called ""hawks"" like certain generals that want to just bomb Cuba with their own nuclear weapons to finish off the communist government in Cuba as well as the power the Soviet Union had imposed on the United States by placing their weapons in such close range. Others can be called ""doves"" because of their more peaceful minds in that they would rather use a strong and forceful talk with the head of the Soviet Union at the time.The implications brought up by the Soviets having placed their missiles so close to the U.S. is that the U.S. was now in danger that a nuclear war could wipe out most of their country as well as start a third world war. It also meant that the U.S. might be seen as an enemy to other countries if their decision was to bomb Cuba and killing innocent peoples in trying to destroy the missiles.The film portrays JFK as most would have liked to know him. It depicted him as very proud and glorious moment in history as opposed to the Bay of Pigs incident a while before where he in a way ""lost"" the battle. But the film also showed him as a much stressed out man, one who drank a lot, took medications and had a lot on his mind. The film clearly shows who are the doves and who are the hawks letting a more realistic view into the mind of a lot of political leaders at the time of the Cuban Missile Crises. The film has good historical facts while also letting in the Hollywood perspective on the issue. Overall I give the movie a two thumbs up and at least a four star review.",,Anonymous,History
Behind the scenes of the Cuban missile crisis,"""Thirteen Days"" from 2000, exquisitely directed by the esteemed Roger Donaldson, is a powerful historical drama that masterfully encapsulates the tense nuclear doomsday atmosphere of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962. Kevin Costner delivers a stellar performance as Kenneth O'Donnell, a close advisor to President John F. Kennedy, portraying the high stakes and nightmarish decision making process with remarkable authenticity and emotional depth. The film's meticulous attention to historical detail, combined with a powerful script, immerses viewers in the very human urgency and fear of the era, showcasing the delicate balance of diplomacy and military action. The cinematography effectively captures the era's aesthetics, while the score (Trevor Jones), heightens the suspense nicely. Supporting performances by actors like Bruce Greenwood (President Kennedy) and Steven Culp (Bobby Kennedy), add layers to the narrative, illustrating the complexities and important nuances of leadership during a crisis. This film not only serves as a thrilling political thriller but also as a poignant reminder of the fragility of peace, making it a must-watch for both history buffs and cinema lovers alike. While this is in no way a documentary, it remains an enthralling dramatic tribute to the deadly brinksmanship that pulled America back from the edge during the most volatile two weeks of the Cold War. Still highly relevant and unfortunately, still just as applicable to modern times as it ever was.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Kevin Costner returns to form!,"As far as historical pieces go, this is up there with JFK.Costner is superb as Kenny O'Donnell, the know all Special Assistant to JFK, despite his Forrest Gump-alike Bostonian accent. Two relative unknowns though are the show stealers; Steven Culp is eerily good as Bobby K, whereas Bruce Greenwood is excellent as the Pres. The real winner in the movie though is the David Self's script. The lack of real action had to be compensated by something, and the lingual sparring between the main threesome and the military and hordes of advisors and secretaries, and Special Assistants and so on, certainly does that. For someone who wasn't alive during the Cuban Missile Crisis, this is as informative as it is entertaining, despite the fact that some of it will no doubt have been untrue. The only real flaw is the jingoistic sensationalism of the Kennedies and the bad light that the post-Bay Of Pigs Military is shown in, but I can look beyond that when the script is throwing up lines like ""I am the President of the United States. And I say when we go to War!"". Excellent film thats even better second time round. As a scriptwriter myself, this movie has influenced me to changing some of my 'action heavy' writing, for the more witty intense dialogue. 9/10",10.0,Anonymous,History

While currently doing a research paper on the CMC, I found some of the info. in the movie just ""stuck"" in; almost to justify that the movie was accurate.

Disappointing,"I found 13 days disappointing.I was in my 20's during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and well remember what a riveting event it was.  Everybody at the time knew that the world was on the brink of nuclear war, and everybody breathed a very deep sigh of relief when it was over.  The world had been so terrifyingly close to the Apocalypse!We'll never knew exactly how the crisis was handled, in Washington and Moscow, but I'm fully prepared to give the late President Kennedy and Secretary Khruschev full marks for drawing us all back from the edge of the abyss.  It was a horrifyingly difficult crisis to deal with, as the US-USSR stance had been highly adversarial for decades, there was no direct communication between the US and USSR leadership at the time, and both sides had military complexes chomping at the bit for a resolution of the problem through military means.I didn't find ""13 Days"" a satisfying re-telling of the story.  I found the script, casting and editing weak, and the movie about half an hour too long. The top military men were presented as intemperate juveniles, and all the top military and political figures (with the exception of the O'Donnell character) were completely lacking in subtlety, gravitas and depth.  Others have commented on Costner's now-you-hear-it-now-you-don't accent.What made the Cuban Missile Crisis such a horror was that neither side knew what the other was thinking or would do.  The movie lacked all sense of that.The movie also didn't convey how very concerned all we ordinary folk were about the whole terrifying situation.I give it 5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,History

As intense as it must have been to live it,"I believe that this film comes as close to the viewer actually experiencing the immense tension those days as it is possible to get. Reviewers who actually did, please correct me if I am wrong. I did not remember many details about the Cuban missile crisis going into this picture; yet I was instantly captivated when it began. It is exciting and engaging throughout, and well-paced, so that while a lot of information and emotion is being conveyed and a lot of credible characters introduced, we're never overwhelmed, the movie doesn't lose us at any point. Production values leave absolutely nothing to be desired, and the many shots of military hardware are stunning. The plot is intelligent, intricate and well-told. Editing and cinematography are marvelous. Acting is excellent, and it seemed like those of the leads who ought to all went for the Boston accent(I understand that Costner's was poor, but at least the attempt was made). Every role is well-cast, as well. There is some humor in this, the amount and tone are appropriate, it doesn't try too hard and it's quite funny. There is infrequent moderate to strong language in this, and the subject matter is, obviously, rather disturbing. If you think a 13-year-old can handle it, then you can try to let them watch it. I recommend this to everyone, and I sympathize with anyone who had to live through the terrifying two weeks(and were old enough at the time to understand what was going on). 8/10",8.0,Anonymous,History
Just how much nuclear test stock footage can one movie have?,"I liked Thirteen Days primarily because I had been expecting an Oliver Stone-type revisionist look at the subject and didn't get it.My main complaints about the film was the constant interruption of the narrative by the insertion of shots depicting nuclear blasts, and the fact that the movie ran about 20 minutes too long to maintain my complete interest.It was interesting to see this take on the situation from the government side, but I think if I want to pursue the subject again, I'll simply re-watch Matinee.",6.0,Anonymous,History

That's how tense it must have been back then,"There were a couple of occasions during the cold war when the world was on the brink: in 1983, when the communists suspected that the 'Able Archer' NATO a manoeuvres were the prelude to an attack, and, much better known, the Cuban missile crisis of autumn 1962. This film reconstructs the events of that crisis from the US point of view, with the focus being on the decisions made by J. F. Kennedy and his advisers. I am using the term 'reconstruct' consciously: As the title indicates, the picture details the events day by day. That is a brilliant approach which helps generating suspense in mainly two ways: First, because it allows showing how Kennedy and his government were trying to find their way in a fog of lacking information, with no knowledge of what exactly was going on in Cuba (e.g. Would a military strike eliminate the Soviet missile bases? Or only c. 90% of them? Would the surviving 10% be enough to attack the US?). Second, the day-by-day approach makes it evident that the US was anything but a monolithic power block. Kennedy was exposed to conflicting advice, with the hawks in favour of intervening on Cuba and to hell with the consequences, and the doves advocating a deal with the USSR. Bruce Greenwood, who plays Kennedy, is excellent as as a president who does rely on a network partly composed of family members, but who takes his job seriously and is aware of what the consequences of a false stept would be (one shudders to think what would have happended with someone like Donald Trump in charge). I am normally no fan of Kevin Costner, but I found I liked him here. He does well as Kennedy's adviser Kenny O'Donnel. All in all, this is an extremely well-acted and intelligent film that any US president should be forced to watch: After all, the nuclear stand-off between the great powers continues.",8.0,Anonymous,History
13 days.....is that the film's length?,"I'll be honest.  I did not like this movie.  Thirteen Days is an unbearable 2 1/2 hours of Kennedy pumping, uneven style, poor editing, multiple boom mike appearances, and puzzling moments of B&W exposure. What about Costner's attempt at a Boston accent?  Admittedly this becomes more bearable as the movie plays, but it is so bad in the beginning that I heard several groans.The ""Football of Doom"" shot near the beginning is supposed to be ominous, but I heard laughter around the theater.  Bobby Kennedy's occasionally comedic dialogue fell flat making people more uncomfortable than anything.The shots of the jets were very cool, but that wasn't enough to keep me interested.

I would like to say that the dialogue being used here was incredible and when it comes to the transitions between these important people, warships, and scenes of bombs, it all fits together.I feel like this movie didn't have any types of flaws or mistakes due to the emotions being used in these actors as it could have been portrayed by these actual real people.

A Pinch Of Salt Please,"I wasn`t born untill 1966 but I`m reliably informed that the whole of humanity was absolutely terrified by the events of the Cuban missile crisis. A great number of people watching the events of the Soviet convoy speeding towards Cuba were convinced the bomb was going to drop and THIRTEEN DAYS tells what was going on behind the scenes at the white houseUnfortunately I didn`t think the story was told as well as it could have been . It`s a film that`s too long for its own good and I can`t help thinking there`s been some tinkering with facts . John F Kennedy was weak and indecisive and was surrounded by hawks who were itching to start a war with the USSR ? And as shown here Kenny O` Donnell along with Bobby Kennedy were the only voices of reason at the white house ? Oh right so John F Kennedy had little to do with averting war did he ? THIRTEEN DAYS also feels similar to JFK at times but without any of the strengths of Oliver Stone`s movie , when the screen fades from colour to black and white there seems to be no reason for it while the stock footage is exactly what it looks like - stock footage unlike JFK. And talking of JFK it`s implied ( Though not exactly hammered home ) that John F Kennedy`s performance during the crisis is what led to his asasination a year later .Like I said watch this movie to make up your own mind but take it with a pinch of salt",5.0,Anonymous,History
A rare insight into a most difficult time in american history,"My daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.

Movie Review,"The movie ""Thirteen Days"", starring Bruce Greenwood as President John F. Kennedy and his personal adviser Kevin Costner, attempts to recreate the experience of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The movie shows what occurred during this terrible time from the White House point of view. The movie shows many details that occurred in real life including the photographs taken by a spy plane discovering the construction of missiles in Cuba. The US had a huge problem with this because they would not tolerate the existence of missiles in a country so near that the missiles would take a matter of minutes to reach the US if launched. THe conflict went on for thirteen days, hence the name of the movie due to the stubbornness of both countries and their refusal to back down. THe movie shows how close we came to having a possible nuclear war.",,Anonymous,History
Kennedy Finally Gets His Due on Film,"While the Kennedy administration had its share of scandal and improper behavior, movies about the Kennedys, and JFK in particular, have tended to focus too much on the details of a torrid personal life, and not enough on moments of triumph, such as the Cuban Missile Crisis. Then ""Thirteen Days"" came along, and dared to break from the mold. This is Kennedy at his finest, and while critics charge that ""Thirteen Days"" is just pro-Kennedy propaganda (JFK's nephew even has a role), historical dramas make for more intelligent movie-making than soap operas.Besides an intelligent topic, we have a well assembled cast, with particularly good performances provided by Bruce Greenwood as JFK (who manages to be convincing in spite of bearing no resemblance to any Kennedy, let alone JFK) and Steven Culp (who is making his second appearance as RFK on film, having previously played him in ""Norma Jean & Marilyn"" (1997). Unfortunately, I do not have the same feeling about Kevin Costner's performance, and I cannot help but to think of Jim Garrison (his character in ""JFK"" (1991)) every time his character, Kenneth O'Donnell, appears. It is as if Garrison had jumped into some time machine so as to better fulfill his obsession with Kennedy. That is the problem with using the same actor for two different roles in two different movies dealing with the same man. Nothing against Costner, he just does not seem to quite fit.Unlike many other films, this movie relies almost entirely on dialogue, with little action or romance, so it is not entertaining in the conventional sense. It is wholly about those conversations that happen behind close doors that shape human history, and much of the drama is played out sitting down.For those equipped for DVDs, that version of this film is especially desirable, for it includes archival footage and interviews which cast further light on the crisis; thirteen days in which the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. came to the brink of war over the U.S.S.R.'s placement of offensive nuclear weapons on the Cuban island. For those who know the outcome, the movie does not reduce the suspense, while those learning about the crisis for the first time receive a valuable lesson in diplomacy and military self-control.",9.0,Anonymous,History
An amazing performance by Bruce Greenwood...,"This film is riveting, suspenseful and keeps you glued to the set. Bruce Greenwood's performance as President Kennedy is on point even down to the walk due to President Kennedy's bad back. This actor in my opinion is under appreciated, he is a true incredibly talented actor. Overall a great movie to watch with a superb supporting cast. Kevin Costner ( which I am a huge fan) seems to be the biggest name here but unfortunately falls short of being the biggest talent in this particular film. The accent was not quite on point but role and tone of character was believable. Give this film a shot, if for no other reason than a good history lesson.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Jack, where are you when we need you?","Yes, the story is well-known and conventionally told. The direction of ""Thirteen Days"" is no better than what you'd find in a movie made for Lifetime TV. But I'm giving this film a ""9"" because of Bruce Greenwood. John F. Kennedy has been portrayed -- on stage, TV  and movies -- by many many actors. No one until Bruce Greenwood has gotten him right. Greenwood's performance embodies why JFK still has such a hold on America's heart. And it has nothing to do with charisma, the Peace Corps, the Alliance for Progress, the space race, the Missile Crisis, or sex.<g> It has to do with the enormous decency and empathy of the man. Not only was he smarter and more courageous than others we have had since, he was more understanding of the hurts, doubts, and longings of other people on this planet. To not use force when force is all on your side -- that is the true hero. And hooray for the great actor Bruce Greenwood for reminding us of that.",9.0,Anonymous,History

"If we got too close,we would not be there to talk about that","Those ""thirteen days"" were the closest point that could easily lead to conventional and eventually nuclear war between USA and USSR and their allies.World was on the edge of unimaginable disaster and only political wisdom of John.F.Kennedy on one side and Nikita Khrushchev on the other saved us from nuclear obliteration. But the course of history could have been different if there was someone else on place of president of the United States instead of Kennedy. What would happen if president was Richard Nixon? Just two years before,on 1960 elections for president, Kennedy won over Nixon with a small difference. From todays point of view American nation made not just right choice of choosing Kennedy instead of Nixon,but also the choice that proved to be one that eventually saved modern civilization from nuclear destruction. Nobody knew that in 1960, but two years later it became so obvious. Would Nixon successfully resist the pressure from Pentagon to invade Cuba and order an aerial attack on Soviet nuclear missiles sites on that island if he was president in 1962 instead of Kennedy? We have lots of reasons to believe that he would not. They were two different men. And we all were lucky to have a right one as a president of the most powerful nation on planet in 1962. Off course Nixon became president later in 1968 and he brought American involvement in Vietnam war to an end,but we know how his presidency ended (Watergate scandal). Thirteen days in October 1962 were the most critical point in all Cold War period. Never before and never after that were Soviet Union and United States so close to engage militarily and they will probably never be in that situation again (relations between Russia and USA today are much more friendly). Soviets installed nuclear missiles on Cuba and much of US mainland came to their range. When U-2 spy aircraft discovered missile sites,White House was in panic. USA imposed sanctions against Cuba on October 22,1962 (sanctions still last today after 47 years) and president Kennedy made it clear-""Shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any other nation on Western hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States"". Another 35 Soviet ships were on their way to Cuba to deliver more missiles,so US established naval blockade of Cuba with 40 war ships in Cuban waters. American B-52 strategic bombers carrying nuclear weapons were on alert ready to deliver their deadly payload. If Americans invaded Cuba Soviets would attack NATO garrisons in Berlin and start war in Europe. From conventional it could easily turn to nuclear war and nuclear exchange between two superpowers could bring our civilization to ""stone age"" for those who would survive. Hundreds of millions of human lives were at stake. And this is what this film is telling about with Bruce Greenwood as president Kennedy,Kevin Costner as his adviser Kenny O Donnell and other people. To make it worse one U-2 was shoot down over Cuba with pilot killed on October 27,1962 but situation did not run out of control. Both sides were ready for war,but luckily American and Soviet diplomats found compromise and crisis was solved. Americans agreed to end naval blockade of Cuba (but sanctions remained),to withdraw nuclear missiles from Turkey and obligated that they will not invade Cuba. Soviets agreed to send their ships home and to withdraw all nuclear missiles from Cuba. That deal was done by both sides and world was spared from nuclear conflict. In 1963 special telephone line was established between Washington and Moscow (""red line"") so US and Soviet (later Russian) president could communicate in future crisis and it proved effective. Two leaders who prevented their countries from going in to war later became victims.Kennedy was assassinated in 1963 and Khrushchev was superseded in 1964 and replaced by Leonid Brezhnev. Later in 1967 Khrushchev wrote-""I wanted to destroy capitalist world and Kennedy wanted to preserve it.I guess we both failed"".Khrushchev died in 1971. This is historic movie and it should be watched by those who study modern history as something relevant as historic document. Wisdom and control of human ego prevented us from destroying our selves and it was valuable lesson we should never forget as Kennedy once said- ""For in the final analysis,our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet.We all breathe the same air.We all cherish our children s future.And we are all mortal.""",,Anonymous,History
Shamefully Underrated,"Like many, I was nervous to hear that Kevin Costner was gonna be in a Cuban Missle Crisis flick, with a Bostonian accent no less! But don't let this scare you off! ""Thirteen Days"" is one great, very historically accurate movie. Now obviously there are parts that are dramaticized as this is a movie about those 13 days back in the 60's largely told through the walls of the Kennedy White House. As one born in the mid 70's, I knew about as much about the history of these events as most my age and went into the theater mostly ignorant to the details. I walked out thinking about the tagline; ""Not believing how close we came"" to World War III. But how accurate was it really? God love the Internet for research!Aside from the dramatization, this movie is very close to the facts as far as the government will let us know. I watched this with my parents who actually lived through the days of Air Raid drills in case ""those Commies"" attacked from Cuba. They were struck by how much of their experiences it brought back. But the best part of this movie is the Kennedys themselves. Being as that JFK and RFK were real people and VERY ingrained in our minds of how they were, the task of making them believable on screen is no easy task! Kudos to Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp for performances that make it easier to slip into the movie instead of glaring at us as actors playing those famous figures. In fact it is easy to perhaps think that this is a documentary as opposed to a Hollywood movie. But Hollywood-ized it isn't. This is a slick film, but not glossy like the Bruckheimer or Ridley Scotts can make.At 3 hours in length...prepare yourselves for numb fannies! But for those who love history, this brings something from my 8th grade textbook to life unlike anything else I've seen from ""modern history.""GOOD- The Kennedys, attention to detail, how this film makes me WANT to see what happens...even though it is well documented history.BAD- Costner's accent (though its not that bad, just unbelievable as we know him too well), the numb butts after 3 hrs.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Worst film I've seen this year,"Thirteen Days is a movie that milks the audiences' patriotism to garner box office receipts.  Don't be fooled by the subject matter, this film takes a real life historical event and exploits the story in a poorly done script to make a little dough (see The Patriot).I honestly don't know what the director was thinking.  No, I really mean it...was he thinking Oliver Stone, or John Woo?  Director Roger Donaldson borrows so much from cliched or trademark directing techniques that it's hard to derive his own style.The musical score, which is constantly playing, doesn't leave any thinking up to the audience.  If the scene is tense, the violins are right there to remind you. If the scene is happy, we're not permitted to figure it out for ourselves.  All in all, I wonder if they even hired a composer or just dubbed over the soundtrack from late night crime dramas. Personally, I was insulted that I wasn't allowed to think for myself.  But the rest of the audience didn't seem to mind.  If you're with me then this movie isn't one for you.Some other complaints: Why the black and white scenes?  This was a question I was pondering during and after the film.  There is no obvious conclusion for why Donaldson included the occasional B&W shots except that he was trying to be like Oliver Stone.  Sorry Donnyboy, but it'll take more than Kevin Costner and B&W photography to make you feel like the master.The characters are trading lines so much that it hurts.  And their New Englander accents would make The Simpson's Mayor Quimby jealous.  Also, there are so many characters that a caption always has to appear after a character delivers his first line to tell us who he is (as if it matters...we soon forget about him and the other 100 government officials who are introduced through this mess).  Luckily for the presumed unintelligent viewer, the story line reduces it's characters down to 4 people: JFK, RFK, Coster, and the other guys.  The first three exist to do everything that'll make them look good for the audience, and the other guys exist to undermine peace and tranquility and act as cheerleaders for WWIII.I wasn't around for the Cuban Missle Crisis, though I've heard the situation in the White House was similar to what I just described...but please don't tell me it was as simple as that-- that our democracy elects either a villain or do-gooder.  If this movie is right, then give me Cuba any day.People were cheering at the end of this movie.  Why?  Because it was patriotic I guess.  But it's patriotic in the same way that Independence Day was.  Just because it's America rising up to the challenge doesn't mean it's a good movie.  And just because it is telling a patriotic historical event doesn't mean we should nominate it for an Oscar (which I'm betting will happen).  I wasn't cheering by the end of this film.  I would have liked to see a good movie about the Cuban Missle Crisis.  Is that asking too much?",2.0,Anonymous,History
Something for the Classroom ... and Maybe the War Room,"""Thirteen Days"" is an interesting film. I'm no history buff, but I do feel that much of what was presented goes with the history of the time. I enjoyed the fact that there were no distractions to the plot at hand (no interoffice love affair; no mindless action), which occur many times in historical fiction. The film focuses solely on the politics of the moment and reminds the viewer of the strength of John F. Kennedy and other quality leaders in our time. This is not really something for mainstream viewers, due to the last of sex and violence. It is best suited for a history classroom, even if that brings them to a discussion of historical inaccuracy.

"There were WMD, but war was avoided","George W. Bush and his cronies should watch this movie, together with all Americans. Thirteen Days shows what happens when good men are in power. During the Cuban Missile crisis, America (and the world) faced total destruction. There were ""massive stockpiles"" of ""active"" WMD, ""ready to be launched"". The evidence of the existence of those WMD was overwhelming. Nobody questioned it. Not even the Soviets. And still, war was averted...The movie brilliantly shows how both the Kennedy's and Adlai Stevenson saved America, through diplomacy. It also shows how the evil and dark American military tries to trigger them into a war. But thank God, it failed. Today, a lot has changed: America is run by a bunch of war criminals who force-feed their obvious lies to the American nation, which swallowed every little detail of it, obediently. This fascist government rushed to war, on the basis of bogus arguments, which the entire world exposed.This movie allows us to understand the differences between the Good Kennedy's, when America was a great nation, and the Evil Bush administration, who ruined every last bit of it.A must see for all freedom and truth loving people.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Garbage,"The Cuban Missile Crisis was the worst defeat the United States had suffered in its entire history prior to the Vietnam War. Kennedy was assassinated because he surrendered to the USSR and secretly removed US missiles from Italy and Turkey, as well as publicly promising not to repeat his illegal invasion of Cuba. It's strange how he is still remembered favourably by so many when he was a warmonger who massively increased the illegal US invasion of Vietnam, and caused Khrushchev to build the Berlin Wall. This film is a complete left-wing whitewash, complete with the usual awful non-performance by Kevin Costner.

Review,I recently saw Thirteen Days in my modern war class and i was highly impressed by its ability to create emotion and drama while at the same time being really historically accurate. I enjoyed the movie a lot because it was very easy to watch and at the same time it was teaching you about just how close America came to nuclear war. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in learning about our nations history while at the same time being entertained with an intriguing piece of film. The use of Kenny as a way to delve deeper into conversations between John and Bobby Kennedy was ingenious. The character of Kenny is not a real person however. It was a smart but not historically accurate tactic to use him. I highly recommend this movie.,,Anonymous,History
PRESIDENT JACK KENNEDY FANS WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE,13 DAYS in OCTOBER 1962 was an agonizing time for PRESIDENT KENNEDY. He had just discovered that the Russians had satellites capable of emmitting cosmic rays against individuals on earth just strong enough to cause pain. JFK also discovered that the Russians had put nuclear missiles in Cuba. The military urged attacks against cuba but Bobby Kennedy suggested a blockade or quarantine around cuba. The first time I felt the pain in my side was at a computer lab at a college in Sudbury Ontario. I was working at the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory at the time. I never felt the pain underground in the observatory at 6800 feet down. At least there is some relief from cosmic rays underground. Bruce Greenwood shines as PRESIDENT KENNEDY who delivers solid leadership. Kevin Costner gives a great performance as Kenny O'Donnell the special assistant to the PRESIDENT.

Incredibly accurate and objective historical drama.,"I am currently working on a set of volumes about Jack and Bobby Kennedy, and have spent hundreds of hours researching everything about the Kennedy administration. As movies go, ""Thirteen Days"" has been the most historically accurate film I have ever seen. I cannot speak much for the suspense, because everything that happened, or was said, I already knew about. But, for anyone who is interested in knowing what really happened, ""Thirteen Days"" is as good as it gets. I am no die-hard Costner fan, but I must defend him here. I have read and heard a lot about how he lets his personal admiration of the Kennedy's show in his acting. THIS IS NOT TRUE. The character he plays, Kenny O'Donnell, first met JFK in the mid-1950's. At first, O'Donnell wasn't impressed. By the time JFK was elected, O'Donnell was closer than any non-family member could get to both JFK and RFK. He would have done anything for either one of them. His nickname was 'The Cobra', and everyone knew that to get to either brother, they'd first have to go through O'Donnell. He was also one of the 'Irish Mafia', so I don't think it's fair to knock Costner for letting his penchant for accents show. O'Donnell did have a strong New England/Irish accent, and often tried to hide it. The movie is also very objective. It does not take any dramatic license with any of the events or characters. The closest I could find to a serious omission is Bobby Kennedy wasn't shown to be as integral a player as he really was for JFK - yet it still does better than any previous work in establishing his importance. Any of the dialogue or actions shown in the movie actually did happen, and if anything the producers left out some factual things that could've made people skeptical. More than anything, I would like to emphasize that ""Thirteen Days"" tells the story as it really happened, and the all the various people as they really were.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Mandatory viewing for every American,"This film is very nearly perfect, and should be shown to every single American high school history class. It's riveting, and terrifying sending the most powerful message about cold war politics, and is dead accurate right down to the vintage Ovaltine bottle on the kitchen table.It certainly answer the big question: how important is it to have the most intelligent person you can as President of the United States. (I couldn't help thinking about George W. Bush during the film... how would he have reacted in this situation? Scary.)Costner is masterful, and his accent is just fine. (Do you want to see him speak the same way every single time? Open your hearts and minds, and suspend the fact that you saw Waterworld for just a moment.)Bruce Greenwood's performance is exemplary. He shows a JFK who is both supremely in charge, and extremely human, fallable in both character and confidence in his own leadership.There's nothing funny about any of this, and though I'm not old enough to remember the event, I am sure that it tells the inside story in a way that most people would never have known. I can imagine no time in the history of humanity where we were closer to extinction than these thirteen days. It is a deeply important message to learn.Directors: yes, please!!!

"Pretty good drama, but...","While I was watching ""Thirteen Days"" I could not help comparing it to ""JFK"" for obvious reasons. What peeved me was watching Kevin Costner hero-worship JFK in so blatant a fashion. In more than one instance in the movie, it was apparent that Costner was trying very hard to shove his perspective, probably not on the actual events but on the people involved, down our throats. His character seems to voice Costner's opinion, about the ""greatness"" of the Kennedy brothers. I also did not see the reason to show so many shots of the trio (the Kennedy brothers and O'Donnell) together, to, what I can only assume, establish how close they were. A couple of shots would have made the point, but there were just too many of them.Apart from these minor points, the movie itself made very good watching. It was as good a drama as any I've seen in recent times and definitely on par with the other big presidential drama this season, ""The Contender"". The director makes good use of the camera, switching from B/W to Colour to emphasise the mood very effectively. The scenes showing the Washington big shots discussing the scenario were directed so well that you cannot fail to feel the pressure these guys were in.

All the presidents men...,"""Thirteen days"" describes the Cuba-crisis in October 1962. The world was at the edge of a third world war because the russians stationed their missiles on Cuba. The story is told from the perspective of Kenny O´ Donnell (Kevin Costner), the personal assistant of president John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood).Costner plays in a reserved way this time. Though his name appears first in the credits,  I think that Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp (as Robert Kennedy) are the stars of the movie. The similiarity of their looks - amazing! I can´t judge about the details whether they are correct or not, but as I´ve heard and read in critics and comments the movie is historic correct.The changes between black/white and color scenes give the movie the atmosphere of a documentation. But it´s also full of intimate and personal moments  -  e.g. when O´Donnell is at home with his family or when he is alone in the oval office, talking to J.F.K.Director Roger Donaldson´s movie (""No way out"", also starring Kevin Costner) is a breathtaking and impressive history lesson.

"Excellent movie, with one annoyingly recurring technical flaw.","I found this to be an excellent film.  Costner's accent was not a problem for me.  For the record, I was six years old when the events of this film occurred, and I do recall taking part in air-raid drills at school.  I thought at the time that it was just part of going to school.  Anyway, I liked the focus on Costner's character, rather than on the Kennedys, because they've been overdone in other films and television programs.  I liked that the focus was on the crisis, and not on JFK's private life.  My one problem with the film was the number of times that the boom mike was in the shot. It had to be at least a half-dozen times, and it got to be distracting. Other members of the audience also made comments about it.  It even happened once during a close shot between Costner and Lucinda Jenney, who played his wife (later in the movie, when he comes home late at night).  I've never seen sloppier operation of a boom.",8.0,Anonymous,History
not the best,"I would not recommend anybody to watch this movie. The movie felt long and boring because it had a lot of long scenes that felt unnecessary. Based on the fact that the movie is based on a true story, I personally feel like they could have done more to give the movie more purpose. They portrayed the Cuban Missile Crisis properly but the acting skills were mediocre so it made the movie feel uninteresting. I didn't get to watch the end of the movie due to absence but it probably would not change my thoughts on the movie. I would love to watch another movie based about the Cuban Missile Crisis so I can get a better second view on the whole situation.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Solid film,"This film tries to stick to the facts, and usually gets it right, but ultimately cuts JFK way too much slack.  All history buffs would do well to remember that JFK got elected by running to Nixon's right (JFK coined the term ""missile gap"").  Also, Kruschev himself was quoted as saying that JFK's unimpressive demeanor when they met made him feel that JFK was a man who could be pushed around.

"""We were eyeball to eyeball, and I think the other fella just blinked""","It's taken the human race millions of years to get where it is today, but all that could be taken away from us in just days, even hours. The Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962 escalated, climaxed and then reached its resolution so rapidly that the Doomsday Clock didn't even have time to adjust its setting, but, nonetheless, it is perhaps the closest we've ever been to destroying ourselves for good. Prior to watching Roger Donaldson's taut historical thriller 'Thirteen Days (2000),' I knew very little detail about the Cuban Missile Crisis, but was familiar with its effects on popular culture. Two years afterwards, Sidney Lumet and Stanley Kubrick independently released two similar Cold War thrillers – 'Fail-Safe (1964)' and the satirical 'Dr. Strangelove (1964),' respectively – both of which clearly attempted to reproduce the mortal political situation in which young President John F. Kennedy then found himself (and both films proposed that next time we may not be so lucky).'Thirteen Days' gives life to events that would otherwise, to a belated onlooker like myself, have seemed mere historical footnotes on paper. Only by returning to the proper time and place can one truly appreciate the despair and uncertainty faced, not only by the political leaders holding eleventh-hour meetings in the White House, but also the stunned citizens who would stock up on supplies in preparation for what must have seemed the inevitable. A historical drama like 'All the President's Men (1976)' is magnificent precisely because it succeeds in spite of a foregone conclusion, and 'Thirteen Days' similarly keeps the atmosphere exhilaratingly tense. Most of the film's action unfolds in the stuffy board-rooms and elaborately-decorated rooms of the White House, and this is where it should have stayed. Unfortunately, Donaldson too regularly cuts away from the primary decision-makers to visit American jet pilots, navy boat captains, and even the Cuban missile-workers, thus only partly representing the Presidents' continual frustration at having so little information on which to base his decisions.The story itself revolves around Special Assistant to the President Kenny O'Donnell (played by Kevin Costner with a dubious Bostonian accent), and so presenting the Crisis from the perspective of a reasonably passive, impartial spectator. Bruce Greenwood (most recently spotted in the Bob Dylan biopic 'I'm Not There (2007)') is excellent as JFK, whose (relative) youthfulness is consistently scorned by the reactionary military commanders who seem intent on undermining his authority. Steven Culp, who has a little Brad Dourif about him, is also outstanding as Robert F. Kennedy, without whose matter-of-fact input his brother could never arguably have got along. Unjustly neglected on its original release, 'Thirteen Days' is a fascinating, and often terrifying, historical account of the Cold War's most dangerous fortnight of hostilities – hostilities not necessarily characterised by gunfire or missile strikes, but by the threat of something so much more widespread and devastating. In making his strategic decisions, President Kennedy walked a tightrope above the threat of nuclear war, and we can only be thankful that he kept his balance.",8.0,Anonymous,History

A Powerful and Outstanding Film--Capturing History with Dramatic Flair,"This is a fantastic and enlightening film. Dramatic, powerful and written by historians, the film captures the amazing story of how John F. Kennedy, RFK and his cabinet ultimately prevented WWIII with a brilliant mix of Cold War toughness and true human diplomacy. The story touches on the importance of JFKs presidency and his unique blend of intelligence, compassion and faith. Kevin Costner is positioned as a central figure in the film and does a fine job... partly as a headliner to draw you in to the film. Robert Culp and Bruce Greenwood capture enough of the Kennedy magic to help us all understand and believe that we are lucky they were elected and we may never see such an uncommon blend of real thoughtful decision-making and diplomacy in the modern era. For those who see Kennedy as a popular and maybe even lightweight politico, this film shows why he is often regarded as one of the best US Presidents. The musical score, historic re-enactments and actors are great. The story is engrossing and the direction makes a taut political and international drama come to life for any viewer.Everyone with a curiosity about Kennedy, the presidency or the Cold War will enjoy this well crafted film.

"Powerful, brink of war drama","This movie is what every movie should be. Incredible acting, great directing, brilliant screenplay. I was impressed by how accurate it was to the real story. David Self must have done his homework on the Cuban Missile Crisis when he wrote this script.The casting was practically flawless. The only small set back was Bruce Greenwood as JFK. Not because anything in his performance was lacking, but just because he didn't seem to put a great deal of effort into the Boston accent. Most of the time it was quite obvious that he was a Canadian trying to fake a Boston accent, but this is so trivial that it has no effect on the movie. Even down to the small supporting performances this movie was very well acted. The only performance I didn't care for was a guy with only two lines and who really cares about that. The highlight of this movie was Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy. His performance was subtle, but brilliant. I firmly believe that he deserved the Academy awards for best supporting actor. Him not even getting a nomination is the biggest robbery since Citizen Kane lost Best Picture. Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara was another highlight. I had no clue who the heck he was the first time I saw this movie, but I walked away praising his performance. Kevin Costner gave a great performance, but it's overshadowed by the supporting performances.Just like Tora! Tora! Tora!

"Action-packed, exciting. Now, if only it were true.","Nice job by Costner, understated in performance, probably because he didn't direct. But I don't really want to review the movie, which is good; rather I'd like to correct the history.The actual destroyer USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (DD-850), which intercepted the Russian freighter Marucla during the blockade, was towed out of the naval museum in Fall River, Mass and put to sea under tow for this movie. Two different numbers were painted on her hull, port and starboard, so she could represent two different destroyers in the blockade for the film, and the DASH helicopter deck and ASROC were disguised because they were a post-1962 FRAM MK II conversion. I'm pretty involved with her, as an ex-crewman: I was the CIC and Intelligence officer from 1965-67. During my tour, there were still plenty of old salts around who had been on board during the blockade, and they told a different story than the world knows and the movie tells.Their story is that the JP Kennedy was nowhere near Cuba when the blockade was instituted, but rather off Bermuda (1000 nautical miles, more or less); and as the freighters bearing missiles approached the island, the rest of the Navy was ordered to stand down so the JP Kennedy, namesake of the President's brother, could steam toward the island at emergency flank speed using the ""war sprayer plates"" for the boilers, always kept in the Captain's safe, and be there for the photo op of making the first interception.At least the movie properly lays the blame for the chaos of two messages from Krushchev squarely on JFK and RFK's stupid idea of leaking the Turkey missile exchange gambit to a sympathetic press. And lest we forget, Sen. Kenneth Keating (R-NY) had been screaming about missiles in Cuba the previous December, but it was hotly denied by the White House until weeks before a mid-term election the party in power was widely expected to lose. Never switch horses during a crisis, they say...Indeed, the world little knew how close it came to catastrophe to satisfy JFK's political ambitions.",8.0,Anonymous,History

However, like so many film treatments of JFK and Bobby Kennedy - this is way too much of a puff piece and just adds to the absurd glorification of the very human, very flawed Kennedys. Utterly ignored here is how, in the end, Kennedy actually was bettered by the Sovs. The Sovs wanted to get the US missiles out of Turkey from all this. What did they get? US missiles out of Turkey. JFK gave in. Period. Another couple of weeks of the embargo and he would have won an unmitigated victory. Much like in the Bay of Pigs fiasco, JFK was a staunch cold-warrior...until it was time to ante up and act like a man. The guy had no follow-through and the devious, wimpy advice of his slippery brother / Attorney General (Holy Neoptism, Batman!) is at least partially to blame.",4.0,Anonymous,History
Thirteen Days: 147 minutes of a gruesome Kevin Costner accent,"The movie Thirteen Days gives an excellent historical portrayal of the fear and horror of a nuclear war experienced by the United States and the world in the Cuban Missile Crisis. The movie's historical facts are close to accurate, following even small details concerning President Kennedy and his relationships with his administrators. Naturally, some of the flourishes and embellishments of the movie were used to create more ""Hollywood"" extravagance and add excitement. Also, the character Kenny O'Donnell is fictional, yet seemed essential to the plot of the movie as a character that tied many pieces simultaneously. The movie pastes together the meanings of the decisions and actions that took place during the tense 13 days. It thoroughly demonstrates step by step the thought process and crucial decision-makings that decided the fate of our country. Thirteen Days truly depicts the real national fear installed by the Crisis, and how close our country came to nuclear war and losing millions of lives. In order for a historical drama to be successful, actors must be able to not only resemble the well known characters they play, but they must have the ability to capture the ""natural"" character of these people and prove it to the audience. The movie did an excellent job in portraying the strong character of JFK, and his resilience to do what he believed was right. Greenwood plays the young Kennedy as an unsure, worried president in the beginning that later blossoms into a confident leader. The movie depicted the tension between Kennedy and several of his advisers with brutal honesty, and showed that Kennedy was not always popular with the political and military leaders of that time. He had to fight the Russians and some of his own staff as well! However, the movie showed the bravery of his cabinet, and our leaders' ability to guide our country through a time of peril. Although the movie had many excellent historical performances, there were several weak spots. I'm normally a Kevin Costner fan, but I was appalled by his atrocious accent. Also, what was the point of the certain scenes filmed in black and white? To stress importance, or was it solely for tasteless aesthetic values? Another improvement could be seen in the bias of the movie. The movie gave an excellent portrayal of the Cuban Missile Crisis from an American's point of view, yet, as an American, I would love to see the vantage point from the Cuban and Soviet side. However, aside from these few not so significant setbacks, I would recommend this movie for any history buff or die-hard patriot, or simply anyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis. Yet Kevin Costner fans beware: this performance rivals his in Water world.",,Anonymous,History

It was not so easy to understand that my mother and father loved this nation and its president and we as a people were made very much aware of the impending crisis that that attempt caused to occur.It also prompted me to tell this women I also remembered the assassination because then too a dramatic event had occurred that caused all to take notice and to pause as we were to lose a president.I was a young boy at the time and both events provided for an indelible impression.As to this very capable movie,it provides a very real appearance of we are there.I believe it is a worthy movie going experience and I recommend it.It is a very well done film,gripping tension,ever ending, unfolding drama.It was a moral buoy to hear the voice of John F.

Little did I know as a youngster how close we came to the brink of nuclear oblivion.  I thought the storytellers did an excellent job of recreating these events and keeping the viewers interest.  However, as a frequent movie goer not used to such things, it was unsettling to see such a professional group of movie makers allow the audience to glimpse the sound mike in not one but two separate scenes!

USSR - 300 of nuclear warheads.As you can see USSR had just 5% of American nuclear arsenal.In 1960 USA placed American middle range nuclear missiles in Turkey. To answer this, USSR was forced to send missiles to CUBA. After Cuban crisis, American missiles from Turkey and soviet missiles from Cuba were withdrawn.There is only one explanation for Cuban Missile Crisis - do not do any harm for anyone and you will not get harm in exchange.American propaganda machine is alive and functioning. 300 billion of American citizens in USA have no idea about real events. Everybody just believe that that damn Russians had put missiles to Cuba just to destroy America. Bloodthirsty Russians just wanted to destroy America. Just wanted KILL THE FREEDOM.

A fabulous film. Just fabulous.,"I know exactly where I was in October of 1962. I was a senior at a small high school in Louisiana and we were more worried about our thus-far undefeated football season than we were about the cold war. In fact, I only vaguely remember the ""Cuban Missle Crisis.""  The year before, our team had won state championship for our small school division, and in 1962 we were ranked first in state, until South Cameron beat us, just barely, in our last game.  Since WW III didn't actually occur that fateful month of 1962, we can still have fond memories of that football season that almost was fabulous.As we now look back, the outcome of the Cuban Missle Crisis may have been the most significant event of the second half of the 20th century, and ultimately the beginnings of the end of the cold war. In ""Thirteen Days"" we see the still young, first-term president Jack Kennedy, with help from his brother Bobby and his close advisor Kenny O'Donnell, attempt to strike a balance between the military leaders who only need a little incentive to invade Cuba, and his own morals which believes there is a diplomatic solution. The fact that they pulled it off, and got the Soviets to back down, is perhaps the reason we are all here.This film does a great job of re-creating those 13 days, and the stress everyone involved was under. The DVD is fine if unremarkable, except it has a very nice set of extras, including historical timelines of the missle crisis, and profiles of the actual players in the 1962 war dance.  Because of the significance of the story, and how well made this film is, it is one of the few I rate 10/10.",,Anonymous,History

Entertaining and instructive,"This  is  an engrossing, thrilling  movie, that sucks you in from the start. It is clearly of great interest to those of us old enough to remember  the Cuban Missile Crisis, the fear while it lasted, the relief when it was over. But the recent spat between the US and China over the spy plane gives the film added relevance for the younger audience; we can be sure that there are much the same arguments between Hawks and Doves in the White House and Pentagon today as in  1962.The film rings most true in showing how few certainties there are when it comes to engaging in or avoiding conflict. Peace prevails eventually, but as much by luck as by judgment; some of President Kennedy's wisest decisions are when he acts indecisively.  Bruce Greenwood graphically portrays the President's confusion and exasperation when faced with conflicting advice, and his mental torment as he contemplates starting a war that would kill millions, while trying not to appear weak. Some find the movie over-reverential to the Kennedies; but this may be because its makers realise more than most the debt owed to the President, his brother and others in ""Camelot"" for striving to avoid war during this crisis.At the same time, whether accidentally or intentionally, the film also demonstrates the difficulty the  US often has in seeing itself as others see it, an attitude which the rest of the world finds amusing at best, and scary at worst. How could the American Government not have realised all along that its missiles based in Turkey would be as much of an affront to the USSR, as the potential Cuban missiles were an affront to the USA? In the discussion of  a possible pre-emptive strike on Cuba, there is a glaring absence of any reference to the Cuban civilian casualties that would ensue, or to the negative impact on America's reputation abroad.On the acting and technical sides the movie is excellent, with great performances by the whole ensemble (but especially Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy); and with exciting air and sea action sequences interspersing the inevitable long stretches of talk. Often criticised Kevin Costner  is more than effective as Presidential Aide, Kenny O'Donnell,  particularly in the domestic scenes with his family.However, the need to keep Costner at the centre of the movie perhaps led to a couple of flaws. Close as O'Donnell might have been to John Kennedy in younger days, would he really have had such free and easy access to the President, and such a casual relationship with him?  Even harder to accept is the role the film gives O'Donnell in persuading airforce pilots to play down any encounters they had with Cuban anti-aircraft fire. Would highly trained and disciplined servicemen have taken much notice of an unknown voice on the 'phone, claiming to be a White House official?Such niggles aside, this is a great movie, containing important lessons, and is a credit to Hollyood. Now, how about a Russian movie, telling the story as seen from Moscow?",8.0,Anonymous,History

History Rewritten,"Kenneth O'Donnell - played by Keven Costner - was appointments secretary to JFK - a very minor functionary who was occasionally seen at White House press conferences. How someone tied him in with the Cuban Missile Crisis is beyond imagination.

For instance, no mention is made of the trade-off in the real story. I.e., JFK's withdrawal of Jupiter missiles already stationed in Turkey in exchange for Krushchev's withdrawal of missiles in Cuba. Also, there was some very interesting brinkmanship in which Robert Kennedy conveyed to the Russians that JFK was losing control of the military and that they might strike out on their own - something the Russians would have been eager to believe since it would have been so much like their their own government/military.As for O'Donnell, he was a hanger-on around the White House who, I assumed, got the job as a family friend or Irish relative or some such.

Why you should see this film.,"`Thirteen Days' is a fine film.Whew!   It's not often I can write that about a film starring Kevin Costner, especially the past several years.     And that's because, despite his character's prominent movie role (larger than the historical facts dictate, but that's something that typically only bothers history buffs), his work is overshadowed by a group of actors who give absolutely wonderful performances.Other reader comments dwell on the facts surrounding the crisis, so I won't go there.  I'll simply highlight why you should see this movie.First, the acting.    Bruce Greenwood's JFK was just plain remarkable.   His accent was perfect  natural, present, yet not distracting nor over-the-top (like Costner's).    His mannerisms, expressions, and gestures truly captured the President's.    In fact, the entire cabinet gave one of the best ensemble acting performances I've ever seen.   Just splendid! Costner, while adequate, was completely overshadowed by his cast-mates.   So don't go to see him - go to see everyone else.Second, the story.    This movie does a great job of showing just how intricate and complicated the situation was, and how frequently it changed.   Each individual event that made up the missile crisis created new options, new scenarios, and new decisions for the President.    The tension that results is wonderful.  As opposed to so many films that require explosions, gunfire, car chases, and sex to create drama, this one uses true human drama  and does it quite well.What about the film didn't I like?    Well, Kenny O'Donnell's role in the crisis was certainly inflated, and he spoke to the Kennedys as if he was lecturing them instead of giving an opinion.   While inflated roles aren't new to Hollywood depictions of historical events, it wasn't necessary in this film.   I'm impressed that Costner took a back-seat role (vs. taking on JFK).    It would have been even more impressive had his character been perhaps a bit less the `hero behind the scenes'.   A tone-down job would have helped a great deal...though not a big deal considering the entire film's excellence.      Also, the JFK role was written in a way that was a bit overly sympathetic, but that's also a relatively minor quabble.Considering how often Hollywood incorporates formula into it's historical movies (such as the fictional love stories in `Titanic' and `Pearl Harbor'), it's refreshing to see a film like `Thirteen Days'.    It's an excellent film overall, worth seeing just to witness the performances of ensemble. Just shows us that sometimes there's a big difference between `fine actor' and `movie star'.",8.0,Anonymous,History

One great scene from the movie was when that guy showed up to his sons football game and seeing how excited he was that is dad was there. The filmmaker is telling the us about war. He is also telling us how crazy things got in the office. I knew that there was a war going on in this time of history. This part of history is not something that excites me. I have not seen any other movies in this time period. There was nothing in this movie that made me question historical accuracy. I have not seen other movies by this director. I have not seen any of these actors in other movies either. I liked how they all came together and played a part.This is not a movie I would have watched outside of school. If I were to recommend this movie to someone I would recommend this movie to my grandpa because he was into this type of stuff.,4.0,Anonymous,History
meh,"Thirteen days is about the Cuban Missile Crisis and how president Kennedy handled that situation. The story was hard to follow and the movie kept going back and forth between color and black-and-white. I started to get really irritated by the fact that it kept going back and forth. This movie had close to no entertainment value. I don't know enough about the crisis to know if the movie was historically accurate or not, but I didn't really care because I was asleep. I couldn't stay awake because the movie dragged. The only movie that surpases this one in dullness is The New World. Not a movie I'd watch again by choice.",,Anonymous,History
8 on a scale of 10,"I would like to give this movie a 9, but I just can't quite pull the trigger. I liked it a lot. It had the advantage of being the type of movie (political thriller) that I prefer. I can also say that there was never a single moment that I thought about how long it was or what time it was or if it was almost over.However, I admit that I was close. I feel that they could easily have cut out 20 minutes and it would have been a better, tighter, more intense thriller. Also, I was turned off by Costner's poor attempt at a New England accent. Interestingly, it was much less obvious by the end of the film.But, it has one big advantage - the fact that it tells a true story. It is truly amazing how close we came. The fact that we can watch the story 40 years later with no fear of realizing the ramifications adds a unique level of interest and suspense. Overall, it was well worth the time.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Thirteen Days was a fine dramatization of the Cuban Missile Crisis,"Earlier this month I visited my sister in Maryland, to see her first-born child, a boy, get baptized. While there, her husband showed this historical drama to me, my mother, and my other brother-in-law. We were all enthralled at the drama of what happened over 40 years ago being played on the just-unwrapped DVD. Seeing Keven Costner, as White House consultant Kenny O'Donnell, speaking in the same accent and mannerisms of the Kennedy brothers Jack (Bruce Greenwood) and Bobby (Steven Culp who I didn't recognize as the same actor that played Rex on ""Desparate Housewives"") made me almost forget his movie star magnetism. Also fine in their real-life roles were Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara and Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Director Roger Donaldson takes his time in depicting the title's events that, no matter what one knows of the outcome, still provides some suspenseful turns as well as also explaining how and why certain results became. I was especially impressed at how Culp as Bobby was seeming so impatient with the way Stevenson as a UN ambassador was slowly taking his time with the Soviet premier. Maybe Donaldson was a bit much with a couple of shots of the nuclear film footage inserted but overall, I'd say Thirteen Days was an excellent depiction of how close to World War III our country was during what must have been very tense days of October 1962.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Was I the only one moved to tears by Thirteen Days?,"I'll agree with the other comments about bad accents, great Bobby and John acting, perfect characterization of others (subtitles were unnecessary for me), slightly too long, etc. It's a very good movie and you should see it if you know about history and you _definitely_ should see it if you don't know about history.The thing that surprised me about the movie was that I broke into tears. Despite a personal reputation as a cold cynic, I do get moved by war drama -- the Midway torpedo bomber scene, the Gettysburg climax of Pickett's Charge -- but this was a nearly bloodless movie.I think it was a reminder (or first expression) of the horrible fear and paralyzing helplessness I felt as a 12 year old. I still remember the tone of voice of the teacher who told us to be sure to watch the President on TV that night. I think that's the most fear I had ever heard in an adult's voice. (She didn't know _what_ was wrong, but she sure knew _something_ was seriously wrong.)I would have expected more comments from people roughly the same age about their feelings at the time and how the movie renews those feelings. (I didn't get the same reaction from the excellent Guns of October with William Devane's tremendous John Kennedy with a dead-on accent.) Maybe I didn't cry at the time, but I was very afraid. It was good to release those 39 year old tears.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp have turned in a couple of the best male performances of the year 2000 as President John Kennedy and Attorney General Robert Kennedy.  These fine actors successfully have recreated one of the scariest moments of the twentieth century, the Cuban Missile Crisis.

Terrific! Powerful! Thought provoking!,"This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. If you are looking for an action flick, forget it. This is a well written, witty drama about an historic two weeks in October 1962. The cold war couldn't get any colder. Too be exact, cold enough to be hot! President Kennedy(Bruce Greenwood), the President's advisor Kenny O'Donnell(Kevin Costner)and Attorney General Robert Kennedy(Steven Culp)deal with the placement of Russian missiles in Cuba.Culp may have played his part better than Greenwood. Both were fantastic in what I guess is billed as a 'Kevin Costner movie'. Costner's accent kept changing, but this did not really take away from the movie's impact.The cast is filled with very good character actors featuring Dylan Baker as Bob McNamara and Henry Strozier as Dean Rusk. Almost comical was Walter Adrian's portrayal of Lyndon Johnson. There is enough emotion, stress and tension to go around. If you like historic dramas, this is a don't miss.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Thirteen Days, an enticing look into our most volatile times...","Thirteen Days, presented historically dense as well as tense situations in my Modern War Class in a manner which kept you centered into each frame change, on the edge of your plastic chair, desperately attempting to make an assumption of what will happen next in order to avoid further anxiety. I would never have thought I would be presented such a roller coaster ride in an optional/elective course, this roller-coaster ride is a rather intricate one giving you a close look, despite Hollywood theatrical elements, into just how close Uncle Sam's jittery hand came to pressing the button. We are presented two conflicting sides in this movie, the military generals representing the ""Hawks"" and the Kennedy's representing the ""Doves"". The enticement factor and anxiety brought on by this movie are solely based on these opposing symbols. The hawks, greatly willing to respond through the ""rules of engagement"" and shaft the ""Red Dog's"" who have been digging and instigating at them, and the Doves, trying to ""cage"" these hawks and prevent them from creating a potentially disastrous hardball approach. We are, in this Movie, more connected with the Doves, not simply because we all want peace to prevail, but because the way the film portrays a menace out of the military generals, and depicts them as officials with a never-quenching thirst for military aggression and war medallions.Though this movie obviously takes a side, it is a bias that is completely understood and acceptable, as the point addressed is a necessary one which, even today, may need to be reintroduced a second time as these events are history which need not repeating.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Two weeks in time worth reenacting, but film isn't very emotional or expressive...","The Russian-Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 as seen through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), political adviser to President John F.

Tense chapter in world history ladled with testosterone-driven speeches and air-raids (courtesy director Roger Donaldson, who clearly sees this as man's business; he doesn't seem to want to know Jacqueline Kennedy or her reaction to the drama--instead she plans a party). However, the technical aspects of the production are first-rate and the acting is uniformly commendable.

After the discovery of Soviet weapons in Cuba, events and tension escalate between two military superpowers and within the White House. President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp) and Special Assistant to the President Kenneth P. O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) are in the hot seat as they struggle to prevent nuclear war,"" according to the DVD sleeve's synopsis.This is an excellent dramatization of the ""Cuban Missile Crisis""; probably, it is a more accurate, more detailed explanation of events than was given to the American public at the time. Interestingly, it focuses on adviser Kenny O'Donnell; as portrayed by Mr. Costner, he is almost as important a player as the Kennedy brothers. Writer David Self and director Roger Donaldson stick with what actually happened, or what conceivably happened; unlike Oliver Stone's 1991 ""JFK"", which also starred Costner.Too few organizations recognized ""Thirteen Days"" during awards season. It did best at the ""Satellite Awards"", with wins for Conrad Buff IV's excellent editing and Mr. Greenwood's fine portrayal of JFK (""Best Supporting Actor""), along with a nomination for Mr. Self's script. The art/set direction, Mr. Donaldson, and ensemble cast are also award worthy. Mr. Culp's arms-folded portrayal of Bobby Kennedy at his most serious is uncanny.

Thirteen Days,"Whilst there is some conjecture about the level of involvement that Kenny O'Donnell (the character played by Kevin Costner) played during the Cuban Missile Crisis (Soviets putting medium-range ballistic missiles capable of targeting US cities into Cuba), what isn't up for conjecture is how good this Roger Donaldson film is. I wasn't alive in 1962 and had no real idea of how close the world came to nuclear catastrophe...until I watched Thirteen Days for my modern history class. Despite knowing how things shook out, the tension and drama that permeates this film right up to the final desperate resolution is impressive. Costner is great as O'Donnell, but it's Bruce Greenwood as JFK and RFK, who uncannily look and sound like the men they are portraying. A very interesting and worthwhile film.",8.0,Anonymous,History
A smart games-theory thriller,"There's not a lot wrong with this film, and what IS wrong is, so to speak, quarantined - it's all somehow connected to Kevin Costner.  It's Costner whose tin ear prevents him from adopting a convincing Boston accent.  (I didn't know it was meant to be a Boston accent - I had to ask an American - and I still don't have a clear idea of what a Boston accent is meant to sound like, but I know phoney when I hear it.)  It's Costner whose greeting-card musings about sunsets jar with the intelligence elsewhere. It's Costner whose family we're forced to watch.  The actors who play his wife and children faced a thankless task - they must have known that they were only accessories, to be paraded in front of the camera for no better reason than to let us know that Costner's character HAD a family ... what kind, who constituted it, what they felt about him and what he felt about them didn't matter; all that mattered was that the family be there, so we'd know that Costner wasn't one of those shifty single types.  I don't know what prompted the director to show us the family itself rather than a photograph of it.  An indefinable sense of duty, perhaps.The story of the Cuban missile crisis is as tense as almost any other, and, Costner-related lapses aside, the film sticks to the story and understands what it is that makes it tense and exciting.  (We even get a clear idea of the pressures that Kruschev would have felt, even though the action never leaves the Americas.)  So absorbing is ""Thirteen Days"" that, although I saw it within 48 hours of the attacks on the Pentagon and the World Trade Towers (the shock waves were of course felt over here, too), I didn't think of current events once.  If I had I would have been struck by the differences. The Russians placing missiles in Cuba was, of itself, harmless: the danger lay in what the action MEANT.  The terrorist attack was of itself horrific, but it meaningless, which mean's there's no real story to tell (except perhaps the subsequent one of a president so dazzled by the idea of revenge that he was willing to turn an extradition dispute - an extradition dispute! - into a war).  Watching ""Thirteen Days"" it seems as though the story was just THERE, waiting to be told ... that the people making the film might have ruined it if they'd been stupid enough but didn't have to do very much in order to tell it successfully.  This is probably false.  But the fact that we get this impression shows how successful the film is.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Gripping Story Of A World On The Brink Of War,"I'm not sure exactly why, but I tuned into this movie almost wanting not to like it. But there's very little to criticize in this extremely exciting story of the Kennedy Administration's response to the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.The movie revolves around the relationship between Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special assistant to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and the President himself. Also central to the story is Robert Kennedy (played by Steven Culp.) We get the impression that here are three men who may have dreamed of governing America, but who never expected to be in the middle of decisions as momentous as these. O'Donnell largely watches as Kennedy locks horns with a military that is willing to risk nuclear war by bombing the Cuban missile sites but also realizes that he has to develop a response that doesn't appear weak. There's an impression here of a military out of control, doing things without seeking the President's permission, not listening (or at least not responding) to the President's wishes. Finally, as a consensus develops around establishing a ""quarantine"" of Cuba, we face the suspense of Soviet ships looming on the horizon, and - even though history tells us how this turned out - there is real suspense.There's not much wrong with this. Perhaps one could criticize the accents used by Costner and Greenwood. Costner's fake New England accent was distracting to me and Greenwood just didn't sound like President Kennedy (in fact - I'll need to watch this again to confirm it - but at one point in the movie I thought President Kennedy spoke a few lines with a distinct Southern accent!) But that's really nitpicking. The end I thought was a bit anti-climatic, but aside from those minor points, this was a great movie, and everyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis or the Cold War in general must watch it.9/10.",9.0,Anonymous,History

The guys they chose for these roles looked eerily like the real thing! I was a little fuzzy on some of the others, as I was only 7 when these events actually happened.2) REALISM: The movie didn't try to turn JFK and his team into demi-gods who single handedly stopped the Soviets, nor did they make Khruschev and the Politburo into some Empire-like meanies.Problem:ACCENTS: People have criticized Kevin Costner for his alleged Boston accent (admittedly fair to poor), but I had a lot more problem with Greenwood as JFK.

Outstanding thriller. Plenty authentic,"Not looking at this as history but as a film, I find it an outstanding production. Even though it was obviously meant as a Kevin Costner vehicle, I found the performances of Bruce Greenwood (John Kennedy) and Steven Culp (Robert Kennedy) to be magnificent and perhaps the best renditions of these two people in any film. The resemblances were uncanny and they allowed the humanness of these two men come through. This made this film for me, as much as anything. The other performances were also well done. I have read some negative critiques of the actors by some people and they seem to forget that the people shown here were involved in a terribly tense and trying situation.I remember these days well, because I was in Berlin at the time when the wall went up and was with my father, a soldier, when all of these events were happening.

"Excellent, historically accurate film about Cuban Missle Crisis",I really enjoyed this portrayal of the inner-workings of the Kennedy White House during this pivotal time in American History. Costner's chowda accent is a bit over-the-top and tough to get used to during the first few minutes of the film but that's the only critique I really have of this fine film. Costner's portrayal of Kenny O'Donnell as the President's bulldog as Appointments Secretary is right on and the other actors portraying the members of the Ex Comm during the crisis are quite believable and effective in portraying the hawkish preferences of many of the members of the government's brain trust as the crisis unfolded.

"A gripping, intense, thoroughly fascinating movie.","One of the best movies of the last few months, it's a fascinating view at the Cuban missile crisis. The performances are solid all around, with special mention to Bruce Greenwood for a perfect JFK. The content is also very interesting, and the great thing is that even though you know the final ending of the crisis, most of us probably don't know all the twists, turns and details, and this makes this movie even more interesting. Also, there are some sequences that are very intense and gripping, even more so that in many fictional thrillers or action movies, and some great air and naval military sequences (my favorite is the low-altitude run by the two Thunderchiefs - breathtaking...). Also, a great thing about this movie is that it actually involves you in the story and makes you become interested about the characters and the story, and that's pretty rare for a movie.A word of advice though: this is NOT an action movie. It's long, it's mature and it's mostly talk, so younger children will not be interested. But the dialogue is fascinating, the direction is brilliant, and the story is real (after seeing the movie, I find this very unsettling), so if you're in the least interested to see a good movie, and have alreay seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, see this movie.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Brilliantly done cold war drama,"""Thirteen Days"" is certainly the best film that I have seen in the last 5 years and one of the best ever. Script, direction, acting, photography and sound are all top notch. Steven Culp is absolutely outstanding as Bobby Kennedy and surely deserved an Oscar. Bruce Greenwood as JFK is not far behind and almost all the smaller roles are played to perfection. Strangely, the only mediocre performance comes from Kevin Costner, who looks rather wooden most of the time. But the movie is a triumph of what I call ""straightforward storytelling"" which seems to be sadly lacking in these days of Tarantinos and Soderberghs. For me, the crux of the whole situation was the sequence where the President asks the destroyer commander, ""Captain, can you force that Russian sub to the surface without damaging it and without damage to yourself?"" In retrospect, it is a wonder that the world came through this unscathed.",10.0,Anonymous,History

Gripping political drama,If kevin Costner has any sense he should stick to films such as this and JFK because it seems to be where he has found a happy medium.

I must admit i knew very little about the cuban missile crisis before seeing this film and i never realised how close we really came to war with the Russians. The way the film builds up the tension of the American political system and how they try to plan every eventuality in the conflict is superb and makes two and a half hours fly by which is always a sign of a good film for me.

Missiles Of October was better,Not as good as the tv mini-series MISSILES OF OCTOBER.Not as accurate or as well acted.The only thing better with 13 DAYS in comparison are those great modern special effects featured for the action battle/recon sequences.Watch 13 DAYS for those cool sequences.It would be nice to just insert those sequences into MISSILES OF OCTOBER.Even as a condensed version of MISSILES OF OCTOBER it does not stand up due to the overblown role of Costner's character.It would have been better if the JFK actor/character in 13 DAYS was written in to be truly the lead of the movie.But it was a missfire when the producers decided to make Costner's character the lead and underplay the great JFK.You cannot tone down or underplay JFK without loosing points in any movie featuring a story revolving around him.He was too big of a personality.It was a bad Holywood compromise for Costner's name.It robbed the movie of it's chance to be a classic.Try to catch MISSILES OF OCTOBER first before seeing this one (only for said action sequences).Still worth a look as a backup to said tv movie(which is one of the best TV movies of all time).Costner fans will love 13 DAYS for sure.......,10.0,Anonymous,History
Brave beautiful film,"One of the user wanders how much more interesting this film would have been had it showed the motivations of the Soviets for placing nuclear war heads in Cuba. I believe that, on the contrary, one of the greatest merits of this film resides in not doing so. This way Thirteen Days places the viewer in the same position of the protagonists of the missile crisis thus creating a wonderful deal of suspense and avoiding the temptation of making a political manifesto, this for pure cinematographical value. From the historical point of view Thirteen Days teaches the new generations, and reminds the old ones, how brave, valiant and invaluable for the survival of the civilization itself JFK's behavior was, for which the entire world (including Russians and Cubans) should and will ever be grateful. This is a legacy worth preserving. After so many years, who cares about the bad guys anyway?Living in a country that is currently under the threat of communism and under great influence of Castro's regime, I would certainly had loved to see Castro trashed in a Hollywood production, but this would have been a too easy way out for the scriptwriter and certainly would not had made a better movie.I give Thirteen Days 9 stars.

Disappointing,"While the Cuban Missile Crisis in American history was extremely important and interesting, this movie does not do justice to it. The acting in the movie was subpar and made it a struggle to understand the characters and their importance to the event.

I do like the switch between black and white and color, not because I think it bears any importance, but it was an interesting artistic choice. The cinematography was decent, but nothing extraordinary that stood out to me.Overall, I am disappointed by this movie.

Best film in years!,"Now that was a movie. I call it terrific, fantastic. Bruce Greenwood deserves to be considered by the academy. He overpowered Costner, who was better than expected. It's the Cuba Crisis. Two weeks of tension. Emotion, anger, fear, power, responsibility hence, politics. The setting: the White House. The protagonists: the Kennedy Brothers, O'Donnell, McNamara. A tribute to JFK. The American perspective. Proud. But not exaggerated, not overdone. Wise. Which is important for me because of my European perspective. Not always dominating political power. Not always confident, noisy; but weak moments, doubts, sincerity. Think of it that way: they tell you a story you already know. You heard and learned about it in school, history classes, even my father told me about it. How scared he was. So you know the story, you know about the happy end. But still, you are tensed throughout the entire movie. No fancy special effects just pure acting. Beautiful. Now, which movie has achieved that in recent years. Most of them don't get your attention with stories you don't know. ""Thirteen Days"" tells you a story you already know and manages to incorporate you, forces you to partake.

Takes You To the Brink,"Throughout the Twentieth Century, misjudgment-- the failure of one side to extrapolate the position of the other side-- has resulted in every major war from WWI to the Korean conflict.  And no one was more aware of this than President John F. Kennedy, when in October of 1962, photographs taken by an American U-2 spy plane uncovered the existence of Russian surface-to-surface missiles being deployed in Cuba; missiles with a range that encompassed every major city in the U.S., with the exception of Seattle.  `Thirteen Days,' directed by Roger Donaldson, is a chronicle of two of the most intense, significant weeks in the history of America, as well as U.S./Soviet relations.  Thirteen days that came down to a twelve to twenty-four hour period that could have changed the world as we know it today.Working from an intelligent, well-researched and accurate screenplay by David Self, Donaldson takes you behind the closed doors of the White House and conference rooms in which the fate of the nation was ultimately decided. The outcome is, of course, a matter of history, but the process which led to the final conclusion is intense, riveting drama that in the end illuminates just how close the world was brought to the brink of nuclear war by the Cuban Missile Crisis.Much of the tension in the film is derived and enhanced by the fact that it only gives the perspective of the Americans; but rather than making it a stilted, biased account, however, it becomes an objective, thoroughly engrossing presentation, and the fact that the viewer knows only what Kennedy knew puts you in the room with him, so to speak, and allows you to experience the process of assimilating the information, of extrapolating with Kennedy and ultimately making one of the most monumental decisions in history.The story unfolds through the eyes of Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), special advisor to the President, long time friend of the family and a trusted member of the Kennedy inner-circle.  The film accurately establishes O'Donnell's position without embellishing his role simply for dramatic effect; he serves as something of a `tour guide,' through whom you gain access to the drama playing out behind the curtain.  That he is a close friend of the Kennedys is reflected in many scenes in which O'Donnell, Jack and Bobby are alone together.  And since the story is told from O'Donnell's point-of-view, naturally his is a significant role; the film very subtly goes to great lengths, however, to establish the fact that within the conference rooms or during the meetings in the Oval Office, O'Donnell is kept at arm's length and, though present, is not a direct participant.Costner gives what is arguably one of the best performances of his career in this film, successfully capturing the essence of O'Donnell in an understated, subtle way that works extremely well and serves the story effectively.  He's clearly the star of the picture, though much of what he does is on the sidelines, which keeps the focus on Kennedy and the magnitude of the situation at hand.  Costner has drawn criticism in some quarters with regards to the distinctive New England accent he affects in the film, but the criticism is unwarranted; you have only to hear a tape of the real O'Donnell to realize how accurate Costner's portrayal is, up to and including the accent.Donaldson and the producers of this film realized that for it to really have an impact, the roles of JFK and RFK, especially, had to be cast with great care; for the film to be believable and to maintain that focus on the story, the Kennedys had to be believable, otherwise the effect would be significant to the point of distraction.  And their meticulous efforts and hard work paid off.  Bruce Greenwood gives an excellent performance as John Kennedy, from the accent to the body language and mannerisms he affects that so defined him.  And Steven Culp is perfect as Bobby, imbuing his performance with nuance and an eye for detail that convincingly brings him to life.The outstanding supporting cast includes Dylan Baker (McNamara), Henry Strozier (Rusk), Frank Wood (Bundy), Len Cariou (Acheson), Bill Smitrovich (General Taylor), Kevin Conway (General LeMay) and Kelly Connell (Salinger). During the strife of the Civil War, the nation was preserved because the right man, Abraham Lincoln, was in the right place at the right time; and in retrospect, the same can be said of John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  As Kennedy said, if we fail to comprehend the Soviets, and they don't understand us, the result will be tragic; and though the controversy of politics is inescapable, and there will always be two sides with opposing views, this film succinctly demonstrates that in this instance, it all came down to the decision of one man who proved he had the vision and the determination to do the right thing.  And anyone who disputes it need only be reminded that, in fact, that is the Sun you see shining through your own window every morning.  I rate this one 10/10.",10.0,Anonymous,History
This movie felt like it was 13 days long...,"Thirteen Days was not a bad movie but not a good movie. Kevin Costner is a great actor but I wouldn't say that this was one of his best performances. The people who played the Kennedys looked a lot like the Kennedys so that was a plus. The Jersey accents really threw me off. They didn't have good accents at all. It didn't have the cinematic experience as other historical drama movies. It really only told a story of what happened. The Cuban missile crisis was a very tense topic and I do feel like this movie showed it. I just felt like something was missing.

Furthermore, these are the two most credible Kennedy brothers I have yet seen, and I wish the focus had been more on them.For what it's worth, I remember the time and I never for a moment thought that we were close to war, because the Soviets were too far out on the limb.

Simply brilliant,"Anybody who says facts are boring has never seen ""Thirteen Days.""""Thirteen Days"" portrays the factual story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962, mostly through the eyes of Presidential Special Advisor Kenny O'Donnell. (It has been dramatized at some points, obviously.)There are many good things about this film. First, it has a fine cast and excellent performances. Anybody watching can figure out who is Kennedy and who is MacNamara and who is LeMay.Furthermore, unlike most movies, ""Thirteen Days"" does not spend the first half-hour setting up or creating a background. It just jumps right into the story. Kenny O'Donnell wakes up, eats breakfast, kisses his wife goodbye, goes to work, and BOOM! learns that there are Soviet missiles in Cuba.Third, once the 143-minute-film grabs you five minutes in, it does not let go until the very very end. It isn't edutainment. It is a high-stakes thriller that happens to be a true story.""Thirteen Days"" ought to be used to teach the Cuban Missile Crisis to students.The tagline for ""Thirteen Days"" is completely true. The truth is, ""you'll never believe how close we came"" to killing each other.A must-see for all.10/10",9.0,Anonymous,History
"A ""Must See"" Film","Thirteen Days is a ""Must See"" film for anyone, especially the younger viewers who not around during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Not only is it an excellent depiction of the historical event that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war, it is an excellent movie as well.From what I have read, the script follows now-declassified tape recordings of the actual meetings in the White House.   It captures the actual drama that President Kennedy, his cabinet members, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff created in their arguments.In October, 1962, the United States discovered from reconnasince photos that the Soviet Union had deployed nuclear bombers and missiles in Cuba.  From this launching pad, the Soviets could hit almost any city in the U.S. within five minutes.  President Kennedy was at the vortex of the decision of whether or not to go to attack Cuba, which could have lead to World War III, which would have annihilated most of the population of the Earth.The Administration had to act within a matter of days before the missiles were ready for launch.  They also had to control breaking the news to the general public in order to prevent widespread panic.  Most of the principals, led by the military leaders, advocated a pre-emptive strike on Cuba, bombing all missile sites, followed by ground invasion to remove Castro.  This sentiment was widely held at the time, as we were in the height of the Cold War.  Both we and the Russians were ""testing"" very large nuclear weapons in an effort to scare the other side.  The tough speeches made by Premier Khrushchev made most of us think he really would attack us. In fairness, I'm sure the Soviet people really believed we would attack them.Although I was only 12, I remember the Cuban Missile Crisis vividly.  When I saw the President's speech on TV I thought we really would go to total nuclear war.  JFK wisely did not choose an immediate strike, and searched for options that would allow both sides to avoid war, and get the missiles out of Cuba.The film is told completely from the point of view of the U.S.  We have no insight about what is going on inside the Kremlin.  The Soviets were always ""inscrutable"" and in this case very frustrating as the few contacts we had seemed to be giving different messages, perhaps even ""red herrings"" to stall us until the missiles were ready.  Some of the cabinet even suspected that Khrushchev had been deposed in a coup.The director makes good use of special effects of U.S. planes on recon missions and our Navy ships stopping Russian freighters on the high seas. This not only breaks up the dialog, but shows that our Servicemen performed bravely in the face of a tough enemy.Overall this is an excellent film: historically accurate, suspenseful, brilliantly scripted with strong performances from the entire cast.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Almost Perfect!,"This was an excellent movie that realistically depicted the tensions in the United States in October 1962 during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Only one major flaw - Kevin Costner's accent.  It was a major distraction as I watched the film and this picture could have been much better without this accent.  There would've been nothing wrong with him using his natural voice.Steven Culp hits Bobby Kennedy dead-on in looks, mannerisms and accent throughout the picture.  He has already played RFK in another film and I think Steven should play him if a film is ever made of RFK's life story.Bruce Greenwood has the accent for JFK alright, but doesn't really resemble him.  But this wasn't a serious flaw.  Not as much as the fake Bostonian accent of Costner's.All in all, a 9.  It'll go on my video shelf later.",9.0,Anonymous,History
***1/2 and A Oscar Contender,"I just saw Thirteen Days at an advanced screening at CSU. This is a great movie that should be seen by everyone. It makes you appreciate being an American and more importantly a human being. It isn't the feel-good movie of the year, but instead a realistic look into one of the most darkest, most tense times in the history of the world.The key for this movie to be a successful one was to be realistic. It did not include any false events that would stray from what the Cuban missile crisis actually was. We all know how it ends, and I was hoping that Donaldson would not imagine a more intense ending and include that in his film. Though the ending of the crisis was far too close for comfort, Donaldson keeps it real, instead of more exciting. In most movies, the detonator is disarmed with a few seconds left on the clock. In the missile crisis it was a day or so until destruction, and that is still plenty of time to leave you shaking.The acting is great. Costner gives his best performance of the last 10 years ( I don't know if that is saying much) and JFK and ESPECIALLY RFK are portrayed wonderfully. This movie, through great acting and story-telling, paints a picture that serves as a great history lesson, as well as great entertainment.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Fascinating for anyone who finds the Cold War interesting,"For anyone who finds movies about the Cold War interesting, this movie is great for you. It manages to bring to life the 13 Days in 1962 when the Soviet Union and the U.S came very close to nuclear war. It does take certain liberties in telling the story, especially when it comes to U.S missiles in Turkey (I won't say how, but pay attention to Bobby Kennedy's meeting the Ambassador from the USSR near the end). Costner is great except for his unfortunate New England accent (didn't we learn anything from Robin hood: Prince of Thieves....). There is also several times when the film fades to black and white for no apparent reason. However, it is a good, interesting movie and to see it now that communism in Europe is dead reminds the newer generation just how close we came. rent it.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great movie, Costner a little dull","As a member of the University of Rochester's student body, I was graced with a preview screening of ""Thirteen Days,"" starring Kevin Costner in the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in October of 1962.  Aside from a few technical difficulties (since it is a preview screening, they receive the movie by satellite uplink--the weather tonight was horrible, so the sound and picture cut out in a few key scenes), I thought it was a very well-done and entertaining movie.  The majority of the movie concentrated on people's discussions and interactions during the ordeal, rather than the scenes of military mobilization. Some would probably complain that they had too many people sitting around in rooms talking and not enough scenes of engagement. However, it never got boring.  All the politics and back and forth deals, coupled with the occasional military encounter, provided for a very tense, edge-of-your seat movie.  The few military scenes that were in it were extremely well done, especially the views of the planes flying low over Cuba. I felt that the actor playing RFK did the best job of interpreting his character.  The actor playing JFK didn't look or sound enough like JFK for me, but RFK was right on the nose. Of course, I don't know the actual person that Kevin Costner was playing, but his Boston accent was slightly annoying, coming from him.  It would probably have been better if he were played instead by an unknown actor, to shift the focus somewhat off of his character.  He was probably the thing I disliked most about the movie--he just didn't fit. Since this was only a preview screening, there were some problems with the editing that I assume will be fixed in the final version.  In one scene, there was a barely visible boom mike on the side.  Plus, there was a short scene that made no sense and had no bearing on the movie that I assume will be cut from the final version (it was a 2-hour 20 minute movie).  That coupled with the fact that there were several technical difficulties and it was an excellent movie means that I will definitely be seeing it again when it comes out :). One thing I'm not certain on is the historical accuracy. Of course I've read textbooks that describe the events, but living through it would have been a different experience completely. I felt, while watching it, that not knowing exactly how the events turned out heightened the tension.  Since a lot of viewers have lived through it and watched each event play by play, it won't be as much of a thrill ride.  But by that same virtue, I don't know if everything in it was accurate.  From what I know of the actual historical events, which I must point out is relatively little, it was accurate.  The extent of my knowledge was that there were missiles in Cuba, and we almost got nuked over it :). Overall a great movie, exciting and thrilling but not relying on its action scenes for all the excitement.  Kevin Costner wasn't great, but he's been on the decline the last few years and this was better than some of his recent stuff, so I've got to give him props for that.  My rating is an 8 out of 10",8.0,Anonymous,History

When will they quit making these movies??,"Costner, as usual, is awful. Bruce Greenwood, as usual, is excellent. But this film is about the story, right?Portrayed as a thriller, political suspense, drama, etc., but it's a story of something that happened 38 years ago and everyone knows what happened.Okay, not everyone. Most of the college students I had the (dubious) honor of watching this film with didn't have a clue about the Cuban Missile Crisis. Most probably didn't know that Kennedy was president in 1962.

"Worth it just to remind us ""how close we came""","OK, Kevin Costner's Boston accent is terrible (and keeps changing during the film) and it's too long and there was too much bashing of the military. But the script was fairly accurate history as far as Hollywood plots go, and it makes ""Thirteen Days"" a valuable film if only to remind us all, particularly the two generations that have grown up since 1962 (many of whom now think the Cold War was no big deal) how just the tiniest misstep could have sparked a general nuclear war.  As I watched the movie, I couldn't help but speculate how more recent chief executives would have handled what JFK faced.Also, from the perspective of seeing the film in Uruguay, a country where many are sympathetic to Castro, ""Thirteen Days"" may provide people here with a better understanding of why many Northamericans have negative feelings about the man.  After all, he was apparently prepared to blow us all up.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Blinking in Private,"There's probably some irony in the quality of Canadian Bruce Greenwood's portrayal of Kennedy -- he's very, very good, and it's the little touches (like casually grabbing hold of passing objects to stay upright, a reference to the legacy of Kennedy's intensely painful wartime back injuries) that make you feel he's stepped into Kennedy's soul. Though it's no surprise he wasn't nominated, it was Oscar-caliber material. Even as he challenges the Kennedy myth by playing him as a man who can anger and entertain doubt in private, he burnishes it by letting his Kennedy submerge all doubt behind perfect resolve whenever it's demanded: the mythic Kennedy nerve.Overall, the film plays a little fast and loose with persons and actions (though history seems largely unscathed, by contrast with Stone's JFK), so it's best to see this as parable, and see Costner's character as a sort of greek chorus to Kennedy and his cabinet. It's a wonderfully made film, though -- what may become a classic study in how to craft a thriller without physical thrills. The few battle scenes are inconclusive (they conclude in situation and briefing rooms) or end in more or less ignominious American defeat, and as I write this it occurs to me that's critical in the film's success: We're given images and rhetoric of taking punishment as a form of _standing ground_, of _not blinking_.",8.0,Anonymous,History

Another reason why Kevin Costner is underrated.,"Kevin Costner as an actor is thought of far too negatively by the public. Movies like ""Thirteen Days"" and ""Open Range"" show that he hasn't lost his touch after disasters like ""Waterworld"". ""Thirteen Days"" tells the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962, with Costner as Kenny O'Donnell, an aide to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood, in an uncanny performance); O'Donnell was the old university roommate of Attorney General Robert Kennedy (Steven Culp, also fabulous). Costner's character has been beefed up, both to further the drama and to give Costner a bigger part, but it works well. O'Donnell functions as the normal man amongst extraordinary figures. JFK, RFK, and O'Donnell are the lead players on the American side, and come into conflict with the hawkish Joint Chiefs, led my General Taylor (Bill Smitrovich, who plays a lot of military roles). Another notable performance is that of Michael Fairman as Adlai Stevenson. Even though the conclusion is well known, the film manages to keep the audience guessing about what happens next. I give ""Thirteen Days"" a 10.",10.0,Anonymous,History

I liked to watch the personalities of the main players portrayed as expertly as they were, and we can all be happy there was John Kennedy in the White House at the time.

Thirteen Days is an excellent movie which has a lot of action on the psychological level and remains gripping although most of the action is set in conference rooms within the White House. The actors are not overly brilliant, but the script is. You have to credit the film also for its ideological neutrality.

The movie also gave me some insight into the communication processes of political leaders. I was surprised that some of the military leaders (males) were so aggressive and pro war.  Were they really that naive to believe that the rest of the world would not be adversely affected by an armed confrontation of such magnitude?

So, along comes the new movie Thirteen Days to show those young viewers just how perilously close their parents came to oblivion in October, 1962.Considering the Cuban Missile Crisis was undoubtedly the most tense and suspenseful episode of the Cold War, it's somewhat surprising that it's taken nearly four decades for Hollywood to turn in the movie rendition. Sure, it's been done as a TV mini-series. But not until now, have we gotten the definitive big screen version.But here it is, precisely restaged by director Roger Donaldson. He shows us the behind-the-scenes plotting and maneuvering, the ways in which a small handful of men, and a small handful of moments, guided the fate of the human race. We see how the Kennedys, Jack and Bobby, micromanaged the chess game with the Soviets. The movie postulates that were it not for their overreaching control of the smallest details, their subordinate war hungry generals would have plunged us all into nuclear holocaust.The movie's biggest fault, however, rests with Kevin Costner. Mind you, it's not Costner himself who's the problem -- his Boston accent is fine and so is his acting. Rather, it's with his character, presidential advisor Kenny O'Donnell. In real life, had O'Donnell done even half the things the script wants us to believe he did, then monuments should have and would have been built to the man. But Hollywood needs a hero, one character to embody both the sharp young minds who helped save the day and the average Americans who went to bed each night for two weeks, wondering if they'd live to see the sunrise.And so, the script turns O'Donnell into a Kevin Costner-type for us to empathize with. Still, this dramatic license aside, historians should have no major beef with the film.Besides, the real star of the movie is Bruce Greenwood, who brings John F. Kennedy to life more accurately than any actor who's gone before. Not only is his physical resemblance striking, but Greenwood masters the subtleties of the President's voice and speech patterns better than any of Hollywood's previous JFKs. He doesn't do the standard over-the-top Boston accent. That caricature doesn't capture how the real Kennedy talked. (To see what I mean, check out Robert Drew's 1963 fly-on-the-Oval-Office-wall documentary Crisis:Behind a Presidential Commitment, I'll wager a good sum of money that Greenwood did; he seems to base his performance on the Kennedy seen in that fine film.)Note: Sharp-eyed viewers will catch the real Kennedy on screen. JFK's nephew, Christopher Lawford, the spitting image of his father, actor Peter Lawford, has a small but pivotal role as a pilot sent on a mission to fly over Cuba.",9.0,Anonymous,History
A Study in Leadership,"I really enjoyed this movie from a leadership standpoint - the difficulty of leading. When I was young I assumed that position = power. It's not really so, and this movie demonstrates how arguably the most powerful person in the world, the President of the US, had to deal with his people and inevitable politics. He and his close advisers couldn't be 100% certain that everything would work as planned - many times they had to do as much research as possible, but it was finite and inconclusive, then make a decision/use their judgement. I think this movie does a good job of painting a realistic picture of how tough leadership is, and provides some insight into how some in public service really are there for the right reasons...",10.0,Anonymous,History
Made for TV,"This movie reeked of an amateurish quality that began with Costner's accent and was constantly reinforced by a heavy-handed soundtrack. Screenwriting 101 says show, don't tell the drama. ""Apollo 13"" did a good job of showing the drama even though we already knew the outcome. Regrettably, ""Thirteen Days"" kept telling us over and over, mostly with reaction shots of Mushmouth (Costner). The footage of him looking concerned, worried, etc. put this film so far beyond two hours, you'll wonder if Thirteen Days is how long it takes to see this film.",5.0,Anonymous,History

On The Brink Of Nuclear Armageddon,"Based on that period known as the Cuban Missile Crisis, THIRTEEN DAYS is a brilliantly crafted and well-acted political drama that reminds us of just how close we were in October 1962 to the brink of a nuclear Armageddon.When faced with incontrovertible photographic evidence that the Soviets have placed strategic nuclear missiles in Cuba and aimed them right at many East Coast cities, including Washington, President John F. Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) is faced with decisions and options of enormous and staggering proportions, all of which could determine the existence of the planet. He, his brother Bobby (Steven Culp) and trusted friend Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner), have to balance the possibility of losing politically if they cave in to the Soviets or setting off World War III if they act too aggressively.The result is one of the best historical and political dramas seen in some time; and the fact that it's based on actual events, albeit slightly fictionalized in the transfer to film, makes THIRTEEN DAYS all that much more powerful.Although the heavy Irish-Americans accents of the three leads may be a little distracting, Costner, Greenwood, and Culp do very fine jobs with their roles. The direction of Roger Donaldson (NO WAY OUT) and the screenplay by David Self (THE ROAD TO PERDITION) are both intelligent enough so that even those who don't remember the Cuban Missile Crisis too clearly or who were born too late to see it as only a footnote in history books will be both spellbound and want to read more about this unique and chilling period in the history of the world. Among the other great things about this film is Michael Fairman's great portrayal of UN ambassador (and former presidential candidate) Adlai Stevenson. His showdown with his Soviet counterpart at the UN General Assembly is a classic moment in recent film history.For those who like politically-charged films like ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN and SEVEN DAYS IN MAY, THIRTEEN DAYS is the ticket. Even if political dramas are not your thing, this film should still be seen for the great acting and the story that is on display.",10.0,Anonymous,History
Blast Off With This One!,"Here are thirteen different reasons why you should quickly move like a missile and invade ""Thirteen Days': 1) It has detailed historic elements that are very educational about the cuban missile crisis back in 1962 2) Bruce Greenwood and Steven Culp contribute presidential top performances as John and Robert Kennedy 3) It was very-well directed by Kevin Donaldson 4) Kevin Costner is in a better movie than `Waterworld' ( I know! That is not a stretch!) 5) It demonstrates how close we were to war!Ok! So maybe I only have 5 written down! It was good! But no that good! If I try to think of 8 other ones, it will probably take me about 13 days to finish the review. **** Good",8.0,Anonymous,History
A fairly solid political drama,"Thirteen Days isn't for everyone. If you're not into political dramas then you're not going to like it, because it's a down-the-line, hardcore, plain-and-simple political drama. There's little character devlopment surrounding the momentous characters (nor is any really necessary), and there's not much action beyond a U2 spy plane getting shot down.If like me, however, you have a passing interest in the Kennedy administration and the whole 'Missiles of October' incident, then this movie is definitely worth a look. The whole thing is very well made, well acted and sleek. Having watched some of the older Kennedy movies, it's nice to see the high-sheen finish of a modern Hollywood production being put to use on this subject matter.Costner's had a hard time at the box office lately, this movie included. However, he does a sterling job here as Kenneth P. O'Donnell. Actually, his entire role was relatively needless, and he got more screen time than necessary for his character. However, he played the part very well throughout, apart from a slightly shaky Boston accent.Bruce Greenwood is a great actor. He manages to be pretty convincing as JFK, even though he doesn't sound like the former president one bit. Whether it was a conscious decision not to try to mock up the unmistakable JFK accent, or whether Greenwood simply didn't pull it off, I don't know, but the performance doesn't suffer too much. Greenwood's voice is far deeper than JFK's too, so Greenwood automatically comes across as more brooding and moody. The other approach would have been to concentrate on JFK's voice, the accent, the right-fist-clenched hand gestures, the upturned top lip... that's precisely the way Martin Sheen approached the part in ""Kennedy"" (1983). Sheen's performance was uncanny (truly, truly uncanny), but sometimes felt a little like a ""caricature"". Greenwood's performance is the opposite -- much more subtle and less ""hammy"", but essentially less accurate too.For me, Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy is the best all-rounder in this movie. His acting is great, and he looks and sounds the part too, mananging to do the Kennedy accent without ever sounding like a self-caricature. This is Culp's second outing as RFK, having played the Attorney General in a low-budget TV effort about Marilyn Monroe a few years beforehand. He really does a great job here... full marks!So, all round, this is a well-made, well-acted and historically accurate political drama. I'm going to give it a 7.5 out of 10.",8.0,Anonymous,History
Great JFK movie,"While I was not yet born during JFK's days in office, I found this movie extremely interesting and educational.   Kevin Costner turns in his usual outstanding performance as the Special Assistant to President Kennedy. Bruce Greenwood is brilliant as JFK as is Robert Culp as RFK.  It really made you feel as if you were in the Oval Office during the Cuban Missile Crisis.  If you are interested in this period of history or are a Costner fan, then this movie is for you.   9 Stars.",9.0,Anonymous,History
"Nailbiting thrills, hairraising insights","Since a lof of people have offered their comments on ""Thirteen Days"" I want stress two aspects only:Number 1: The fact that we´re all here to discuss this and other movies is ample evidence that somehow the then world-leaders in charge did manage not to blow earth to smithereens. Whether it worked exactly the way it is shown in the movie is beyond my knowledge, but the way that is highlighted in the movie will serve as a number one example about how to do a thriller whose ending is public knowledge without losing your audience from the word go. In fact it´s a nailbiting suspense movie that´ll keep you at the edges of your seats.Number 2: After all that facts and fiction about the Kennedys (thank you very much Oliver Stone!), we tend to forget how young these people actually were when they had been given the power to preserve or destroy the earth. ""Thirteen Days"" reminds one of these fact and that´s another reason why this films keeps holding you in its grip from start to finish.""Thirteen Days"" is not a Kevin-Costner-flic. The main function of his invented character (how much it basically is a supporting role becomes evident in the major crises scenes, where he has to take the back seets) seems to be the one scene when his wife mentions that not only the Kennedys but he himself was also bright, to which he responds with deeper insight, ""no not like them"", thereby gloryfying them once more. Maybe that´s why ""Thirteen Days"" ironically reminds one of why Mr. Costner was considered a major star and acting force in Hollywood once.",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Great film, great story, great acting, great entertainment","Says it all, don't it?Especially I thoroughly enjoyed Kevin Costner. Finally, he showed us that he can actually act and be great to watch again!The plot is well known, but it is really great watching it in this movie, that sort of underplays the epic drama of it all, and instead gives us great insight into the fears and anxieties controlling the men during the crisis.

If they had fired the boom operator...,"... this would have been an even better film. Or just fire the guys in post-production who miss about a dozen of microphones hanging there.Well, that is about all there is to criticize for the movie in itself is a very good example of ""real politics"" the thing you don't see or read, the stuff that goes on behind closed doors. While all actors put on a good show in portraying the people that make the decisions, truly Steven Culp (Bobby Kennedy) and Dylan Baker (Robert McNamara) succeed the most and come closest to the original.What apart from the actors truly makes this film though, is that it is not shown from the perspective of the decision-makers but from the perspective of a by-stander (not an un-influential by-stander, but still) someone who will not be held responsible for the actions taken, but still knows everything that happens. If it weren't for the technical mishaps and the pressed metaphors (""the sun rose this morning"", the football game, etc.) this would have been a 10 movie, so it's ""just"" an 8 movie.",8.0,Anonymous,History

I was anxious to see this wonderful movie,"It was a pleasant summer day on the Bulgarian coast. The year was 1962. Two men were walking along the seaside near the wonderful Palace of Evksinograd, near the town of Varna talking to each other. The Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev and his Bulgarian partner and colleague Todor Zhivkov had a lot to discuss... Probably at that moment the Soviet leader for the very first time mentioned that he had intention to deploy medium range ballistic missiles in his new ally Cuba. No one can say exactly how it all began, but many say that Todor Zhivkov unsuccessfully tried to persuade Khrushchev not to do so... The rest of the story is very well known. The movie Thirteen Days appeared in Bulgaria in 2001. Almost no one saw it and that`s pitty. Once again Kevin Costner stars in a realistic and even shocking political film, which, in my opinion stands along with the classic JFK. And both movies are closely connected. I was delighted to see this masterpiece and a month ago I bought it on a video tape. Probably the most important lesson one can learn from it is that the Greatb Powers are closely connected, much more than officially admitted. And we, the common people on the Planet, will never be aware of what really happens on  the Great Stage of World Politics!",10.0,Anonymous,History

Thirteen days is about the cold war. The director is Roger Donaldson. Some actors are Kevin Costnor,Bruce Greenwood,Steven Culp, Frank Wood, This movie was alright.

"Jon Monsarrat review:  great, safe for non-drama types","I'm an action movie guy, and while I have an appreciation for history, sort of, I'm hardly a drama fan. But Thirteen Days is quite accessible and not at all boring. In fact, I found it riveting and have seen it a couple of times since.The film is the true life story of the Cuban missile crisis, which I always thought happened at the same time as the Bay of Pigs crisis, but I was wrong. The script writer takes special care in every single scene to (a) set up tension (b) explain what's going on and why that's important. So despite all the complexities, I never got lost.Meanwhile, the story itself is fascinating, and the fact that it's true to life means that unlike most of the action flicks I see, it actually has some meaning. The only negative I can think of is those overdone Boston accents. Whaddya know, a Kevin Costner film I actually liked.Who should see this:-- everyone who has even the tiniest interest in spy thriller stuff-- drama fans, you'll go for it too-- action fans, definitelyI'll give Thirteen Days a 9 out of 10.",9.0,Anonymous,History
Elmer Fudd saves the world,"It's hard to imagine. The fate of the world in the hands of the Kennedy brothers and some joe named Kenny O'Donnell (Kevin Costner, sounding eerily like Elmer Fudd at times). These three were apparently the White House inner inner circle.My own knowledge of the events is fuzzy. I hate to call this film educational, but it's now the account of the Cuban Missile Crisis that I will remember. It makes me want to read more about it, to see what's true and what isn't. Hopefully others won't be so quick to accept the film as gospel and look upon it as what it really is: entertainment.Like any Hollywood movie with a Kennedy in it, Jack and Bobby are treated as infallible protectors of everything good. No other president has more stories surrounding him, more speculation about his personal life and beliefs. When Bruce Greenwood (in the best performance of the film) tells O'Donnell, kiddingly, that he wishes ""someone else were president"", we'd understand if he meant it. Hollywood has us believing the world would be a better place had JFK survived longer than three years in office. Kennedy's clashes with the military establishment is used for drama in ""Thirteen Days"", but doesn't take over the story. It's the cat-and-mouse game, the fact that these three men seem able only to trust each other, that makes the film so compelling.The Crisis is so important because it's the one time in history where the world really seemed to be on the brink of nuclear annihilation. There was a chance, however small, that something could go wrong. ""Cooler heads"" might not prevail. ""Thirteen Days"" takes you inside of it, giving you things like the White House staff's reactions to Adlai Stevenson's ""til hell freezes over"" declaration to the Soviet U.N. delegate. Even if things didn't happen exactly this way, you see what it must have been like. Accurately depicted is the weight of the situation. You can feel the life-or-death quality of each decision these men faced.Lest we forget that there are still enough nuclear weapons in silos around the world to destroy it twenty times over, the film is some timely food for thought.Grade: B",8.0,Anonymous,History
"Very timely, well crafted film....","I feel this is an excellent film.  It stands out particularly because it is so timely as we sit through an incredibly incompetent administration, which is not only unable to protect its citizens, but is launching us head first into a ""war without end.""The phrase ""hopefully cooler heads will prevail"" which is uttered  often in this film is a statement that both sides need to privilege at this time.There is sufficient depth in this film.  It consistently makes me cry, which says a lot for a film.  The characters are personable, understandble, reasonable, intelligent, thoughtful, contemplative; it is a wonderful film for learned people to enjoy.It is an historical document which much like ""Amadeus"" by Milos Forman, which is an excellent vehicle for learning about classical music. ""Thirteen Days"" is a also a wonderful laboratory for examining the operations of democracy, diplomacy, teamwork and leadership at its best.There are also relatively subtle, but unmistakable statements that speak to the nature of our military, its attitude and the extraordinarily (yet unappreciated) fragility inherent in our rich democracy.It is very hard for me to find flaw with this film.  It is exceedingly obvious that the cast, director and crew really believed in this film and without ever over acting or indicating, they convey these events with convincing authenticity, familiarity and agency.I only wish there were more films like this for our young people to make American History and civics ""come alive"".  FDR, Teddy Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Thomas Jefferson films could all emerge from essentially using this model of paintstaking authenticity and sensitive craft.Articulating the special cares and concerns of our great figures in history.",10.0,Anonymous,History
"Gripping, tension-filled","In October 1962, I was 11 years old and a 6th grader at Nottingham Elementary School in Arlington, VA, a suburb of Washington DC.  I still recall the terror that swept the school as we were required to store Metriacal (sp?) and bottled water in our lockers and practice bomb drills by diving under our desks and huddling in the hallways.  We knew enough about politics and international affairs to know that DC would be the first city hit with missiles, even though I do recall it was one of the first times I ever rooted for New York to win anything!The movie did an excellent job of recapturing this terror.  While flawed by an inept effort to put a Boston accent on Kevin Costner, the trio of JFK, Bobby & Costner (Kenny O'Donnell) worked extremely well together.  Bruce Greenwood (Double Jeopardy) played a very believable JFK, while Steven Culp did a fine job playing a less-than-impressive RFK.  You really felt the tension that JFK must have lived as he was making some of the most critical decisions that any president has ever had to make.The old, tired, military brass and advisors did a fine collective job of trying to convince the `damn Kennedys' that we oughta bomb em back to the Stone Age.'  Curtis LeMay was as scary as I remember him, and there was an excellent shouting scene between Robert McNamara and a Navy admiral.The movie proved that, like Apollo 13, you CAN make a gripping movie even though you know how it begins and how it ends.  9 of 10 stars.",9.0,Anonymous,History

Great film of the 1962 crisis.,"""Thirteen Days""  depicts the extremely tense moments during the cold war between the US and the USSR.  It also gives a glimpse of what might have gone on in the White House during that time.  I highly doubt the makers of this film had complete access to the records from this time but they may have had some.  I am also sure that many of the details of the events are still classified and will remain that way for many generations to come.Kevin Costner is excellent as at Kenny O'Donnell and shows just how close and how much influence a presidential advisor has with issues such as National Security and other policy matters.  I enjoyed the depictions of stress and out right fear that these events depicted.  This made the film seem more real.  I am sure that many people, who actually lived during this time, felt this brought back some memories.The story of the crisis and the extreme care both nations took to try to resolve the conflict without resorting to the unthinkable is well presented. However, the film did not show that Kruschev was in a very difficult position.  At this time, he was already in danger of being deposed, which he was a year or two later, and he could not make any withdrawal from Cuba without something to ""save face"".  If he had not, he would have been deposed and things would, very likely, have turned out different. I also have to admit, I really liked the way the film depicts the fear that people felt during this time.  Many people felt this was going to start a war between us and the Soviets.  Wars of the past had started with much less reason.  I also like the fact that it showed that both sides were afraid.  In this situation, no one wants a war using nuclear weapons.Overall, this is a great film and worth seeing (9 out of 10).",9.0,Anonymous,History
Gripping real-life drama magnetically told,"Back during the Cold War, life was a little different. Once the USSR became a major world power, there was an intense battle of wills on the parts of both the US and Russia not to get into another war. While previous wars had been fought using conventional warfare, it was common knowledge that the next one would involve nuclear weapons, and would probably be the last war anyone would see. In October of 1962, the Soviets planted missiles on the Communist island of Cuba, a mere 90 miles away from Florida's coast. Those of you who were sentient beings in 1962 must have been apoplectic when you heard that news. Imagine! The Red Menace, which had up till then been as distant as Mars, was now parked in your front yard, tooting the horn. It was probably enough to make you quake in your boots. Americans aren't accustomed to reacting in such a manner, of course; we're the big, bad tough guys of the world. And while up till then a full-blown nuclear attack might have seemed as unthinkable as the Cubs winning the World Series, all of a sudden it was very possible. And people were terrified. But by the time the public found out about the missiles, the White House had been working on the problem for a little while. This film captures the inner-circle machinations that President John F. Kennedy and Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy orchestrated to avert thermonuclear war. Was Krushchev seriously trying to initiate a war? Was he trying to scare the US? Was he basically saying, ""We can park these missiles right here and there's nothing you can do about it,"" basically making the US look bad to the rest of the world? It was among the most gripping time period's in the brief, eventful history of the United States. The future of not only the country but of the entire world was teetering, and one false move on the part of the level-headed thinkers in America would plunge it into the abyss. To complicate matters, there were two letters purporting to be from the Soviet leader: Were they both fakes? Was the first real, and the second a fraud? Should the US denounce both? And of course, there were certain military leaders in the US who wanted nothing more than to blow the Reds off the planet. The movie is filled with a virtual no-name cast. Bruce Greenwood plays the president, and he was convincing and powerful in his performance. Steven Culp plays Bobby Kennedy, volatile but shrewd, the ultimate diplomat. The only real ""name"" in the cast belongs to Kevin Costner, who plays political advisor Kenny O'Donnell. He has the same good-old-boy accent he sported in JFK, but he was a little more emotional than in most of his films. A good move on his part, I'd say. The madness of near-war is an infection to which these prime players seemed immune. It's movies like this that remind one that politics and war planning are not simple textbook exercises; they need to be cultivated from the heart and leashed by the brain.",9.0,Anonymous,History
terrible,The film Thirteen Days was not good to me. There were a lot of scenes where they just argued and went on and on. It was very dragged out and every other scene had arguing in it. I would not watch this film ever again. Another reason that I did not enjoy this film was because I didn't really understand what was going on in it. The actors were great but the film overall was terrible. Maybe if I understood more and there were not so many scenes of them just going back and forth and disagreeing on things then I would rate it higher. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone but maybe there are other films similar that are better than this.,3.0,Anonymous,History

A cold war movie that looks like it was made 20 years before,"The film is able to show some tension by portraying one of the closest moments the earth has been to an atomic war. However, there are some drawbacks that really bore and makes it hard to resist until the long movie finishes. By portraying mindless militaries who want to bomb other countries as if it were a sport (yes, it is correct, they are like this) it does not mean, as the movie suggests, that Kennedy was a wise man. Indeed, the film is too permissive to the false understanding that it it reasonable that the United States consider as their right to invade other countries with military airplanes without being shot, or to claim that Cuba does not have long-range missiles while their ally Turkey has. Indeed, the United States does not seek peace, as the ridiculous speech in the end suggests, but an advantage in their imperialism. Soviets are portrayed as dumb and mischievous as if the film had been made 15 or 20 years before, during cold war. Therefore, a musical score that brings spectator to heroism was also a disturbingly misleading. To resume, the film is a little boring and very politically biased despite its strategy to portray Kennedy and Costner's character as the wise moderate statesmen.",5.0,Anonymous,History

Good movie Overall,"Thirteen Days narrates the story of the Cuban Missile Crisis in the United States in the 1960's. Seen through the eyes of John F. Kennedy's special assistant (which never existed), one grasps the seriousness and tension of the situation.Although one knows the outcome of the movie, it is a still interesting and worth seeing. Seeing the development of each character as time progresses and tensions grow, one feels as if one was there. It truly captures the essence and importance of those thirteen days of world history. It teaches us that we really did come close to WW III.One thing it portrays very well is the bias of the hawks and the doves. Military men such as General LeMay and Acheson really pushing for a war. In contrast, Stevenson and Rusk try to look for diplomatic alternatives. This contrast was made quite clearly, but at times, very harsh.Though the movie is an excellent watch, at times it can become too dramatic. One particular scene that was a waste of time was the scene where Kevin Costner shows up at his son's game. It says nothing about the movie and really portrays drama at its highest level.Overall, this movie does a good job in teaching us how important political decisions can really be and how one simple mistake can cause a catastrophic event. It also shows how intelligently things were carried out in the White House in the time of the Missile Crisis. Even I, who was not alive at the time, can truly say I got a sense of what it must have felt for people at the time to live in such confusion.",5.0,Anonymous,History
U.S vs. Cuba,"I was not a fan of the movie Thirteen Days. It was way too slow and I feel as if every other scene it's just men arguing. I guess that's what pretty much happened during this incident anyway, but to watch it in a movie, was very boring. I do like, however, that the film captures the tension of the decisions that JFk and his administration had to make and how the results could have been very critical for the world. This movie should remind the American people to be really grateful for the decision that was made. Reason is, we wouldn't be here today if those missiles went off. It was only 90 miles out from Florida, so the U. S. would have been done for. Even though I wasn't the biggest fan of the film, it was an important one. I recommend everyone should watch it, especially the American people.",3.0,Anonymous,History
The world goes to war - almost...,"THIRTEEN DAYSAspect ratio: 1.85:1Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS(Color & black and white)An account of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, during which President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his closest advisers struggled to avoid a potential nuclear conflict following the discovery of Russian missiles in Cuba.A step up from the likes of SPECIES (1995) and DANTE'S PEAK (1997) for director Roger Donaldson, this compelling drama distills the essence of the Cuban missile crisis into a tightly-packed narrative framework, toplining Kevin Costner as special assistant Kenny O'Donnell, whose presence is depicted as central to the outcome of proceedings. Strong B-list actors Bruce Greenwood and (especially) Steven Culp are superb as the Kennedy brothers, determined to find a political solution to the unfolding situation, despite unrest among their military advisers. David Self's script allows a few domestic interludes, to emphasize the effect of the disaster on ordinary lives, and Donaldson keeps things moving swiftly along, clarifying a wealth of details with economy and grace. All the key incidents are reproduced, including a nail-biting moment following the introduction of a US-sanctioned blockade of Cuba, when American warships prepare to fire on Russian tankers steaming toward the exclusion zone. How much of this is strictly accurate, and how much is emphasized for dramatic purposes can't be guessed, but THIRTEEN DAYS does a fine job of educating viewers unfamiliar with this momentous historical incident.",5.0,Anonymous,History
Unlucky for some,"Amazing, riveting, suspenseful, shocking, worrying and tense: that's enough about the Cuban missile crises. Some of it rubs off on this film but not a lot. There's just enough razzle from the events and persons depicted in this film to stop 'Thirteen Days' from fizzling out altogether.The actors are very variable across the board with some eye rolling performances varying from dumbstruck to raving mad. Minor characters are unbelievable and major characters are all over the shop.The story is very oddly developed, characters are described to us rather than properly demonstrated, or ""performed"" and action scenes are not a strength either. This film isn't far from being parody. In fact it makes me think of 'Dr. Strangelove' if that film had taken a more reserved approach to it's subject matter. I keep expecting someone to start talking about their bodily fluids and wink at each other.The sense of the 1960's isn't visually convincing and the cinematography is flat with basic lighting which isn't helped by the largely boring interior spaces that the film spends most of its time in. Similarly the director seemed to have a craving for crane shots and low angle shots in the first act but after that the camera becomes entirely TV in style with medium shots, reverse angles and reaction shots at eye height, which adds little visual drive or insight to the talky drama.Kevin Costner has accent problems but otherwise hands in a standard type performance in his role. The rest of the cast are up and down like a rollercoaster.The editing isn't adding any extra dimension but I suspect that chopping together some of these interlocking scenes was actually a significant endeavour in post production editing. The score and sound design is functional only. The sound mix has a professional balance with clearly delivered dialogue. There are times however where the adage that silence is golden might have been better heeded by all involved.I rate at 4/10 because there is enough bang for your buck left over from the actual real life story to enliven this film treatment and make it watchable enough.I recommend to fans of the principal cast, and to those inquisitive to recall the era, and to J F Kennedy fanatics. ""A Bay of Pigs fiasco"" film would surely slot in with this and Oliver Stone's 'JFK' to complete a Hollywood-isation of the Kennedy period.",4.0,Anonymous,History

It's neither high quality and enjoyment or low equality and low enjoyment. It's just in the middle. I know it may seem like i hate this movie well. Because i did.

Give Costner a break. This movie is great.,"Why does everyone hate Kevin Costner all of a sudden? After Waterworld came out, the American public seemed to loathe Kevin Costner. I don't get it. Let's not forget about Field of Dreams, Dances with Wolves, JFK, and other great films starring Costner.After reading numerous comments on this movie, I've found that the biggest complaint is that people don't like Costner's New England accent. Are you seriously going to hate a movie because of an accent? By the way, many New Englanders do sound like that. Try spending time north of New York, and you'll hear it. The biggest reason it sounds weird in this movie is because we're not used to hearing Costner talk that way.Thirteen Days is a great political thriller. Let's give Costner a break.",,Anonymous,History
Costner and another bad accent,"Though I knew the facts involved here I enjoyed this film and thought Greenwood the best JFK and Culp the best RFK I've ever seen on film. The only problem is Costner. Another grim performance - boy does this guy take himself seriously. He'd do well to make another film like Tin Cup and lighten up a little. Another bit of advice: Kevin, never, ever do another accent. This was the worst, most distractingly bad accent I've seen since, well, Costner in Robin Hood. OK OK, I get that the guy is from Boston but Costner sounded absurd next to Greenwood and Culp.",,Anonymous,History
I should have been even MORE worried,"I was in junior high and remember very well counting down the time until we heard whether the Russians turned back from the blockade.  I was scared as all of were.  After seeing this movie I know now that I should have been scared even more than I was.  What an amazing turn of events those couple of weeks were.Several comments have been made about Costner's accent and the only thing I have to add is why did he have to have a Bostonian accent anyway?  Did the director feel that he would not be believable without one?  Costner should have just been allowed to use his own natural voice instead of us being distracted at first by his accent.  Culp and Greenwood were excellent in their roles and it was kinda cool to see Christopher Lawford in the commander's role.Two things really struck me during this film:  1) V.P. Johnson's role - or lack of role I should say.  He certainly was not included in any of the decisions which is further proof of the Kennedys' lack of interest in his opinions.  And, 2)Was the public ever informed of the U2 pilot's death? I sure do not remember ever hearing of it until this film.Overall this was an excellent film.  Let's hope if we ever get into a similar crisis we have the men in power to get through it without ""blinking"".",,Anonymous,History
Excellent Within The Constraints Of The Genre,"Put simply -- this film is worth the expenditure of seeing it on the silver screen, intelligent, mature entertainment, and generally as good as a film of its genre is going to get.  But please, folks, remember that it is a Hollywood version of the events and NOT, by any means,  a historical documentary or even an accurate portrayal of events.Oh yeah, and Kevin Costner's acting is -- as ever -- somewhat wooden, his accent sounds like a bad voice coaching job, and they could have chosen a more controversial subject matter, and portrayed the situation of the Cubans with a bit more (or in fact, any) depth, but what the hell -- I enjoyed watching ""Thirteen Days"", so I don't want to knock it.",,Anonymous,History
Fascinating story about something that really happened.,"I only wanted to watch this movie because of Bruce Greenwood, however the movie was completely fascinating to me.  Not being American - therefore I knew very little about this event. Although I had heard of the Cuban Missile Crisis before,  all I knew about it, was that it was about a crisis, in Cuba and it had probably had something to do with missiles.If you are a history buff, then watch this movie.  If you are not, watch it anyway - I cant imagine anybody not liking this movie, because its a true story, great acting,  good character likenesses and enough tension to keep you on the edge of your seats - like I was.Even though I knew that the movie would end without WW3 obviously, but I didn't know how it would turn out and I imagine most people wouldnt and that kept the suspense in the movie right to the very end.Though I was wondering about JFK - did he really talk like that ?  It seemed a very strange accent to me.",,Anonymous,History
a tense telling of history,"In1962 U.S. spy planes flying over Cuba spotted the first of a growing supply of nuclear missiles. United States president John F. Kennedy announced a naval blockade to prevent the arrival of more missiles. He demanded that the USSR dismantle and remove the weapons and declared a quarantine zone around Cuba. For 13 tense days the country waited to see if there would be a nuclear war.  This film follows those 13 days and focuses on the decisions and actions of the Kennedy's as well as others in the White House that finally led to peace. Canadian actor Bruce Greenwood plays the president and while he may not look a lot like JFK he definitely has the personality. Surprisingly the worst part of the movie is it's only big star (and one of the only reasons it got made), Kevin Costner.  Who goes through the film doing something that resembles a horrible Boston accent.  Still Thirteen Days is an interesting and thought provoking film, that will make you wonder: would America be here today if someone else were in charge of the presidency?",,Anonymous,History
Somewhat Disappointing,"I really wanted to like this movie, but I really did not.  I thought the performances were pretty good (Costner should have bagged using the accent, but otherwise he was fine).  My problem with the film was that I saw four microphones that inadvertently appeared at the top of the screen above the actors -- two of them were so obvious that pretty much everyone in the theater saw them and laughed.  I could see something like this happening in a low budget film, but this movie reportedly cost $80-90 million.  Maybe this is nitpicking, but seeing something like that really disrupts a film for me.I also thought a few important scenes came off as a bit fake, particularly the scene where the President and Bobbie Kennedy were watching Stevenson address the UN.  This film would probably make a good rental, but I cannot recommend that you pay theater prices to see it.",,Anonymous,History
"Still Tense, Though Knowing","The mark of a good historical movie is that the audience, while knowing how events will turn out, is still caught up in the tension of the moment. That's what happened with `Apollo 13'-we knew the crew was going to arrive home safely, but we still clapped for joy when their capsule re-entered the earth's atmosphere.`Thirteen Days' tells the story of the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, and it recreates expertly the fear many of us had at the time (I was a senior in high school) that the United States and Soviet Union were about to start a nuclear war.Kevin Costner, we are told, passed up the role of John Kennedy to play Kenneth O'Donnell, who according to the film was as close to JFK and Bobby Kennedy as they were to each other.  There seems to be a question as to whether O'Donnell's part in the crisis was built up to accommodate Costner, but regardless, the star made the right choice.  This is his best role in a long time. He plays O'Donnell as a tough but compassionate political adviser to JFK.The task of playing JFK falls to Bruce Greenwood, who continues a string of outstanding performances.  I wonder if Greenwood is ever going to be recognized as a great actor.  He doesn't try to imitate the president, but gives a convincing performance. Steven Culp is also good as RFK, as are a supporting cast headed by Dylan Baker as Robert McNamara, Bill Smitrovich as General Maxwell Taylor, Tim Kelleher as Ted Sorensen and Kevin Conway as the trigger-happy Gen. Curtis LeMay.Roger Donaldson keeps the film moving-I was shocked to discover that when the film was over it had lasted more than two and a quarter hours.  He directed Costner in the successful ""No Way Out,"" suggesting the two ought to continue collaborating.My only quarrel with the film comes from my memory that a heavily Republican newspaper in my hometown of St. Louis portrayed the missile crisis-at least at the beginning-as a ploy by Kennedy to capture votes for a Democratic congress in the upcoming elections.  The film doesn't cover the angle-but that's its only fault.",,Anonymous,History
Interesting historical picture.,While this is an interesting film to watch it only captured the U.S. side of the crisis and contained nothing about what was happening in the Kremlin. The story of the crisis over the years has been beaten to death by documentaries and interviews of virtually everyone who was involved so it didn't really contain anything original.  In the 1974 made for TV film `The Missiles of October'  John F and Robert Kennedy were the principal characters where in this version presidential advisor Kenny O'Donnell is clearly given the lead role.  It's good for the historical aspect and had some action footage but don't pass up seeing the 74 docudrama.,,Anonymous,History
A solid film that tries to be inteligent and mature but never suceeds,"I went into this film expecting another brilliant Kennedy turn for Costner. I was a little disappointed. The film was relativeley well done...with good(though not great) performances all around. However, this film never succeeds as what it attempts to be. You can see the director trying to make the film inteligent and mature; however, the script just doesn't have what it takes. Furthermore, I found the film to be somewhat derivative of Oliver Stone's two film from that era (JFKandNixon). The use of black and white and montage was very similar to both of Stone's films....In the end this film excites and enthralls the viewer...but never enlightens or makes them think.

"Thirteen Days, Two Hours, and Fifteen Minutes","It takes truly masterful filmmaking to take one of the most terrifying and unthinkable moments in world history and make it into a movie with all the drama and excitement of C-SPAN. After signoff. During a power failure.Uhhhhh, no - I didn't much care for this movie. Too bad, too. I was very anxious to see it. When I saw trailers for ""Apollo 13"", I was excited because, after all: here was a true stroy with real suspense and a happy ending. How could you possibly screw that up? Well, good thing that Ron Howard never asked ""Thirteen Days"" director Roger Donaldson that question, because he evidently has the answer. I was hoping for a repeat of the satisfaction I got from ""Apollo 13"" with ""Thirteen Days"". I was sorely disappointed.""Thirteen Days"" is badly written. Characters launch into pointless silioquies that sound very profound and affecting if you don't actually listen to them. Unfortunately, I listened and heard many words with very little said. Again, this is like watching C-SPAN (Let me explain for the benefit of our friends outside of the U.S. C-SPAN is a television channel that broadcasts from a camera bolted to the floor of the Senate and/or the Congress. It is very useful for torturing schoolchildren and as a sleep-aid for adults).""Thirteen Days"" is a failed epic. The film occasionally slips into black-and-white which, given the historical content of the film, might have been used to give it a feeling of history. However, the black-and-white scenes seem to occur at random. There is also an incredibly annoying amount of stock footage used. I can understand the use of atomic bomb test stock footage, but there's also a huge amount of stock footage of crowds and ""people on the street"". Again, some might argue that the filmmakers were trying to achieve a sense of history, but it just comes off as cheap and distracting. The film seems to go out of it's way to break your suspension of disbelief and remind you that you are watching a movie.""Thirteen Days"" is badly cast and acted. Kevin Costner is stiff as a board and his Boston accent comes and goes as randomly as the black-and-white scenes. Bruce Greenwood acts competently, but he's not a very convincing John F. Kennedy. Steven Culp is fairly acceptable as Robert Kennedy, although the weak script doesn't give him much to work with. Michael Fairman plays Adali Stevenson, a perenially weak politician who overcomes his weakness while telling off the Soviet ambassador during a U.N. conference. Unfortunately, the only real indication that he overcame his weakness is that the rest of the cast cheers him while watching on TV. Nope - no character development there.""Thirteen Days"" basically fails on every level. It's insufferably dull, uninteresting, bereft of sympathetic characters, and despite dealing with the near end of human civilization, does nothing to fire the imagination or provoke thought...other than what might be good at the snack bar. Instead, I reccomend watching two and a quarter hour's worth of C-SPAN. The characters are much more believable.",,Anonymous,History
Solid political drama with excellent dialogue and lead performances.,"13 days is an excellent window into the events which unfolded in October of 1962, when the world stood still and turned their heads towards the Caribbean island of Cuba. Bruce Greenwood ( John F.

A great look at great men of our past,"Year after year, Hollywood continually attemps to bring the Whitehouse and our government to life. The lives and administrations of our leaders are often so intricate and involve so many twists and turns that a viewer becomes lost. Instead of creating conspiracy (The Contender) or showing us falsehoods (JFK), Thirteen Days does an incredible job of showing us the truth in a time of unrest in the U.S. Lives are reached on a personal level, the tension we see is very real, and the story is informative. A viewer comes away with so much from this film, and we see politicians in a true light for the first time; not perfect, but working to better things in this country, and avoid the worst, war. The acting is superb (finally a breakthrough in Kostner's longtime slump), and we are introduced to several new actors which will hopefully be seen more in following these performances. Thirteen Days brings history to life in a true and exciting fashion, and is a welcome change to our usual films on the subject.",,Anonymous,History
Yet another Kennedy hagiography,"I predict that eventually JFK and RFK will be portrayed in Hollywood productions with medieval-style nimbuses around their heads. Both characters are brought pretty close to sainthood in this picture, the characterizations of which have all the depth of a 1940s-era comic book. The Kennedys and their ""best and brightest"" are smart, subtle, and preternaturally adept at perceiving internal machinations in the Kremlin. The bad guys, namely the Pentagon brass, do everything short of gnashing their teeth and twirling their moustaches to come across as cigar-chomping, one-dimensional villains.On the plus side, the acting is reasonably good, and the military hardware is well portrayed. Period aircraft like the Vought RF-8A supersonic reconnaissance plane and the venerable U2 are resurrected with proper respect and startling verisimilitude. I think I even caught a glimpse of a Rockwell RA-5C Vigilante--very cool! The only technical error I caught was when a missile liftoff portrayed as an ""Atlas test"" was actually a Titan II.",,Anonymous,History
Great film if you get past Costner's accent...,"A very well done film showing the inner workings and politics involved in what must have been an incredibly difficult and tense period in world history.But why oh why does Kevin Costner continue to insist on trying to speak in an accent other than his own??? His own voice would have been just fine for that role, and it's not as though anyone really knows who that guy is or what he's supposed to sound like. This is film. This is illusion. Don't spoil it with a terrible attempt at an accent! I actually found the actor playing JFK to have underplayed JFK's real accent, and I certainly didn't miss that, or feel that the part wasn't done well because he didn't cop as much of an accent as JFK had. Actually, I blame the director for allowing Costner's accent in the film, but then again, if we're to believe the stories about Costner exerting his 'clout' on films, it may have been beyond the director's control.But this is still a very good film, bad accent notwithstanding! :o)",,Anonymous,History
gripping historical drama,"In just the past few months - since the United States has once again been put on a state of high alert after the September 11th terrorist attacks - `Thirteen Days' has assumed a position of much greater pertinence than it did when it was first released in theatres in late 2000.  What at that time might have seemed like little more than a quaint history lesson - dealing with issues and events from a bygone world and era - now suddenly throbs with a contemporary relevance it didn't have before.`Thirteen Days' derives its title from the two-week period in October 1962 when, during the famed Cuban Missile Crisis, the world was brought almost to the brink of nuclear annihilation.  In this Halloween horror to end all Halloween horrors, the citizens of the planet held their collective breaths as President Kennedy and Premier Khrushchev faced off over the Soviets' attempt to employ nuclear weapons, aimed directly at the United States, in Castro's Cuba.The most admirable aspect of `Thirteen Days' is that the filmmakers understand the power of their material and feel no need to hype or gussy it up with irrelevant side issues or cheap melodramatics.  For 147 minutes, we are thrust into the center of this volatile moment in time as President Kennedy, his Attorney General (and brother) Robert Kennedy, and Special Assistant to the President Kenneth P. O'Donnell - who serves as the Everyman focal point for the audience - weigh what options they have in trying to avoid the hitherto unthinkable possibility of global, all-out nuclear war. Complicating their decisions are many of the contending forces in their own ranks - be it Congress, the Joint Chiefs of Staff or the media - all of which have a particular point to make, job to do, or political ax to grind. The film is fascinating just on the level of allowing us to see the complex and often ugly nuts-and-bolts aspect of high governmental drama.  Yet, although the film never wavers from the issue at hand, it manages to achieve remarkable depth of character as we see these three men of goodwill struggling with an issue of unprecedented life-or-death global importance. We come to see the toll such stress brings to bear even on men who, in our tendency to romanticize our heroes, often seem superhuman from our outside-looking-in perspective.Despite the fact that the movie rarely leaves its Washington setting, we are still afforded chilling images of life on the outside during these two amazing weeks:  anchorman Walter Cronkite intoning a bleak sign-off to his broadcast during one of the gloomiest hours of the crisis, hordes of somber Catholics queuing up outside a church where round-the-clock confessions have been instituted, and masses of people depleting grocery store shelves in preparation for the worst-possible-case scenario.Kevin Kostner as O'Donnell, Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Steven Culp as RFK all deliver superlative portraits of serious minded and compassionate adults who comprehend the gravity of the situation in which they find themselves.What is most amazing about `Thirteen Hours' is that, even though we already know how it is going to end, we still find ourselves caught up in the tension and suspense of the situation.  Particularly gripping is the scene in which Adlai Stevenson, then U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., confronts head-on the Soviet ambassador who attempts to deny the truth of the allegations made against his country.  It is a moment of high political and emotional conflict worthy of Greek or Shakespearean drama.One wishes that the makers of `Pearl Harbor' had taken the same approach to their historical event as the makers of `Thirteen Days' did to theirs. Then we might have been spared the inane, puppy-love scenario that all but sank that later film.  Imagine if the focus in `Thirteen Days' had been on John having to break the news to Marilyn while a jealous, rheumy-eyed Bobby looked on from the wings.  Thank God saner heads prevailed and we have a film on this subject that serves both as a fascinating lesson in history AND as a gripping study of human behavior in a time of crisis.  Given what the world is going through right now, `Thirteen Days' emerges as a film deeply relevant to our time.",,Anonymous,History
Hollywood can do History better then P**** H***** or U571,"I was quite impressed by this film. I felt it was for the most part well acted and although it would have been hard not to make a tense thriller out of the material,there was enough historical detail to it to make me feel I'd learned something from it after I'd been on the edge of my seat for 2.5 hrs.It was a tad onesided in that little of the Russian/Cuban angle was seen aside from RFK's visit to the ambassador, the liaison with the Washington Rezident and the UN talks. But then I guess that's Hollywood for you.Steven Culp was spookily like RFK, and Bruce Greenwood, though not so physically similar, did a good job of playing JFK. I cannot comment on how good Costner was at O'Donnell, as I have never seen or heard of him before. The accent he was doing did sound like the mayor from ""The Simpsons"" from time to time though.Overall I'd give this movie 8 out of 10",,Anonymous,History
Truth Is Stranger Than Fiction,"You must always take historical movies with a grain of salt. A lot of times you can actually question how much is true, and how much is propaganda. Knowing very little of the actual events portrayed in this film, a lot of this is open for interpretation. Still, I was riveted, even though you know the ending. The drama and the tension was about as strong as could be for a movie with minimal action. I am a sucker for good script writing. This is one of the best-acted movies I have seen in a long time. I never for a moment doubted that Culp was Bobby Kennedy, or Greenwood was JFK. The most startling aspect of this movie was many actors' resemblance to the actual person: Strozier could have been Dean Rusk, I wouldn't have known. Even Walter Adrian, who plays a minimal speaking role as LBJ, looked like the real man. Political tension on screen usually misses, but not here. Scores 8 of 10.",,Anonymous,History
great film about the Cuban Missile Crisis,"I remember first seeing this film when I was about twelve or thirteen years old. It was on pay-per-view and I had nothing else to watch. I began to watch it, but being ignorant on the matter I completely zoned out and fell asleep forty five minutes into the movie. It was very idiotic of me I would say, because this film, now that I look at it with a whole new perspective and having knowledge of the subject, is a truly moving and powerful piece, with few weaknesses.Bruce Greenwood's portrayal of President John F. Kennedy is magnificent and nothing short from perfect. All the trouble he went through, all the thoughts and emotions he felt during the Cuban Missile Crisis are beautifully shown by Greenwood. He does a wonderful job of showing what it was like for JFK to be on the spot, between the hawks and doves of the United States.This film really shows how close the United States got to a all-out, head-on nuclear conflict with the Soviet Union. As I watched this film I could feel the anxiety, the fear and worry that people felt during this period of time. I think and try to imagine what it would have been like if neither the USSR nor the U.S. decided to back down. It's a daunting thought.One thing that I didn't understand was the cuts into black and white scenes. I felt that they had no purpose and the film would've been better off without them. I also feel that the film could have been directed more efficiently. Many of the shots could have been more powerful if they hadn't been filmed the way they were.All in all, Thirteen Days was a great movie that really showed the audience what the Cuban Missile Crisis was like.",,Anonymous,History
An inconsistency,"There's one inconsistency I noticed in the movie.  Several years back, I saw a three hour special on The History Channel that dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis.  In that special, it was specifically stated that we were unaware, at the time, that there were tactical nuclear weapons in Cuba that they had a free hand to use any way they saw fit and it's likely they would have used them against us had we invaded.  Yet the movie implies that we did know of their tactical nuclear weapons at that time.  I wonder what the real story on that is, does anyone happen to know?",,Anonymous,History
Felt like a Fortnight,"See ""The Missles of October"".  The older movie, with William Devane, is pretty crude and the acting is variable (veterans like Ralph Bellamy, Howard da Silva and John Dehner are excellent;  whereas Martin Sheen,playing Robert F. Kennedy, the Attorney General who authorized wiretaps on Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., gives a performance good mainly for laughs).Though not so egregiously antihistorical as Oliver Stone's fictions (JFK, Nixon), ""Thirteen Days"" is nevertheless misleading.  The bad guys seem to be members of the U.S. military complex, defending American freedom, rather than members of the ""evil empire"" who were setting up missiles deliberately and stealthily to threaten democracy.Since the Soviet Union is dead and its revealed documents have shownthat everything we feared from them in the Cold War was true, isn't it ok to let them be the threats to democracy and civilization that they were, rather than U.S. ""hawks""?",,Anonymous,History

"An Over looked, Oscar Caliber, GEM: What a Crime!!","Poor Kevin.You were on top in the early 90's.  What the hell happened?  With the exception on 3000 Miles and The Postman, your movies are still good.  But this one is one of your best.  Put this film 10 years ago, it would have been a 100+ million dollar box office hit, and would have been an Oscar contender.

Sorry, but I'll still go and see your films.13 Days is an excellent film with everything: Great sets, great acting, bogus special effects, and a great true story.  People should be ashamed of themselves for ignoring this film.  My friends and I were the only people in the theatre opening night, and we all enjoyed it.  Just bad luck I guess. Bruce Greenwood should have won an Oscar for his portrayal of JFK.  He was too much like the real thing. I actually thought he was the 35th President in a few scenes.  My only complaint was Kev's fake Boston accent, but it wasn't too bad.  It also is a little long, but then again nothing's perfect. I still loved it.  I own the DVD and will enjoy it for years to come. You should do the same, go out and at least rent it.  A great film to watch on the big screen though, you missed out guys, and so did the Oscars.***1/2 out of ****",,Anonymous,History
Good film.,"Excellent, but was 30 minutes to long.  Bruce Greenwood is excellent as JFK and Kevin Costner is good enough in his role.  I was really caught up in the film for most of it but then began to wonder when it was going to end. Could have been near perfect if a little shorter.  Still highly recommended 8/10",,Anonymous,History
"action as communication good, accent on Costner bad","OK we waited to see this one. We held our breaths and hoped for best. When Hollywood does history this is an honest reaction. The story comes out pretty good. Perhaps the best line in the movie after ""the other guy blinked"" is from Robert McNamara while browbeating the anxious admiral, something to the effect of ""this isn't a blockade, this is the President of the United States communicating with Premier Khruschev."" It is a wonderful line and in an era without instant communication a very important realization.So what was wrong? In a word, Costner. His accent is annoying and his character really superfluous. He regularly talks to the Kennedy brothers as though they were children instead of the most powerful men in the world. A little more deference to authority and a little more respect for their intelligence or else a little more historic background to make us understand that these fantastic brothers were not as smart as their staffer.The military come off as conniving and self serving, but then that is one view of men whose whole job it is to be ready to fight and not appease an enemy. The distrust of Kennedy, especially in light of the Bay of Pigs was probably real, but I would have loved more fiction here, it would have been nice to see Gen Curtis LeMay pinned down for insubordination, but then it never happened and I am the one who likes accuracy, c'est dommage.",,Anonymous,History
America On The Brink!,"Even Kevin Costner affecting the worst New England accent in movie history can't ruin this stunningly written, acted and directed docudrama about the Cuban Missle Crisis in October 1962 when the world for the first time literally stood on the brink of nuclear destruction.One wonders what might have happened if a different kind of man were President at the time....a weaker man who might have led the military run roughshod over him or a ""cowboy hawk"" who believed risking nuclear annihilation a test of macho herosim.JFK (superbly played by Bruce Greenwood) emerges in the film as an intelligent thougtful man faced with an awesome responsibility.Though Coster is top billed, it's Greenwood's sensitive, self effacing performance that is the real center of the film.""Thirteen Days"" takes some harrowing real life events and turns them into a riveting political thriller.Oliver Stone would do well to take a cue from ""Thirteen Days.""",,Anonymous,History
"I believe that the movie' historic facts were dead on, but the movie's plot actors and accents were very frustrating","I believe that the facts of this movie were mostly completely dead on. I wonder, however, about the validity of some of the events, such as the first flight that was shot at, and if the Catain really said that they were just sparrows. Another scene that confused me was the one were they shot flares over the ship and the Secretary took them as arms. Besides those two scenes the rest of the movie's historic facts are dead on(in comparasion to my sources) The acting, however, I think was very mediocker. I think that the accents were way off, and the intensity was way off many times. Although it portrayed the actuall events, it frustrated me to see us ALMOST go to war, several times, and then have nothing happen. It was like a child sticking his hand in his face while saying ""I'm not touching you, I'm not touching you!!!"" However, there was no way to make the movie less frustrating without twisting the actuall events of history. I believe the historic portrayal was wonderful, but the movie frustrating, with over dramatic actors.",,Anonymous,History
Stupid lapses into cheesy sentimentality mar a mostly interesting scenario.,This relatively objective look at the Cuban missile crises is constructed well enough to be intriguing political drama and a fascinating look at alarmist notions and confrontational ethics.  The addition of scenes about Kevin O'Donnell's familial concerns should have been left on the cutting room floor and cheapen the entire flow.  The characterizations/performances range from the sublime (Kennedy/Greenwood) to the ridiculous (O'Donnell/Costner).  Not nearly as tedious as you might expect.,,Anonymous,History
no.... really???,"This movie depicts, in very general terms, the story everyone knows. At times inaccurately. In a film like that, it is good to have  a strong subplot. Just to make things a bit more personal, you know. The way it is, I doubt many people will actually sit at the edge of their chairs (especially given Russia's current state of affairs) biting their nails in suspense. Excepting those who have lived through that historical horror show. Steven Culp is a dead-ringer for Bobby Kennedy, whom he portrays. Bruce Greenwood is unbelievable as JFK. And Kevin Costner is, as always, great as Kevin Costner.Interestingly enough, while at the Soviet Embassy, Costner exchanges words with a woman, who is just as terrified as the Americans. That was a hint on a plot I would care to see. Maybe in the 70's or even 80's, a one-sided view like this, at a crisis of such humongous proportions, would have gone over well. But in 2000, when the enemy doesn't even exist, it's unforgiveable. Of course, the real facts and what actually went on on the Soviet side will probably forever remain a mystery, but who says you can't use your imagination?",,Anonymous,History
Finally a win for Costner,"It's really sad when I expect a certain actor's performance to be bad based on previous movies. Poor Kevin Costner just hasn't had many winners lately with lame movies like ""The Postman"", ""A Perfect World"", ""Waterworld"" and ""Wyatt Earp."" But finally, Kevin has redeemed himself. And, he finally manages to nail down an accent (unlike ""Robin Hood""). Though these events were ten years before my time, it was a fascinating tale of a very nerve-racking fortnight. My parents told me stories of the empty supermarket aisles, hiding under school desks and the bomb shelters, but I never really understood the paranoia until I saw this movie. Now it makes sense. Well filmed and well acted--way to go, Kevin.",,Anonymous,History
A must see,"This is a gripping tale of the days in October of 1962 when we stood on the verge of nuclear war.  The movie was engrossing and scared me more than any horror flick I've seen in my lifetime because I knew the events really happened. I was a teenager when this happened and remember how scared we were but never realized until watching this movie how justified we were in our fear.  The men who played Jack and Robert Kennedy were wonderful in their parts and rather than try to imitate them, they captured their essence. All of the actors in this movie are talented and played their parts exceedingly well.  For those of you who don't like Kevin Costner don't worry about it.  I personally like him although I do agree with those on this board that said he shouldn't try accents; however, as I was saying even if you don't like him, please don't let that stop you from going to see this movie as it has a story that will keep you in your seats and the acting is superb.",,Anonymous,History
"Mildly politicized, but worth watching","I found this to be a very interesting movie.  I watched it with my husband, who is an amateur military historian, and apparently it is historically quite accurate; I learned more about the Cuban Missile Crisis watching this movie than I did in school, that is for certain.A few aspects were annoying -- politics creep in just a wee bit, but not nearly so much as I had thought might be the case.  Kevin Costner's accent was atrocious at times and bearable at others.  Otherwise, the acting is good.It's not a movie I'll rave about, but I'm not sorry I watched it.",,Anonymous,History
Casting change,"In my opinion, this movie looks like it was rewritten after it was green-lit.  I can't help but think that Kevin Costner was originally cast to play President Kennedy but somehow it was decided that he didn't fit the part and it was given to Bruce Greenwood.  Therefore they had to boost the presence of Presidential Aide Kenny O'Donnell (Costner)even though Kennedy was the character holding the story's center of gravity.  I thought this made the movie seem somewhat awkward and forced.",,Anonymous,History
Silly mistakes spoil it,"13 Days is a worthwhile film in many ways.  The acting is very good and the recreation of the period setting is near flawless.  The pace builds very satisfactorily until the last quarter where it loses its way a bit.But what the hell was the boom microphone doing bobbing about at the top of the screen in so many scenes?  Pure amateur hour!On a more serious note the attempt to caricature the US military figures as irresponsible zealots was lazy - easy black and white pap for liberals. Anyone with an ounce of decency knows that the real life villains were the Stalinist butchers in the Kremlin.  Can you imagine a film that portrayed a doveish FDR and Hitler trying to do a deal in the teeth of opposition from McArthur and the SS?  To suggest equivalence between democrats and dictators is morally decadent.The truth is that Kruschev knew exactly what he was doing.  He wanted to get nuclear missiles close to the US and when he was caught doing so (the Soviets were unaware of the potency of the U2 at that time) he decided to test the resolve of JFK.  There is quite a lot of anectdotal evidence that Kennedy would have offered a softer deal to the Soviets but for the opposition of many in Congress like Fulbright (not the US military who had no role in making the big political decisions).However with that health warning out the way this film is worth seeing. It is exciting and, for the most part, realistic.  Some people will regret the syrupy ending with Costner at his worst but on the whole its one of his better performances of recent years.",,Anonymous,History
Kevin's JFK does an average job on the Cuban Missile Crisis,"A reconstruction of the Cuban Missile Crisis focusing on JFK, his advisers and their handling of the events.  In the theme of Apollo 13, dealing with famous historical events in which the outcome is known.The opening credits hold so much promise.  Dramatic footage of nuclear explosions set a mood of apocalyptic dread. However as the film unfolded I was disappointed and bored. The movie seemed to consist of various scenes clumped together without attention to creating a mood.  Fading from black and white to colour and back again could have been used well but became annoying.  JFK was presented as a 2 dimensional character who nervously fumbled through his lines occasionally remembering to add a facial twitch or two.  Kevin Costner should not be allowed to say so many lines. 13 Days seems to be Costner's pet project in which he gets to play a major role in the Cuban Missile Crisis. If the movie had taken a more gritty approach and set a mood of sombre tension through the use of more imaginative camera angles, dialogue and characterisation then it would have been more interesting.  The movie didn't bother either to give any impression of the national mood or the any glimpse into the Russian perspective.All in all: 1 and 1/2 stars.If you like Kevin Costner see ""The Postman."" If you like movies about nuclear warfare watch `Dr Strangelove' or `The Beach'",,Anonymous,History
Tight and gripping drama....but,"Watching this movie about the Cuban missile crisis and the processes of government that could have resulted in a world wide nuclear war, produced a number of mixed reaction in me.Like some other reviewers, I like this movie, but found there were some short comings.Firstly, I was gripped. Obviously no nuclear war was going to happen, but how it would be prevented was what I wanted to find out. The truth of what really happened has only come to light recently so in fact, much of the story is news to most people. The script is tight, the drama enthralling, the acting credible (including Kevin Costner who is a brilliant actor for a limited range of characters and a terrible actor when he goes beyond that).Secondly, I felt the story was too pro the Kennedys. In fact the story was mostly constructed from interviews done with Kenny O'Donnell, the White house aid to the Kennedys.Thirdly, I was torn between the idea of the story being told in a one sided way, which it was, to one which lets you know more about what the Russians and Cubans were thinking and doing. However, the process was justified by time and by representing the experience of the American command. I think a complete story should be the subject of a documentary or a good book, not a movie.Fourth, the direction was a little weak, using black & white worked in concept, but was more or less thrown in randomly, rather than used well. The movie has a tele-movie feel about it, partly because of the characterisations of the Kennedys.Lastly, I want to recommend this movie to everyone. It is well worth watching for its insight behind processes, its overall tension and drama and despite its failings, it is a good movie to sit at home on an evening and watch. It is not pro-American at all. It is not anti-Cuban or anti-Russian, because all we have are the guesses that are being made about what is happening at the time, not historical analysis of the events. Probably the best part of the movie is that it tries not to judge anyone, condemn any bodies actions, just try to show the razor edge which the world worked, while men tried to act in the best way that they could.",,Anonymous,History
The best JFK movie .,"I was 11 Years old in Oct. ,1962.  I remember vividly watching Walter Cronkite with my parents and being very scared each day until the crisis was ended.

But will today's audience get it?,"I was 8 years old when the Missle Crisis prevailed over the nation. The mood of immediate adults and what was on the tube influenced even now my impressions of the time(s). This film, in my opinion, captured that mood/attitude/state. Frankly, I am surprised that the film didn't leave the circuit one week after hitting it. The majority of persons in the showing I saw were my age or older- and I'd be willing to bet that, while each and every one of them are aware this was a actual occurrence under the administration of the last leader to sit in the White House, the primary reason for seeing the film was for a reminder of just that- when the nation had leadership and that same nation relied carte blanche on that guidance.The bulk of the dialog in this film is based on actual transcripts, and it serves well to pace the film. Costner may be THE big name and he does as a good a job as he ever has, but truth be known- his character in the real events had virtually no input or involvement. Here the screenwriter and director take an Oliver Stone approach and effectively combine a lot of other ""players"" words [which is not at all bad filmmaking if done respectfully) and have them being spoken by Costner. No matter- the essence of the events are here, the immediacy and frailty of the players is very apparent and the certainty of just how close we came to the brink will, unless you are simply numb, gather you into the ""action"". I am sure there will be viewers, asking the same thing I disgustingly heard when viewing ""Apollo 13"" for the first time- ""Did this really happen?"" I admit severe bias about JFK and his times- but I can only say that seeing this film for the younger set could allow them to understand greatness of mere humans. And it could be a manual for studying how to deal with the next instance of human threats to the entire planet.",,Anonymous,History

I have decided to quit going to see any movie he has anything to do with because everything he does now is garbage and if it isn't garbage already then he makes it garbage.  He used to be good in films like UNTOUCHABLES and BULL DURHAM. What happened?  THIRTEEN DAYS is a long-winded, talky movie and there's no real suspense since we all know what happened anyway.

"A very engaging,but typically long Costner film","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All CostsPast years have seen Kevin Costner films which have a tendency of being very lengthy (well into the 3 hour stretch)falling into 2 categories :excellent (JFK) or poor (The Postman,apparently).Luckily however,13 Days falls into the before category ,an interesting indictment of one week in America with President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood)in power that nearly resulted in nuclear war destroying the world.While indeed the subject matter is determinently involving,the film is sadly marred by consisting mostly of talk and not a lot of action,which might result in even the most fundemental of film viewers becoming lathargic,especially ,as mentioned before,given the film's length.It's almost a cast iron guarantee that any film top billing Costner will run for over at least 2 hours,without generalising in any way,shape or form.His (Costner's) performance itself seems very revised and calculated,and becomes engaging for it's ultimate campishness if anything.Whether writing, directing and indeed acting ,the man is just theatrical.Roger Donaldson employs heavy but sweeping direction of the movie,giving it a Hunt For Red October feel in it's conveyance.Greenwood's performance as  the most intrigue surrounded American president of all time is also assuredly down to earth.But the most pressing and disturbing issue of the film is kind of unintentional.It's nearly 40 years after the film is set,and nuclear/atomic weapons of mass destruction crafted by the likes of Russia,Cuba and Iraq are still the things posing the biggest threat to our existence.We may already know the outcome of this film,but isn't it more daunting to think of the outcome of the world?****",,Anonymous,History
Very Few Missteps in this Powerful Historical Thriller,"Screenwriters adapting true stories for the screen always need to be careful. Very often the conventions of narrative Hollywood cinema require adjusting the facts to fit into traditional genres and structures, often at the cost of historical fact. At worst you end up with a ragged mess like The Hurricane, a film which refused to be content with a fabulously compelling story and had to tamper with the truth to create easily delineated heroes, villians, and plot points. At best you get All The President's Men, a complex journalistic thriller that you just can't imagine them making today. But getting near that level is Thirteen Days, written by David Self and directed by Roger Donaldson. Based on the thirteen days of the Cuban Missile Crisis, Thirteen Days knows that its story is enough and with the exception of a few moments of saggy sentimentality, the film holds together as a wonderful version of history (though, of course, not a history lesson).Thirteen Days is probably best appreciated by people who know the whole story, but have forgotten it. It may actually be a little too complicated for the entirely unversed to pick up on everything, while scholars may be more prone to pick the facts apart. For people who lived through the Crisis, of students who have adequately studied it, the plot contains dozens of ""Oh Geez, I'd forgotten *that* happened"" moments.Thirteen Days begins with a U2 plane flying over Cuba taking pictures, only to discover that the pictures show Soviet offensive nuclear weapons. For the next two weeks, the world was on the brink of nuclear war as President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), Bobby Kennedy (Steven Culp), and [for purposes of cinema] presidential advisor Ken O'Donnell (Kevin Costner) try to balance politics and history to ""save the world."" Naturally this is a reductive summary. But for the most part what's on screen is what happened, or at least something like what happened.Several critics of the film have complained that it places far too much emphasis on Kenny O'Donnell's role in the Crisis. Since the actor playing O'Donnell is Kevin Costner (easily the film's largest star) and O'Donnell's son Kevin is one of the men behind Beacon Pictures (which produced the film) a lot seems suspect. Historians have argued that O'Donnell is rarely heard on the actual tapes on which the film is based. I can only urge these people to actually watch the movie. O'Donnell is at the center of the piece, but his role is clear that of fly-on-the-wall. He sits in on the important meetings and rarely speaks. Kennedy certainly asks O'Donnell for advice, but it's always in private and it never feels as if O'Donnell has the final word on anything. His part in the affair is probably slightly amplified, but I don't see the harm.Additionally, fans of the military may feel good cause to complain about the film's portrayal of the Joint Chiefs and generals as warmongers who want to bomb Cuba back to the stone age regardless of the consequences. Nothing, I suspect, was quite that black and white. However, with the military still reeling from the Bay of Pigs, I have no doubt that much of what the film depicts is true. It isn't like they invented characters to be bad guys like, say, The Hurricane.David Self's script is mostly wonderfully structured. He was working from a good story, but the film is set up to give nearly every character their moment of triumph, almost like a play. Occasionally there are moments where things become overly cutesy (the generals marching from the oval office muttering, ""Those Kennedys..."" seems pointlessly melodramatic) and sentimental (Costner's moments with his family), but those parts are easy to forgive.In the military and political scenes Roger Donaldson's film craft is generally quite wonderful. The grainy look of the Cuba preparations and the US mobilisation are a great touch (the film is shot by Andrzej Bartkowiak the best cinematographer never to be nominated for an Oscar). Donaldson allows the tension to be undermined in the aforementioned sappy scenes, but he makes sure they don't last very long before rushing back to the war rooms offices.When thinking of performances it must first be admitted that Kevin Costner's Boston accent is horrible and that it takes twenty or thirty minutes to fully ignore it. Once you get beyond that, it's a very good performance and Costner holds the film together with his gravitas.The two men playing the Kennedys, Culp and Greenwood, give effective performances of different types. Culp looks and sounds exactly like Bobby. It's a little scary at times, to be honest. He has the voice and mannerisms perfectly. Greenwood, on the other hand, looks very little like JFK. However, much like Anthony Hopkins's performance as Nixon, Greenwood's work is so super that by the end, you forget what the real Kennedy looked and sounded like and just accept the man on the screen as the real thing. Greenwood (whose performances in Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter were both Oscar worthy) will be a revelation to American audiences who only know him as a hammy bad guy in films like Disturbing Behaviour, Double Jeopardy, and Rules of Engagement. He's far better than that and this film is proof.The rest of the supporting cast is equally wonderfully. Donaldson wisely went against the Oliver Stone routine of casting familiar actors in every role no matter how small. With the possible exception of Dylan Baker, most people won't recognise anybody and thus they won't be distracted.Thirteen Days probably shouldn't be confused with actual historical fact. But it is a well researched, well acted, well directed drama. I'd give it 8.5/10",,Anonymous,History
A test of dialogue writing!,"Writer David Self did himself a favour by not working on this script with anyone else.  As a self written screenplay based on the book The Kennedy Tapes - Inside the White House During the Cuban Missile Crisis by Ernest R. May and Philip D. Zelikow, Self has manufactured a painstakingly difficult script filled with the merry go round of conflict between the U.S. and the USSR in October 1962.  These two nations almost went to war over the Russian's stockpile of nuclear missiles in Cuba and the U.S. stockpile in Turkey.  Both sides are made to look responsible for this conflict.  The snappy direction by Roger Donaldson put me in mind of some of his most tense moments during 1987's No Way Out' which also starred Kevin Costner.  Here, Costner plays Kenny O'Donnell, the President's highest ranking aide.  Bruce Greenwood, a Canadian, and Steven Culp, play John and Robert Kennedy with accents which are mastered beautifully.  This film is never boring.  The frenzy becomes a bit much after the first hour and forty-five minutes and then continues for another forty minutes or so but as a lesson in history, it seems, for a film, pretty authentic to its historical facts.  They really do show how we came within a hair of ending the world before one side backed down.",,Anonymous,History
On the brink of madness,"The film shows how easily human events can get out of control. The theme of the story is that we must not abandon our own judgment in the heat of crisis. The hawks and doves who, only a few years later, would fight a civil war in the US over the mess of Viet Nam are shown here tuning up. Political, diplomatic, and public fields of conflict are portrayed with restrained but excellent performances.We make our problems and we have to be able to solve them or else we will destroy ourselves.

Review,"The film does well in providing entertainment, yet some of the historical aspects of the film may be questionable. Apart from the horrible attempts at the New England accents by Costner and the rest of the actors in the White House, the film does well in humanizing the President and his cabinet. Thirteen Days provides us with the fact that the President of the United States, despite his superiority, had fears and thoughts no different than our own during the Cuban Missile Crisis.The film is extremely detailed, showing the day to day conflicts between the so called Hawks and Doves. The Hawks being those who believed that war was the solution to the Cold War and the Doves being those who believed politics was the method to solve the ongoing pressure between the US and the Soviet Union. It is interesting to note the change of policy during the Cold War administrations and the current administrations, how we have changed from a retaliatory strike policy during the Kennedy administration to a first strike foreign policy in the current.",,Anonymous,History
The Cuban Missle Crisis--- or how we avoided WWIII,"As a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst I have been interested in how this group of national security people actually negotiated with the Soviets in such a way that a nuclear holocaust was prevented.  I had heard there were cool heads and hot heads, hawks and doves battling for their point of view.  Each side thought they were right and had the best interests of the nation at heart.  It could be seen as a 13 day marathon (therapy) in which the group leader, John F. Kennedy, found a way to avoid extreme and dangerous differences, especially with the help of his brother, Robert and a close aid and friend, Ken O'Donnell.  The latter role was taken by Kevin Kostner, and although the excellent movie critic James Berardinelli thought that was a mistake, (they should have focussed more on JFK and Bobby) I thought it useful to have a person without power, but with perspective, that the audience could identify with.  As a result, we had the privilege of being the 'fly-on-the-wall' at secret meetings in which the fate of the world hung in the balance.  It didn't bother me that the story was not a documentary--- these exist and can be used for comparison.13 Days was very well acted, directed, edited and photographed, with ample display of then current military planes, ships and rockets.  The Oval Office was reportedly painstakingly reproduced, as well as actual television news accounts at the time.  And throughout there was a dramatic sprinkling of shots of nuclear bombs going off, a reminder of what was at stake.From this perspective, I can see why the world has avoided a nuclear confrontation from the early 60's till now, almost 40 years later.  As a result we owe the Kennedy brothers and MacNamara much appreciation for protecting us from nuclear disaster.  The film made good use of showing us what was at stake, families and children playing in peace, being prosperous and secure.  It was good to see these men of influence having moral values and caring for their families, despite their many reported personal lapses.You can see why the nation recently gave high approval ratings to Bill Clinton in spite of the Lewinsky scandal.  Like Kennedy before him, his personal hero, Clinton was handsome, articulate, intelligent and charismatic, the ultimate politician.  One can only wonder how Clinton would have dealt with a nuclear showdown.",,Anonymous,History
leaves much to be desired,"overall, thirteen days wasn't bad. it wasn't great. perhaps it was the way the story was portrayed.....i felt that the story went a bit too slow, and some details were left out. an hour into the movie, or a few days in the story, i wondered, where's lyndon johnson? where's the second in command? was he dead during the kennedy administration? surely he wasn't, because he succeeded jfk after his assassination. so i ask again, where was the vice president? did he have no word in the cuban missile crisis and what could've been wwiii? i may be looking too much into the details, but that's just me. i'd recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys a good drama, and there's no doubt in my mind that i'll be seeing this movie again to pore over the details.",,Anonymous,History

What has gotten into you?"" Henry quickly secured the offered beer before something sudden would happen, like a nuclear war or a mood swing. You never knew when Kristls mood would take another turn. Women, so Henry thought, were highly unpredictable.. especially to men.."" I really liked the movie. It was a good political thriller. Strange actually, considering that I knew what was going to happen: it still had me sitting on the edge. I liked it that they never showed what the other people were thinking or doing: the Soviets, the Cubans, even their own people: the US military. And although I had to get adjust for a moment, it was a good thing that Kevin Costner did not play the president but his adviser. It sort of made it more human. """"Yeah, funny... Our military was as much to be trusted as not. I can imagine that some people will not like this image of some military dudes steering towards a nuclear war. Perhaps somewhat unfair too? The Russians were the bad guys, no?"" Henry mused. He savored his beer.""Soviets. Not Russians. Let's call them Soviets. And the answer: maybe.. maybe.. at least they were unknown baddies.. That makes the movie unnerving. You have no idea what they are thinking. Just like the president and his staff must have been experiencing. What are they up to? How far will they go?""""And what if they don't stop?""""Yeah. How did you like the intro.. how it flows from the introduction into the movie.

Henry made a vague gesture., spilling some beer.""No damsels in tight suits shooting up legions of evil guys?"" Kristl smiled.""Yeah., no action.. yet the movie scares the hell out of you. They were so hovering on the brink of a nuclear war. If the Russians had not given in.. If they had not turned those ships around.."" Henry made a sudden gesture with his hands making him spill beer all around, ""BOOM!""""That is true.. but than we never know if president Kennedy would have backed down himself. Or that they would have ignored the ships being there. This is of course another thing. That this issue got to be a big issue was because the US made it into a one. They were prepared to go to war over nuclear missiles stationed on Cuba not because it meant that the US could now be nuked -the Soviets could do that already- but because the US could be nuked far quicker than before. Not hours.. but minutes. It sort of evened the score in their opinion because that same threat hung over the heads over everyone else. It sort of gives you pause to think why this thing was played up. Why was Kennedy prepared to let it get this far?""""Well. In the end the Russians backed down.. so the US won."" Henry said.""Won?"" Kristls face became thoughtful, ""Won. Maybe. But at that point in time I wonder.. was it really necessary to drag the world towards a nuclear war over some missiles placed on Cuba? I mean really.. the Soviets could already bomb the US back into the stone age so placing missiles on Cuba was not actually changing the balance in the world by much. Maybe it was more to save the presidents prestige than anything else. Which makes you wonder... and scared. """"Let's fret not over things that are in the past.

Engrossing,"A docudrama about the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962. This could have been a boring history lesson but it's anything but that. The film moves quickly despite its length (135 minutes). All the characters are introduced with subtitles which helps immensely in understanding who they are and their perspective in the crisis. The direction is quick and assured and the music score loud and thrilling. With one exception, all the acting is great. Bruce Greenwood as JFK and Robert Culp as Robert Kennedy are especially fine. They aren't dead ringers for the Kennedys but get the accents and portrayals down perfect. The only bad performance is by Kevin Costner--his accent is way off (I was born and raised in MA, so trust me) and he just gives a dull, by-the-numbers performance. Still, everything surrounding him is great so he doesn't really hurt the film. Well worth seeing. Also, it's frightening to realize how close we came to nuclear war.",,Anonymous,History
This is a great movie for teaching the Cuban Missile Crisis,I am a teacher of 8th grade students. I think this movie could be a great teaching tool to help our young people understand some of the problems our country and its leaders have faced.  My only problem with the movie is some of the language.  Is there any way that movie producers could make already dubbed so that these great films could be more effectively used in the classroom?,,Anonymous,History
"Impressive history, just a tad too much Hollywood drama","My history prof in high-school told us that during the missile crisis, he and his college friends were preparing for a nuclear war between the US and Russia.  I can't imagine that now: even though we countries all around have nuclear capabilities, and the US military stubbornly refuses to sign the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty, being so eager to develop ""the next generation"" of nuclear weapons,(one generation I think we can all agree requires an immediate abortion.) Roger Donaldson's Thirteen Days has definite flaws-  First, he should have killed the Costner family angle: Costner's character could have served as an illustrative link to the popular reaction to the crisis.  The moment he sees the line-up for confessions holds greater impact than any family scene.  2.  The music by Trevor Jones (composer of the Last of the Mohicans) at first brings up the tension, but after an hour or so, you're bored by its constant reminder of the importance of events.  With more silence or a gradual build-up, the score could have been more effective.  3.  There's no clear need for those b&w sequences- it really didn't serve a purpose. 4.What the film really needs at the end is a summation of where the central characters ended up- put a photo of the actor and real-life character up with a post-crisis bio.  (Hell, McNamara got us into Vietnam!) I applaud Thirteen Days because it treats history as a subject for drama, realizing that truth is stranger than fiction.  It also is a film that celebrates victory in peace not battles.  I think we'll soon be seeing the exact opposite with Pearl Harbor, which I fear will ignore our oppressive decision to ship Japanese Americans into concentration camps during the war.Thirteen Days presents JFK and RFK as regular men in extreme circumstances, heroes only by way of heroic decision-making.  The supporting cast perform very credibly, though this is easier since the majority of audiences won't remember McNamara, Adlai Stevenson, Acheson, or LeMay. Regardless, the B&W TV broadcasts of JFK and Stevenson are very effective: people in my audience were applauding when Adlai said, ""I am prepared to wait for my answer until hell freezes over!""Likewise, Donaldson brings great tension to the air&sea military sequences, combining newsreels, computer graphics, and action scenes.  For a film that visually often seemed to have a TV-movie feel, the U2 flights and Pearce conflicts rocked.  For a moment when McNamara (excellent acting) went against the Admiral on the blockade decisions, I felt like I was watching Hunt For Red October. I wonder if that's a problem of this film: this unique historical moment feels here like a hodgepodge of other movies: shades of Independence Day, (the coming attack, national speech, and preparation), Apollo 13 (how can we negotiate the solution to this crisis?), and JFK (the conspiracy of the military against the lone peaceful warrior.)  Admittedly, when you give a more Hollywood feel to history, you might add to the overall resonance, but do you lose credibility in exchange?I'd nominate David Self for best Adapted Screenplay, taking the White House tapes and making for totally engrossing dialogues.  The film effectively impresses the importance of the decisions and influence of every man in the Oval Office those thirteen days.  Hopefully, our new president would also do more than nod to the judgment of Old Guard military solutions and look to his own good will, if faced with such a crisis in the years to come.  ***",,Anonymous,History
A fine re-telling of one of our finest hours.,"Told with a minimum of fluff ( and an odd penchant for crawling in and out of black & white for no apparent reason ), this film chronicles very well the events of the ""Cuban Missile Crisis"" of 1962.  All the primary participants of our government's reaction to - and handling of - this crisis are well represented ( Jackie & Lyndon had little to do with this - Jackie being away from Washington for much of the two weeks of these events, and Johnson was never a major confidante of John or Bobby Kennedy ).  I would recommend anyone interested in this subject should also see ""The Missiles of October"" for a slightly different perspective.",,Anonymous,History
Good but one-sided view of the Cuban Missile Crisis and its handling.,"""Thirteen Days"" begins with the discovery of long-range nuclear missile sites being placed in Cuba by Soviet forces in the 1960's. Obviously a terrifying discovery, these missiles could hit every major city in the continental US except Seattle, this information is immediately relayed to President John Frederick Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood) and his Cabinet. From here on out we get about an hour and a half of the insides of the White House and the decisions taken to alleviate what is known as the closest the world has come to all out nuclear war.However, not once in the entire 145 minute runtime of ""Thirteen Days"" do we get the Soviet perspective, or even a clue as to what their intentions or ideas were for placing thes missiles in such close to proximity to the US. Also, the film lacks the historical background, there is only a brief mention of the fiasco at the Bay of Pigs, that is necessary to understand why the USSR would place these weapons in Cuba, something that in the movie seems almost like a declaration of nuclear war. Historically this is untrue, because the crisis only came about because the USSR believed that they had to protect Cuba which seemed to be close to an invasion from the US, which had been practicing invasion forces as a show of strength on islands in the Caribbean. Although very good at portraying JFK and his cabinet as the hero's of this crisis, it puts the Soviet government, particularly Premier Kruschev in a very poor light, making him seem like a deranged war-crazy lunatic.This is a well-made film, although I do agree with previous comments that the black and white seens were unnecessary and at times confusing, and that the New England accents were overdone and cheesy. I would recommend this film to anyone who can keep an open mind about the Cuban Missile Crisis and see that it wasn't just the Americans who were heroes and that didn't want a world-consuming nuclear war.",,Anonymous,History
Costner is back,"This time ten years ago, Kevin Costner was the hottest kid on the block. A life-changing performance in Dancing With Wolves, and a worldwide blockbuster in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves had thrust him to the top of director's most wanted lists.What goes up must come down though, and Costner did- with a bump. High-profile duds including Waterworld and The Postman had made him a laughing stock in some Hollywood quarters and it seemed that the once golden boy was dead and buried. Despite this, Costner has been handed a classic opportunity to restore his lagging reputation with his latest film Thirteen Days.Based on real events, he stars as Kenny O'Donnell, political advisor to President John F. Kennedy (Greenwood) and his brother Bobby (Culp). It is October 1962 and the USSR have placed atomic weapons in Cuba, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war and possible Armageddon. Never have so many lives rested on the shoulders of one man as the president's actions dictate war or peace.Costner excels as O'Donnell, as does Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy, but the best performance of them all comes from Bruce Greenwood as the troubled and emotionally-torn president. The chemistry between the trio is exquisite and brings real feeling to characters whose real life stories are more the tales of comic books.The archive footage is perfectly entwined into the plot and the air-force and navy scenes are excellently filmed. Despite a running time of over two and a half hours, as with any good movie, the story doesn't drag at all: there is no need for complex sub-plots or love-twists as Thirteen Days relies on a story so strong that it's difficult to believe it's based on true events.There are no dud-performances as the acting is strong from start to finish and the message is strong and clear that we should learn from our mistakes in the past and never forget just how close we came to annihilating ourselves. And if you're looking for a more contemporary Hollywood message, how about this: Kevin Costner is back.8/10",,Anonymous,History
Scary movie of a scary time,"I was 14 at the time of the Cuba missile crisis of October 1962. I was scared at the time and have seen no reason not to have been as a result of watching several subsequent documentaries and re-enactments of those incredibly dramatic 13 days. This 2000 movie of that historic period is directed by Roger Donaldson and often looks like a drama-documentary, a style deliberately evoked by occasional use of black and white, but underlines the sense of drama by using a few scenes of what might have been as missiles are launched.The strengths of the film are its careful use of detailed records of the key meetings and conversations plus the use of a range of actors who look and sound like President John F Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood), his Attorney General Brother Robert F Kennedy (Steven Culp), Defense Secretary Robert McNamara, Air Force General Curis Lemay and others. The weakness is the casting of Kevin Costner as Kenny O'Donnell, Special Assistant to the President, through whose eyes we see the events. Our familiarity with Costner as an actor and the use of O'Donnell for the perspective both serve to unbalance what should have been an unremitting focus on the President himself.Having said that, what the film does really well - in total contrast to so many political movies - is to demonstrate how difficult and complex is the decision-making process, especially when one has imperfect information, conflicting signals, and rival factions (which frankly is usually the case).",,Anonymous,History
blown away,"I am Hungarian, and went to see this movie with my two roommates, a French and an English citizen. All three of us had a very strong and very positive reaction. Thirteen Days is one of  the best movies that came out of Hollywood in the past few years. It is not sappy, it is not overly patriotic and doesn't try to teach you an obvious lesson. It simply grabs you by the throat and does not let you go for 2 1/2 hours. A brilliantly made and truly fascinating movie, highly recommended to anyone.",,Anonymous,History
Edge of Your Seat,"Even though I remember the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis and the subsequent outcome, this film is definately edge of your seat suspense. It was like reliving the events all over again.  It was a time when all of us weren't sure if we were going to see the next day and the scenes of school children being told to hide under their desks and supermarket shelves being cleaned out brought back chilling memories.  But the real crux of this film was to portray the tensions being played out in the Whitehouse and the Pentagon.  Very good and highly recommended.",,Anonymous,History
or thirteen feet over Cuba,"The low-level reconnaisance flight over a missle position in Cuba, alone, was worth the price of admission.  Cosner's New England accent was unnecessarily distracting.  However, the movie was entertaining and a little broader than ""Missles of October"".",,Anonymous,History
"Lacked interest, personality...","This film is far from powerful or even interesting; at its best it was an ineffectual history lesson.  The first thing that annoyed me was how noticeable it was that Kevin Costner's accent was unnatural and somewhat uncomfortable.  None of the characters are developed very well, which I suppose that is to be expected from a non-fictional film, but that should have been made up for with exceptional acting, which was also absent, with the exception of Steven Culp and Dylan Baker at some points.  If you did not live through this event, there is little that may be found appealing to you. I gave this film a six out of ten.",,Anonymous,History
Actually Starring a Kennedy,"I thought that it was interesting that this movie actually starred a real life Kennedy.  Christopher Lawford (Commander William B. Ecker) is the son of Peter and Pat (Kennedy) Lawford, and nephew to JFK and RFK.Other than that, I really enjoyed this movie...then again I am a political science major focusing on International Relations.",,Anonymous,History
My vote reflects the importance of the topic and film depiction,"Aside from Kevin Costners' poor New England accent this film is golden. If Costner had played it straight I'd have preferred it but with that said the subject is entirely riveting. Rarely is the outcome of the story known so well beforehand and yet the movie keeps you on the edge all the way through. Since most American's these days learn their history from movies I am glad this one is very accurate.The historical events are almost on target to a tee. The subjective license has to do with the actual influences and dialogue between JFK, RFK, the Joint Chiefs, and JFK's chief advisors of which Costner plays the key man, Kenny O'Donnell.I saw this movie with my mom and niece and it was great because we had my mom(who was in her late 30's in '62, I was 8 yrs. old and my niece had not yet been born. Afterward we were able to discuss the events as they were shown in the movie and recall and reflect the times for my niece who, now at 27 was so moved by the closeness we came to an all out war with the Soviet Union.I would highly recommend this movie, especially for the generation born after 1965. It will reflect the tenuous times we lived in during the height of the Cold War.",,Anonymous,History
I loved it!,"I'm by no means a movie critic, I just know what I like. I thought the characters were very believable (except I had a hard time with Kevin's Mass. accent), and I REALLY enjoyed Bruce Greenwoods's performance, definitely award material as I saw it. I did note that there was one character in the film that I thought bore a stiking resemblance to Peter Lawford, so when I looked up his character's name on this website, I was amazed to learn that it was his son (appropriate, since he is a Kennedy.) This is a movie I would see over again.",,Anonymous,History
"Great Performances, Terrible Accents","Thirteen Days really puts into perspective how close we came to nuclear war and the destruction of millions of people (everyone in the U.S. except Seattle, Washington). It gives a dynamic example of the horror we faced during the Cuban Missile Crisis and the strong, resilient character that JFK and his Cabinet possessed. Bruce Greenword (JFK) and Steven Culp (Robert Kennedy) give brilliant performances as Kennedy brothers encompassing all the confidence and stability they exuded while in power. Kevin Costner, however, delivers a forgettable portrayal as Kenny O'Donnell with quite possibly the worst Boston accent I've ever heard. His character is the Special Assistant to the President and was never actually a real person. He acts as the link that ties everything together. Thirteen Days takes you step by step in the decision making process concerning what to do with Cuba and the threat they posed. Soviets had been secretly stashing missiles in Cuba and the U.S. needed a resolution to prevent them from being set off. The real debate throughout the movie was which method to use: Airstrike, Blockade(Quarantine), or Negotiations. The movie does have its embellishments in order to heighten the suspense but what movie doesn't thats based on true events. The movie gives off a sense of patriotism as the country stands together in a time of imminent destruction. They should have showed more vantage points from the Soviets and Cuba, but instead, they only focused on American perspective. It was a rough time for citizens of the United States and knowing that any day could begin with nuclear attack, the government kept its cool and progressed. I recommend this movie to anyone interested in the Cuban Missile Crisis, aside from the lackluster performance of Costner and the cheesy black and white scenes, for its excellent depiction of America as a strong-willed nation in a time of this urgency and magnitude.",,Anonymous,History
