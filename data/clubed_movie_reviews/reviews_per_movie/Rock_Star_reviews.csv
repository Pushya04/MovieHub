Music really saves it,"As a huge fan of 80s Hard Rock, I was really looking forward to seeing Rock Star. As the movie started I was more than satisfied. A lot of the early scenes were funny and entertaining. The concert scenes made me feel like I was actually there. One major compliment I give this movie is that they made the songs from the fictional band STEEL DRAGON sound realistic for the time period the movie is in. If I didn't know better, I could've been fooled into thinking Steel Dragon was a real band, and all their songs actually were made in the mid 80s. The underdog portion of the story may not be original, but it still works none the less. And by the time Wahlberg's character was in his first concert with the band, I really thought Rock Star could be one of the coolest movies of the year.But at about the halfway point, I was lost. The second half of this movie could've really used a lot of work on the script. I say that the second half of the script needed work, but what I should say is the second half of the movie actually could've used a script, period. The second half is held together by some predictable sequences, all telling the story of a guy indulging in the rock star life, which we've all heard and seen a thousand times. There were very few moments that actually were used to progress the story.But I don't want to give the impression that Rock Star was no good. Although some of the movie didn't work, I still had a blast watching it. The music is what really holds it together. Both the original songs written for the film (Steel Dragon), and the background songs used. It's not often that you can hear bands like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, Kiss, and Motley Crue used in a movie. And like I said before, the concert scenes are awesome.So for people who love great 80s Rock, this movie will be a lot of fun.Rock Star is an average movie, with an above average soundtrack. Not a perfect film, but it provides enough entertainment for your money.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Comic book cynicism,"Surprisingly well-acted, well-written movie about hard rockin'-but-decent young man getting that much-hoped-for ticket to stardom: his favorite heavy metal band wants him to replace their lead singer. Not far-fetched, the film tries keeping things in perspective and doesn't go over-the-top; it certainly makes you think twice about those lingering adolescent fantasies about being in the music business. But the script, despite solid dialogue, follows a tried-and-true, formulaic pattern, and gets bogged down by its own clichés in the final act. I enjoyed it much more than the sugary fluffball ""Almost Famous"". It has a nice, bitter edge to go with its heavy metal decadence, but a stronger finish might've made it more memorable. **1/2 from ****",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"We've seen this all before, but the film still captures an honest and insightful attitude. *** (out of four)","ROCK STAR / (2001) *** (out of four)By Blake French:""Rock Star"" is the story of a nobody who becomes propelled into fame, only to realize living his dream is not the way he imagined it. We have seen all this before (in better movies), but this human story does capture the world of rock and roll with a brutally honest and insightful edge. It garners a recommendation because of its visualization of the atmosphere. The script, by ""Crazy/Beautiful"" director John Stockwell, portrays the hard-core universe with memorable images-it doesn't explain what it is about, it shows us.""Rock Star,"" originally titled ""Metal God,"" stars Mark Wahlberg as Chris ""Izzy"" Cole, a Pittsburgh office supplies salesperson who dreams of becoming Bobby Beers, the fiery lead singer for the heavy metal rock group, Steel Dragon. Although Chris already sings for his own tribute rock group called Blood Pollution, instead of writing his own songs, he insists on performing only those by Steel Dragon, and only in the exact way they perform them. His group becomes irritated with Chris' obsessions and gives him the boot.This devastates Chris, as well as his supportive parents and faithful girlfriend, Emily (Jennifer Aniston from TV's ""Friends""). He then receives a phone call. It's the Steel Dragon band. They have seen Chris' tapes and want him to replace the recently fired lead singer. In an instant, Chris rockets into the dizzying world of sudden stardom-from the biggest rock fan to the biggest rock star. Unfortunately, it's not as rewarding as he expected.A true story inspired the ""Rock Star"" concept. An Ohio supply salesman, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, really did replace Rob Halford, the lead singer in Judas Priest, after initially singing for a tribute band. The rest of the film is probably fiction, although most of what happens must represent the experiences of many other bands. The film details the various ordeals of being a rock star. It explores the aspects of touring, personality differences, the danger of drug abuse and violence, struggling relationships, sexual freedom, dishonesty, and the extreme measures of the producers all to please the fans and keep popularity high.I have seen all of Mark Wahlberg's movies, and this is the first that has earned my affection. Wahlberg, a former singer/model, has made movies like ""Fear,"" ""Boogie Nights"" ""Three Kings,"" and most recently Tim Burton's lacking remake ""Planet of the Apes."" I am starting to admire the young actor more and more. Although he has not performed in many successful films, he has taken many chances, and done a variety of roles. ""Rock Star"" is his best film to date. I can't think of many actors who could have convincingly portrayed Chris Cole's struggles and aspirations. Wahlberg truly makes ""Rock Star"" rock.Jennifer Aniston lights up the screen as well. She creates a chemistry-rich relationship with Chris that induces audience participation. It's tragic of what happens to their relationship. We care about these characters a great deal.During the film concert scenes, director Stephen Herek (who also directed ""Holy Man"" and the live action version of ""101 Dalmatians"") creates a gripping atmosphere. He captures the scenes with an intense urgency, and a raw, unmistakable energy. The musical numbers provide the film with the best, most involving scenes.Unfortunately Herek cannot sustain the energy and zest throughout. At the three-quarters mark, he looses the spark as the movie becomes dull and unpleasant. I understand where the story needs to go in order to portray the negative side of fame, but this movie loses everything it previously had going for it. In ""Almost Famous,"" a much better film about rock and roll, there is a certain amount of interest and life in even the most sorrowful scenes. Here, it feels as if the filmmakers lose their passion.The message comes a bit too late and suddenly in the story. The film turns into a morality tale that wants to provide us with a sappy destination. The filmmakers might as well stop everything, appear on screen and say: ""now audience, the moral of the story is"" We understand the theme, but it's too instantaneous. The personal discovery for Chris' must be gradual.Fortunately, all of this happens in the last twenty-five minutes of the film, hardly enough to completely destroy an entire eighty-five minutes of a reasonably good feature. ""Rock Star"" is not a great movie-see ""Almost Famous"" if you want a remarkable film about rock and roll-but for Marky Mark, it's a turning point in his career.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
High Entertainment Value Compensates for Plot Problems,"I've been looking forward to the release of this movie since I first heard the concept two years ago, and I was not disappointed.  I won't bother summarizing the story since everyone else has, but I will say that it was just plain entertaining throughout.  The performances were great, as was the music, and the main characters were likeable.My only complaints are: (1) the story was definitely lacking; the movie wrapped up very abruptly- in fact the writing became pretty lax in the second half, as though the writers weren't sure what to do with the plot. Since the plot wasn't nearly as important as the music and the action, this didn't really affect the entertainment value of the film, so this is not as major a complaint as it would seem.(2) This is really nitpicky, but the music that the characters in the movie were listening to was sometimes dated after 1985, when the movie was set. INXS' Devil Inside was from 1987 and AC/DC's Are You Ready was from 1990, among other mistakes.  This bothers me a bit, since they obviously went to lengths to make a good period piece, they could have checked the copyright date on these songs to make sure they were 1985 or earlier.  Again, not a big deal.Oh, I thought of something else that was strange.  The Steel Dragon band members were supposed to be English, but for some reason Dokken bassist Jeff Pilson and Ozzy guitarist Zakk Wylde played band members, and they each had a couple of speaking lines in AMERICAN accents.  That was kind of lazy also, but it was still cool to see actual musicians playing musicians, so I will forgive that as well.I could probably nitpick all day, but I don't want to give the impression that this wasn't a super entertaining movie.  I will probably buy the DVD when it comes out, and I will certainly buy the soundtrack CD simply for the six Steel Dragon songs (some of which were sung by the singer from the band Steelheart, if you remember them!).  The highlight of the film was possibly a great outtake where Mark Wahlberg is lipsynching to a rock song on stage and suddenly someone plays ""Good Vibrations"" by Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch.  The surprised look of Mark's face is priceless.  Classic rock and roll flick! Score: 8/10 due to extreme entertainment",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock Star: I should have liked this more,"Rock Star tells the story of the lead singer of a tribute band who get's to live out his dreams on a much grander stage. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Timothy Spall and Timthy Olyphant it certainly doesn't lack star power.As you'd imagine being a movie about classic/glam rock the soundtrack is fantastic, right up there among the best of them though shatter any illusions you may have that it was Wahlberg singing.It's big, it's stylish and to my knowledge it's pretty damn accurate so why am I not rating this higher? I like the cast, I'm an old school rocker myself and on paper this should be a guaranteed tick in the win column from me.The construction of a movie is simple, you need a beginning a middle and an end and Rock Star has that but in a rather disjointed way. The films construction is my biggest grip, it comes across more like a Behind the Music episode than an actual movie. The protagonist walks away having learned several life lessons but the viewer (Or rather in this viewers case) it felt more empty than it should have.Rock Star is an interesting enough look at a subject rarely touched upon by the mainstream Hollywood movie industry but perhaps needed an additional 30+ minute to really flesh it out.The Good:Great castAwesome soundtrackSome brilliant visualsFirst movie ever to make Timothy Spall a successful ""Good guy""The Bad:Olyphant feels wastedOddly builtI struggled to feel for our leadsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Jennifer Aniston holds the secret of eternal youthThey could/should have found Wahlberg a better wigBallet is where rock stars go to die",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock N' Roll with a side order of excess,"Where have all the rock stars gone?  The bubble gum pop bands with their virginal image and the hip hopping wannabe baddies bore me.  Where's the flash and excess of groups like Led Zeppelin, or the old Motley Crue?  These were the hard rocking, and even harder partying bands who brought the sex and drugs to rock n' roll.  Whether trashing hotel rooms, engaging in debauchery that would make Caligula blush, or caught up in a deluge of chemicals and booze, there were no half measures.  Women wanted them and men wanted to be them.  Sometimes, life is good.Life as a photocopier repairperson is less than riveting.  For Chris Cole the only way to cope with the daily tedium of toner and paper jams is in his alternate guise as the lead singer in a ""Steel Dragon"" tribute band.  Chris acts, dresses and sounds like his idol, hoping beyond all reason that one day he will join his idols.  Lucky for him, rock and roll is a fickle business.As anyone who follows heavy metal (or reads previews) knows, ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the true story of salesman-turned-heavy-metal-frontman Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, who was tapped to fill in as lead singer for Judas Priest when Rob Halford left the band.  However, the similarities end there - when Judas Priest pressed for increased creative control over the project, the producers opted to distance themselves from the band and change the story and the exploits of  ""Steel Dragon"" are a composite of several apocryphal rock legends.With strong performances in such films as ""Three Kings"" and ""The Perfect Storm"" Mark Wahlberg has proven that he is more than a living underwear mannequin.     Wahlberg brings the same combination of innocence and wide-eyed wonderment to Chris that he displayed in ""Boogie Nights"" (without displaying much else).  These qualities keep Chris' transformation from nobody to rock god from becoming a ridiculous parody. Keeping him grounded is Jennifer Aniston as his girlfriend/manager, the one person who realizes his talents and for once Aniston breaks free of Rachel, and delivers a decent performance.  The supporting cast, drawn from real rockers and solid character actors, gel well onscreen. Overall, the story is well paced, light-hearted, the soundtrack is great  (I felt my head moving back and forth more than once) and you actually buy the group as a real band.  Definitely worth the price of admission, and remember not to leave before the outtakes are finished.",,Anonymous,Music
Stand up and Shoooooooooooooooouuuuuuuuuuutttttttt!!!!!!!!,"I must admit I wasn't expecting much on this movie. I was surprised  I truly enjoyed it as much as I did.  The script wasn't oscar material, but it wasn't horrible either.  The acting was great by Mark Wahlberg.  Jennifer Aniston  had a great supporting role, and looked lovely as ever.  What made this movie for me was the music.  If you do not like 80's glam metal or hair bands, then you probably wont like this movie.  Its all about being a rockstar.  Some cliche's were present, but didn't bring down the movie at all.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes rock and roll and remember to Stand up and Shout!!! 8 of 10 for great acting and awesome music.Jason",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"No real surprises, but a solid presentation.","Nothing really unpredictable in this movie, but a solid flick in all respects.  Everything from acting to cinematography was solid.  Not a perfectly linear plot line, but there wasn't anything you couldn't see coming.  Perhaps a tad melodramatic at points, but again, a fairly decent movie none the less.  Definitely worth checking out.  If in doubt of what film to rent over the weekend, give this a go.

Simplistic and Enjoyable. Prepare to Rock Out!,"ROCK STAR is a well-told Hollywood-style rendition of the tale based on fact actually on how Ripper became Rob Halford's replacement for Judas Priest. Mark Wahlberg poured on his likable boy-ish charm and performed with believable admirably, something he has been known to do since the release of BOOGIE NIGHTS.Stephen Herek, no stranger to musically-themed movies, takes the audience through the wonders of the breakneck lifestyle of an extinct species, the Hair-Metal Rock God. Wahlberg's ""Izzy"" acts as the film's host plays the everyman who gets to see his wish come true. His likable character quickly wins over the heart of the viewer, who wants to see him succeed and gets the chance to give him the Metal ""goat horn"" hand-sign several times over.The only real complaint with the story is that the supporting cast, namely the other members of the band, were not fleshed out, or even introduced, properly. More interaction with these life-long Rock musicians would have amplified and solidified Izzy's new surroundings.Naturally, ROCK STAR is filled with great music. Rabin's score, the Steel Dragon's original work and plenty of 80's-style Metal hits makes this soundtrack a must-have! Let's all hope that films like ROCK STAR not only give a credibility to a style of music that helped define a generation but also spark a very-needed revival.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting Judas Priest 'insights'!,"This movie was originally supposed to be about Judas Priest and Ripper Owens' climb to be lead singer. The various lawyers got involved, and all the direct references were deleted, but although, 'The names have been changed...' this movie is still about that!I think it's interesting seeing some of the inner workings of Judas Priest, and if you are a fan of the band, or even of the genre, you will enjoy it. Of course, it's NOT perfect, it's the 'Hollywood' version of metal and Rock and Roll lifestyle.......rent it, buy it, get a few cold ones out of the fridge, and pop it in the player...enjoy!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
The Story of Journey?,"Lead singer of a tribute band (Marky Mark) becomes lead singer of the real band he idolizes.So, I see comments saying this is another movie Jennifer Aniston ruined. Well, that is half true. She definitely makes it worse and every scene she is in amounts to a steaming pile of doo. Even her voice is grating and it is hard to take her seriously.But the movie would have stunk either way. It has a good idea, sort of, especially since this really happened (to Journey). But it is not funny enough to be a comedy or serious enough to be a drama. It just sort of... is. It would have been significantly better if it had a little more humor in it and could have been passed off as a mockumentary. I mean, yeah, we already have ""Spinal Tap"", but it wouldn't have to be that silly.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"A ""Nice"" Movie","Rock Star is a ""nice"" movie.  Everyone is nice.  Even the guys who aren't supposed to be nice, really are nice.  Chris is a nice guy, who learns a lesson in life.  He goes back to his girlfriend Emily, who is also nice.It's a good movie, despite all the niceness.  Maybe I'm just used to all the angst of the X Gen music.  In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believable.Mark Wahlberg's acting is quite good.  Jennifer Aniston played her role well, but it was uncomplicated.  She was a nice girl.Go see it.  If you have ever been to a rock concert or seen Spinal Tap, go see it.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting beginning and a dull ending,"As the storyline of this movie is based on Judas Priest, my favourite band, I had to watch it. I had really high hopes for it. Did it meet my expectations? Unfortunately no.It starts off really well. A kid with lots of talent, whose dream is to be in his favourite band. His cover band gets attention by the his heroes and he is recruited as a replacement for their vocalist. Once in the band, he quickly gains fame and fandom and is loved by many. However, he also discovers the unhealthy ways of rock stars, including lots of partying, alcohol, drugs, random sex etc. His ideas and input are also rejected by the other band members. All this is portrayed quite well and the actors are really good at what they do (except Anniston perhaps, whose character I thought was mostly quite unnecessary and pointless).But the ending does not come together well at all. It's pretty unrealistic and very predictable. I expected it to be something really awesome as most of the movie was quite well thought out. I'm not going to spoil the ending, but I think it would've been way better if he quit the band and joined/made a different hard rock/metal band where he could do whatever he wanted and avoid all the negative aspects of a rock star life and thus set a good example for future rock stars. Hey, look! I came up with a better ending already! Seriously, this movie could've been a masterpiece if it wasn't for the stupid ending.Overall, I think this is a movie worth checking out if you like movies about the rock star business. Just don't expect too much and end up bitterly disappointed like I did",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Zakk Wylde!! :),"I have watched this movie three times in total, however the first two times was when it first came out and I had never really listened to metal before, yet I still loved the movie. I am now obsessed with Zakk Wylde and BLS and when I found out that he was in this movie I nearly passed out!! He amazes me...his voice, lyrics, his ability to play guitar. Not to mention the tight outfits they had him in :) I was upset with the little attention he received for doing this movie, especially since he helped write some of the original songs and re-worked the copied songs. However, the few lines that he had were quite funny.By the way, I'm a gal, not a gay guy praising Zakk for the tight outfits in the movie, haha.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Not great but surprisingly good,"This is a bit of a Cinderella story about a wannabe rock star who makes the grade and subsequently brings his girlfriend/manager (Aniston) into the world of the whole rock scene with him. The deeper he gets into it the more troubled their relationship becomes and after a while even the good times don't seem so good to him.I suppose it is a little contrived and the second half doesn't have the freshness and ""what will happen next"" anticipation of the first part but nevertheless it's a decent watch.This was the first role I'd seen Jennifer Aniston in other than as Rachel in ""Friends"" and it opened my eyes to the fact that she really is a very good actress. I've seen her in other films since such as ""The Good Girl"" and she is definitely far more than just a pretty face.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Be Careful What You Wish For,"Mark Walhberg in a great role, idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs, imitating him to perfection, and dressing like him.  When the opportunity comes for him to take over his ""idol's"" role in the band, he jumps at the opportunity.  However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be... and relationships can change ....  This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it.  Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads, Mark Walhberg and Jennifer Aniston.  It did make me feel sad, especially when Emily, (Jennifer Aniston), met up with Chris in Seattle and saw the depths to what he had sunk.  If anybody ever dreamed of being a rock star or a groupie they should watch this movie to see that the lifestyle, although glamourous for a while, is very lonely and ultimately not what you may want.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Clichéd but highly watchable,"Look, if you come across a rock movie and particularly a fictional rock movie you really do know what to expect and on that level this film does not disappoint. Without seeing it I could have approximately predicted the storyline and no doubt you could too. The rock stars life style unpredictably stylised, the love interest threaded through the heart of the film, the body surfing, the rock star language - its all there in bucket loads. Having said all that, this is a highly watchable film in no small amount due to the performances of Jennifer Anniston and Mark Wahlberg. Both these actors have a screen presence that holds your gaze. Don't expect too much from this film and you'll enjoy the ride - give it a go.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Marky Mark and the Metal Bunch!,"Being a metal head myself (though I like other music genres too)I'm not going to review the production qualities of this movie. No, I'm going to go higher and to speak my mind about the horrible facts who makes this to be one of the worst insults to whatever heavy metal have inspired in its more than 40 years of life.1. The title. If the plot of the film consists in the story of a METAL fan singer, who sings in a METAL band who pays tribute to another METAL band called Steel Dragon, and one day he's giving the opportunity to front the latter band, why on earth have this movie been called ""Rock Star""?. Rock stars are Mick Jagger, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, and they are not that metal (at all!). 2. The music. Is Bon Jovi metal?, no. Is INXS metal?, no. Enough said. 3. The lead actress. When you know beforehand, that the movie is going to portrait 80's metal life style, one with even a certain amount of knowledge about that era could foresee that the lead female actress is going to be someone named Doro Pesch (Warlock's singer) or even Lita Ford. Nop, here we have Rachel from that annoying TV sitcom. 4. Steel Dragon. If this movie is based (loosely) on Tim Owens'life, then Steel Dragon is the fictional equivalent of Judas Priest. Mmm, not likely. Though made up of great musicians (Zakk Wylder, Jeff Pilson and Jason Bonham)Steel Dragon's image and music is nowhere heavier or good as Priest's. I see them as a slighter heavy version of Motley Crue (when they played pop metal). 5. The main protagonist. Marky Mark it's an outsider here. I think Vanilla Ice could have done a better effort. It's like doing a film about the life of Bob Marley, and giving the main role to Adam Sandler (who would suck even if he decides to play himself in a movie about his life). 6. The end. If you think this movie is inconsistent, then don't watch the end. I'll tell you one word: Seattle. Can you make the associations?.In the end, Rock Star is not good or bad. It's not entertaining or depressing. It's just a travesty to the Metal genre, the Metal community, its bands and fans alike.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
Rock On!,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought that it would be stupid and boring (and yes, at times, it was both), but there were enough quirks in it to make it really different and interesting.First of all, I found it immensely amusing that Chris' parents were totally into his rock 'n' roll lifestyle and it was his brother who was the wet blanket instead.  Also, I liked how Jennifer Aniston, as his girlfriend, handled the situation.  Instead of being totally immature and jealous and breaking up with him in a screaming match with accusations flying everywhere, she calmly tells him that this is his time and his dream and although she is sad that she doesn't have a bigger part in it, she is content to go do something she wants to.Also, I watched this movie on DVD and I would totally recommend this way to view it.  If you listen to the director commentary, he tells you that there are artists from Slaughter, Dokken, Third Eye Blind, and Verve Pipe among others that play the musicians (including Jason Bonham).  Therefore, these guys really contributed a lot of input as to whether the movie was realistic.  As for the guy who commented that there was no connection to Judas Priest, the director said that the studded vest, hat, and collar seen at the Steel Dragon house was a direct reference to Judas Priest.  Also, that the lead singer of Steel Dragon turned out to be gay.So, if you like rock movies I would totally recommend this one!!",,Anonymous,Music
Almost Famous meets Juke Box Hero (Foreigner),"First off, I would like to say I expected this movie to be cheesy and lame. I was surprised at how well the drama and humor of the movie was played out.While I am not familiar with the history of the the band portrayed--purportedly Judas Priest--the events portrayed were not blatently far fetched.  Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job of portraying a devoted, but somewhat obsessed fan, of the Steel Dragons who becomes a member of the band.  The photo shoot scene was excellent.The characters were likable and most showed development of the character over time.  A comedy relief character was added.  In the beginning he was humorous, but by the end he is best ignored.Rating 4 out of 5 stars.  For me it is a single viewing movie.  If you like 80's metal/hard rock, the soundtrack will probably be great.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A dream becomes reality.  Why would you give up your dream?,"Mark Whalberg plays Izzy the wannabe rock star who is the lead singer of his band. The band that seems to have a lot of skills, but no goals, besides to tribute Izzy's favorite band ""Steel Dragon"". He has amazing vocal talent, but for some unknown reason his only motivation as a musician is ""Steel Dragon"", and believes he isn't capable of doing his own material. A miracle graces Izzy's life as he takes over the lead vocalist in his ideal band ""Steel Dragon""...Izzy's girlfriend/ manager in this film (Jenifer Aniston) comes along to follow her boyfriend in the outrageous and scandalous life style of a rock star. Things were going smoothly for Izzy and this movie, as Izzy is living his dream rocking out with ""Steel Dragon"", with millions of fans now idolizing him ironically as he once idolized the same band a few short years earlier. The movie is now a little over an hour in running time, what will be the conflict for the remaining part of this film? Surprise surprise, Jenifer Aniston (Izzy's girlfriend)decides she isn't cut for her job as Izzy's manager no longer, which also indicates her thoughts on her and Izzy's future. I found the whole second part of this movie predictable and stale. Izzy's girlfriend quits and returns home. Izzy at that time was having the time of his life, his dream became reality, now with his girlfriends departure he decides the Rock and Roll life wasn't meant for him after all, so he returns to his girlfriend and blah blah blah!! I saw the second half of this film coming a mile away, its done so excessively in the average B- movies...Now I ask this question to anyone who reads this if you had your dream handed to you like Izzy did, would you run with it...Or throw it away for any selfish and jealous woman (and beautiful of course) like he did? Their are millions of fish in the sea...Izzy only had one shot at his dream, and he gave it up. Not smart.All in all this movie DID show promise and I particularly enjoyed the first half. I can relate to Whalberg's character because I am too a man with a dream. I just wish the movie would have focused on the dream for once rather then ""boy meets girl"",""boy falls in love with girl"" ,or maybe Hollywood should start showing the world some realistic endings after all for every single marriage there is a divorce. If the film could have steered in the opposite direction in its second half then it would have been much more enjoyable. My opinion of the movie is almost like the movie itself. It shows hope and ambition to be a memorable film as Izzy shows to be the lead singer of ""Steel Dragon"", but in the end the movie sells out and becomes forgettable and ordinary, as Izzy retires from his dream to pursue the so called ""love of his life"".

I had long hair during the late 1980's and early nineties, and I have played guitar for the last 15 years or so. Did I like Rock Star? Oh yes. The music is good, not great, the actors are good, and believable, even Jennifer Aniston plays her part to perfection. And Mark Wahlberg is perfect as the wannabe rock singer.

Inauthentic,"The attempt here is to amaze us with a Cinderella story, but it can't escape the level of a morality play.A talent deficient actor poses as a talent deficient character/poseur. If they'd only spoofed that, we'd have something interesting. Wahlberg repairs 'copy machines' -- that's as close as they get.The 1980s were full of heavy metal preening, but this is not about heavy metal -- this is the Hollywood version of 'heavy metal'. Back in the day, the industry churned this stuff out faster than McDonald's big macs. It required no commitment for commercial mastication. It was the same thing over and over again (a copy machine), album after album. It seemed the principal audience could never get enough. It was finally supplanted by irresistible force, but that's another story...This narrative is simply a string of TV anecdotes ABOUT the lifestyle, ABOUT the bigger personalities in a weak cosmology, not that OF a cinematic experience. That would require some commitment, some leap of faith. This is simply everything we've seen in 'Behind the Music' -- pre-chewed and pre-digested.Ignore this. If want something far more authentic, see ""Decline...part II"". If you want to see a spoof done right (cinematically), see ""Spinal Tap"".

"Good Hard Rock music, poor soft movie !","Being a Judas Priest fan (on which the actual movie is inspired) and a lover of great rock and heavy metal, I was waiting to see this film with not little anticipation.What we get is a roller-coaster of a movie, yet with only one peak.The first half of the film is good, with solid performances by all, yet then it just goes crashing down once ""Izzy"" joins the Steel Dragons.I'm not too sure on the actual identity of the film - is it a comedy, or is it to be taken seriously? The problem is that it hovers too much in the middle, not knowing when to laugh or ponder upon what you've seen.As to the life led by the band, I believe it's waaaaay over the top in the exposure to sex and drugs. The guys do work occasionally, even though it never seems they do.To be honest, I was expecting something in the league of Almost Famous my best movie of 2001 ), yet what we get is passable stuff.

Great Music,"I was just a kid in the 80's but I remember the big hair and arena rock. I'd set up stages made from plywood and cement blocks and play my broom in the back yard. The days of Def Leppard, Dokken, Motley Crue, White Snake, and arena rock maybe over, however Rock Star captures those days. It has some solid arena rock hits preformed by Steel Dragon called ""Stand Up"" and a great ballad ""We all Die Young"".This movie is entertaining to watch and I really thought the ending was great. It's just the kind of movie you can watch more then once and still enjoy.This is a movie for every fan who's dared to dream to be a rock stars.

A word of explanation: I went to Hasting's to take an unrelated movie back, which was really scratched, explained that some scenes didn't even play, and they gave me a rain check for a free rental, and I came across Rock Star.Mark Whalburg plays a lead singer of a cover (or a ""tribute"") band and gets the chance of a lifetime when he's called forth to replace the lead singer in the band that he idolizes. Not much to it, really...it kind of speeds through the whole story, which is a good thing. If it got bogged down in the whole clichés of rock-and-roll, it probably wouldn't be as enjoyable.Acting was pretty much solid, nothing too much to complain about.

"Why Jennifer, why?","No emotion. Bad music (and I am a reformed eighties metal guy, so I would be vulnerable to some good stuff.) Everything is half done. The brother is a parody, there is nothing to hold us in except to see what horror from the eighties they'll pull up next. The tour manager tries to bring a humanity to the thing but isn't given enough time. Wahlberg is okay and Aniston is slumming. We know she didn't need the money. Is this the only role she could fit into her summer break? Surely she must slap her forehead every time it pops up on VH1--which is only slightly less often than Ozzy does. It barely qualifies as a TV movie. It's just hard to believe that it was actually released theatrically.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
So it had a few clichés...,"Nonetheless, this was a pretty good film. Yes, the garage band (or porn house basement band, in this case) rocker gets his shot at the big time, then falls into the abyss of excess, i.e. the rock star life. But the way he left the band was unforeseen, despite the fore-shadowing of Mats' story of his marriage. And the film then illudes to bigger things for Chris Cole as he ends up in Seattle playing with shorter hair and wearing plaid. Perhaps he rides the wave that bridges 80's hair metal to 90's Seattle scene 'grunge' rock. At any rate, that Chris ends up with Emily makes a big difference in the reconciliation of his personal journey, as if there were another possibility (though Hollywood does occasionally try to throw a curve our way, once a decade or so). I liked this movie, and though he's yet to show real versatility, Wahlberg lends his innate likability to every role he assumes. I also hope that Aniston's continued ventures onto the big screen bring her increased success. She's a rare thing: a beauty with talent.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

Liked Wahlberg,"It's Pittsburg in the 80s. Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) idolizes the band Steel Dragon and works tirelessly to emulate them in a tribute band. His girlfriend Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston) is his biggest fan. He repairs copying machines and still lives at home. His cop brother dismisses his dream. After an on stage fight with his guitarist Rob (Timothy Olyphant), he is kicked out of the band as they want to start playing their own music. Then a surprise call from Steel Dragon guitarist Kirk Cuddy (Dominic West) for Chris to audition for the band as he fires the lead singer Bobby Beers.Mark Wahlberg has good likability as the dreamer and does a good rock star imitation. Jennifer Aniston is pretty good. She isn't doing anything out of her comfort zone. There are some rocking music even if Marky Mark doesn't do the singing. It's an earnest recreation like a tribute band. What this movie needs is a lot more jokes. Falling off the stairs could have been funny but it's played very seriously. The story is just too filled with clichés for me to take seriously. It feels very superficial and not gritty enough. In the end, I enjoyed Wahlberg's commitment to his character.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Sexy, wild, romantic. Mark and Jennifer - great chemistry!","This totally takes me back to the day . . . man. Just kidding. Even those who are not children of the 80's can love this movie. I was a Duran Duran freak (Don't be afraid, there are none of us in this movie) and I still loved Rock Star. I wasn't into the hair bands, but this movie is so funny, touching, wild and entertaining. The music is seriously fabulous. The voices and bands are awesome. I'm so impressed with the production of this film. Mark Wahlberg didn't really sing, but if you didn't know that already, you'd never believe it. (Like I said, child of the 80's, I know my lipsincing.) Regarding the cast - I am now officially a Mark Wahlberg fan. Jennifer Aniston is so great in this (as usual). They make a sweet, believable and sexy couple.

"This movie is not about music, but I think that is the point","Fluffy fun. Not a lot of depth here. I did long for more detailed characters, but it was still a fun ride.Being in high school in the 80's helped me to really appreciate this movie. There were so many teenagers in the theatre that missed so many of the jokes. People kept staring at me because I was laughing so much.I really liked the ending. I have never thought about how much it made sense to have the over-indulgent 80's give way to the purist early 90's scene. And Mark Wahlberg looks so much better with short hair. :)The credits were hilarious. Especially when that one early 90's song came on that I won't tell you what it was. It was my favorite joke.This movie wasn't about music unfortunately, and that is what I miss.

The late 80s/early 90s metal scene,"2001's ""Rock Star"" is loosely based on the metal band Judas Priest, who hired the lead singer of an Ohio JP tribute band, Tim ""Ripper"" Owens, after losing their original singer, Rob Halford, aka 'the metal god' (taken from the Priest song ""Metal Gods""), which explains why the movie was originally to be called ""The Metal God"". All the major plot points of this film parallel the Judas Priest story; only the names and times have been altered.In ""Rock Star"" the band is Steel Dragon (fictional of course), the singer of the tribute band is Chris 'Izzy' Cole (Mark Wahlberg) and the man he's replacing is Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng). Jennifer Aniston plays Izzy's girlfriend Emily and the Steel Dragon band members include Dominic West (who's excellent as always), Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson and Zakk Wylde. Timothy Spall and Dagmara Dominczyk also have prominent roles as Steel Dragon's road manager and public relations manager respectively.The Ripper Owens story is an excellent tale for a film and this is a good movie, but the times are a bit off. In reality Rob Halford left Judas Priest in late 1991, corresponding to the advent of grunge, and Ripper Owens replaced him in early 1996; in the film the original singer leaves circa 1989 and the tribute band singer replaces him almost immediately. Ripper Owens didn't leave Judas Priest until 2003 whereas Izzy obviously leaves somewhere around late 1991/early 1992.""Rock Star"" is just an enjoyable experience, especially if you're personally familiar with the 80s/early 90s' metal scene. The soundtrack includes numerous great songs from that era, as well as the 70s (like Ted Nugent's ""Stranglehold""). Unfortunately there's not one cut by Judas Priest (!). Apparently Judas Priest were originally linked to the project but ultimately disassociated themselves due to failing to reach a financial agreement for the rights to the story; this is when the producers decided to ""re-imagine"" the tale, as they say. This is all well and good but shouldn't there be as least one Priest song in the soundtrack? Where's the justice?The film takes the middle road between advocating the rock star lifestyle and decrying it. It shows both the glories and the pitfalls. When something's no longer fun and genuine it's simply time to move on -- to thine own self be true. Such experiences naturally have both positive and negative elements. Even if the experience ends up being more bad than good it's a necessary stepping stone to who you ultimately become, that is, who you are, your true success. A good example is Blackie Lawless of W.A.S.P. (check out their 2009 album BABYLON to get my drift).***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read this paragraph if you haven't seen the film). Some criticize the movie on the grounds that Chris (Izzy) turns to playing grunge in Seattle after leaving Steel Dragon, maintaining that he was a 'poser' all along. But didn't Rob Halford himself explore different styles of music when he left Judas Priest, in particular the band Two? In the film Chris accomplishes his dream and by the end has had his fill of the whole 'rock star' phenomenon with all its ridiculous trappings; he was older & wiser now and understandably wanted to write his OWN songs (as he wasn't allowed in Steel Dragon, neither was Ripper in real life) and opts to explore his art. Keep in mind that Ripper himself was a grunge fan and fronted a grunge tribute band called Seattle in the early 90s. When Chris leaves Steel Dragon grunge is the flavor of the month and he just goes with it; he's still young and he's exploring, that's it. I'm sure he'll go on to revisit his metal roots in the future just as Rob Halford ultimately did after his 90s' meanderings; the film just doesn't take us that far ahead. ***END SPOILER***FINAL WORD: ""Rock Star"" may not be great but it's certainly an enjoyable film on the late 80s/early 90s music scene. It's equal parts dramatic, fun, funny, realistic, inspiring, educational and sobering.GRADE: B (6.5/10)INCIDENTAL NOTE: I was the guitarist/songwriter for a metal band in the early 90s and we opened up for Tim Owens' JP tribute band in Youngstown, OH in the winter of 1995. I knew the guitarist of his band and I got to meet Tim. A year later he was a friggin' member of Judas Priest(!).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Live the fantasy that others only dream about.,"This movie is a lot better than you imagine. Chris Cole is the lead singer of a tribute band that is swept off his feet when he is asked to join the real group and then drowns in the world of sex, drugs and heavy metal. Mark Wahlberg plays the part of Cole and eases into the role excellently probably due to his own musical background. Jennifer Aniston plays Emily, Cole's love interest and manager. She can only stand so much of watching Cole sink lower and deeper into the decadent world associated with the band. Emily leaves to start a new life in Seattle and later Cole comes to his senses when he realizes that the Steel Dragon does not want his input more than his sexually willing body and voice to sustain the group. Cole hands over the mic to an eager wannabe and trades in his heavy metal wardrobe for jeans and sweaters and singing his own songs in front of half-filled coffee houses in Seattle.Like I said, Wahlberg is excellent in the role. I've never been an Aniston fan, but she really is impressive in this movie. Timothy Spall is moderately funny in the role as the Steel Dragon's road manager. Lending their individual talents to make the film more believable are: Jason Bonham, Timothy Olyphant, Brian Van Ark, Jeff Pilson, Jason Flemyng and Dominic West.Besides the music of Steel Dragon and their tribute band Blood Pollution there is original music from the likes of Kiss, Ted Nugent, Bon Jovi, Everclear and Motley Crue.Note: This story is reportedly roughly based on the story of Judas Priest's Tim ""Ripper"" Owens.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Judas Priest story line with Bon Jovi soundtrack,"This is the movie that is somewhat based on the exit of Rob Halford from British Metal Gods 'Judas Priest' and how the band replaced him with Ripper Owens, who used to front a Priest tribute band. Originally titled Metal God this movie could have been something great. Instead, someone in an office somewhere who knows little to nothing about metal music decided to water it down. From the title change of Metal God to the 'safe' middle of the road 'Rock Star' to the lame soundtrack this movie plays out badly. Having spent most of my life in a professional metal band I was really looking forward to seeing this, I was very let down by several points of the film. The soundtrack is very NOT metal for one, and the ending of the movie is lame as well. The movie does have a few bright spots in the writing and acting but as a whole, it fails in the end because...1)A movie based on a metal band should have a metal soundtrack. 2)There is NOTHING metal about Marky Mark or Jennifer Aniston. If Bon Jovi, Warrant, Def Leppard and Poison are your idea of 'heavy metal' go see this movie. If Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Dio & Black Sabbath are your idea of metal see this movie for a good laugh.",1.0,Anonymous,Music
Be careful what you wish for - you may get it.,"Have just finished watching this on video, and looked at various comments. It wasn't bad; it wasn't all that good. There were some nice moments - Timothy Spall good, as always, and I liked the bit when the original lead singer Bobby not only admitted he was gay but took off his wig. I think it showed the difference between leading a tribute band and getting to have a fairly ordinary life otherwise, with a loving girlfriend, and living the rock star life for real, constantly on the move, can't go out and just hang around because you'll be mobbed, your girlfriend bored out of her skull because there's nothing for her to do except what she doesn't want to do (be a vacuous stoned rock chick), women constantly hitting on you just to score with a rock star. And in this case, when finally you start wanting to do your own thing, you can't, you have to sing what other people write, just go on doing the same old thing. So Chris Cole grows up a bit and decides what he *really* wants. Okay, so it's a cliché, and I agreed with a reviewer who said he wanted more characterisation, especially on Chris and Emily and their backstory. But it was quite well acted, I thought; good chemistry between Wahlberg and Aniston (let's be honest, she's the reason I watched the film). In many ways, the first part of the film was the best.

Movies could rock but don't,"I give this film a modest rating because around the time this film came out there was a bit of hype or revivalism surrounding eighties metal and ""metal"" and I feel that this movie could have been funny and hip but instead it's actually about the trials and tribulations of getting a job singing for Judas Preist. Doesn't anyone think this is funny?You cant make a for-real drama out of a ridiculous hypothetical situation. When was the last time you looked in the paper: ""Journey requires loud pompous rock vocalist. Must have big hair and innofensive tattoos""""Iron Maiden wants a cool guy to tune their guitars for them and make interview appointments. Must be good at doing metal leads.""And so it could have been a version of Spinal Tap that was a biting and cool satire instead of a dreamy teenage movie.While I'm at it, ""Almost Famous"" is dead serious as well.

Charming Retro Tribute to '80's Hair or Metal or Some Sort of Rock Bands,"Watch enough of VH-1's ""Behind the Music"" and you can figure out the plot of ""Rock Star.""I was late so may have missed a philosophical discussion of the difference between a covers band and a tribute band (hmm, that may be worth thinking about for a few minutes). Having missed the '80's in music due to having a life, I did try to figure out if the fictional band was just a hair band, a hard rock band, a light metal band, thrash metal or what, as it's based on Judas Priest which is more metal and alienated than this.But with all those caveats, I was surprised how enjoyable the movie was, and with a fun authentic-sounding soundtrack with folks like Jason Bonham and Zakk Wylde in the fictional band (well, to me as a non-expert in whatever light metal rock genre it is with AC/DC, Bon Jovi, etc.).Mark Wahlberg is simply charming through all the hair extensions, much more like his earnest eager to please ""Boogie Nights"" character than his would-be hero in ""Planet of the Apes."" Jennifer Aniston's character is surprisingly more intelligent and secure than her ""Friends"" persona.The groupies here are much less benign than the Muses of ""Almost Famous,"" but then this is a decade later in the travails of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll. I don't think I've heard this line from a professional stripper in a VH-1 music movie: ""Hey I need to do you now cause I have to get to my job by midnight.""The production values are very high.

Thankfully -- NO SPANDEX !!,"The movie ""rock star"" was much better then ""Almost Famous"" (which ""almost"" had an ending.) -- it is definitely a ""period"" (a la 80's) piece.Plot was predictable, but not a nuisance.  if you can stand marky mark acting (mark wahlberg)  its not a bad piece.Its about a wanna-be rock star that makes it to the big time --and all the trappings that go along with making it.

Two Words : Rock On!,"Perhaps it's because Bon Jovi's 'Living on a Prayer' is on the soundtrack that made me love this. Any movie that can pull that off has my vote. Normally not a Mark Wahlberg  - fan (if you will), I knew I had to see a film with this title. Mark does a fantastic job as Chris Cole - lead singer of the Steel Dragon tribute band. Being a singer/performer himself I guess made him believable being on stage. There is nothing worse than watching an actor play a singer and have their body and vocal movements out of sync with the music. The lead guitarist in the tribute band Blood Pollution isn't that convincing on the guitar but I suppose there is no need to get too picky. Excellent casting of Timothy Spall as the road manager. Just what you would expect of a road manager in the 80's.One of the best things about this movie (and I guess the most unexpectant) is the relationship between Chris and Emily. Jennifer Aniston (brilliantly) plays the long time girlfriend and manager, Emily, with such depth and honesty - which is what makes the ending so moving.

Long live rock'n'roll,"The last time I watched this movie was somewhere in the beginning of 2010s and I remember clearly how much I loved its soundtrack, so much so that I went on the internet and searched for this band, Steel Dragon, like it was real, downloaded all of their music and learned all of them songs by heart.Now, ten years later I still dig them, although with a somewhat different perspective and subtext and see the movie even clearer. Rock 'n' roll lifestyle isn't for everybody and the main protagonist learns it the hard way. You can have everything you want and will still not be living the life you were born to live.I heard Chris Cole, that's the name of Mark Wahlberg's character, is written with a nod to Blaze Bayley and how he replaced Rob Halford in Judas Priest and the resemblances pretty much stop there (besides their both names starting with the same letter).The movie is filled with music, each frame of it screams ""hard rock"" and I love it but above this music there's also a story, sure it's watered-down and all one-dimensional with caricaturistic characters and shallow meaning behind them but it is pretty damn well made; the performances are not annoying and both Mark and Jennifer Aniston brighten this overall mediocre picture.

Featuring original songs as well as classic tunes from Kiss, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, and ""Uncle"" Ted Nugent, this film moves right along at a fast pace.Chris Cole (Wahlberg), a product of the Pittsburgh 80's metal band scene, still living at home with Mom & Dad, is a lead singer loaded with talent, and who is the front man of a Steel Dragon (fictitious group) tribute band. When he has a falling out with his bandmates over creative differences, it isn't long before the real band comes calling. They are also losing their lead singer, and ask Chris to come audition. Not believing his incredible luck, he and his girlfriend, Emily (Aniston), who also serves as his manager, board an airplance and never look back. Chris changes his name to Izzy, and soon, he is on the road rocking sold out auditoriums, but at great cost. The life he always envisioned as being so great, is not all what he thought it would be.I am a product of this generation myself, being a big-time headbanger back in the day (and to a degree, I still am). I had all the important albums, had my favorite bands, and have seen my share of rock concerts over the years. I felt this movie captured most aspects of this time period pretty well. There was always a ripple of electricity surging through the expectanct audience before the band hit the stage, and when the guitars started to wail and the pyrotechnics exploded around you, you lost your mind for a few hours. ""Rock Star"" is a nice homage to those moments.I actually thought the acting was pretty solid from top to bottom. Nothing was taken overly serious, there are no dramatic nods here, just a fun look at a fun time. The original songs written for the movie and performed by the guys who were there, were excellent. If Steel Dragon had been a real band, I probably would've like them - LOL. This is a winner. A recommend at a solid 7 stars out of 10. If you're a rocker, and you haven't seen this on yet, plug it in and live the life!",7.0,Anonymous,Music
"Real Fun , Great Soundtrack","the movie was a little predictable but the acting was good.  Mark did a great job,  also make sure you watch the end credits great outtakes.  the music was all 80's .. the movie is not for the under 13 crowd...",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Interesting,"This was an interesting movie.  I could have done without the bathroom scene and the seduction scene - EWWWW!  Other than that, I loved the head-banging music this movie revolved around.  Chris/Izzy's parents are AWESOME!  They totally support their sons interests and believe in him enough to support him - now that is AWESOME!! What really surprised me was the Chris's realization at the end.  It was not quite the ""hollywood"" ending on his road to self discovery.  The overall rise to stardom and the fall of it was quite a roller- coaster ride.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A wasted opportunity,"The real story of the departure of long time Judas Priest singer Rob Halford along with his coming out and the hiring of Judas Priest tribute band singer Tim ""Ripper"" Owens inspired this movie. Mark Wahlberg is Chris Cole, the lead singer in a tribute band to his idols, British metal group Steel Dragon, and after a violent argument with his bandmates during a gig is kicked out only to be invited several days later to audition for Steel Dragon's lead singer job. He lands the job and goes on tour with his new band and girlfriend. The movie starts out well and Mark Wahlberg does a reasonable job of playing an 80's metal front man but the story just isn't there. He sleeps with a few groupies, has a few beers, and sniffs some drugs but it's also contrived to give a cute little ending where he leaves the band after pulling a guy out of a concert audience who happens to be a better singer than him. He then proceeds to cut his hair and go play small shows at coffee houses with his integrity intact. Bleh.",3.0,Anonymous,Music
***1/2,"Worth seeing although I don't know how I'd feel if I had to pay 8 bucks instead of nothing for the sneak preview I saw.  Mark Wahlberg and Jennifer are very good and the script succeeds despite a fairly anti-climactic ending.  Everything was great up until that point, it just seemed very forced, almost out of desperation to find some sort of warm feeling to send viewers home with.  Probably could have ended about ten minutes early, you'll see what I mean.  Stick around for the outtakes at the end, they're worth seeing.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Predictable, but better than I expected","Not being a massive fan of Mark Wahlberg, I really don't know why I watched this. However, I'm quite glad I did. There are some films that you just don't like for reasons you can't quite put your finger on. This is the opposite. I liked it and I don't really know why.The plot follows Mark Wahlberg as the lead singer in an eighties tribute band to the (fictional) rock gods, Steel Dragon. However, his life takes an interesting turn when the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves (or is kicked out!) and his bandmates offer Mark the job as replacement. Now, if that sounds a little hard to believe, check out the movie trivia. Apparently, a similar situation actually happened during the seventies (and before I was born, hence I'm not totally up on it).From there we see what his life is like 'living the dream' of drugs, rock and roll (and 'the other' obviously).The thing is, based on that briefest of plot summaries, you can probably guess the highs and lows (and probably eventual outcome) of the film. And you'd be right. There are no major twists in the tale. Yet, for some reason, I still found it enjoyable to watch. There's a healthy dose of sentiment, but not too much to distract from the big eighties hairdos and thumping guitar chords.Perhaps fans of rock (as I am) just automatically like it? Perhaps I just got lucky. I found it a kind of semi feel-good movie for adults.It doesn't reinvent the wheel in terms of story-telling, but the characters have their own charm (and special kudos to Mark's on screen parents, who, despite being 'all grown up and respectable' like to headbang with the best of them down at the gigs and mosh pits!).",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Better than it has a right to be,"See this one for Mark Wahlberg's performance.He's initially appealing reprising the ""lamb in a den of wolves"" role that made him a movie star in ""Boogie Nights.""But he's very impressive in his rock performance.  He handles metal music with ease.The story is cliched, as many others here have noted.Its humor gives ""Rock Star""  a bit of a split personality.  This is no ""Spinal Tap,"" but several spots are similar in tone and content.Both Wahlberg and Anniston are too old for their roles, but that won't bother you too much.And Jennifer Anniston's performance reminded me way too often of Barbra Streisand in her early movies--everything from her hair to her nails to her delivery of wisecracks.  Watch the scene with her and the rock stars' wives and think of the young Babs.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Destined For Greatness,"Like all great art, Rock Star was not appreciated in its own time. My friends and I, all 80s hair metal fans, saw it in the theater and LOVED IT. Sure, there are issues with some of the background music being out of time, which can be annoying, but the awesome Steel Dragon tunes more than make up for that. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, and it has a light, fun tone. The soundtrack rocks, and the original Steel Dragon songs are amazing! I frequently find myself singing them at random times. The writing is pretty good, there are several classic lines that crack me up every time. The casting is great, mixing perfectly suited actors and real musicians. This movie will definitely become a cult classic, and when that time rolls around, Jennifer Aniston and Mark Wahlberg will be proud to have it listed on their resumes. Right now, I think they're a little embarrassed about it, BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE!!!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Bring back the 80s!,"Actually, this is not a bad movie.But the problem with this kind of movie is, that it won't interest people other than those who grew up in the 80s.Yes, the story is cliché, no wonder about that, but it could have happened today (after all, all boys band are wannabe who got hired to play the dummy and sing for a manager), but since it's located in the 80s with rock bands (do people really classify this as metal? Hard Rock ok, but metal? please..)But, just like the movie ""The Wedding Singer"", you get in this movie and you suddenly miss the 80s, and how fun it was back then.So, don't go see this movie if you want a serious movie, go to this movie if you wish to be entertained and have a bit of nostalgia.As for the acting, I like Mark Whalberg, and it's an interesting choice of actor, because he's actually, well, you know, the brother of Danny Wahlberg of NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK, which is one of the ""boys band"" of the 90s who was a manager creation, so maybe he got input from his brother... but we all know Mark Whalberg is a former hip-hop artist, I guess it's the only kind of music he can sings, if they didn't use his vocals on this movie... then maybe I'm wrong, but I sure know on the soundtrack it's not him!As for the music itself, it's really up to the level of those hair bands in the 80s, you can seriously swap those songs with Bon Jovi or Motley Crue and it would do. I must say that's it's almost a shame they put that ""metal"" chorus on ""We All Die Young"", because that song is radio hit potential.As for comparing this movie to Almost Famous, well, maybe it's another rock band, but no, this one is a best entertainment than Almost Famous, but Almost Famous is more original and more ""serious"".",7.0,Anonymous,Music
Metal mania,"Jennifer Aniston is mildly annoying as a girl who believes with all heart that her boyfriend (Mark Wahlberg in a bad wig)who is in a tribute band to a famous metal band will someday hit the big time. Dominic West (who gave a truly awful performance in ""The Forgotten"") as an obnoxious guitarist is the best thing about this movie, believe it or not. Wahlberg and Aniston both phone in their performances, which flat out stink.Both unbelievable and ridiculous, this movie tries to be nostalgic for the hard-rocking, more innocent times of the 80's, when all people wanted to do was rock and roll. But it falls embarrassingly short, and the story falls apart.Only loyal Aniston and Wahlberg fans will want to watch this movie, although it is good for some (unintentional) laughs.",4.0,Anonymous,Music
"Good movie, Great music!","I was very excited to see Rock Star because I am a big fan of Mark Wahlberg's. I was surprised to have liked it more than I originally thought I would. The script did leave something to be desired, but the movie's performances made up for it. There were a few moments when visions of Spinal Tap came rushing back, and I can't help but think this movie would have been even better as a mocumentary. But, I digress.Wahlberg continues to demonstrate his talent, as he plays with believability an ordinary guy whose biggest dream comes true. He does it with the wonder and innocence that make you not only believe him, but also make you really care about his character.Jennifer Aniston, who hasn't impressed me in movies up to this point, is surprisingly good as the girlfriend/manager. She shows more real emotion than I've seen in her last few movies combined.But above all, it's the music in this movie that really draws you in. Peppered with some 80's tunes (let's face it - Bon Jovi would have any 80's music fans rocking in their seat), the movie really rocks with the original Steel Dragon songs and Wahlberg's performance of them.I plan to see this movie again, but first I'm going to rush out and buy the soundtrack!",9.0,Anonymous,Music

Full bag of stupid clichés,"I don't know any idiotic rock'n'roll cliché not used in this movie. Ouffcourz , rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. Say it to stupid young boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too much Guns'n'Roses or Motley Crue stories. I have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be fresh, sober and clean in evenings. After live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement. Then you have a bit time to have fun. But its not any luxury or dream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. The ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yeah, what a moral. Real 90s.",2.0,Anonymous,Music
what a waste,"From reading some of the other posts it is pretty obvious how badly this film failed on almost every level.Most people think the movie takes place in the eighties - I guess that is because of the numerous hair band cliches and some of the music. But if that was true - how could Mark Walhberg's character end up in post grunge Seattle after one short tour? The true story that this cliche ridden film was based on was - as one poster already pointed out - was legendary metal band Judas Priest replacing their long time lead singer with a singer from a Judas Priest tribute band. What was really interesting about the story to most people was that at the time Judas Priest was often playing to smaller crowds than Rippers Owens' tribute band did back in Pittsburg - and how Owens and crew eventually won over long time fans. But why bother telling a little told story of a band overcoming the reluctance of their old fans when you can fall back on the old as dirt - Star Is Born based rise to stardom - and inevitable fall - brought down by sex drugs and rock and roll - nonsense that permeates this film. I mean that would take a little work and skill wouldn't it.But back to the main question - just when is this flick supposed to take place? The 70's, the 80's the 90's? They have a Ted Nugent song being played in a disco right next to Relax by Frankie Goes To Hollywood. Seriously! The filmakers seem so out of touch with any time period it is hard to imagine they have even been to a rock concert in the last twenty years. The look of the film seems to be based almost completely on repeated viewings of Behind The Music.But, hey that seems to be John Stockwell's specialty. Taking a subculture and writing such an unbelievable piece of tripe that any chance of making a good film about that scene will be instantly destroyed when his unsuccessful film bombs at the box office. (See last summer's Blue Crush.) Which begs the question - who's blank is he blanking anyway?Having said that - Mark Wahlberg is actually quite good and it's a shame his performance was wasted in this drek. He sings the songs and actually has a great set of pipes.",,Anonymous,Music
"Goes down as easy as a Bon Jovi song, with as much depth","This film, set in 1985 or so, captures the hair band rock scene with accuracy (though inexplicably, they play the 1987 INXS hit ""Devil Inside"" at a party.) The pacing and camera work are solid. Mark Wahlberg, having been a pop star, does an admirable job imitating a tribute band singer who becomes the actual band's singer. Jennifer Aniston does her ""Friends"" character but isn't given much to do in the end. The major problem with the movie is not much happens and events just sort of happen. There's not a lot of major character development, dramatic high points or incredibly funny ""Spinal Tap"" moments either. It's frequently mildly amusing, which is usually a sign that you should probably rent this when the better films come out.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
"Wahlberg rocks, the rest sucks.","This movie seemed like a little bit ""Boogie Nights"", a little bit ""Saturday Night Fever"" and a little bit ""The Doors"", but it definitely had very little original going for it.  Mark Wahlberg played the identical role that he had in ""Boogie Nights"" and he played it the same way, nice kid, eager to please, making the audience root for him to succeed. He is pleasing to look at and truly a talented performer, so that was the high point, but other than his performance, there is very little meat in this film and at the end, when we have all gotten our lesson in rock and roll debauchery, we are sent on our way with little return for our buck.  I would say skip this one and go rent ""Boogie Nights"", which is a better film with some outstanding performances.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

This movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel the excitement of Izzy.

"Pretty good, if we forget the music","I went to see Rock Star with the fear that it was another shallow and overhyped movie, but fortunately I was wrong. It's curious I have enjoyed the film, although I have found the music pretty bad (Too loud and tasteless). Anyway, I guess not all music-related movies can have such good songs like Good Fellas or Almost Famous.Certainly, I wasn't expecting for a fine movie starring Jennifer Aniston, and this has been the exception. To be honest, I thought she had forgotten how to act due to the unjustified pile of money she is getting for playing Rachel in the now-pathetic sitcom Friends.As for Mark Walhberg, I had seen him for the first time in The Yards, a really GREAT thriller.To sum up, Rock Star is a good way to spend one and a half-hours.

So you wanna be a rock star? Who doesn't?,"So you wanna be a rock star? Who doesn't? Cool clothes, hot babes (or mansteaks depending upon your preference) and world travel. These days one barely needs talent...The cast within Rocks Star both the musicians and the actors playing musicians just don't have any oomph. It's hard for me not to love Mark Wahlberg, though.Marky Wahlberg is not only one of the cutest croissants in the bakery of man, but he's a wonderful actor. His soft-spoken, near bookish demeanor and hard crusty bits mix in a large portion of talent perfection cocktail. Sure, I'm smitten, but it's the truth. This is one of his most humorous roles yet.Jennifer Aniston is still trying to break out of her Friend's mold. She hasn't done it here, unfortunately. Her role, as Chris (Izzy)'s girlfriend could have been played by just about any starlet wondering the lot. Maybe next time she'll get some meat and dumplings to sink her perfectly shaped teeth into? It's hard to get out of the whole must see TV stuff.Rock Star is a comedy, not a brilliant comedy, that follows the rise of Chris Cole. He's a lead singer for a cover/tribute band, Blood Pollution that drives the locals into frenzy while they emulate a real, famous, rock band Steel Dragon ; like all those tribute bands of the Grateful Dead or the Doors do even now at local dive venues to a screaming B class groupies yellin' over a quazi-karaoke night.The year is 1985, big hair, tacky clothes and cucumber bulges rule, and so does metal. Chris is very much a part of the scene. He's a semi loser during the day, drives a beat up Dart, and lives at home- 'nough said?When Christopher's unceremoniously booted from the band he lives for he's thinking life's pretty much a big old bag of rag weed you paid a premium for. That is until his phone rings and fate steps up to his microphone. He's asked to step-in for the Steel Dragon's singer, Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng), ala the real life switch-a-roo Judas Priest pulled with leather boy, Rob Halford...Chris has suddenly become the icon people in bands around the world look to be. Neat huh? But he wants more. Snore. Chris, now known as Izzy, does the whole Mick Jagger-Bowie-Poison gig and is livin the generic rock star life of legends...all while as his gal, who was always his strongest supporter, (sniff) Emily (Jennifer "" I see Brad Pitt naked -anytime I want"" Aniston) is starting to be lost in the fog machine of life.He's rude, crude, whoring around and into drug food. She's gotta dump the creep. Oh, how quickly people forget who was there when they were beggin' for change to fill up their gas tank...He gets his ego bruised a little to though... hehehe (<-evil cackle)Rock Star's problem? There's a lack of edge, no real energy of the ""time"" is present, and few belly laughs await you, dare I say it's a Spinal Tap lite? Granted Rock Star has some great scenes, some decent acting and lots of young hot bucks in tight clothing wriggling about a stage and scantly clad felines for all the audience to enjoy. Remember Mark ""the actor"" Wahlberg was once an underwear exposing hip-hop artist ricocheting around a stage in his Calvins, grabbing his crotch to sound of screaming girls simultaneously in prayer that his stylin' oversized jeans would plummet to the floor and reveal his winky. While Rock Star's music is other end of the jukebox different, Wahlberg's had the rock star experience and he does a great (I just think it could have been even better) job of bring Chris up to a quazi-believable star. Mark did provide less of a lypsyncing-local-talent-show impersonation and managed to capture an essence of what schmoo turned icon would be reacting like. The movie itself just didn't grab you.The band Steel Dragons actually boasts real musicians with a bit of a name for themselves; the drummer is the real Jason Bonham (son of Led Zeppelin's John Bonham -second only to Moon in talent), the bassist is Dokken's guitarist Jeff Pilson, and Third Eye Blind's lead singer, Stephan Jenkins plays a rival bands lead singer. So there's tasty treats for the diehard music folks sprinkled in the audience.Often I thought of Spinal Tap, the quintessential rock star mock and wishes for Nigel (Christopher Guest) to pop up backstage arguing about finger sandwiches and the evils of bread crust...it never happened.In the end , Rock Star is a big old metaphor for how important it is to be yourself. To find your own voice. Sure Chris/Izzy's made it big, filling the shoes of Steel Dragon's ex-singer. Somebody who already paved the road, so the fans aren't really gushing over Chris at all. That's gonna effect your psyche eventually huh? He's an artist after all...Rock Star is also a chance for some rock and roll nostalgia. Not just for the fond memory of the ridiculously made-up boys of the eighties, but for those shapely men in their super tight custom leather performing a kind of bare chested ballet to screaming guitars and half hour long drum riffs. If your one of them rush and see this...if not wait for rental.Snack recommendation: Beer and donuts, while reviewing Boogie Nights just one more time...",,Anonymous,Music
Stand up and shooouuuut!,"Mark Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, a photocopier repair guy by day who fronts a tribute band (Blood Pollution) at night. He and his bandmates emulate the legendary hard-rock band Steel Dragon, but he takes himself too seriously, and is ousted from the band. Then, a major opportunity arises: he's tapped to actually replace the lead singer (a very effective Jason Flemyng) of Steel Dragon, who himself was unceremoniously dumped from the band. Chris and his loyal girlfriend / manager Emily Poule (Jennifer Aniston) find themselves caught up in the decadent rock 'n' roll lifestyle, which becomes a detriment to their relationship.Inspired by a real-life story, ""Rock Star"" is no great shakes as a script. It's just not *that* interesting a story, playing out without any real surprises. It does a decent enough job depicting the seedy aspect to the music business, and establishes some credentials by casting a couple of real-life musicians (Jason Bonham, Jeff Pilson, Zakk Wylde, etc.) in supporting roles. Timothy Spall is a standout as Steel Dragons' sleazy road manager; also putting in appearances are Dominic West and Timothy Olyphant. One thing I liked seeing was that Chris' parents (Beth Grant, Michael Shamus Wiles) were so supportive of his dreams and proud to be at his concerts. Good, relatable performances by Wahlberg and Aniston help to keep things watchable.""Rock Star"" is ultimately a yarn of a wannabe who thinks he knows what he wants out of life, but finds that it's not all it's cracked up to be - especially when he's not allowed to be creative himself.Certainly if you're a rock fan, the soundtrack will be of major interest. Even the original Steel Dragon songs concocted for the film are not bad.Six out of 10.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
It rocked but not completely rolled,"`Rock star' is not on its way to any `stairway to heaven' category as one of the best rock films of all time, but it does make you `jump' from time to time because of its high-level energy. The film's theme is on a die-hard rock group fanatic who actually becomes the lead singer of his favorite band. The story is based upon the true story on what happened to the heavy metal band Judas Priest.  If you think this movie is filled with a witty screenplay and intellect direction- then you got `another thing coming'. However, what did `shook me all night long' was the fine acting of Jennifer Aniston as the rock star's devoted girlfriend. I could not say the same about the rock star himself; Mark Wahlberg was much better as a porn star than a rock star.   I did enjoy the 80's retrospect journey the movie intakes.

We loved going on the weekends to see Pantera when they were a little known hair band playing in bars.  It was a fun time.  I loved the hair do's and the clothes and the fun attitudes of Rock and Roll.This movie perfectly captured a guy with a dream.  I believe that it touched on reality of getting all you dreamed for and it not being as happy go lucky as you wanted.. but it didn't try to teach too much of a lesson...it wasn't preachy.. it simply showed a guy reaching his dream and deciding to bow out before it got too out of hand.

The premise was horrible and the acting was even worse. As if people had not suffered through the hard rock movement in the 80's enough, we have to endure it through third-rate story-telling on the big screen.

"After the Musketeer, this was a breath of fresh air.","After seeing the Musketeer, it's difficult not to be too flattering to Rock Star.  Afterall, Rock Star offered me everything the Musketeer didn't; entertainment. Mark Wahlberg's follow up to Planet of the Apes comes in the form of Rock Star, a story of self discovery set in the 80's world of drugs, sex and rock & roll. Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, the front man for a band dedicated to covering his favorite band ""Steel Dragon"".  Cole repeatedly refers to his band as a ""tribute"" band, and spends all of his time matching the looks and sounds of Steel Dragon.  Eventually all of his work pays off, as the lead singer of Steel Dragon leaves the group, and they are suddenly in need of a new front man.  That is where Chris Cole comes in.  Renamed Izzy, Cole steps in as the new lead for the real Steel Dragon. The movie goes on, and Cole is forced to choose between making his own music or making Steel Dragon music. He's also faced with the decision to be with a woman who loves him (Jennifer Aniston), or having a new girl in his hotel every night.  In the end I don't need to tell you which choices he makes. While Rock Star is a fairly predictable movie, it is also very enjoyable.  There were moments that felt like Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"", but you are never drawn deep enough into these characters to achieve the excellence of that movie.  I also could have done without the nudity.  I suppose it served it's purpose, but it somehow seemed out of place in a movie with this much heart.  That being said, I laughed, and when the scene was set, I got a little emotional. Mark Wahlberg shows us all of the heart and feeling that he held back in ""Planet of the Apes"".  He is a subtle actor, but he is very effective in this, as we see his battle to become his own man. Jennifer Aniston has star quality written all over her.  If only she would let someone else choose the movies that she gets involved in.  This is the first movie I can remember her in, that didn't suck.  ""She's the One"" and ""Picture Perfect"" were not exactly star vehicles.  In this movie we see the gifts that she has.  She's like Julia Roberts in that when she starts to cry, you can't help but get welled up.  Guys, you know what I'm talking about!!!  She's beautiful, and you can't help but cheer for her to be treated right. Finally, I'm looking forward to picking up the soundtrack to this movie. For any youth of the 80's, there will be instant flashbacks to bands like Motley Crue, Poison and Warrant.  Oh, those were good days.  You haven't heard music until you've heard it from 5 guys with long hair and eyeliner. Steel Dragon had some strong tunes, I just wish that they had been a real band when I was growing up.  The final song done by Chris Cole is also fantastic and worth the price of admission. This was a really enjoyable movie, just don't expect to carry it with you like ""Almost Famous"".  Spend your $10, and enjoy.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Major disappointment,"This movie was laughably terrible!  The first five minutes lets you know how bad this movie is and that it would develop even worse.  I am sorry to say this, but Marky Wahlberg is not a good enough actor to carry a major film. He was great in ""Boogie Nights"" but that movie was filled with interesting characters.  This movie was sorely bereft of them.  Jennifer Aniston is a good actress but it was hard to believe she would fall for such a dunce like the main character. This movie could have been cool.  I was very interested in it when it first came out.  Unfortunately I could have easily turned this off and not finished it but my curiosity go the best of me.  What a perfectly horrible script! Too bad...",,Anonymous,Music
Wannabe actually hits the big time.,"Not a bad movie, especially if you miss rock-n-roll from the 80s.  Wannabe in a cover band hits it big with the real thing.  It's a typical rock movie with no real surprises, but it manages to hold your attention with decent acting (even Jennifer Aniston which REALLY surprised me) and (for the most part) GREAT music.  There are a few musical selections which leave me scratching my head.  Most notably would be the INXS song.  Anyone into 80s metal wouldn't have been caught DEAD listening to this!!!!!  (Take my word for I'm a hair metal headbanger!).  The costumer designer obviously didn't live in the 80s era either as far as Jennifer A. was concerned!!!!!! Where were the ripped jeans, etc etc.  But overall definitely a watchable movie.",7.0,Anonymous,Music
A period piece - for fans of the music genre only,"If you are a twenty or thirtysomething who can appreciate Motley Crew, Poison, or any other 80s glam metal band than this movie is for you. Rock Star is a period piece examining the life and times of one cheese metal band, Steel Dragon and their new front man Chris ""Izzy don't call me Marky"" Cole.Rock Star succeeds where Almost Famous doesn't, in that it accurately (for the most part) depicts and portrays the nostalgia of the time, the music, and most of all, the fans. Rock Star encompasses a solid fundamental core of film traits that aid in establishing it as a worthy video rental. The plot is predictable yet believable, the acting is above average, the set design is fairly accurate, and the pacing of the movie is fast enough to keep the viewer involved as well as entertained. Most important, the movie does not take itself too seriously. During the end credits ""Good Vibrations"" is played which I felt was humorous and refreshing, as well as an accurate portal of the transition period of the early 90s between glam metal and Seattle grunge.However, the movie is not without its fair share of technical glitches and the cinematography is not subtle - it's more like a Def Leppard video. If you are a fan of the music and grew up in the 80s you might enjoy this one. Otherwise, if you are going to be overtly cynical or generally have contempt for the glam metal counterculture you might want to stick to VH-1 Behind the Music and save yourself the $4 rental fee. I can appreciate the music so I gave this flick a well earned 6/10 - mostly for its technical accuracies of the music, culture, and the time period.",6.0,Anonymous,Music
Just A Fun Time,"The story travels a generic route of fame and fortune, but dammit if I didn't find the rock 'n rock journey and faces in the cast a lot of fun. 'Rock Star' will appeal to people who like seeing equal parts fantasy & nostalgia. It has some humor, some decent music and is a pretty good time capsule that gets the vibes and feels of the 80's music scene. Forget reality, the Judas Priest tale it's loosely based on and just go for the ride.Chris Cole (Mark Wahlberg) is the lead singer in a Steel Dragons tribute band. An everyday guy (with a great singing voice) who gets to live his dream when the lead singer of the actual group Bobby Beers (Jason Flemyng) leaves and he's tapped to replace him. Joining him on this journey is his girlfriend and former manager of his tribute band Emily (Jennifer Aniston). While Mats (Timothy Spall) - the road manager for Steel Dragons - acts as a guide to Chris to this new world of being famous.Wahlberg is more than up to the task though he obviously isn't supplying the vocals he's appearing to sing. Aniston isn't saddled with a one note gf role and brings some down to earth heart. Spall presents an interesting mix of the bands best interests & learning lessons. While Dominic West is fun as the bands founder & most featured member rhythm guitarist Kirk Cuddy. The cast is full of real life accomplished musicians playing roles and even some Playboy Playmates portray beautiful trophy wives to complete the picture.It nails the usual suspects - sex, drugs, alcohol, infidelity, money - while the stage moments in front of huge crowds deliver energy. The only things that don't ring true is the time span. From the beginning until the end is like only a year. Plus there's an artificial manufactured feel to Wahlberg (see box cover) walking down the road with a guitar on his back even though he doesn't ever play. It's like a movie exec said we need this shot to sell the movie. Otherwise I've seen 'Rock Star' a couple of times since it got released and it always entertains.",6.0,Anonymous,Music

"Not Perfect, But Whatever. \m/","As a metalhead, it makes me so happy to see movies about heavy metal and rock & roll. Metal does not get the amount of praise and respect it deserves. That's something I never understood. These are some of the most talented musicians in the world making music that takes the listener on journey. The best music genre is mixed into a glimpse of life on the road an finding your true self.'Rock Star' is loosely based on the story of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens. Judas Priest's Rob Halford wanted to try a solo career and the rest of the band got Owens to fill in for him. Owens was in a Priest tribute band first, similar to Wahlberg's character. He did a couple of albums with them until Halford came back.Mark Wahlberg plays talented singer Chris Cole. He worships Bobby Beers, the frontman of the world's top metal band, Steel Dragon (is that not a badass name or what?) During the daytime, Chris is an IT guy at an office building. By night he is the frontman of a Steel Dragon tribute band called ""Blood Pollution."" Chris takes every little detail of Dragon so seriously to be incorporated into Blood Pollution that they eventually kick him out. He doesn't know where Bobby Beers ends and he begins. Chris soon finds out that Bobby Beers gets booted out of the band and Chris gets the gig as Dragon's new frontman.The beginning of this up until right after Chris' first performance with Steel Dragon is golden. Living life as a wannabe and fulfilling his dream was very relatable. And him becoming Dragon's new lead vocalist was nice as we could totally feel a starstruck Chris. But after Chris' first concert, the movie completely lazes out. When you're a rockstar (and in the world's biggest band), life is full of parties, sex, drugs, and travelling. We see Chris doing all of these and how it effects his longtime girlfriend (Jennifer Aniston), but none of these things are done in a very clear and concise way. In the first chunk, we feel exactly what Chris feels. Then we get pulled out of Chris and become just speculators getting little peeks into Chris' time on the road. We can't relate to Chris wanting to find himself and wanting to change like we could in the first half. If the second half of the script was re-written so that it was stronger than the first half (movies need to keep building and move up), the whole movie would be as revered as 'Love & Mercy' and 'The Buddy Holly Story.'Whatever. Since only part of the script is weak and the music is perfect, 'Rock Star' is a great time to have.3/4",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Boring movie about boring music,"80's sleazy (glam)rock is like 90's house music or current boybands: it's boring and has no ideas or ideals. The only thing that makes it a bit 'cult' nowadays is that it's a long time ago, so we can laugh at its sillyness. Too bad 'Rock Star' has no laughs at all, as it must be one of the most boring movies of recent years.Chris (Mark Wahlberg) is singer of a Steel Dragon tribute band. When he's kicked of the band at the same time the real Steel Dragon singer is kicked of as well, he becomes the next lead singer. You already know how this is gonna end up at that time, with Chris losing it with sex, drugs and r&r and forgetting about his long-time girlfriend/manager, Emily (Jennifer Aniston).There's way too much (boring) music in this standard formula-packed excuse for a movie and should be avoided for it at all cost.

There are some good performances but nothing can save this trite tale about trashy heavy-metal stars. Almost Famous captured a certain charm and naivete amidst the debauchery, Rock Star seems to be solely obsessed with the debauched. Also, the goody-goody persona of the Mark Wahlberg character just didn't convince. Nor did all the people (parents, choir-members, etc.) around him. The ending was flat, simply because it was impossible to care anything about the character in the first place.",3.0,Anonymous,Music

Heavy Metal: The ABC Afterschool Special,"I like American Cheese as much as the next moviegoer, and on some levels the film does entertain... Mark Wahlberg lends the same innocent-boy charm to this role as he did his Dirk Diggler character in 'Boogie Nights' (matter of fact, he's playing almost the same character here... the biggest difference between them is the hairstyle and lack of, um, prosthetics), but that's not enough to hang a whole movie on...",3.0,Anonymous,Music
A great movie & great music!!,"If you don't appreciate this movie, you must not have been alive during the '80s. That was the time of great rock music, flashy clothes, & flashy musicians. The story is based off of the heavy metal group Judas Priest. A wannabe who idolizes his favorite rock band, gets the phone call of his life...to have the chance to be their new lead singer. You get so excited watching the movie, that one almost feels that they're in the movie. '80s rock stars Zakk Wylde (guitarist-Ozzy Osbourne), Jeff Pilson (bassists-Dokken), & Jason Bonham (drummer-Bonham) are in the fictional rock band, & what better way to have real live musicians. Also in the movie are Rachel Hunter & Heidi mark playing musicians girlfriends/wives...since both of them were at one time.

Tim Ripper Owens is from Akron,"This movie is a classic from the beginning of Mark Wahlberg's career. His roll here is great and the Steel Dragon music is definitely enjoyable. Jennifer Aniston is both sexy and strong. Wahlberg's character feels the ups and downs of the hair metal rock industry and returns to where he starts. Rock Star hits the mark with the story and music. Anyone who grew up in the 80s listening to the music of Malmsteen, Priest, Slaughter, etc... will love it. The story based loosely on the life of Akron's own Tim Ripper Owens. He's a great guy and owns a sports bar/concert club here in the Akron area called Rippers Rock House. If your in the area stop by. Ripper is there frequently and plays solo or with local bands as well.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
Please folks just look away,"Ok so I was real excited to see this movie when I rented it.  I even had beer, and when I have beer its easy to enjoy just about everything. And I was really into the true life story of Ripper Owens, the kid who got to sing for Judas Priest, which this movie was partially based on.  I have a strong feeling in my psychic verberaorations Ripper's life is about 100 times more fun than this doo-doo.Its sad because this is a great premise for a story, small time kid who plays in tribute band actually gets to sing for the band he has been emulating his whole life.  That's super.  Well Wahlberg plays the geekiness/metalness pretty well.  But get this, even though he has dedicated his LIFE to loving, imitating, and worshipping this band, he gets all goofed up over the fact that he can't write their songs now that he actually is in the band.  Suddenly he doesn't know that the guitarist and drummer always write the songs(That would seem like vital info to a true fan).  Suddenly this is a problem.  WHAT?  Suddenly lets just ditch our character for the convenience of a plot turner.Wait I'm getting another vision, Jennifer Aniston in another movie! Basically we get the same ol Rachel character she plays on TV, but with metal hair.  ""Be be bebebebeebbebe"" whatever the hell she always does.  Its old and terrible.  Anyway she play's Wahlberg's girlfriend in the flick and is there to do little more than get happy when he does something good (YAaaaY!) and fret the rest of the time.  Oh boo hoo, we're getting into drugs, oh boo hoo all the other band members' wives are sluts and plus they hit on me and make me question my sexuality.  Yeah boo hoo.  This was only a DREAM of hers, and Marky Mark's, but now its just upsetting! Women should be more willing to make sacrifices for their men, THATs what I think.But folks, this is the KICKER.  The movie is almost over, we hope, we think. Wahlberg's playing in the band and suddenly just DECIDES to take off, handing the mike to some punk KID in the first row and lets him finish the show.  The other members of the band just play on like yeah this is fine. That enables Marky to leave the stage, ON HIS OWN TERMS PEOPLE let it be known.  He turns to the stage manager and goes "" I gotta take a p***"" (which is actually supposed to reference something romantic from early on - Just think of ""Good Will Hunting""s line ""I had to go see about a girl"" but totally MeTaLized and you've got the idea).THEN, OK THEN... We flash forward a year or two and Alternative rock is in!! Mark has his hair cut alterna-short and is wearing a cute little fuzzy hippy sweater and singing in a smoky coffeehouse.  Oh, thank GOD you got COOL!  Another character ditching!!  A true metalhead would never fall so far. LAME.  So here he is belting out this little soft sweet love tune while the other members (made up of the tribute band he was in at the beginning, they had a HUGE fallingout but yet here they are all together at the end, FRIENDS FOREVER XXXXOOOOXXXXXOOOO) back him up, also with cute little haircuts and pleasant, loving visages. Then Rachel comes in and he talks so SOFTLY to her its so sweet!!! CUE THE CREDITS BABY THAT WAS SUCH A GOLDEN ENDING.  Thanks a lot test audiences!!!So I guess I didn't like it at all.

What a BS movie,"I decided to watch this only because Jennifer Aniston is in it and i wished i hadn't of watched it at all. The plot wasn't that great and didn't make sense; like how can a wannabe lame rock-star become a big star and join a great band overnight? There were barely any funny moments in this movie, so it shouldn't be considered as a comedy. I'm not a rock fan or listen to rock music at all but i felt this movie didn't portray the life of a rock-star accurately and realistically; probably the reason why it was such a box office bomb. Only good thing is i felt Jennifer Aniston portrayed her character as Emily well like she does in most of her movies.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

One of the best movies of 2001,"This is one of the few movies that were ever made that I am able to watch time and time again. Perhaps it has to do with the soundtrack, which smokes, or the fact that it takes place in the 1980's, which I just love, or maybe it has to do with the fact that my favorite type of music is 80's heavy metal. This is definately one of the best period movies ever made.Mark Wahlberg stars as Chris Cole, a singer in a tribute band to Steel Dragons. When the lead singer of Steel Dragons decides to leave the band, Chris is brought in to replace him. Based on the real life story of Tim ""Ripper"" Owens of Judas Priest, this is one film that will actually make you feel like the rock star in the film.The period pieces in this film are great, however, some of the music does not fit the film. The film is supposed to take place in 1985, however, for some reason or another, we here songs that were not released until 1990 or later that appear in the film. This is just a minor oversight, however, perfectionists will find fault in this.Mark Walhberg gives a very convincing performance as a heavy metal singer. I was a little scared when I heard that he would be doing this film, however, he did the 80's metal scene justice. He really nailed the look and sound of the 80's right on. Also, the addition of Jeff Pilson (Dokken), Zakk Wylde (Ozzy Osbourne), Blas Elias (Slaughter), and several other rockers, adds to the reality of this film.This film is truly one of the best of 2001. It was overlooked at the box office, and seemed to flop. I do believe that it will find a cult following on DVD and video. Do yourself a favour and rent this film. I guarantee, whether you are a metal fan or not, you will really like this film.",,Anonymous,Music

The bloopers that played during the credits made up for some of the bad acting, but the best part was when ""Good Vibrations"" was played.

Laughably bad to the point of unintentional self-satire,"Marky Mark Wahlberg plays a rock star wannabe who rocks out at rock concerts with his rockin' girlfriend and rocking friends. He gets into fights with competing rock band members and his older brother, who hates rock music and is a police officer, makes fun of him for being a wannabe rock star.So the titular rock star eventually becomes a real rock star, headlining his favorite rock band as a rock singer.Notice how I keep using the word ""rock"" a lot? That's because this movie is inundated with rock - and in a bad way. Hair metal died with the '80s - making a retro picture now? It's not surprising the film didn't even recoup half of its $38,000,000 budget in theaters.I'm not picking on hair metal, but if you look at Motley Crue or KISS, at least they had attitude. The bands in this film are lame! I guess Mark thought this would be a good semi-sequel to ""Boogie Nights"" - he satirized the '70s porn industry, now why not '80s gratuity? - but, unfortunately, at the helm of director Stephen ""I Haven't Made a Good Movie in Years and Am Still Riding on the Coattails of 'Bill & Ted' and 'Mr. Holland's Opus'"" Herek, ""Rock Star"" looks like a laughable, silly picture.Oh, and Jennifer Aniston's annoying performance as Mark's girlfriend only adds to the fun.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
will probably play better on home video,"I got the feeling while I was watching ""Rock Star"" that this film was trying to do cinematically for the 80's hair metal craze what ""Boogie Nights"" did for the world of 70's porn. However, I would only call it coincidence that both films feature Mark Wahlberg in the lead. That is where the similarities stop though. While ""Boogie"" was a stylish, wickedly funny and often moving (not to mention realistic) look at it's subject, ""Rock Star"" is contrived, flat and largely unaffecting. Wahlberg does his part to redeem himself from his blank expression of a performance in ""Planet of the Apes"" here, playing a tribute band singer turned rock star with a very genuine feeling authenticity that allows you to sympathize with the charcter, even if he is-like EVERY other character in the movie-poorly written and underdeveloped. The former Marky Mark could look just as much in place working hardware in Wal-Mart as schmoozing at some Hollywood party, and that's a gift he's fortunate to have. The rest of the cast is pretty underwhelming; nobody's BAD by any means, but, like the direction, the cast is merely competent. Jennifer Aniston, cute and likable as always, ismore or less channeling her character from friends while the supporting players left no impression at all. Another problem with the film is that it cannot make up it's mind-one minute it's a cute, smirky running joke/homage to an era gone by (a la ""Wedding Singer""), the next minute a ""shocking behind the scenes look"" at a world of debauchery and betrayal before finally settling as a ho-hum melodrama.

Amazingly, he is upset and initially unwilling to live the life and sticks with his girl, his previous ""band manager"" and useless waste of space Aniston, reprising every bad role she ever did. The movie can't decide whether to be an all-out comedy (the Mom and Pa duo are much more interesting than the rest of the movie) but ultimately it's a couple of hours of mindless entertainment.

We all die young is an incredible song, as is Colorful, and Wahlberg's incredible voice more than makes up for a slight lack of complexity in the plot. Having said this, i don't see that as a negative point, as it is a great story.Music aside, the message of the film makes me chuckle each time i see it - that however much you can devote your life to something, and want to be something you're not, a lot of the time you're wrong, and what you really want is what you already had.

"Some things to look for, Wahlberg isn't one of them","Mark Wahlberg, the star of Rock Star, seems not totally right for this movie.  Not just because of the Marky Mark past image, but also because he seems uncomfortable sometimes in the movie.  Sure he might have a god singing voice as a hairband lead singer, but that might not totally compensate in my book.  It would've helped a little if it looked like he was having a little more, well, fun.  Both Wahlberg and the film have something in common- they take themselves too seriously.Still, the film has it's moments.  They're are a good number of in-jokes and puns at the rock industry (It's no Spinal Tap though), some alright rock music, and a good feel for the period.  But, the film becomes muddles after what we know the plot is is established.  Formula, toppled with formula, with only a tad of compensation.By the way, though the film might sound original with it's plot, it's actually based (in part of course) on the events that transpired with Judas Priest when they kicked Rob Halford out of the band (you might even spot a gay reference here or there).

"Quite good, need to see again.","I live for 80's Hard Rock music and that's why i wanted to see this movie (and because Jennifer Aniston is in it).  I can remember when 80's Hard Rock was everywhere and i thought it would never die but unfortunately it did when the new Hip Hop sound came out.  Even at the end of Rock Star as the credits were rolling, Mark Wahlberg basically said Metal was out and Hip Hop was in, that's what happened in 1991 at the MTv music awards when the leaders of 80's Hard Rock, Poison, gave a memorable and very bad performance (due to the lead guitarist doing a solo in the middle of a song which caused an embarrasing situation and the song had to be started over again) which led to the end of this feel good music but that's another story (i'm trying not to ramble too much).  Rock Star was an okay movie which i feel i need to watch a second time to enjoy more.  It's shows the lifestyle of a Rock Star very well, not just the good points, but Rock Star points out all the downsides to being a Rock Star too, all the things we hear about have been put into film for our entertainment.  It's a fast moving movie which manages to hold your interest if your into this style of music, there is quite a bit of comedy too which is also worth mentioning to it's credit.  It's very obvious that Mark Wahlberg was miming when he was singing, the real voice was by Michael Matijevic of the band STEELHEART, and also some of it was by Mark Slaughter of SLAUGHTER, two of the best 80's Hard Rock bands.  You can tell Michael Matijevic's voice anywhere as it's so loud and piercing his voice can blow up your CD player if your not careful.  Rock tar is worth watching just for the music, anyone who remembers 80's Hard Rock will have their memories flowing back after watching this with a soundtrack from BON JOVI, DAVID LEE ROTH and AC'DC among others.  It would have been nice if some of the old Rock stars from the 80's were given guest appearances, especially Bret Michaels of Poison since he was so influential to the success of Hair Metal and he has an acting background too.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
"""ROCK STAR"" #1 Movie of the Year !","Finally ! A movie WORTH EVERY PENNY ! Definitely the Best Movie I've seen in a long time !!!""Rock Star"" had it all, a solid story and extremely well casted actors. Watching the former hip hop rapper ""Marky Mark"" deliver one of the finest performances ever as a believable rock star was just a bonus. This movie is what you wish for in more movies. It had a good opening that created the basis for the rest of the movie, then the ending was just as good. I won't spoil it, but the ending of Rock Star won't leave you hanging as so many movies do nowadays. Don't you hate leaving the theatre after a movie p***ed off because the ending sucked and didn't give you closure ? Not here, Rock Star delivers !!! A++++++Don't listen to the critics about this movie. The critics watch soooo many movies, part of their job, that they can no longer distinguish the good movies normal movie goers would like apart from the wierd potboilers they prefer. Critics seem to rant and rave about films that love to bore you, put you to sleep, make your butt hurt in your seat. At Film.com, Rock Star audiences gave it 92% thumbs up, only 8% thumbs down. The critics bashed it and continued to give their cudo's to films that don't interest the majority of the movie going public.Mark Wahlberg should get an emmy for his performance as a ""Rock Star"" He was believable the entire time. But of course, they like to give those type of awards to an actor playing a handicap, or a vietnam vet. C'mon Hollywood, give this guy his cudo's !!! Music was also great !!! Bought the CD right after I saw the movie.I've recommended this movie to a lot of people. That's how much I took to this movie. Can't wait to get the DVD and BLAST IT !!! Go see it, you'll love it !!! 5/5*****",,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie & Music,"I first saw this film a good few years ago and wasn't sure I would like it. On seeing it I fell in love with the film and bought the DVD immediately. Call me sad but I've seen it lots and lots since then.
I acknowledge that the script isn't oscar material and that some scenes are predictable but if you like 80's rock then you will love this film.
It follows a young man called Chris (Wahlberg) who is obsessed with his favourite band Steeldragon and models himself on the lead singer Bobby Beers played by Jason Flemyng. He even sings in a tribute band dedicated to Steeldagon managed by his girlfriend played by Jennifer Aniston. As fate would have it a video of him singing finds its way to the guitarist of Dragon played by Dominic West, Dragon just happen to be looking for a replacement for their lead singer who has issues and they want to replace him.
Cue an interview and Wahlberg hits the big time but is it all he dreamed of?
The film is sprinkled with songs from Ac/Dc, Kiss, Motley Crue, Def Leppard, Bon Jovi and Ted Nugent along with songs performed by the fictional Steel Dragon. The band members include Zac Wilde and Jason Bonham and the band's manager is played by the excellent Timothy Spall who puts in another great performance. Wahlberg and Aniston are also great and yes this film does contain some rock stereotypes but who cares.
It's full of great songs decent acting and the songs carry the film passed any gaps in the script. I love it, it's awesome.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.,"I was taken to this movie against my will, however, I was glad once it was over.  Clocking in at almost 2 hours long, I was glad when it was over because I thought I was going to hurt myself from laughing so hard.  The laughter came from the campiness of the film, not out of sarcasm.  This film doesn't take itself seriously, which is it's saving grace.  If you were active into movies and music in the 80's, you will appreciate what I think this movie is trying to get across which is nostalgia with humor and music. From the lead actors obsessive compulsive fascination with the band and lead singer of the group which he has formed a 'tribute band' for (which everyone else calls a cover band much to his dismay) to the movies' rock opera-ish metal songs with the 'rock chix' that flared back in the 80's to the films soundtrack featuring Bon Jovi, Motley Crue, Talking Heads, Def Leppard, and other of your shameful dusty favorites (you've sung them at karaoke night in the pub..admit it).  I laughed so hard at the pseudo-serious drama that I thought I would hurt myself at times.  A little long, but a fun film for nostalgia sake.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
A fun hard rock fairy tale.,"This film seems to cop a lot of flak but I am not sure if it is because people don't get it. This is what the 80's was like, excess and indulgence in spades.A tribute band singer (Wahlberg) is thrown out of his band and gets a call from the band Steel Dragon that he has spent so much admiring. They want him to audition as they have also just sacked their singer.And so Cinderella as it were gets to go to the ball. Madness ensues as he becomes more and more immersed in the hard rock lifestyle.There isn't much to the film but in the end you either enjoy the hard rock music and cliches or you don't.I loved it all. A shame music can't be this much fun anymore.The film also has many 80's rockers playing parts as musicians which makes it even more fun for us fans.",9.0,Anonymous,Music
half way to a good movie....,"Half way through 'Rock Star' I was still enjoying myself.  I really enjoyed Mark Wahlberg's performance(all though somewhat similar to his character in 'Boogie Nights').  Jennifer Aniston was better than usual as well.  This was the first movie she was in the I didn't see Rachel Green from 'Friends'.  At least she extended herself past that for a change.After the half way point however, specifically after Wahlberg's first big concert, the movie goes downhill.  It gets boring and repetitive.  It also tries to speak out against the indulgences of the rock and roll industry, mainly sex, drugs and rock n' roll.  During the last fifty minutes or so only one thought kept popping into my head, and that was that I had seen all of this before.  Not only had I seen it all before, but when I saw if the first time it had many things this movie does not:1.Well defined characters2.A smooth flowing story3.Good direction4.Absolutely stellar acting5.A great script with excellent dialogueThe first time I saw it, it was called 'Almost Famous'.  This movie is nowhere near as good.  Just watch 'Almost Famous' because its really not worth wasting time on 'Rock Star'.  It started out promisingly, but then it degenerates into a bad bad movie.  Disappointed at the end.  5 out of 10.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
I liked it!,"I didn't really know what to expect from this movie and I'm not particularly a metal fan - although I do like it once in a while.  I thought the movie might somewhat entertaining, but I was pretty surprised that I actually ended up liking it alot.  I'm not sure why.   Maybe it was because I think guys with long hair are great to look at, and because Mark Walberg was pretty hot, Jennifer Anniston was entertaining to watch and the music was really good.  I particularly liked the song, We All Die Young.I liked this movie so much that I might even buy it on DVD.",,Anonymous,Music
"Decent date movie, nothing more.","Briefly, Rock Star is a fairy tale. It's not really about rock and roll. It's about a male Cinderella (a Cinderfella, if you will, and if you don't mind a Jerry Lewis reference) who, instead of marrying a prince, marries a rock band... but at what cost?This movie has several hurdles to clear -- This Is Spinal Tap, Wayne's World 2, and ""VH1's Behind The Music"". The audience already knows what happens in a rock and roll band. Thankfully, the movie isn't out to top anything or be a cautionary tale. It's just there to entertain.If you've seen any trailers for this movie, you'll know what the story is: Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is the lead singer of a Steel Dragons tribute (NOT cover) band called Blood Pollution. When the lead singer for SD is fired, Cole is recruited to join as the new lead singer. Begin rise of fame. During his career with SD, his relationship with his girlfriend/manager Emily (Aniston) is strained. Will things work out? Will Steel Dragons be able to keep fans with a new lead singer? WILL HAIR METAL SURVIVE? All of these questions will be answered in the movie, if not here.Although the movie is based around a fictional band, certain activities didn't need to be made up. Just as Hannibal Lecter is a combination of several serial killers, Steel Dragons is based on several metal bands. Nods are given to Judas Priest, Black Flag, Metallica, Led Zeppelin, The Who, Guns 'n' Roses, Van Halen, and probably a host of others I can't think of right now. Adding to Rock Star's r&r credibilty is the casting of Zakk Wylde (one of Ozzy Osbourne's guitarists) and Jason Bonham (a drummer, and son of late Led Zeppelin drummer John Bonham). So, the music is going to be of high quality, regardless of your feelings towards hair metal as a genre.The movie is set in the mid-1980s, when post-glam hair metal was making big strides in top-40 music. This distinction is very important. Steel Dragons is not Twisted Sister or Motley Crue or Judas Priest or Metallica. It's more in the vein of Def Leppard or Winger or Bon Jovi. Girls will like this band. Cole (who is known to the public as Izzy) will not scare girls like Lemmy from Motorhead. The time that the movie is doubly important in that it happens before hair metal becomes a parody of itself, and, even more importantly, before the dread beast from the Northwest emerges from Seattle. It happens during the glory days of hair metal. Power ballads? Absolutely. Guitarists moving in unison? You bet. Tight leather pants? Oh, yeah. Once upon a time, this was actually cool, and not campy or homoerotic. Well, in retrospect, it was always homoerotic, but girls still liked it. And, that's what rock and roll is all about.However, it's not what the movie is about -- it is about, to steal the tagline, ""a wannabe who got to be"". Here's where the movie tends to disappoint. The cast was incredibly talented, but the characters are fairly one-dimensional. Which is not to say that the performances were bad -- some of the scenes were incredibly passionate, but I would have liked to have seen more character in the characters. Chris Cole is, to put it bluntly, a geek. He knows things about Steel Dragons that would put a Trekkie who sleeps in his Spock ears and could write a 20-page dissertation on why Kirk is a far better captain than Picard to shame. Details about the color of the thread in costumes, what year and tour a particular outfit was worn, not to mention lyrics and choreography. This kid is devoted to his dream. Emily has a head for business, and is devoted to Chris. I really would have liked to have seen more backstory between these two characters. As they were written, however, I felt just a little bit left out. The character of Miggs (Spall) however, was just about perfect. He is THE roadie. Not the god-of-all-roadies that we saw in Wayne's World 2, but just a guy who can get the job done. And, of course, as this is a fairy tale, he is as close as we come to a fairy godmother.If you're looking for a good character study within an industry, watch Boogie Nights. If you're looking for a date movie, Rock Star is probably better. And less awkward.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

"Wow, Interesting to see what it's really like.....","I love this movie, first and foremost because of Mark Wahlberg is in it and secondly because the end justifies the means. There is something about this film that sucks you in and allows you to feel all of the emotions the characters are feeling. Jen Aniston is great as the girlfriend in this movie. It takes a look at the Rockstar lifestyle that so many hardcore rockers lived back in the day (perhaps these days they have gotten just abit smarter). It takes through a rainbow of emotions and has a lot of subtle facets to allow the light through. Like a diamond, this movie shines. You won't waste your popcorn on this one. Semi-chick flick but my husband enjoyed it too. There's some laughs thrown in too.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Entertaining Crap,"30 minutes into 'Rock Star', you'll feel like you're watching a made for TV movie.  The entire first half hour is so totally unbelievable and cheesy that you will really start to regret that you rented (or bought) this movie. Thankfully, it does get better after that, but not much.  Even after the first half hour, though, the movie does suffer from it's moments of inability to suspend disbelief.  Probably the worst of this, aside from the first 30 minutes, is the end, when Mark Wahlberg's character simply abandons his hair metal band, and next thing we know he's playing 'sensitive' music in an early-90s coffehouse in Seattle and wearing flannel and sweaters.The mere fact that, historically, grunge was a reaction AGAINST 80's hair metal makes this ending completely laughable.  Personally, I was hoping that Jennifer Aniston's character leaving for Seattle halfway through the movie was a foreshadowing of an ending that would've been much more entertaining: Her character joining the late 80's Seattle grunge scene, and then at the end of the movie (presumably circa 1991) during the 'grunge explosion', she becomes rich and famous and Mark Wahlberg ends up crawling back as nothing but a broken has-been. :)",5.0,Anonymous,Music
Stand Up and Shout!!,"One of the most real and best movies I have ever heard, bought watched and seen!! Chris Coles' dream is mine, the movie was done mimicking the great 80's hairbands to a T.. Perfect in every way.. And to pull it all of, they had such people as Jason Bonham, the drummer (john Bonhams son and drummer)Zakk Wylde, who plays Guitar both in the movie and in the sound track, known for The Black Label Society, or maybe more known before as Guitarist for Ozzy Osbourne, Blas Elias, drummer for blood pollution, and Slaughter in real life as well!! Also Brian Vander Ark (blood pollution), who can be found playing with such bands as the Verve pipe. Jeff Pilson, bassist for Steel Dragon, but more known for the real band Dokken.. And Stephan Jenkins lead singer of Third Eye Blind.. There were 7 original songs made done and preformed by Steel Dragon on the sound track and an another song just in the movie called Reckless.. Lead singers for the band were Jeff Scott Soto, (played in a million hair bands)Mike Matijevic (lead singer for 80's hairband Steel Heart), and Mark Wahlberg, vocals on songs like Reckless(""I got a Hunger Burning Way Down Deep, In My soul I'm on a roll, I'm on Fire!!).. The movie shows and makes the dreams of so many people out there like me for example that just want to make it.. But I guess you would have to have Chris's dream to see the movie the way I see it.. ""Livin the life I was born to live!!"" Givin it all I got to give!!"" A must see for any one who Loves 80's music, or has the dream of making it big!!",,Anonymous,Music
Poodle-perm fun,"It's a revelation to me that people haved raved about this film.  I couldn't imagine who, except Mark Wahlberg fans, the target audience was supposed to be.  Running against the grain of the huge current popularity of modern metal, the film is set 15 years ago when Heart and Bon Jovi rocked the world and features a soundtrack of screaming-guitar poodle-perm AOR.  No genuine Heavy metal or new metal fan is going to enjoy it.  Jennifer Anniston is missing for a huge chunk at the middle, and the romance story is pretty incidental, so there go the girls and the Friends fans.  It's not even that funny, so there's no word of mouth about the laughs or the great set-pieces. Did you even realise this was directed by the same man who gave the world Bill and Ted and Don't Tell Monm the Baby-sitter's Dead?  I have to say, I like Bon Jovi, and the concert material made me smile, but I don't understand how money got invested in this project.",5.0,Anonymous,Music

superficial but entertaining film,"So what happens when a person's dreams actually DO come true, especially when the context of that dream turns out to be superstardom in the celebrity driven culture of modern America?  Does that individual, in attaining the summit of fame and fortune, find true happiness and fulfillment there or does he come to realize that it is all mere ashes in the long run?These questions have formed the basis for any number of films in the past and `Rock Star' doesn't bring much new insight to the theme.  However, in style and spirit, this film by director Stephen Herek is just loopy enough to be entertaining.  Although writer John Stockwell provides a basically superficial - and in some ways even sanitized - survey of the rock star culture, at least we are spared some of the heavy-handed rebel angst that usually accompanies films on this subject.From the beginning, the film incorporates elements that go against the grain of the subject matter.  For instance, the main character, Chris Cole, is less a wannabe rock star than an obsessed devotee of his favorite rock band known as Steel Dragon.  Chris emulates the band's adored lead singer to such an extent that the people around him - including his own band members who spend most of their time covering Steel Dragon's tunes - begin to feel that Chris might actually be having trouble distinguishing reality from fantasy, that he may actually be coming to think that he IS his idol.  The screenplay also breaks out of the mold by having Chris's parents be supportive of his endeavors and by making Chris himself a rocker without a societal chip on his shoulder.  Chris simply loves rock music and the band that he feels has come to epitomize it for him.  Unlike in most of these stories, the lead character is not an ambitious, driven, trailblazing artist but rather a follower content to bask in another person's glory.Until fate one day intervenes in an astonishing way and Chris gets that rare chance to live out his ultimate life fantasy.  He receives a call from the leader of Steel Dragon who has heard Chris's renditions of their songs and offers him a job as replacement for the burnt out lead singer, Chris' idol. At this point the film lapses into more familiar territory, with Chris and his girlfriend taking the inevitable downward spiral from wide-eyed innocence to the hedonistic trap of unbridled sex, drugs, booze etc. - and all the interpersonal strain this places on once-solid relationships. Happily, `Rock Star,' although it shows all these conventional aspects, doesn't go overboard into total despair and misery as so many previous films on this topic have.  In fact, it is surprising just how upbeat the film remains even in its darkest moments.  Even though that adds to the superficial quality of the film, it also keeps it from becoming fashionably cynical and clichéd.Mark Wahlberg gives an energetic performance as Chris and Jennifer Aniston conveys a real transcendent sweetness as Emily, Chris' devoted girlfriend. One ends up not believing a minute of `Rock Star' (at least not after that fateful phone call arrives), but it has a nice fairytale quality nonetheless.",,Anonymous,Music
The most unhappy rock star of all time...,"Rock Star started off in the right place. It was funny, interesting, and didn't make the 80's look as cheesy as I remember them, but Mark Wahlberg looked like he was in hell throughout the movie. There are genuinely only a couple of scenes where I can remember seeing him smile and this is about a guy who gets to live out his dream of being in a gigantic rock band!The reason he didn't smile much is probably because of the whole meaning behind the story though. From almost the beginning, it's like the whole idea of Rock Star is to talk about the evil of the music industry and how people treat each other and by about 3/4 of the way in, you feel like it's being slammed over your head.That whole morale gets old real fast and much of the comedy and pleasure in the film is quickly swept away before you can even laugh again. Although I'm sure it's true and all that, Almost Famous is a much better example of what movies about the music industry should be like.",5.0,Anonymous,Music
The best ever film depiction of metal subculture,"Rock Star is a comedy and a love story. But it's also a devastatingly accurate depiction of the old-school trad metal subculture, and a very funny one (let's face it trad metal subculture is a bit sad :-)Apart from the (Hollywood compulsory) love scenes and the ending (very Hollywood)...don't worry, these only take up about 10 minutes of the total running time....the entire film is one long series of jokes and in-jokes about the scene. The film almost reads like a series of separate sketches...a sketch depicting life in a struggling metal band, a sketch depicting backstage life as a rock star, a sketch depicting the process of album making and so on. All are excellent. At least as good as Spinal Tap, maybe better.Just one possible niggle; I loved this film, but I live for trad metal. I would say that at least half the jokes, especially the visual in-jokes, would be meaningless to anyone not steeped in old school metal and who has never played in an old school metal band.

Big name Metal Band adopts new lead singer. So you want to be a rock star? Juvenile with mediocre music. 1 Fly out of Five,"Isn't Metal music about real noise, rebellion and anarchy? Are the makers of Rock Star really trying to tell us that cynical corporatism rules even in the Metal world? Is this a film only aimed at tut tutting, middle aged, failed musos, turned film execs, who are trying to make a buck out of stupid metal heads who'll watch anything as long as a few distorted guitars and Jennifer Aniston are on show?And do these film producers really believe that we the viewing public are as dumbed down as they are, or at least would like us all to be?Who's going to see Rock Star. Judas Priest Fans? One or two at a stretch I'd say. Judas Priest, unless they're the big headed, manipulative, shallow b*****ds they're portrayed to be in this film, also wouldn't go. They'll no doubt send their lawyers but that's another story.And what of Mark Wahlberg as Chris Cole, who's obviously meant to be Tim `Ripper' Owens. Owens was a devoted fan and a member of a Judas Priest tribute band who in 1997 replaced Rob Halford as Priest's lead singer.Cole in Rock Star pulls the same trick but is Wahlberg the actor really interested in anything Wahlberg does? Two generations ago we might have called him an existentialist. Mark Wahlberg could have walked straight out of Catcher In The Rye if he could have cared. Remember Val Kilmer in The Doors? Now that man was involved. There was a real rock star. Wahlberg as a Metal Man, no way!Still the orgy scene was pretty good fun and I am a sucker for stage fright.

The Fallacy of the Like-Minded Soundtrack,"Not bad, not great, not anything much, but it gets better as it progresses, and it ends up being more than the lump of bland nothingness that ""Almost Famous"" is. Herek makes only one real mistake...I call it The Fallacy of the Like-Minded Soundtrack. This is the story of a musician from the 1980s: the ""Steel Dragon"" songs he slavishly reproduces, strangled high note for strangled high note, and the songs of his own (well, one of them) which he ends up singing instead. So we hear a decent amount of 80s-style rock. But what of the moments when nobody is singing? What should the soundtrack consist of then? Why ... more 80s-style rock, right?Wrong. The actual songs, the songs that are being presented to us, come across as just another part of the musical wallpaper (which, for the first part of the movie, is just too darned relentlessly loud). You can't really HEAR when the songs that aren't part of the story end and the songs that are begin. And rock songs make poor soundtrack material even in the best of circumstances. While I'm aware that a traditional orchestral score might clash with the subject matter, and synthesised minimalist drivel is too bad in itself to be worth considering, there IS at least one other option: silence.",,Anonymous,Music

The band was Judas Priest, their lead singer was gay (their heavy metal ""look"" of leather and studs was robbed from the gay community where it was popularly worn all the time). His name is Rob Halford.After immense success as one of the top heavy metal bands of the 80's, Halford took off and he was replaced by this young ""kid"" who played in a Judas Priest cover band. Just like the lead singer in the movie, Rob Halford was known for having a very high vocal range which this kid could deal with.I don't know for how long it lasted but it fizzled out rather quickly.

Pain For Pleasure!!!!!!!,"Once again Mark Walberg does what few actors I think out there do. He makes his performances so convincing. Going into this film I didn't really know what to expect. One side of me said this was branded from the start to be cheesy and garbage. The other side of me said give this film a chance, afterall it's about heavy metal music. I think people who are involved in music like play in bands will really relate to this film. From beginning to end, I felt like although the plot was kinda far fetched, it could STILL happen. Just like in Boogie Nights, you get caught up in Chris' world. From the 80's soundtrack, to the wack ass hairstyles. Everything that IS the 80's is on display. I think one of the highlights of the film is when Walberg is trying to ""perfect"" his British accent. Having real metal heads like Zakk Wilde in it was cool too. Kinda like the real porn stars sprinkled in Boogie Nights. The lead singer of Third Eye Blind (Steven Jenkins) plays quite a surprising role in the film also. I've never been a Jennifer Aniston fan, but she also does a killer job of acting as Walberg's girlfriend. Throughout the film you develop a bond with both Walberg and Aniston, which shows the film has great charactor developement. You really want good things to happen for them. The scene where Walberg is trying out for Steel Dragon, made me nervous. Like Walberg was my little brother trying out for the big band. Now, alot of critics and others will probably trash this film, but I think the target audience are the 20 somethings. Will teens like it? Not sure, they can't relate to the mid 80's, wasn't their time. Overall, I'd like to see this film get some type of award. It was the best movie I've seen all year, next to American Pie 2. The definate late summer sleeper. Rock Star is definately worth seeing again, and stick aroud to the ending credits. Their pretty funny. This is definately one awesome ass flick. I will buy when the dvd comes out.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Fantastic!,"This is the second movie about 1985, the other one was 'The Wedding Singer'. Whilst the 'Wedding Singer' was portraying the pop side of the 80's, 'Rock Star' is all about metal.Mark Wahlberg plays a talented singer in a tribute band of some famous rock act of the time and Jennifer Aniston plays his girlfriend. When his fixation rewards him, his whole life changes in a day.The story doesn't get too dramatic and it only scratches the surface of the life of a rock star. Sex and drugs are very limited in this movie, but it is full of Rock'n Roll! The music is fantastic and the concerts are directed brilliantly! The whole concert feeling is very well captured, since they used real audiences (no cgi here).Great direction and a brilliant performance by Marky Mark, who acts like a true metal dude!'Rock Star' is all about fun and if you had anything to do with the old metal scene, you are going to love this movie!10/10",10.0,Anonymous,Music
surprisingly good!,"Rock Star is a great movie, especially for fans of the 80's hair band era. The trailers I saw didn't give away any of the movie.  I went in not expecting much.  The music was great and there were some good laughs.  Mark did a great job and, as usual, he's easy on the eyes.  I like the style of humor and gave this movie a 9.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
"Great the first time, better the fifth time.","It is really hard for people my age to take Mark(y Mark) Wahlberg seriously. BUT... Rockstar is as good as it gets!!! Mr. Wahlberg is more believeable as Chris ""Izzy"" Cole, than as Mark Wahlberg. Jennifer Aniston is remarkable as the manager/love interest. She brings power, depth and angst to the role. ( And she makes out with a chick ;-)... I kept looking in the shadows for Joey Tribbianny..LOL.) The music is moving and reminds us the Eighties were about more than Reaganomics and a Flock of Seagulls.",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Awesome movie without some of the usual clichés!,"I had been waiting for this movie to come out for months and it was even better than I ever anticipated. One really releaving aspect about this film is that it steered clear of showing the typical clichés like drug addiction or cheating on the girlfriend etc. That would have been beside the point. The music was great and so is the soundtrack. If you were a teenager and a musician in the 80s, this will hit home!",10.0,Anonymous,Music
I LOVE this movie!!!,"Well, let me put it this way - I have always been one of the ""hardcore brothers""; I've always loved rock music, and especially heavy metal!! That's why this movie is like a gift from God! I believe this movie is one of the best movies ever (well, except from Neverending Story and Star Wars, of course ...). It's great to hear all the classics, like ""Long live rock and roll"" (DIO), ""Stranglehold (Ted Nugent), songs by Jon Bon Jovie, Deep Purple, AC/DC, Zakk Wylde and several other legendary rock bands. Heavenly! Absolutely gorgeous! WONDERFUL!!! I hope they will make more movies like this (otherwise it's just crap movies, like that ""AC in da USA"" or what they call it, and ""8 miles"". Bulls***!). Well, I strongly recommend this anyway! Everything I'm missing is a couple of Stratovarius-songs! But except from that, it's one of the best movies ever! Ten out of ten!",10.0,Anonymous,Music

GOOD---one of the best i ever seen.,"the only thing that i can tell you about this movie is that its probably the best drama movie that i had ever seen in my life. this movie had everything. passion, action, and kinda of a true story. i thank the director of this movie. the script was unbelievable. kinda made me wish that i was a rock star, if you know what i mean. everything about this movie was excellent, the only problem that i have noticed about it is that they havent mentioned the band THE CURE. common whats up with that. all my friends (PM) have heard of the cure. there probably the best rock band right after KISS and AEROSMITH. i love this movie 'cause of one reason. IT TOOK PLACE IN THE 80s. they explained the story so well about normal life in the rock star position. the advantages of drugs and alcohol and the disadvantages of family members. 10 out of 10. (you'll be hearing a lot from me)",10.0,Anonymous,Music
Great Movie,I really enjoyed this movie.  It had great music in it and I think Mark Wahlberg did an excellent job in his role.  I have been waiting for it to come out on video for purchase.

Off You Go,"Rock star is a 2001 musical comedy-drama about one mans dream coming true when he becomes the new singer of his favorite band, only to realize that things aren't always as great as they seem.I feel like this is one of those movies that people either really like, or they hate, But for me I've always thought it was a good and entertaining film. It's got a great cast behind it including Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, and Timothy Olyphant. The story is interesting, the music is fantastic if your into 80's hair metal, and the film overall is a fun ride through the eyes of a rock star.If you haven't seen this before, I would recommend checking it out to see what you think.",8.0,Anonymous,Music
All About Rock,"Mark Wahlberg didn't want to wear a loincloth in the recent remake of PLANET OF THE APES, but he gets to show off his lean torso a lot in this interesting cross between ALL ABOUT EVE and the Rock world.The goal is raunchy rock, man, in this satire of show-biz and fame. Wahlberg starts out as a copy machine repairman who copies a rock group called Steel Dragon. He dreams his dream so hard that he not only becomes Steel Dragon in his head but in reality -- or the rock version of reality.The plot follows a naive young man and woman on the roller-coaster of fame and high times. The boundaries between reality and fantasy blur with alcohol, drugs, and sex. But the strange journey eventually takes the two main characters back to themselves and their own music. Along the way, they must deal with the issue of what is really valuable in life.This is an interesting character study and a bit of fun too.",,Anonymous,Music
Uneven satire,"The script of this movie contains a mixture of elements which are variously funny, silly and painful, and generally it is pretty schizophrenic. Although the subject bands play heavy metal, the soundtrack is mostly what is described as hard rock (there is a  difference) and composed by people with talent, unlike what is supposed to be the case with ""Steel Dragon"". Unfortunately the soundtrack doesn't compensate for the formula dross that the bands play.  There are things which are just so unrealistic (has the scriptwriter ever tried to conduct a conversation with someone at the front of a rock concert?) that they just have to be dismissed.  Other things - like the life of debauchery in between composing and performing - are certainly spot-on, but which is no cause for joy for the spectators..  The first half of the film is mostly a humorous send-up a la ""Spinal Tap"", the second half becomes ponderous and quasi-philosophical.  The lead actor did nothing for me, but Timothy Spall is always good, and Jennifer Anniston is very easy on the eye, if not much else.",,Anonymous,Music
Could have been great,"Surrounded by a cast that's almost as hairy as the one in his last movie, Mark Wahlberg plays Chris, a rock fan turned band member. Wahlberg fails to be a convincing rock star, or even a convincing movie star for that matter. His acting is tolerable only in comparison to that of the empty, vacuous Jennifer Aniston. There's some great music, though some of it is very misplaced. Kiss, AC/DC and The Beach Boys? Surely some mistake. Other highlights are the star's family, and Timothy Spall as the band's road manager.As it is the film fails to deliver on its promise of showing you what it would be really like to go from fan to idol. They should have ditched Aniston and gotten more into the concerts, the sex, the drugs, the in fighting, and the money. They should have shown how little a part of ""the big picture"" the music is as the corporate machine rolls across the country.All in all a disappointing movie. Best to get the soundtrack, then show up for the hilarious end credits.",,Anonymous,Music
BAAAAAAAAAD movie,"As some of those who wrote about this movie before me have hinted in their own words; this movie is bad. Mark and Janiston just aren´t good actors, they don´t even strike it as mediocre actors. They only thing that I found enjoyable about this movie was some of the music although I´m not all too keen on 80´s rock music. Oh and ofcourse seeing the son of late great john bonham on drums. On anoher note I find it a bit heartbreaking to read someone saying that it was a quite a surprise to see that Jason can play the drums adequately. I would think that the son of Bonzo could at least do that. If you want to see a movie about the excess of rock and roll then watch Cameron´s movie, it´s so much better.",,Anonymous,Music
Cool flick man,"This movie is quite fantastic really.  I was expecting a cheesy movie sort of like that ""Detroit Rock City"" flick that came out a few years before, which SUCKED, but this movie ROCKS... the music, everything, whoever wrote this script is genius! Jennifer Aniston wouldn't strike anyone as a groupie, but she's quite believeable!! Really, everyone does a GREAT JOB in this flick---The movie is:FUNNYDramaticBELIEVEABLEHas some ACTIONRomance for the ladiesIt's like a dream come true. ------- Go see this movie.  It's cute-good..

Like Spinal Tap never actually happened,"A famous heavy metal band recruit the lead singer of a tribute band to perform with them.Not a bad idea in theory and sort-of true in the case of Judas Priest and Oasis - for a short while at least, but this is not a movie but a cliche fest. This is amazing that it includes not only every rock cliche in the book (even TV set out of window is shown - TV-out-of-window for christ sake! TV-out-of-window is not even allowed in satire!), but every cliche involved in a rock musical film. If you have never seen any before and want to catch up on forty years of cinema buy your ticket now. This is just a compilation tape. And just when you thought you were safe, they steam in with another at the very end - ""funny"" outtakes!What is there to say about Heavy Metal that hasn't be said a thousand times before and taken to pieces in Spinal Tap? Nothing. Boy dreams of fame - get fame - finds that fame is not what he thinks it is. No wait, wait. Boy becomes corrupted by fame? No, no, wait again. How about Boy gets fame as a rock star and is screamed at by thousands of girls, but all the time he secretly wants to play soft acoustic rock in an old pullover in a coffee bar? Marky Mark in a pully - no that was an out take that got put in by mistake surely!So how is the telling of the motley cliches? Well professional, but not that great. Aniston is not an actress, just a personality actress that got very very lucky. Here she wears a thong under a kind of knit dress and kisses a girl (I think anyway - who can tell in Heavy Metal), which I suppose is as wild as she gets. Maybe she will realise that Marky Marky has changed and no longer needs her ---- nooooooooooo, that would be too much of another rock and roll cliche.The last question - why are all rock managers English in these products? What is it about this country (mine) that makes them so ideal to be the fast talking fly-by-night 10 percenters? Maybe it is the accent that makes everything they say seem more real, correct and followable. ""Now Marky me-ladooo, drop your pants... That's it right down, now see that blender well pop your member in there.... There ya go, couldn't be better. Now reach down and press that green button with your left hand. That's it. Good boy. Ossie does it all the time - never goes on stage without doing it first.""",,Anonymous,Music
Considerably weak given real life comparisons,"Let me say I play hard rock and am a hard rock historian.  While this movie didn't flat out suck, it could have been done much better with more key to detail.  Some points I might add..The movie is losely based on the Judas Priest story but if you know your Judas Priest none of the movie is really accuarate.  Halford left priest on his own doing and was not fired.First off Herek should have used somebody other than Walhberg to play the part of ""hero"", given Mark's past as a 'rapper' and having no real knowledge of such a situation involving heavy metal singing (movie or not).Keep in mind the movie takes place about the mid 80s (say 84-86 max) yet while the soundtrack is good, some of the actual songs in the soundtrack were written/recorded much later than the supposed time frame of the movie (Bon Jovi - ""Slippery When Wet"" in 1986, Motley Crue ""Wildside"" in 1987, and AC/DC ""Are You Ready"" in 1990).  Sloppily done and researched.Accoring to the movie, Izzy (Wahlberg) comes in to replace Beers about 1985, does a few tours, puts out one album, and then seeminngly ""walks out"" within a two year time zone.  Again, sloppily done given what real life is. Even some of the worst of the many replacement singers that have come in to many a 'real-life' metal bands had a tenure of much more than just ""2-3"" years (recording a new album and a subsquent tour alone often takes up more than a year).  Blaze Bayley spent 6-7 years in Iron Maiden alone after Bruce Dickinson left.The ending is stupid, showing Izzy leaving a larger than life metal band to supposedly ""finding his love"" of playing crappy alternative music in some local bars.  (Again, the timing thing.  Alternative music didnt explode until really the mid 90s and the movie has him doing this at maybe 1990 the latest, back when hair metal was still ruling).  Not to mention 20 years from now many of us are gonna look back and wonder why ""alternative music"" was so overhyped (most of it sucked).All in all -- an okay movie.  Could have been done much better.  Wasnt too well-received (probably because of the inaccuaracies) and thats why it wasnt at theatres too long.",,Anonymous,Music
Mixed Messages and a Whole Lot of Wigs...,"Gotta love a movie that cant decide whether its glorifying something or villifiyng it. Odds are this was intended originally as a kick in the pants to the music business, but as production moved along, the whole concept of movies being a business took over. So in order to make this rotter marketable, the producers chickened out and end up advertising for the very things they are seeking to expose. Marky Mark is cool, but he and his agents had better learn how to read a script. There is so much wrong with this film, it would take too long fo me to write it, and for you to read it. If Jennifer Aniston wasn't basically topless, calm down, she isnt, but what she wears might actually may be more tantalizing than if she did strut around the entire movie like tarzan. Take them out of this movie, and you wouldnt last 5 minutes.",,Anonymous,Music

Whats with the low f*@#in' rating????,This is a pretty cool movie and to be frank its a lot better than loads of movie ranked higher. Come on people it may not be an 'Almost Famous' but it is a realistic approach to showing the world of Arena Rock back in the 80s. I recommend it to all rock lovers and also people who want to see a well made entertaining movie that sort of has a touch of history to it. Mark Wahlberg is awesome and his acting brings out a true to life Rock Star. Soundtrack is like a 9/10. For all those who didn't like this movie only have the excuse they can't stand rock music but other than that this is one kick ass flick. Oh and for the guys Jennifer is very cute.......Also lotsa breast flashin'!,,Anonymous,Music
"A Fine, If Somewhat Stale Effort","I saw a sneak preview of Rock Star a few days ago.  Throughout the movie, I couldn't help but think of ""Almost Famous.""  I wondered why I cared so much for the characters in Almost Famous, why I felt so strongly about what happened to them.  Despite a common theme ""Rock Star,"" I felt little for Wahlberg's character or any of the others.  The movie had few funny bits, but it never really developed the characters.  It was like an action movie that spent all its time on the special effects and forgot that there was actually a story to tell.  ""Who are these people?"" ""What have they gone through?""  This movie doesn't answer any of these questions.  I just can't recommend it.",,Anonymous,Music
A great musical sure to be a classic.,"This is one of the best Musical movies since Eddie and the Cruisers. I have never been a big fan of Mark Walberg or Jennifer Aniston's, but this movie had me glued to the screen. The acting was great as well as the plot of the movie. This one is a ""You have to see it"". Not only is the acting great but if you love Heavy Metal or remember the 80's you'll love the soundtrack. I enjoyed every minute of this movie. I brought back alot of memories. This is an intent classic.",,Anonymous,Music
Really Good,"I lived thru the 80's as a teen metal head, and man did the people behind ""Rock Star"" nail it.  Mark Wahlberg was terrific, the music kicked ass, and the supporting cast was great. Lots of cool cameos by real rock dudes from the 80's metal era playing their real instruments. The film is very entertaining from start to finish. And really funny. Genuinely funny. I'm glad they didnt go for cheap nostalgia jokes here. well written dialogue. Wahlberg plays the idoliizing cock rocker to a T.  Stay for the credits and watch a priceless practical joke played on him during the shooting of a concert scene.",,Anonymous,Music
This is what I've been waiting for!,"Although I liked Almost Famous too but Rock Star is really my Rock & Roll movie. Of course the plot is predictable, It isn't like the Doors or Almost Famous with a biographical story formula, but nobody as in nobody has ever attempted to write and direct a story about 80's Rock music and it's lifestyle, This one nailed it right. The problem is, when you put a very slow exposition of the characters and slow pacing in the film it tends to get boring, Rock Star's plot is well paced and focuses not only on the characters but on the music and lifestyle too.The ending wherein Chris Cole(Mark Wahlberg) passes the mic to a wannabe and sees his final glimpse of Rock and Roll accompanying with a very powerful dramatic rock score is my favorite scene in the film. The Love Story blends well in it too, It is balanced not like Almost famous wherein Rock Music is just a supporting story, Here everybody is a star the Characters whether big or small roles, the simple plot, the music, everything.For over the years I really missed the 80's music and this is really what I've been waiting for, A movie tribute to the bands and music of the 80's to early 90's who are gone and out of the pop scene completely ignored by this generation of today. But there will come a time people will appreciate it soon, what comes around goes around.And that is the essence of Rock and Roll.A Perfect 10 for a perfect movie!",,Anonymous,Music
Crock star!,"Watching Rock Star is like watching the 'Spinal Tap' episode ofThe Simpsons stretched over two hours, except all of the laughs are missing.Chris Cole (Wahlberg) is a Steel Dragon fanatic, dedicating his life to imitating lead singer Bobby (Flemying) and playing in his tribute band. When his over-serious, perfectionist attitude leads to an onstage brawl Chris is thrown out, mirroring the ejection of Bobby from the real Steel Dragon for being gay (He is colourfully referred to as a ""sausage jockey"" by his bandmates""). This opens the door for Chris, who joins the band and jumps feet-first into the hedonism of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle with his girlfriend/manager Emily (Aniston) along for the ride.  As Chris becomes embroiled in the trappings of fame and alienated from Emily, she leaves and he starts to question the validity of what he's doing.Well shot and acted, with nice stylistic touches from Herek, the problem with Rock Star is that it's just plain boring. At no pont do we care about the characters, with their distinct absence of chemistry, and the concert sequences, although spectacular, are repetitive and soulless. The only redeeming feature comes from Timothy Spall as the vulgar road manager, Mats.my rating: 5/10",,Anonymous,Music
"Jennifer aniston great, movie boring.","maybe one has to be a real fan of rock and roll to take this movie. I find mark wahlberg as very talented and extremely versatile to carry part off, but, story is stupid and weak. movie is very boring, i found and again, jennifer aniston shines in a boring,weak, and straight to video movie.Even the scenes showing rock groupies is so played and typical it makes the movie look like a television show brought to the movies, aformula fit movie. But, even in this weak picture, jennifer aniston is sexy,charming, and her performance sustains the picture and provides some redeemable qualities.Jennifer aniston is the only shining star in this movie rock fiasco.",,Anonymous,Music
Heavy Metal = mysogyny and homophobia (at least in 1985),"It's 1985, well before Boy Bands ruled the Earth  but it's still an age when the dinosaurs of Heavy Metal command a devoted and fanatic following.Mark Wahlberg plays Chris Cole, a cute longhair headbanger who fronts Pittsburg's most genuine ""Steel Dragon Tribute Band"". He has lived and breathed Steel Dragon since his older brother bought their first LP, hated it and gave it to Chris rather than throw it in the bin. The music speaks to Chris's very soul, but unknown to Chris, and most of Steel Dragon's fans, is the fact that their leather-clad and studded front man, Bobby Beers, is totally and utterly gay.Steel Dragon know their fan base is waning and realise that the main consumers of Heavy Metal are young men who want to be just like the Rock Stars and pull heaps of chicks while taking lots of drugs. Bobby was getting far too out and proud, even on-stage. He had to go.The scenario of Rock Star is based on the real life circumstances of British proto-metal band, Judas Priest, whose openly gay ex-lead singer Rob Halford continues to enjoy a successful solo career - performing and recording heavy metal rock.The original music is arranged by Trevor Rabin - the cute young rock star guitarist who put life into Yes when Steve Howe left that band in 1985. Tracks from classic metal artists like Kiss and Mottley Crue fill out the score. It all sounds huge and satisfyingly powerful (pick a cinema with a big sound system).The now 100% hetero and ultra-macho Steel Dragon then proceed to bonk and drug their way across America, following the philosophy of Spinal Tap's drummer: ""If I had the sex and the drugs, then I could do without the rock'n'roll!"" Jennifer Aniston turns in a sterling performance as the girlfriend/manager who wants to see Chris succeed in rock'n'roll, but who quickly realises why Keith Richards looks like he's 150 years old.This is entertainment by virtue of good music, lavish direction and fine performances all round. Timothy Olyphant (Dennis in ""Broken Hearts Club"") is good, Timothy Spall is great as the tour manager and Mark Wahlberg convinced me that he can act, in spite of being cursed with exceptionally tragic beauty.",,Anonymous,Music
Could it be Worse?,"""Rock Star"" staring Marky Mark was nothing short of unbearable. Wahlberg's acting, although extremely weak, was impressive compared to the rest of the talentless cast. Aniston did nothing other than sit back and look good, possibly all she is good for, and the dialogue--akward and almost impossible to sit through--sounded like it was written by a second year Iowa State film student. I would recommend cleaning your bathroom floors for 105 minutes rather than watch this poor excuse for a film.",,Anonymous,Music
